Good evening, Marianne.

46
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:52,064
If you can give us your weekly update, it would be greatly appreciated.

47
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:53,945
Sure, good evening, everybody.

48
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,527
Nice to be here.

49
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,648
Marianne, hold on a second.

50
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,209
Oh, okay.

51
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,530
Just unmuted her, hang on.

52
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,474
She's listed it, she's showing us unmuted.

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,352
Can you hear me now?

54
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:15,253
We can't hear.

55
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:16,033
We still can't hear.

56
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:19,095
Give us one second.

57
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:26,658
Pat?

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,440
Yeah.

59
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,181
You can hear me?

60
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,081
That's strange.

61
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:35,183
Yeah, we can't hear Marianne.

62
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,784
Can you hear me now?

63
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,431
We can hear her on Zoom.

64
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:46,478
That's strange that for whatever reason, it's only in one place.

65
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:52,071
Yeah, we had an issue earlier also.

66
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:20,153
about now.

67
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:20,493
No.

68
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:25,236
We can hear you.

69
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:28,237
It looks like the they're trying to reset the council chamber audio.

70
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:31,358
It says I'm unmuted.

71
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:37,741
So I'm happy to talk to you.

72
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:39,842
Nice to see you.

73
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,443
You do area.

74
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,497
Can you hear me now?

75
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,059
Congratulations.

76
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,540
Thank you.

77
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,742
Thanks for having nice to be here.

78
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:04,683
Good evening, everyone.

79
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,606
So I just want to give you a little bit few updates.

80
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:14,932
So, so far to date in March, we've had 264 cases.

81
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:22,358
So while I know the state is reopening and we're relaxing a little bit people still obviously

82
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:24,087
need to be vigilant.

83
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:30,532
That's certainly not the surge we saw early in the winter, but it's still alive and well here in Medford.

84
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:34,735
We need to be safe and follow the social distancing and the mask wearing.

85
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:39,298
We've had 18 cases just in Sunday.

86
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:45,903
Our highest week, we had 161 cases the week of March 7th to 13th.

87
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:51,468
So we're still seeing the cases while we're still in the yellow

88
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,409
As far as the state's concerned now positivity rate is looking good.

89
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,269
We're not out of the woods yet.

90
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:05,330
And I think everyone needs to be aware of that 264 cases this month so far today.

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:16,692
So, good news is we completed the housing authority first dose vaccinations last Friday, so we completed all the housing authority units which is great.

92
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,793
And the vaccination.

93
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:31,695
information is on in weekly updated I mentioned that last week they're now putting out the vaccination reports by community on the state website, every Thursday evening.

94
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:41,884
So they updated again last Thursday and as of last Thursday which wouldn't include all of our housing authority because we did one on Friday, 72% of a 75 plus.

95
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:48,268
residents are vaccinated with at least one dose.

96
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:50,449
So that's really good news.

97
00:06:51,509 --> 00:07:03,374
Out of the entire community, it looks like 26% has received at least their first dose, with 74% not yet, but we haven't hit the younger age groups yet.

98
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:09,116
So what we're hoping to see is that reversed, right, by June or July.

99
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:09,977
We're hoping to see

100
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,934
76% vaccinated and 24% not vaccinated.

101
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:20,660
But as far as the 64 to 75 group too, we're seeing good numbers.

102
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,644
63% of that population has been vaccinated.

103
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:26,427
And we're going to be posting all of this.

104
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:31,532
We came up with some, I think, pretty nice ways to put this on the website.

105
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,954
We're going to be using pie charts

106
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:53,165
So it's easy to kind of see the percentages going to do it by age and by race and by race is really interesting and, and we're really working hard on outreach in the, in the, in the diverse groups because we're worried about vaccine hesitancy, we're not seeing the numbers we want to see in some of those.

107
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,827
So this group so we are working hard on some outreach efforts.

108
00:07:58,928 --> 00:07:59,689
more to come on that.

109
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:05,172
So, and again as you know this week we entered into phase four step one.

110
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:14,557
So that increases gathering limits, the sports guidelines were just updated yesterday, youth and amateur sports guidelines.

111
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:22,842
They've released or relaxed I should say the spectator guidance where it used to be just two parents and siblings were allowed.

112
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:38,654
It's now 50% occupancy of whatever, whatever the indoor venue is now can have spectators, and the same with an outdoor venue with with a stated capacity limit will be 50% of whatever that is.

113
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:44,759
But obviously, only if social distancing can be maintained.

114
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,262
And I think.

115
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:51,573
I think that's all I have.

116
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:55,454
Is that anyone questions or thoughts?

117
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,955
Councilor BailÃ£o.

118
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:00,976
Thank you, Mr. President.

119
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:02,577
Thank you very much for the update.

120
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:03,157
Appreciate it.

121
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,839
Appreciate all the hard work put in by you and your department.

122
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,360
Just got a couple of quick questions.

123
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,062
You mentioned the new, I think, data or metrics that are gonna be on the website.

124
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,883
Do you know when those will be on the city website?

125
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:19,989
Hopefully tomorrow.

126
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:28,111
We just figured them out, got them in the easiest format, I think, for people to understand, because what the state has is just a bunch of numbers.

127
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,432
I mean, the state data is not bad, if you want to look at it.

128
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:34,733
It's a good report, but it's more the numbers and the percentages.

129
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:41,394
We put it in a pie chart format, so it's easier to kind of see visually.

130
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,295
So we're hoping that that's ready today.

131
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:44,235
It should be on tomorrow.

132
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:45,515
OK, great.

133
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:47,136
And I think that's one of the key points, is that

134
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:55,745
it's put in a way where everyone or almost anyone can look at it and be able to visualize it and understand what it is.

135
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,427
So I think that's great.

136
00:09:57,527 --> 00:10:01,173
And do you know when that data is there, is it through a certain week?

137
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,436
Is that through like last week or through this week or?

138
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:09,273
Yeah, it follows the same guidelines as the case reporting data that the state does.

139
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:15,817
So it's that Sunday to Saturday reporting, but they're doing this on a weekly basis.

140
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:25,985
So I think the data up there now, I want to, I shouldn't even say, I think it's up as of the 16th, but I'm not quite sure.

141
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:29,748
But yeah, it's a weekly data reporting on the vaccinations.

142
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:31,188
Thank you.

143
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:38,213
And last week, I believe you mentioned the possibility of a regional vaccine clinic.

144
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:38,994
Yes.

145
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:41,536
Is there any update on that?

146
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:41,996
Yes.

147
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:42,556
Yes.

148
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:43,757
Thank you for reminding me.

149
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:44,438
Absolutely.

150
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:44,698
Yes.

151
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,079
After I spoke to you

152
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:52,060
The state did approve that regional clinic, which is great news.

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,222
So Medfit, along with eight other communities, will be hosting a regional site called the Metro North Regional.

154
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:04,684
And we don't still have a firm date from the state.

155
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:08,585
They're telling us potentially the earliest it would open would be April 5th.

156
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,769
that we would have the doses to actually start distributing.

157
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:21,234
But that one of the sites of the main site, one of the main sites would be the Gansher Center at Tufts University, which is wonderful.

158
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:26,718
And what they do allow us to do as a regional and we still haven't

159
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:28,299
got the details figured out.

160
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:32,202
We're still looking at MOUs and trying to do those details.

161
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:40,528
But the nice thing is that 25% of all doses can be put aside for our regional communities.

162
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:42,950
So that's a nice thing.

163
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:50,996
But you would access that site the same way you're going to access the new pre-registration site that the state's using.

164
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,318
That's the same way you would access this site now.

165
00:11:54,739 --> 00:12:05,168
But if you do that pre registration process, what it does is it puts you tries to get you an appointment in the closest mass vaccination site to you.

166
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:11,193
So it's not going to send you to Foxborough, when the next appointment opens, it's going to search for the closest appointment to you.

167
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:16,177
So once this regional site opens, and we're in that pre registration process.

168
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:25,360
people here in Medford, that'll be the site that they'll be that they'll be looking for an appointment for for you.

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,423
And as far as the you mentioned, the 25% is that 25% of the doses will go to Medford residents or is that regional communities?

170
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:41,164
It's regional, it's regional right now, but we haven't figured again, we haven't figured out the details.

171
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:42,624
So would we all regionally say,

172
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:54,070
subset of a community, like we're going to do 25% of everybody's 75 plus a or whatever, that those details again have not been, we just got the approval.

173
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,411
So we're still trying to work out those details.

174
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,812
But it's nice to have reserved doses for our area.

175
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,713
Yeah, absolutely.

176
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:09,236
And as far as the two in a nutshell, who's responsible for like coordinating this and putting it together?

177
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:10,137
Would this be you?

178
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:11,972
Good question.

179
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:22,799
No, if this is being the we've partnered with Cambridge Health Alliance, so they will actually be the ordering facility and handling all of the billing and such.

180
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,661
Again, when it comes to us trying to reserve at 25%.

181
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:41,864
That may be put back on the communities that may be put back on us as far as privatizing those 25% for a separate clinic as opposed to everybody in the state, being able to register for the region.

182
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:43,926
Does that make sense.

183
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:47,469
No, no, that makes sense it as far as the last questioning it.

184
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:54,215
You mentioned I think, you know, working to, I think, trying to

185
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,349
just looking at my scribble notes here.

186
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,054
As far as I believe you said we need to do more work with reaching out to some of our more diverse community.

187
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:07,878
Did you say you're going that we're beginning to do some outreach or comment more on that.

188
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:12,582
Yeah, we are we're definitely doing that we're putting together some.

189
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:32,454
We're hoping to put together videos and pictures of people from diverse communities testimonials about getting their vaccine and maybe some of the hesitancy they may have had prior to but realizing it was a good thing to do.

190
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,319
those would be coming out shortly.

191
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:44,542
And we have been doing this outreach, we have the resource line and multi languages we have, you know, we can answer people's questions if they want to call.

192
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:51,404
So we're hoping we're hoping to get more investment from those diverse communities into vaccinations.

193
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:53,405
Thank you very much.

194
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,665
And one last final question.

195
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:55,685
I just thought of this one.

196
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,346
Right now is City Hall open?

197
00:14:58,446 --> 00:14:58,646
Is it?

198
00:14:59,427 --> 00:15:00,247
I know City Hall is open.

199
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:04,288
But as far as the number of employees, is it restricted to 50% or something like that?

200
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,793
still at the 50% capacity.

201
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,494
Correct.

202
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,436
Is that going to be changing anytime soon?

203
00:15:10,496 --> 00:15:13,698
Or is that if you could just have any on that?

204
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:15,679
It depends on what the state does.

205
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,142
Yeah, I don't know when that would happen.

206
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:21,403
Okay, no problem.

207
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:22,404
Thank you so much for your help.

208
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,845
And now they can be a hard work to both you and to your department.

209
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,907
Appreciate it.

210
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:28,788
Thank you, Mr. President.

211
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:30,930
Thank you again, Marianne for being here again.

212
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:32,808
week after week.

213
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:40,354
I just have two questions Councilor Fargo actually asked a bunch of mine but going back to the groups which might have had vaccine hesitancy.

214
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:48,341
Has there been collaboration with community groups I know other cities are doing that working with trusted community groups to be a conduit to get people to get vaccines.

215
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,548
Yeah, that's what we're working on right now.

216
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:55,710
Yeah, and that's what we have been working off the last several weeks actually, and doing some outreach in those areas.

217
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:09,475
So in West Bedford Community Center was a real good partner as far as trying to get us people registered for the vaccination clinics we were able to have, but we're still, yeah, we are definitely working with community groups.

218
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:10,795
Okay, great, thank you.

219
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,176
That's what I thought.

220
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,897
And then just other follow-up question is,

221
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,481
the vaccine numbers.

222
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:20,203
How frequently do we think that'll be updated on the website?

223
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:26,307
So hopefully every week, I think it comes out on Thursday nights with this on the state.

224
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:33,511
So once now that we have this set up, it shouldn't be hard to just plug in the new numbers and have it updated the next day.

225
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:34,652
Okay, great.

226
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:35,492
That's all I have.

227
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:35,853
Thank you.

228
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:37,834
Thank you.

229
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,095
Any further questions?

230
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:44,520
Um, Marianne, I just got one question for you.

231
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,666
Um, you mentioned a number of the positive cases that we have.

232
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:52,831
Do you have an age group or age range that those cases are in?

233
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:59,000
It varies, obviously, but it's it's trending to the younger

234
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:05,976
younger ages, and we are seeing a lot of younger cases.

235
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:10,058
About the senior school age and such.

236
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:14,200
Not, not as much with the seniors, it's really trending younger.

237
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,141
So both of the younger.

238
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:16,781
All right.

239
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:17,081
Thank you.

240
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:17,982
All right.

241
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:19,222
Any further questions, Marianne.

242
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:24,144
All right, motion to receive a place on file.

243
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:24,845
Thank you, Marianne.

244
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:25,885
Welcome.

245
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:26,625
Thanks for having me.

246
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:27,706
Have a good night.

247
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:30,868
Councilor Scarpelli?

248
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:37,515
While we're on this, Mr. Fadjen, can we look at number 21094, please?

249
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:37,975
Resolution 21094.

250
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:42,439
We're already on suspension.

251
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,024
21094, Department of Ed dates from the police, fire, and DPW.

252
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:51,148
I see we have Chief Buckley and Commissioner Kearns.

253
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,450
Which one of you two gentlemen would like to go first?

254
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:56,285
I unmuted first, so I'll go first.

255
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,527
Thanks for having us.

256
00:17:58,528 --> 00:17:59,249
I love that view.

257
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,912
Mr. Kern, you got to get an office like that.

258
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:02,453
Thank you, Chief.

259
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:03,173
Thank you, Chief.

260
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:18,043
We have the Chief Buckley on to give us a department update.

261
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:20,444
Chief, would you like to give us an update?

262
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:28,366
Yeah, so first question I have for you is I was able to, it was late this afternoon, but provide a document to the clerk.

263
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,007
I don't know if he provided that to you.

264
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:31,487
We did receive it.

265
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:33,843
It's a big document.

266
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,064
I know you probably don't have time to review it, but it's out there.

267
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:39,326
It's the 2020 crime statistics report.

268
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,728
I'm not quite we haven't done in the last few years.

269
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,811
I'm not sure that you have seen a document like this in previous years.

270
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:52,835
But this is an updated statistical report for everything that we've dealt with in 2020.

271
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:58,238
But this document provides a statistical comparison analysis and provides you

272
00:18:58,678 --> 00:18:59,798
statistics from 2017, 18, and 19.

273
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:10,500
So it gives you a kind of a four-year overview of sort of police operations and the criminal statistics that we would have in the police department.

274
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:15,641
One of the advantages we have, I have Rob McIntyre on tonight.

275
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,282
He's a crime analyst that we have.

276
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:22,623
We hired him in 2019 and Rob has been tremendous for us to be able to provide

277
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:31,921
not only to look at how we capture data, but to really project it onto chats and make it a lot more user-friendly and visible.

278
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:38,364
And so you're the first to sort of receive this document and it will be released publicly starting tomorrow.

279
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:41,185
It's somewhat good news.

280
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:44,587
I think we trend as everyone else has across the country.

281
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:51,330
Crime is, even though we took more crime reports this year, crime tends to be down across the country.

282
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,811
I will tell you that

283
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:59,612
And I don't know how far you want to get into this right now, but I want to take a moment to thank the officers in the Medford Police Department.

284
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:07,274
There's one sort of like amazing statistic, and I'm going to give you just a few of them here.

285
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:08,314
Just pulling it up here.

286
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:09,894
One second here.

287
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,715
Calls for service to the Medford Police Department.

288
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,316
In 2017, the Medford Police Department responded to 23,136 calls.

289
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:16,316
2018, 21,818.

290
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:29,510
Come 2019, we were up to 36,000 plus calls.

291
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:35,834
2020, slight dip, pandemic, 34,153 calls for service.

292
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:41,238
That's an increase of 12 to 13,000 calls for service per year for the last two years.

293
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:48,902
And one of the, I seem to be somewhat surprising, but there are some related factors, but emergency calls, our 911 calls,

294
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:51,910
2017, 441 calls, 2018, 360 calls, 19 is 825 calls.

295
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,731
2020, we had 2,375 911 calls for emergency.

296
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,552
So there is, there's a lot of,

297
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:14,983
there's a lot being put upon the police department these days.

298
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,244
We are in a national pandemic.

299
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:27,831
And as I started my sentence earlier, I just wanted to thank the men and women of the police department because they are working in under sort of extraordinary conditions and doing a phenomenal job.

300
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,373
And their workload is pretty much doubled in the last two years.

301
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,293
So I

302
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:38,778
can't pass up the opportunity to say, you know, thank you to all of the officers for the police department.

303
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,503
And if you have questions related to, I know this is somewhat, but Rob McIntyre is also present.

304
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:51,187
So if you have specific questions or statistical data on what can be gathered, I brought him here tonight to answer those questions.

305
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,709
But I also have a detective Brooks Stanton Hurd.

306
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,411
Detective Stanton Hurd is our new domestic violence officer.

307
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:01,274
And over the last year to two years, we have

308
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,212
put together a new domestic violence initiative.

309
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:11,596
And a lot of it was really fast-tracked when COVID hit in March.

310
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:25,624
And one of the things that we did in the city of Medford was to automatically go to an outreach for domestic violence through Detective Stanton and the Detective Bureau and the patrol division.

311
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:27,105
They all kind of came together.

312
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:30,527
We went out and reached out to our prior

313
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:35,877
anyone who was listed on a prior domestic violence report to check in with them.

314
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:42,202
You know, there's a lot of concerns of, you know, when people are quarantined, whether they're together or not.

315
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:48,467
And so I think it's an extraordinary effort that was put together by the domestic violence unit in the Method Police Department.

316
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,769
So I brought her here tonight in case there was specific questions related to that.

317
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:58,164
And, but I, you know, overall as a chief, I'm happy to finally get this document out.

318
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:01,287
It is the plan has always been a plan to kind of keep statistics out there.

319
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:02,828
It'll get out on our website.

320
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:14,197
I'm sure it will get out to the media and we want to be able to provide this sort of statistical facts to the city on a regular basis.

321
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:18,420
And we now have the opportunity afforded the ability with our crime statistics.

322
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:21,703
Any questions as it relates to that?

323
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,579
Councilor Marks, you were first, then Mike.

324
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,921
Thank you, Mr. President.

325
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:47,575
And I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Scott Kelly, for putting this on the agenda to get an update, starting with the police chief, the fire chief, and the commissioner of DPW, and moving on to other departments as well.

326
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:51,698
I think it's always helpful to get information from our department heads

327
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,233
especially the ones that we don't run into too often.

328
00:23:56,594 --> 00:24:03,902
Chief, this is the first thorough crime statistic report that I've seen in the last 20 years, and it's much appreciated.

329
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:28,167
And, you know, I'm always looking as one member of the council, when I get emails and concerns from constituents regarding traffic controls, regarding speeding and regarding other issues of concern, such as crime and so forth in certain neighborhoods, this information would be most valuable to have to be able to report back to residents.

330
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:29,667
So I appreciate that.

331
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,428
And I think you did mention that it's on your

332
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:34,618
website, is that correct, Chief?

333
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:35,499
It will be.

334
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,781
I'm hoping by tomorrow, it's beyond my technical capabilities, but I'm sure you're the first to really receive this.

335
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:48,103
So it will be put out publicly and on the website, hopefully tomorrow, but by the end of the week, definitely.

336
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:50,564
That would be great.

337
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:51,885
Thank you, Chief.

338
00:24:52,625 --> 00:25:00,848
And I too want to thank the brave men and women of the police department for all they do on behalf of our community in these trying times.

339
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,668
It's not easy.

340
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,966
to be a public safety official.

341
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:13,149
And they've been doing tremendous work on behalf of keeping our residents safe as well as their personal property.

342
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,669
And it doesn't go unrecognized.

343
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:30,274
Chief, I had just a couple of basic questions that I was wondering if you can answer, not regarding crime statistics, but a general follow up from the meeting that we had, this council met on site

344
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,136
on Fulton Spring Road back some several months ago.

345
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:45,260
And I know along with the Traffic Commission and yourself, there's been much improvement made to that area regarding signage, regarding pedestrian crosswalks.

346
00:25:46,065 --> 00:26:03,939
And one thing that I think we still need to follow up, Chief, and I've had this discussion with you, was regarding resident-only access on Fels Ave, Fulton Spring Road, Murray Hill Road, Fels Ave Terrace, Grover Road, and that particular vicinity.

347
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:13,767
I understand that some of the state roads lead into that road, and it may be difficult to put signs, but I think that's one missing component

348
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:15,613
of creating an area.

349
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:23,596
I think we promised residents that we were going to try to eliminate the cut through traffic the best way we could.

350
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,317
And I think the resident only access

351
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,194
may not be a solve all, but it'll definitely help.

352
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,115
So that is my first question, chief.

353
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,576
And I know you said you're going to review and look into it.

354
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,777
I was wondering if you had the opportunity to do so.

355
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:42,940
So we have started that review and we're probably a little bit behind on it, but we'll continue to do so.

356
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,501
And I can get you an update on that through my traffic division.

357
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:50,303
But we had talked, maybe it was a month ago, councilor,

358
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,954
you know, there are some valid concerns up there.

359
00:26:53,994 --> 00:27:01,177
It's the state road access, and then it's obviously, if you close these streets off to residents only, where does the overflow go?

360
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:08,420
Because we want to only, we don't want to only just concentrate on the area of the problem, but where we will create additional problems.

361
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,803
So it's not an easy problem to solve and an easy task, and we've gone at it.

362
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:20,756
and attack the problem a number of different ways up there with the street markets and the patrols.

363
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:22,136
I think it has had some improvement.

364
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:30,838
I have received some, you know, thank yous and notes of positivity as it relates to the traffic up there in the neighborhood.

365
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:38,100
But I don't have a solution yet on those signs and we are still working on it, but I will be sure to keep you up to date on that.

366
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:41,221
That would be much appreciated.

367
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,782
And let me tell you the response I got from residents so far

368
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:54,383
Many residents are happy, and I'm sure Councilor Falco, who lives in the area can attest to it, are very happy with some of the progress that has been made to date.

369
00:27:55,044 --> 00:28:01,211
I just think we have to close the loop on some of the other major issues of traffic.

370
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:02,793
That would be helpful.

371
00:28:03,987 --> 00:28:32,231
My other question, Chief, over the last year, I know there's probably been an uptick, at least from the calls I've received in the community, but because of COVID, the fact that people are home now 24-7, I think you see a lot of particular things escalating that may not have happened during other times, but because of COVID, I think it's escalating some of this within the community.

372
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:42,474
And I get a fair amount of calls from residents that may have issues with a neighbor or someone a couple of doors down and don't know how to resolve an issue.

373
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:45,416
And for whatever reason, they can't get together.

374
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,980
And I think it's important, Chief, and I'm not sure if this is currently being done.

375
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,543
I know I mentioned it to you before, having some type of community mediation.

376
00:28:56,265 --> 00:29:11,372
where the police can intervene on certain instances that may require them to get two parties together to somewhat come to a resolve, so it doesn't come to something other than a peaceful resolve.

377
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:13,933
And that would be my intent.

378
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:19,275
I was just wondering, Chief, is there any type of community mediation program that exists?

379
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:24,538
If not, is that something you'd be interested in moving forward in this community?

380
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:32,525
In a different way, we do community mediation, but we have to be careful about getting the police department involved in civil matters.

381
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:45,369
So for example, if there's two neighbors who are arguing over tree or a fence, we wouldn't necessarily want to step in as a lawful authority, but the theory of mediation in the community, I think is a great idea.

382
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:49,850
And I just think it would have to involve a lot of other different parties.

383
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:54,072
And if we have to be a party or present at the table, I think that that is,

384
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,162
absolutely something that we could do.

385
00:29:57,182 --> 00:29:59,903
You know, we do a lot of community outreach.

386
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:19,435
We have our domestic violence teams and, you know, we have, we collaborate completely with all other organizations and, you know, from mental health organizations to domestic violence organizations to our hospitals and our EMT personnel.

387
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,336
And we meet regularly to solve a lot of the problems.

388
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,698
So, well, that is sort of sometimes

389
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:32,874
you know, focused on specific clients, I don't imagine that something along those lines is impossible to do for the city.

390
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:35,095
It's just, it's a tenuous thing.

391
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:46,397
I would request that legal, you know, somebody of legal authority be there because a lot of what we see in neighbor disputes is civil and we have very little authority when it comes to it and we just have to be careful.

392
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:51,938
But I guess if we're talking generalities in theory, I'm all on board with

393
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:57,886
making a nicer, peaceful city, but I think we have to take sort of baby steps as we get there and how we handle this.

394
00:30:59,466 --> 00:30:59,846
That's great.

395
00:31:00,146 --> 00:31:09,388
I think we're on the same page and I look forward to working with you to try to develop something in the community that we can use on a local level.

396
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:21,510
And I appreciate the fact that, you know, there are certain items that we can't get involved in, but there are other items that I think we could successfully mediate, especially as the police department

397
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:31,799
position of authority can help assist, maybe ease some of the tension that may exist in certain areas and among certain neighbors and so forth.

398
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,101
So I think that would be a useful tool to implement.

399
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:50,451
Chief, I have a lot of other questions I'm gonna reserve to our budget meetings, and it's regarding personnel and your maintenance and regarding your vehicles and so forth, and I will reserve that

400
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,281
to when we meet for budget.

401
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,201
I appreciate your time.

402
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:55,381
Thank you, Councilor.

403
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,302
I appreciate it.

404
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:57,962
Councilor Morrell.

405
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:00,903
Thank you, Mr. President.

406
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:04,444
Yeah, thanks to the chief for being here tonight and the detectives as well.

407
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,765
I do have a question based on, I didn't get the report you're referencing.

408
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,986
I don't know if just hard copies were delivered so far.

409
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:13,627
So apologies if this is in it.

410
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:25,408
But I did have residents reaching out very much to your point of concerns of domestic violence increasing in light of the pandemic, people being stuck in living situations, being stuck at home.

411
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:34,956
So I'm curious if there is data related to that calls as far as domestic violence and how that's been addressed, if that can be shared or to the extent that it can be shared.

412
00:32:35,477 --> 00:32:38,159
Well, so there's some information that we can share.

413
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,701
Interestingly enough in 2020, and I

414
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:46,285
you know, we're going March through till current into 2021 that COVID has been present.

415
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:55,328
We really didn't see an uptick in domestic violence cases, but we have seen from 2019 to 2020 an increase in total.

416
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:09,734
But I think the person who probably we could talk to, and I think has a lot to do with why our numbers are down, because we have such an outreach and involvement in partnerships with organizations is Detective Brooke Stanton-Heard.

417
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:25,078
If Mr. President, if you would allow for her to speak on the matter just a little bit, she could probably go a little bit further into answering the question of the counselor, would she see it as a primary domestic, excuse me, domestic violence officer?

418
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:26,659
Thank you.

419
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,000
Detective Rastead.

420
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:32,603
Hi, can you guys hear me?

421
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:32,703
Yes.

422
00:33:35,044 --> 00:33:35,524
Hi, everybody.

423
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:40,148
So we did address a little bit of that in the packet about domestic violence.

424
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:50,116
Personally, it was a large concern of mine during the pandemic that people will be stuck at home, they're not going to be able to get the help that they usually would go into school or work and seeing people.

425
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:53,779
So what we did is we created a domestic violence follow-up team.

426
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:03,666
What we did with that is detectives like myself, my partner, my boss, and other patrol officers actually called any victims from the past year just to even just check in.

427
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:08,689
I also created a domestic violence follow-up packet that is now being distributed to all

428
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,630
domestic violence calls.

429
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:22,434
Inside the packet, it has an example where it shows different ways they can get help, like telling the public about text 911, where you can real time text a dispatcher and the person you're with may not know.

430
00:34:22,454 --> 00:34:39,160
I also updated information on safe houses, other resources like Portal to Hope that we work with that will help them get resources if they're maybe not the most comfortable going to law enforcement, because unfortunately, sometimes people want help, but they don't want it to rise to the level of legal action.

431
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,642
So we gave them various resources from getting help from us as well as through other communities around us.

432
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:55,726
We also did see through doing this that we were able to get at least 10 definitive new reports that would have gone unreported otherwise if we didn't check in with them.

433
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:57,107
But we also had

434
00:34:57,987 --> 00:35:10,021
a ton of other people who have recently moved from Medford who had new domestic violence incidents, and we were able to contact outside resources to make sure that they followed up with those individuals and got them the help they needed.

435
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:18,071
So although we may not have all the numbers just for Medford, I know of at least 15 other incidents that I called and I had those departments reach out to them.

436
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:32,279
And even if somebody didn't have a new crime or they didn't want to report a new crime, most of the people we spoke to said that they were willing to get these new packets and I mailed them to people, I emailed them to people, and now they're also being distributed.

437
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:40,284
So that even if they're not open to getting help right now, they at least can have this in their back pocket for future or if they have a friend who needs help.

438
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:49,030
I know we also did put some things out on social media about listening from home and calling 9-1-1 or texting 9-1-1 if you have concerns about a neighbor.

439
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,412
So the response has been pretty good from the public, honestly.

440
00:35:53,072 --> 00:36:00,017
Aside from that, we also got some numbers of old people who were still in contact with abusers or quarantined at home with abusers.

441
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:08,222
Just for in the future, if we get a call from them, we can know, okay, this person is not able to get help because they're quarantined at home with somebody who used to abuse them in the past.

442
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,503
So I thought it was very useful.

443
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:28,270
Moving forward, also, just to kind of wrap it up, I also created a high-risk assessment tool where officers or detectives, when they go to a domestic violence call, we can actually use 14 questions that are yes, no, and kind of assess how high on the scale for re-offense they may be.

444
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:33,472
Or if there's someone who's been through us multiple times, we can see if behavior is escalating and address it

445
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,815
more carefully so we can get them the resources they might need.

446
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,717
And we're keeping all of those in-house.

447
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:44,621
They're obviously not public information, but it helps us be able to understand our victims better and better serve them.

448
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,626
Oh, and the last thing, I'm sorry, I also, we have a strangulation worksheet as well.

449
00:36:50,746 --> 00:36:58,653
So if there is a strangulation incident, we can better document it and have all of the injuries and have a better response for those kinds of very serious crimes.

450
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:03,628
Thank you for that information.

451
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:04,770
I really appreciate it.

452
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,534
And just for, you know, the department's attention to this specifically and work on this.

453
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:17,965
And thanks for highlighting the text 911, because obviously, you know, if people are trapped at home, you know, or stuck at home, it's difficult to actually make those phone calls in a way that

454
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:20,422
feel safe.

455
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:25,586
So I'm curious how, how do people learn about the existence of that program?

456
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,026
How is that pushed out?

457
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:32,190
Just letting people I know it's kind of like a challenging thing to let people know about the texting program for text 911.

458
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,450
Oops.

459
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:40,547
Sorry, I think I unmuted myself.

460
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:47,509
So every time I speak with somebody through domestic violence, when I do my follow up investigations, I inform them of it.

461
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:49,589
But it's also a part of this packet.

462
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:54,630
So when you're able to get a hard copy of it, it actually has a list of domestic violence resources.

463
00:37:55,231 --> 00:38:01,452
And the second one, aside from calling 911, I've listed text 911, which explains that it's an alternative

464
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:19,357
to contact and also what I did is I created a packet for the officers who were doing these follow-up calls and I kind of had a script for them to read kind of an explanation for it if they even weren't familiar with it and I explained to them that it works outside of Medford as well and if

465
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:27,821
for some reason they try to use text number one, it's not in an area that accepts it, it'll actually send a text message back so that they don't think that they're getting help when they're not.

466
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:46,511
So I've been having officers explain that to people, I've been explaining it to people, and it's now on this packet that goes out to every domestic violence call so that even if people are just looking through it, it might be a useful tool that people can tell others about and try and get as much safe help without alerting the possible abuser they may be in the situation with.

467
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,293
Great, thank you so much.

468
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:51,294
That's all I have.

469
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:51,834
Thank you both.

470
00:38:52,555 --> 00:38:52,875
Thank you.

471
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:58,639
And I know Detective Stanton explained it very clearly, but all our offices now are up to date in this and they carry this package.

472
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:09,366
Even if it's a question of abuse or something along those lines, they hand those things out, the packets out so that there's a clear understanding to all parties involved in these cases.

473
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,368
So we do get it out there as best we can.

474
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:13,689
Great, thank you.

475
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,632
Counselor Scott, I apologize for taking you out of track.

476
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:24,670
Sorry, Mr. President, you've lost my vote, but that's okay.

477
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,511
First of all, Chief, thanks for coming tonight.

478
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:31,736
I think that one of the biggest questions, what are we asking chiefs and department heads to come out for?

479
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:38,803
And one of the discussions we talked about every time we meet, it's usually about budget and it's, you know, we need this, or can we give you this?

480
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,705
But I think that it's important that we

481
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:56,454
spent some time talking about what, you know, the information you gave us today, I had a brief opportunity to look through and it's pretty amazing what numbers can show you and how well our police department works with our community.

482
00:39:57,015 --> 00:40:02,457
And, you know, I know that, you know, you talk about so many of your officers doing so many things.

483
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:07,219
I know Councilor Falco really pushed for the community meetings and hopefully they get started again.

484
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,980
I know we have Officer Rory Rockowitz,

485
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:12,286
works and method cares about prevention.

486
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:21,840
Officer Rudolph we've had here to talk about 9-1-1 and any issues and concerns and that he put to rest and, you know, talking about

487
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:31,037
Officer Hartnett and Officer Brooks and Sergeant is talking about probably the biggest phone calls we get the most dealing with traffic issues and concerns.

488
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:50,752
It's great to see the Civil Rights Division now with Officer Purifuri having someone there in place and you really see and then, you know, one unbelievable addition and Officer Stanton Hurd and domestic violence

489
00:40:51,789 --> 00:41:03,514
and having her on board, I think that there's a common thread here that Method Police really do work well with our community and they hear what our needs are.

490
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:16,260
And if there is something there, you're a chief that's willing to really work together with the community to make sure that if there is something that people need to talk about or that aren't being heard, you're ready to jump in

491
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:19,545
and into action.

492
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:27,167
So again, these are the reasons why that having these meetings, Council Member Mox had some great questions and you gave a great presentation.

493
00:41:27,707 --> 00:41:29,147
And I just want to thank you for that.

494
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,728
I don't want to continue with the evening.

495
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:33,529
I know some of the others have questions.

496
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:38,050
I just, if I can, I do have one question for Officer Stanton Hurd.

497
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,432
Can she tell us who her favorite high school softball coach was?

498
00:41:46,349 --> 00:41:46,789
Oh boy.

499
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,251
I honestly knew that was coming.

500
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:51,774
I knew it was coming, Mr. Scarpelli.

501
00:41:52,354 --> 00:41:54,095
Okay, are you just saying my name?

502
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,136
Is it Coach Scarpelli?

503
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,437
It's you, I promise it's you.

504
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:57,798
Okay, thank you.

505
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,680
Thank you, Chief.

506
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,441
Councilor Scarpelli, I thank you.

507
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:06,185
I probably could, you know, comment on everything you said, but I think you said it eloquently.

508
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:11,550
And I just want to say that, you know, we understand that we faced a lot this year and there's,

509
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:20,127
There's a lot being asked of the police department, and there's a lot that the police department have to be responsive and responsible to.

510
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:22,168
And we are moving in this direction.

511
00:42:22,188 --> 00:42:25,909
I just openly say on behalf of all the officers, we're working hard.

512
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:31,111
We just want to work with people to come up with solutions and resolve matters.

513
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,871
So thank you.

514
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:33,432
Thank you.

515
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:34,872
Councilor Parker.

516
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:36,653
Thank you, Mr. President.

517
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:40,635
And I'd like to thank my colleagues for asking some great questions.

518
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,689
I thank Chief Buckley for his leadership.

519
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:49,251
And also thank the woman and men of the Memphis Police Department for all the hard work.

520
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:56,954
I think especially over the past year with COVID, it's amazing.

521
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:04,196
And I know the number of calls that I'm looking through this report, it's really amazing to look at the data, look at the increase.

522
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:10,679
I know there's a slight dip this past year, but I think probably a lot of the calls were a lot more challenging as well.

523
00:43:11,461 --> 00:43:21,968
with COVID and it's, you know, it's amazing how, you know, you put your own safety and well-being on the line every day, you know, in a normal day, and then you put COVID into it as well.

524
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:27,972
I know it's been a very challenging year, but I want to thank you for your leadership and all your hard work.

525
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,174
And thank you for this report.

526
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:33,916
This is really, I mean, I love to see data and this is great.

527
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:38,179
You can look at this over the past three, four years, and you can really see

528
00:43:38,798 --> 00:43:44,961
the uptick in the number of calls and it's, you know, I haven't had a chance to really read it yet.

529
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:53,945
I may have just received it when I came to the meeting, but I know I'll be reading it over and I'll definitely be giving you a call probably with more in-depth questions.

530
00:43:53,965 --> 00:44:01,408
I also wanted to thank Detective Stanton, especially this domestic violence piece in the back of the report.

531
00:44:01,468 --> 00:44:05,830
It's really good to take a look at this documentation to see what we're doing.

532
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:10,467
And, you know, it helps answer a lot of questions that sometimes people might have.

533
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:31,459
And, but Chief Buckley, if I may, really quick, and I know this is just because, like I said, I haven't had a chance to really digest this report yet, but when you look at this report, do you see, is there like a number one issue or number one concern or top one, two, three list of things that you would be concerned about or think need to be addressed?

534
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,402
know, I think that's an interesting question.

535
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:39,762
I think we're always concerned with the same thing.

536
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:49,085
Our numbers are always going to be up on crimes of assault, crimes of theft and crimes of property damage.

537
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:57,006
And, you know, we used to say in policing that, you know, you know, more police more reactive, you know, to this sort of thing.

538
00:44:57,026 --> 00:44:59,027
And I don't know that that necessarily

539
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:01,550
is proven to have worked out there.

540
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:14,734
But I do think that police officers being part of the community and educating the community brings crime down, right in a visible presence, not just standing there as police officers, but being absorbed into the community helps to address those issues.

541
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:16,775
So those are sort of the things that we're working on.

542
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:22,297
And I think it's finding when you collaborate with your partners in the community,

543
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:34,081
whether it's not just the municipal partners like the schools and the DPW and the fire, but with your hospitals and your mental health and your substance use disorder agencies, that you really start to have an impact.

544
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:36,462
And we have to find different ways of policing.

545
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,143
And I think we're really doing a good job of that.

546
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:51,228
And, you know, I know I'll get teased a little bit about this, but I don't know how many of you saw the WH, it's in the back of my report, but WHCH listed Medford as the fourth safest

547
00:45:51,934 --> 00:45:54,956
largest city in Massachusetts.

548
00:45:55,697 --> 00:46:04,923
And I'd like to tell you that I'm proud of that, but, which I am, but I think all the credit goes to the police officers here.

549
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:14,170
You know, COVID was tough and, you know, you, you're out there publicly and you, when this first came out, you didn't, you know,

550
00:46:15,148 --> 00:46:16,208
It was scary.

551
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:26,170
And our officers and others, the firefighters and the Method Police Department and their EMTs and the nurses and doctors, there was a lot of us that were out there in the public, but it was a tough job to do.

552
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:34,632
And it was an experience that, you know, I hope we don't have to relive, but I can speak directly to the officers of this police department.

553
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:35,932
They came to work.

554
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:37,592
They weren't taking sick time.

555
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:39,033
They weren't taking vacation time.

556
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:40,793
They showed up.

557
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:42,980
They responded to calls.

558
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,724
I'm telling you, I don't have the statistical data to back this up, but I swear we were the busiest police department around.

559
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:49,825
No doubt.

560
00:46:49,905 --> 00:47:00,472
I talked to other chiefs and our officers just really, they went above and beyond during the pandemic.

561
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:06,116
And it was also during a time where, you know, we weren't exactly looked upon as, you know, man's best friend.

562
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:08,458
And so, but they kind of,

563
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:11,623
you know, they come to work and they do the job.

564
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,244
And I think it's very altruistic.

565
00:47:13,284 --> 00:47:19,107
And I think it's very, you know, they signed up for this and they know it and they do their job and they do it well.

566
00:47:19,187 --> 00:47:22,468
So it gives me an opportunity to thank them again.

567
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:25,349
And I probably don't get to do that too much publicly.

568
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,231
And I just want to make sure that that was heard.

569
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:30,892
But those few things you'll see are

570
00:47:31,408 --> 00:47:39,889
that I talked about, property crimes, assaults, and lastly, things that as police officers, you're looking out for, but they're interacting more with people now.

571
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,730
And as COVID goes away, we're able to do that.

572
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,970
And community meetings will help, and we can talk about these things.

573
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:59,173
And once we have these community meetings, one of the things that I like is that the community starts to talk back to us and says, hey, chief, you know, there's people hanging here, and we're worried about this, and, you know, there's crimes that are occurring at this park, and we get more intelligence, and those all work.

574
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,713
So, you know, as COVID,

575
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:07,099
Quiet's down, I knock on wood because I don't like this plateau that we're going through.

576
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:12,341
Maryann would kick me if I say this, but I want to be able to bring people back together and have these conversations as a community.

577
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:15,183
But lastly, I just want to say one other thing.

578
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:28,970
We thank a whole lot of people in the police department, but this crime report wouldn't have been done if it wasn't for Rob McIntyre, and he's on here tonight, and I know you probably don't have many questions for him because he's kind of that statistical, he calls himself a nerd, but I can't thank him enough.

579
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,610
I can't do this.

580
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:40,333
I mean, I can pull, they can give me data all day long, but to put it together and make it read well and look well in charts and documents, Rob has been an all-star for us in this.

581
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:47,715
And so his presence and his work ethic allow us to be able to continue to give documents like this to the city.

582
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:54,277
We're going to try to push these out more and more on a, you know, if we can do quarterly basis, we'll do that.

583
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:57,878
And then we'll have the year end kind of response.

584
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:00,577
I hope I answered your question, Councilor.

585
00:49:00,657 --> 00:49:03,598
I kind of went off a little.

586
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:04,618
Chief, that was very good.

587
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:05,238
Thank you.

588
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:06,019
I appreciate it.

589
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,660
And thank you to Rob for the report.

590
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,902
I deal with a lot of this type of work where I work during the day.

591
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:19,344
And a lot of time, effort, and energy goes into stuff like this here.

592
00:49:19,844 --> 00:49:20,484
And you can tell.

593
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:24,646
And the report, just by going through it,

594
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:30,517
I mean, it tells a story and, you know, about the hard work that you in the department go through on a daily basis.

595
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:34,280
So I just want to thank you for your leadership and your hard work.

596
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:41,286
And like I said, I'm going to go through this more thoroughly and I'll be calling you with some additional questions, but thank you very much.

597
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:43,788
Thank you.

598
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:45,789
Thank you, Mr. President.

599
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:46,750
Thank you, chief.

600
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,812
And I actually do have a question or two for Rob.

601
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:52,134
So I hope he'll be, he'll be ready to answer them.

602
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:55,677
And I want to answer these questions.

603
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:58,099
Good.

604
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,624
So just jumping into the statistics, real quickly, and I'll get you unmuted, Rob.

605
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:06,266
I haven't had a chance to look at the report.

606
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:09,669
So I'm sorry if I'm asking questions that you actually answer in it.

607
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:14,873
But, you know, that 2020 911 call number really stood out to me.

608
00:50:14,953 --> 00:50:16,254
It's such a huge increase.

609
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:18,866
Do you break that down at all?

610
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:29,252
Was a lot of that around medical emergencies, you know, people calling because of they were afraid they're sick with COVID or, you know, any other statistics on why the 911 calls jumped so much?

611
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:35,316
I didn't really break it out as far as what the 911 calls.

612
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:43,101
I mean, that's certainly something we can do if there's questions on it to determine what types of calls were involved there.

613
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:50,964
Most of the information on that, part of it is our records management system.

614
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:56,645
The 911 calls are better recorded, especially now that we're in the new building with a good system.

615
00:50:57,765 --> 00:51:00,226
We're really making sure we're keeping track of that.

616
00:51:01,086 --> 00:51:10,248
We've done a lot of work with the department since I came on in 2019 to really improve our record keeping.

617
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:23,681
Every report that you see, all 1,660 that went through that were reported as actual crimes in this report, there's a number of other reports too that we took for the year.

618
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:27,023
I read every single one of them.

619
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:38,292
I checked them for, we use a coding system around that, and the FBI sends out a guidebook on the National Incident-Based Reporting System.

620
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:46,194
I review that and then determine based off the call and the definition that they give which kind of bucket it fits into.

621
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:57,297
But there's a lot of data points that go with that too because the FBI also tracks age of offenders, relationships, they track what property was taken, what type of property.

622
00:51:58,528 --> 00:52:03,292
If there was a relationship involved, what kind of location it is, date, time.

623
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,695
The system we have does a lot of it.

624
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:14,002
But what the FBI hasn't tracked, we've kind of implemented our own system.

625
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:20,588
So next year, you should see numbers for what kind of outreach and referrals we did around that.

626
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:32,395
We're doing a number on our, we added 13 questions at the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, which is why it's not included in the report.

627
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:36,237
And it's 13 questions looking for if there's

628
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:47,733
if there's domestic violence, if there's mental health issues, if there's substance abuse, if it involves someone who's elderly, if it involves children, things like that.

629
00:52:47,853 --> 00:52:57,039
So really my big focus is on getting the right data and trying to present it as best I can, so.

630
00:52:59,261 --> 00:52:59,761
Yeah.

631
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:00,822
I'm sorry to interrupt.

632
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:07,606
If I could just add, he's being slightly modest because a lot of this is, it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of, you know,

633
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:16,987
patients involved, but one of the things that we're changing around here, and a lot of it's thanks to Rob, is your data out is only good as data in.

634
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,809
So we're trying to really change how we capture the data.

635
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:28,012
As years go on, and the months go on, we're going to start really producing better documents than this.

636
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:31,654
I hope one day someone looks back at this and says, ah, look what they've done since then.

637
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:35,049
he's going to lead us into that direction and really work.

638
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:37,030
I will add one last thing.

639
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:57,977
And I am, you know, like I said, I was surprised that the 911 calls, but there's also another factor here that we're not sure how much it plays into, but 911 wireless calling services have also, the technology has increased and the E911 capabilities where before, if you dialed 911 on your phone, you would go to a state police directory and then it would be rerouted and come through different phones.

640
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:03,740
Now we have the capability, wherever you are in Method, if you dial 9-1-1, you're getting them at the police department.

641
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,642
And that absolutely has played to some of the uptick in those calls, and it should be noted.

642
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:17,026
And I don't think we can really, right now, tell how much of an impact, but there certainly was, during the national pandemic, a very large uptick in that number of calls.

643
00:54:18,527 --> 00:54:20,888
Thank you for that, Chief and Rob.

644
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:22,369
And that makes sense to me, too.

645
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:26,391
It just really stood out as a number, such a huge increase, even with the pandemic.

646
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:28,696
And that takes me right into the next thing.

647
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:40,601
I mean, we had some discussions last year around data and statistics, and I just think it's really encouraging the attitude that we're taking around having good data come in and good data come out and informing decisions.

648
00:54:41,421 --> 00:54:44,743
And my other thought was around that bigger bucket of calls.

649
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:50,745
I think you said it was around 35,000 kind of, I don't know if it was calls or inputs.

650
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:56,488
We also were talking about just how much we are asking police to do.

651
00:54:57,088 --> 00:55:00,429
you know, beyond criminal matters, and you even brought it up around mediation, right?

652
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:04,431
It's like, well, we don't want to necessarily get involved in that because we have our role.

653
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:22,299
And I was wondering, you know, as well, on that bigger number of calls, did you have a sense of how many of those maybe weren't about criminal matters, and you're getting called out to something that's not a crime, and you might have an issue even being able to deal with it, given your authority?

654
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:25,637
That might be for you or Rob.

655
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,840
Yeah, I'll answer it very briefly.

656
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,681
We do not have a sense of that, right?

657
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:35,665
And so that's a different sort of analysis of the actual police report, right?

658
00:55:35,725 --> 00:55:39,769
I don't know if you can just check a box this way, but it is something to think about, right?

659
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:48,536
It's something to think about as for the future, but I'll actually really defer to Rob on this one and how much, because he looks at that data all day long.

660
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:50,837
So if every one of the,

661
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:58,231
It's tough to say exactly which ones are criminal and which ones are more civil in nature.

662
00:55:58,891 --> 00:56:04,413
We do have a classification for non-criminal codes that is considered a civil issue.

663
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:08,955
You know, if the officer goes out and feels they need to document it.

664
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:15,438
So we do have kind of a way to track that, but we're still working on

665
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,771
efficacy to make sure that we're reporting that properly.

666
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:29,675
So the big push this year was to get our crime stat figures focused and make sure that we were, the codes were right.

667
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:32,036
We're getting the numbers to the state correctly.

668
00:56:32,776 --> 00:56:39,738
And there was a big push, especially the beginning of this year to make sure that all of that was done.

669
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:43,960
Cause the FBI has a cutoff date in March for us to do our submission.

670
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:49,328
And they'll still go through and audit it and look at all the crimes that we submitted.

671
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:55,211
And you won't even see an official report out of the FBI until October, November, maybe.

672
00:56:57,192 --> 00:56:59,614
And Councilor, I'll add one last thing.

673
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:06,998
All of our reports that are written, we now share in-house with our jail diversion clinician.

674
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:09,399
We have the city social worker.

675
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,702
We're working on a grant right now to try to bring in another social worker.

676
00:57:14,439 --> 00:57:33,785
to get them full time here to review all these cases, to sort of take some of that burden off of us, because it's not just sometimes the initial cost of follow up, right, and how that can be done in a different and if it belongs out of the law enforcement arena, we certainly want to get individuals who need help to the proper connections and the proper care.

677
00:57:33,805 --> 00:57:36,646
So we're building that whole program within the police department.

678
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:42,836
And, you know, hopefully over the next year, you'll start to see a lot more of that showing, you know, but we do it now.

679
00:57:42,936 --> 00:57:45,877
And, and we, I fully believe in the success that we have.

680
00:57:46,217 --> 00:57:57,640
So yeah, and you know, you kind of took the words right out of my mouth that, you know, thinking about now that you're able to track referrals and kind of track the different partnerships and have that good data coming in, you know,

681
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:06,445
I might be speculation, but maybe one of the reasons you were doing so much this year is that we don't have enough people doing some of these other work and that work is falling onto you.

682
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:13,067
So I think it could even help us inform budgeting, in a broader sense, how can we get more social workers?

683
00:58:13,308 --> 00:58:17,909
How can we make it so you're not writing grants all the time to get these essential positions filled?

684
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,450
So thank you for that.

685
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,531
And those are my questions and I really appreciate all your work.

686
00:58:23,191 --> 00:58:23,531
Thank you.

687
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:26,432
Thank you for coming this evening.

688
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:37,053
and everyone's questions and you know, in your brief tenure as chief, policing has changed a thousand percent in the last couple of years.

689
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,994
And I thank you for your leadership and I thank you for coming tonight.

690
00:58:40,794 --> 00:58:43,775
I thank you all and don't take this as offense, but I gotta get home.

691
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:50,798
So I'm gonna log off and if there is, you can always reach out to me, but long day and I appreciate you having me here and enjoy the night.

692
00:58:50,858 --> 00:58:51,138
Thanks.

693
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:52,179
Thank you.

694
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:52,999
Thank you.

695
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,161
Mr. Kearns, Commissioner Kearns.

696
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:01,018
Good evening, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.

697
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:02,519
Thank you for coming this evening also.

698
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,703
Do you have a little brief update you want to provide before we take questions?

699
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:13,985
Yeah, we start off with a C-click fix.

700
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:23,990
As always, for citywide or departments, the bulk of it, it's fair to say, rests on DPW.

701
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:30,688
It was massaged and relaunched by the mayor earlier this month.

702
00:59:31,549 --> 00:59:51,137
And, you know, my hat has to go off to Dyer, at least in the mayor's office, who gave, well, some of us a refresher, but some guys, quite honestly, the training where, you know, now all the department heads, highway, water and sewer, parks and so forth,

703
00:59:51,991 --> 01:00:05,439
Uh, you know, I have, uh, access to see click based on their departments and also systems upgrade for some of them with the computers that they had.

704
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:14,224
So that way they can communicate with the different requests that come in from the public or whoever may be interested.

705
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:20,688
Um, it's fair to say, okay, that, uh, you know, it's, it's working out very well on the DPW end.

706
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:28,475
You know, I look at it as, quite honestly, a tickler file where things come in here in so many different directions.

707
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:45,683
You know, we can go back in it with, you might say, the click of the mouse and, you know, see, you know, how many potholes were filled this month or, you know, how many, you know, complaints we have for illegal dumping this week.

708
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:49,625
So from a management side, it's good.

709
01:00:50,012 --> 01:01:01,621
but also too, it also measures the progress as far as how much time does it take for us to not acknowledge requests, but to close it up.

710
01:01:03,062 --> 01:01:09,608
So anyway, I'd like to say it's working out very, very well, at least from the DPW end.

711
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:15,552
I've talked to other department heads and they obviously don't get what we get,

712
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:22,823
It's working out very well and quite honestly, you know, I'm happy with it.

713
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:35,229
The next couple of things, okay, the DPW fleet maintenance has assumed the maintenance of the police fleet.

714
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:42,453
All of the cruises marked and unmarked that are in the jurisdiction of Metro PD.

715
01:01:42,473 --> 01:01:43,994
I believe it's about 58 of them.

716
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,925
But all of the maintenance now is being performed by PPW mechanics.

717
01:01:51,806 --> 01:01:54,888
And, you know, that's been working out well.

718
01:01:55,869 --> 01:02:07,018
You know, trying to familiarize ourselves, you might say, with the cars and, you know, continue to maintain them properly.

719
01:02:07,439 --> 01:02:13,684
Street sweeping, well, I think we've had 28 inches of snow and we'll leave it at that for this winter.

720
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:24,079
Street sweeping is going to resume April 1st for the overnights on the arterials from midnight to 7am.

721
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,562
The schedule has been posted on the website.

722
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:38,293
The signs are up on the streets as far as the times and the dates that the particular street you park on is affected.

723
01:02:39,033 --> 01:02:41,755
but that'll resume on April 1st.

724
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:49,719
The citywide sweep, we're leaning probably towards, maybe towards the middle of April.

725
01:02:50,580 --> 01:03:04,748
You know, we haven't, Steve and I haven't come up with an actual, you know, firm date yet, but again, we'll be doing the citywide sweep to, you know, pick up all of the debris that's been generated from, you know, the winter months.

726
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:26,592
Okay, the last thing that I have and I'll throw out to any questions, the entire DPW staff, okay, so many per week are going through CPR and defib training to be certified in CPR and to also use the defibrillators.

727
01:03:27,772 --> 01:03:33,553
So probably within another week or two, you know, the entire staff will be certified.

728
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:40,996
It was about a year ago at this time when I had finished up having everybody OSHA 30 certified.

729
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:45,818
State law required us to be OSHA 10.

730
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:49,960
I pushed the envelope and got everybody OSHA 30.

731
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,403
And talk about timing, that's when all of a sudden the COVID broke out.

732
01:03:56,653 --> 01:03:59,576
So anyway, we're on the move.

733
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:01,418
Obviously, we're out there every day.

734
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,841
The water main breaks, potholes or whatever.

735
01:04:04,582 --> 01:04:12,831
And hopefully, you know, if the weather stays in our favor, we'll be getting out into the athletic fields very shortly.

736
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:14,133
Right now, of course, the ground is

737
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:26,932
out there.

738
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:33,336
Thank you.

739
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:34,857
Uh, Scott Billy.

740
01:04:36,638 --> 01:04:37,819
Uh, thank you, Mr President again.

741
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:38,840
Thank you, Council marks.

742
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,081
Uh, I think this is what we're looking for.

743
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:46,424
Um, Mr Karen's, you know, we'll like again.

744
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:50,487
We speak during budget times, but, um, it's mostly focused on

745
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:54,596
what the needs are and how we can help or how we can't help.

746
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:57,358
But I think it's important to hear what you just said.

747
01:04:57,418 --> 01:05:02,882
And I, you know, my questions I had were see quick fix and how the department was working.

748
01:05:03,823 --> 01:05:08,586
The other question I had was, you know, seasonal street sweeping.

749
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:11,548
We talk about, you know, snow removal.

750
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:15,011
We talk about, you know, in every season there's something.

751
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:18,233
The preparation of the ball fields, that was another question I had.

752
01:05:18,253 --> 01:05:19,774
I'm glad to see that,

753
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:34,376
is scheduled in place once the equipment can get on the field so our kids can get outside, especially at this time, you know, during the pandemic that they just want to get out and run and just have a good time.

754
01:05:34,456 --> 01:05:41,359
So again, I don't want to be related to the issue, but you appreciate what you're doing.

755
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:45,441
I think that, I don't know if Stevie Tenaglia actually sleeps.

756
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:47,042
I see him,

757
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:49,396
at all hours of the day and night.

758
01:05:49,977 --> 01:05:51,377
He's driving around in a truck.

759
01:05:51,557 --> 01:05:56,198
Sometimes I think he's attached to that seat, so, because he's always working.

760
01:05:56,618 --> 01:06:13,403
And again, I think that, you know, yes, staff, whatever department it is, whether it's water, sewer, whether it's parks, whether it's highway, I think the DPW does an amazing job for the number of employees we have there.

761
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,824
And, you know, it's what keeps our city going.

762
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,840
You answered all my questions.

763
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:25,461
I think that's important that we know what's happening and our residents know what's going on.

764
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:31,822
And this isn't just a one-time meeting that we talk about, you know, the budget.

765
01:06:31,842 --> 01:06:32,483
So thank you.

766
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:36,163
Councilor Marks.

767
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:38,744
Thank you, Mr. President.

768
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:45,225
I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Scott Pelli for co-sponsoring this as well as members of the council.

769
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:58,387
You know, Councilor Scott Pelley hit the nail on the head regarding the amount of work that is produced from your department, Commissioner Kerins.

770
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:16,354
It's remarkable with the minimum manning that you have in all levels from parks, highways, cemetery, water and sewer that you're able to produce and keep producing is a tribute to not only the workers, but your leadership skills.

771
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:21,557
So I just want to, on behalf of the residents of this community, thank you for all you do.

772
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:28,000
You know, when you think of first responders, immediately police and fire are the thought, but guess what?

773
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:32,662
DPW workers, in my opinion, are first responders as well.

774
01:07:33,122 --> 01:07:41,106
And they've done a remarkable job over the past year during COVID to be out there and making sure that this community keeps moving forward.

775
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:43,367
And indeed that has happened.

776
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:46,088
You know, this was extremely informative and that's why

777
01:07:46,484 --> 01:07:51,688
Myself and council Scott Pelly thought it'd be helpful to have these meetings every so often.

778
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:57,252
I never realized that DPW now does the maintenance of the police vehicles.

779
01:07:58,332 --> 01:07:59,793
And that's a large undertaking.

780
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:05,878
It was always for the most part subcontracted out for much of the repairs.

781
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:15,164
And now I guess we're taking it in-house and that in itself is a large task and something that I didn't realize.

782
01:08:15,204 --> 01:08:16,165
So that was very helpful.

783
01:08:17,474 --> 01:08:40,117
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, regarding equipment needs, and I know some of this will be touched upon in the budget, and I'm not gonna get into budget issues until we start talking about the budget, but is there anything in particular that you could say to the council and to the residents on what particular equipment needs you may have in the upcoming months?

784
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:50,554
Well, right now, of course, we're in the process of transition councilor as far as going from the winter to the summer.

785
01:08:51,354 --> 01:09:08,765
I mean, there are a few medium duty trucks that I've actually sidelined for age and deterioration that I'd be requesting for replacement for different departments.

786
01:09:09,876 --> 01:09:17,762
The parks department, you know, want to look at the feasibility of some additional grounds equipment.

787
01:09:18,662 --> 01:09:30,971
You know, Mike Nestor and I have been in discussion, you know, nothing concrete yet because we're researching what is out there that would be best suited for the job that we have.

788
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:36,995
So there's different, you know, pieces out there that you might say a housekeeping,

789
01:09:37,914 --> 01:09:50,899
But in addition to that, now that PPW has assumed the responsibility of the maintenance, the upkeep of the cruises, I'm very, very well versed as far as cruiser maintenance.

790
01:09:51,460 --> 01:10:00,023
Back when, way back when, that was my first job, okay, was superintendent of a police fleet.

791
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:04,805
I had 150 cars, a helicopter, 20 horses, and 30 motorcycles.

792
01:10:05,712 --> 01:10:11,036
I kind of have an idea as far as what abuse, you might say, and use they go through.

793
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:19,984
That's going to be the area that we're going to really have to focus in on because some of these cars, though they run very good, they're getting tired.

794
01:10:21,205 --> 01:10:26,890
Tired as far as age, tired as far as mileage is concerned.

795
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:30,793
All in all, and I will have to say the men and women of the department

796
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:36,080
have taken very good care of the equipment, and in some cases, under the most adverse conditions.

797
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,722
But like anything, it's a piece of machinery and it does wear out.

798
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:51,486
So the chief and I will definitely be sitting down as far as coming up with what we both mutually agree and recommend as far as cruise is a concern.

799
01:10:51,986 --> 01:11:00,349
And I would also apply with Chief Berdy with the fire fleet, which we also maintain as far as what's out there because

800
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,778
Everything has multiple drivers.

801
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:06,339
Everybody has their own style of driving.

802
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:10,001
In one minute, they're going 25, 30 miles an hour.

803
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,943
The next minute, they get an emergency call.

804
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:16,845
And well, all right, they pick it up a little bit.

805
01:11:16,866 --> 01:11:19,147
So they live a tough life.

806
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,288
It's not a Medfit issue.

807
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,710
That's just the nature of the business.

808
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,991
In my business, all right,

809
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,302
Yes, it's multiple drivers, but it's also okay to stop and go with the wear and tear.

810
01:11:31,923 --> 01:11:42,067
And in most cases where my fleet, all right, is engaged in snow and ice control, all right, when these trucks have their blades on, they're taking a beating, they're taking a pounding.

811
01:11:42,668 --> 01:11:45,289
And again, machinery, it wears out.

812
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:54,433
So, you know, we're gonna be sitting down and coming up with what we absolutely need before, you know, we'll sit with the mayor and put

813
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:59,211
down what we really, really need, and then bring it to the council's attention.

814
01:12:01,352 --> 01:12:02,872
Thank you for that thorough response.

815
01:12:02,992 --> 01:12:21,298
And I know this council, and I'll just speak for myself, has been very supportive over the years to see that DPW received the appropriate equipment, the appropriate staffing to fit the needs of not only a department, but to make sure they address the needs throughout the community.

816
01:12:21,858 --> 01:12:22,818
And I know that'll be

817
01:12:23,652 --> 01:12:26,654
something that this council is pushing for during the budget time.

818
01:12:27,355 --> 01:12:38,903
Just to touch upon what Councilor Scott Pelli has brought up a dozen times, and I don't expect an answer now, but the creation of a sidewalk crew to do it in-house.

819
01:12:39,844 --> 01:12:43,526
I know Councilor Scott Pelli has been on top of that for many years.

820
01:12:44,107 --> 01:12:51,272
And I think from a financial standpoint, it makes a lot of sense to have an in-house crew that we can depend on

821
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:56,849
that sole purpose is to replace broken sidewalks throughout the community.

822
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,989
So I just want to put a plug in for that.

823
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:07,592
And the priority sidewalk for snow removal, it's something that we've talked about recently over the last couple of months.

824
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:20,977
And I'm hoping that's something that we can look at by doing 40, 50, 60 miles of priority sidewalk throughout the community to connect bus stops and schools

825
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:25,364
business districts for safe travel for residents.

826
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:29,166
And I know that's something that you expressed interest on as well.

827
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:37,030
And the last point is what Council Vice President Knight brought up, I believe it was last week or the week before, regarding road improvements.

828
01:13:37,691 --> 01:13:47,076
And I don't have to preach to you, Commissioner, but I think we all understand that our roads are in dire need of some attention.

829
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:50,418
And it's great to throw some tire in a pothole,

830
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:59,447
but I think many of the roads are past that and we have to look at resurfacing many of our major roads and thoroughfares throughout our community.

831
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:06,351
And I hope not only within the capital plan, but also our budget that we put a higher emphasis on roads.

832
01:14:06,891 --> 01:14:13,195
So I want to thank you again for coming tonight and appreciate all your staff and what you do for us on a daily basis.

833
01:14:13,595 --> 01:14:15,196
Thank you councilor, my pleasure.

834
01:14:16,716 --> 01:14:19,638
Thank you councilor.

835
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,602
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Commissioner Kearns.

836
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:28,667
I want to thank you for all your hard work and for the hard working department as well.

837
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:38,735
I know that there's been staffing challenges within DPW, but you always seem to

838
01:14:39,422 --> 01:14:40,203
get the work done.

839
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:54,352
I agree with countless car belly I think Steve can actually lives in his truck, but every time I call him I he's working on something, and I know that the DPW is always working hard so I thank you for all hard work.

840
01:14:55,052 --> 01:14:55,753
I also wanted to.

841
01:14:57,523 --> 01:15:04,909
uh, basically ask you a quick question regarding, uh, you had mentioned the, and I, Councilor Marks touched upon it as well, as far as maintenance of the cruisers.

842
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:11,515
So do you, um, do you know if, uh, or feel that we have enough mechanics on staff to handle the volume?

843
01:15:12,576 --> 01:15:18,921
Uh, for present, presently right now, uh, you know, we're, we're moving ahead.

844
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:28,887
What I want to try to do is focus in on potentially looking at the feasibility of an additional mechanic.

845
01:15:29,768 --> 01:15:31,310
Because right now we have a mechanic

846
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:42,558
when there's no fire trucks in for maintenance or repairs, he then works on BPW, he wears two hats.

847
01:15:43,598 --> 01:16:01,485
And I would like to look into getting another two hat mechanic, you might say, even though that mechanic would be a little bit more busier, particularly with 58 police cars, keeping them maintained because they require a lot of

848
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:11,998
because, okay, the life of that officer is in our hands, all right?

849
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:18,683
And I wanna make God being well sure, okay, that that car is running the best we possibly can get it.

850
01:16:20,324 --> 01:16:20,925
Okay, thank you.

851
01:16:21,545 --> 01:16:22,666
And I missed what you said before.

852
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:24,368
Did you say how many police vehicles?

853
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:30,072
A combination of mocked and unmarked, Councilor, I believe it's 58.

854
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:30,072
58.

855
01:16:30,773 --> 01:16:32,014
And unmarked cruisers.

856
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:49,431
include, okay, the speed boards, their message boards, their Howie Davidsons, you know, that's also part of their inventory as well, but, you know, I'm just giving you the number of the rolling stock.

857
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:51,252
No problem, thank you.

858
01:16:51,492 --> 01:16:56,233
And when did you start, when did the DPW start maintaining the police car, police fleet?

859
01:16:56,494 --> 01:17:01,235
Earlier this month, Councillor, beginning of, you know, the beginning of March, okay.

860
01:17:01,959 --> 01:17:06,541
is when we started the maintenance of them.

861
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:19,907
And basically it's been, okay, we get these guys in once a week, the whole fleet comes in and they go bumper to bumper, check the oil, tire pressure and everything else.

862
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:28,010
And then call them in as the mileage or the hours, the running hours fall for regular maintenance.

863
01:17:29,617 --> 01:17:29,977
Thank you.

864
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:33,360
And last but not least, do you have any major concerns?

865
01:17:34,081 --> 01:17:40,547
What would be a major concern regarding the DPW that you think might be in the horizon or might need to be addressed?

866
01:17:41,628 --> 01:17:43,269
Keeping them healthy, Councillor.

867
01:17:49,242 --> 01:18:00,828
I will have to say that now that we're in the category of eligibility, yesterday I had two guys get their shots.

868
01:18:00,908 --> 01:18:02,809
Today I've got four getting their shots.

869
01:18:03,349 --> 01:18:06,010
I'm getting my shot at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.

870
01:18:06,835 --> 01:18:14,439
So I'm starting to get a little peace of mind, but trying to keep these guys safe and healthy for their own sake.

871
01:18:15,139 --> 01:18:22,243
That's been a full-time job because to me, this pandemic, it's like shadow boxing.

872
01:18:22,763 --> 01:18:23,944
But I don't know what to do.

873
01:18:26,025 --> 01:18:26,705
Very good point.

874
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:28,746
Good luck with your shot tomorrow.

875
01:18:28,946 --> 01:18:32,668
And once again, thank you to you and your department for all your hard work.

876
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,249
Appreciate it.

877
01:18:33,289 --> 01:18:33,569
Thank you.

878
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:33,869
Thank you.

879
01:18:37,606 --> 01:18:38,546
Thank you, Mr. President.

880
01:18:38,767 --> 01:18:39,627
Hi, Brian.

881
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,368
Just want to say thank you again.

882
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:47,091
I think you really are the poster child for when we ask people to do more with less, you always exceed expectations.

883
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:57,576
And my biggest hope is that we can get you to do more with more, because I think we could just do so much for this community if we could get you some more resources.

884
01:18:58,056 --> 01:19:05,560
My only question, and I think Councilor Falco kind of got at it a little bit, is, you know,

885
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:19,833
Do you have an idea of how much staffing, like what staffing level you would really like to see at the department to provide all of these services that we're talking about?

886
01:19:19,853 --> 01:19:28,115
You know, I know that the staffing level has gone down over the past several years, and I'm just wondering where would you like to see it come back to?

887
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:36,597
You know, we're always asking about one position, maybe a mechanic, but is there kind of a broader number of how many people you'd like to see staffing DPW?

888
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:39,066
Yes, there is.

889
01:19:39,766 --> 01:19:44,410
I've always said, give me 25 positions of my choosing.

890
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:51,777
It'll be five for each of the parks, five for the highway, five for parks and so forth.

891
01:19:52,377 --> 01:20:00,844
All right, five for every pave, but okay, I would then go and establish, okay, a Monday through Saturday work schedule.

892
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:03,507
So that way four of the days

893
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:05,545
of the week, all right?

894
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:18,476
I would have the extra muscle in each department to do either a special project, or you will say, like as Councilor Scappell said, sidewalks or whatever, but I'd have six day a week coverage.

895
01:20:20,157 --> 01:20:22,699
The city is growing, all right?

896
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:23,480
And it's, you know,

897
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:34,694
coming down to, you know, it's a seven day a week city, you know, and we have to change with the times, we should change with the times, all right, we want to stay in this business.

898
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:51,163
And, you know, I've said, all right, you know, 25 sounds like a lot, but you break it up to the five departments only gives each man department five, but go six days a week, because, okay, the people are out there for six days a week, 12 months of the year,

899
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:57,294
And it's plenty for these guys to do, because the majority of the personnel, they're all cross trained.

900
01:20:58,014 --> 01:21:07,902
Okay, so I mean, you know, all right, fine, all right, you know, we may not be lying in a baseball field in the wintertime, but flip side to it is they're capable of filling poppers.

901
01:21:07,982 --> 01:21:10,524
And I just throw that as a quick example.

902
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:17,290
So there's plenty to be done out there and the 25 would be, you know, a good number.

903
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:19,492
Right, and I appreciate that.

904
01:21:19,512 --> 01:21:21,173
And I think, you know, it goes back to what you're saying,

905
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:22,826
about keeping everyone healthy.

906
01:21:22,906 --> 01:21:27,548
Part of that is COVID, but part of that is not having Steve in the truck 60 hours a week, right?

907
01:21:27,848 --> 01:21:35,532
So, you know, I might be under counting it too, but thank you for that.

908
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:43,977
And I think that's the kind of visioning we need to think about when we're talking about making sure that our departments have the services, you know, have the resources to provide the services that we need.

909
01:21:44,217 --> 01:21:44,997
So thank you, Brian.

910
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:48,979
Thank you, Councilor Baez.

911
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:49,800
And again, Brian,

912
01:21:50,777 --> 01:21:52,237
I just want to thank you for coming tonight.

913
01:21:52,277 --> 01:21:58,619
Again, you know, today you have to do more with less and get better results from limited resources more than ever before.

914
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,939
So again, thank you for your leadership.

915
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:03,460
Thank you for coming tonight and see you soon.

916
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,501
Okay, my prerogative is to be safe, Councillor.

917
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:10,981
Thank you, Mr. Carrington.

918
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:12,142
Thank you for coming this evening.

919
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:12,582
Thank you.

920
01:22:18,492 --> 01:22:20,834
when Chief Gilberto comes back.

921
01:22:21,054 --> 01:22:21,775
So, thank you again.

922
01:22:21,795 --> 01:22:23,176
Motion to approve.

923
01:22:23,196 --> 01:22:24,618
Can we take 21-198?

924
01:22:24,658 --> 01:22:25,198
Hold on, which one?

925
01:22:25,218 --> 01:22:25,238
21-198.

926
01:22:25,298 --> 01:22:27,840
I don't know if Marie's on the call, but we'll put it up there anyways.

927
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,643
21-198 offered by the entire council, be it resolved.

928
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:48,939
that the Memphis City Council congratulate Marie Cassidy on her 70th birthday.

929
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,481
Later this week, one of our own community heroes celebrates a special birthday.

930
01:22:53,821 --> 01:23:06,006
Marie Cassidy, the lifeblood of the Memphis Family Network, has worked tirelessly for almost five decades as a teacher, social worker, all around facilitating and giving love.

931
01:23:06,186 --> 01:23:14,250
Establishing relationships with families of young children, Marie has become an integral support person in many Memphis households throughout her years of service.

932
01:23:15,547 --> 01:23:19,529
As one family said, you are one spectacular lady.

933
01:23:19,949 --> 01:23:28,294
You entered our lives when we needed you the most and introduced us to friends who became family, which is more than a sentiment that rings true with many.

934
01:23:28,954 --> 01:23:43,122
She is also in such honors as the 2018 Excellence in Public Service Award from the Medford Chamber of Commerce, Community Hero by the ABCD, and an honorary degree of public service from Tufts University.

935
01:23:43,637 --> 01:23:54,343
We celebrate Marie's everlasting impact on our city this year, and of course, her birthday, by raising a glass while donating your favorite feather bow.

936
01:23:55,723 --> 01:24:12,232
If you are looking to wish Marie a happy birthday, or just let her know you appreciate all she's done in your favor, join us on Friday, March 26th at 8.30 for a virtual celebration, and head over to the Friends of the Metro Family Network website for information.

937
01:24:13,093 --> 01:24:13,393
Thank you.

938
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:16,051
Councilor Marks.

939
01:24:16,071 --> 01:24:19,432
I will refer to Councilor Falcone.

940
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:19,992
Thank you.

941
01:24:20,252 --> 01:24:21,853
Is Maria here?

942
01:24:21,893 --> 01:24:27,355
I don't know if Maria is on the call tonight.

943
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:29,556
I don't see her here, but Councilor Falcone.

944
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:30,917
No problem.

945
01:24:31,257 --> 01:24:32,477
Mr. President, thank you very much.

946
01:24:33,157 --> 01:24:35,738
I'd like to say happy birthday to Maria Cassidy.

947
01:24:36,379 --> 01:24:38,740
I've known Maria for almost about 20 years now.

948
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:44,651
just through my work on the MFA Family Network and being on the advisory board for many years.

949
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:48,934
And I remember meeting Marie some 20 years ago.

950
01:24:48,954 --> 01:24:52,777
I've never met someone with so much energy and enthusiasm in all my life.

951
01:24:53,518 --> 01:25:01,744
And she is someone that has had a tremendous positive impact on thousands of families here in our city through the years.

952
01:25:02,665 --> 01:25:06,648
She has been with the network since it's a beginning.

953
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:11,455
when it started in multiple locations and I would say quartered at the high school.

954
01:25:12,035 --> 01:25:17,720
But like I said, she's had a positive impact on thousands of families throughout our community through the years.

955
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:21,122
And she's a very special person.

956
01:25:22,303 --> 01:25:23,604
And she's always on the go.

957
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:24,545
She's always moving around.

958
01:25:24,565 --> 01:25:29,368
I hope she finds some time to celebrate her birthday with her family and her friends.

959
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:32,931
So I'd like to say to Marie Cassidy, happy birthday.

960
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,433
And I hope she enjoys her day.

961
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:35,993
Thank you.

962
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:41,394
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

963
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:43,855
You couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person.

964
01:25:44,636 --> 01:26:05,908
In all the years I've been in city government, Marie really stands out for her way that she handles situations, her intense knowledge of what she does, and her really caring and sensitive approach, how she deals with children and family in our community.

965
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,711
And I just want to congratulate her, Mr. President.

966
01:26:10,151 --> 01:26:11,331
I do think there's a typo.

967
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:13,991
It says five decades in here.

968
01:26:16,412 --> 01:26:19,512
It can't be five decades.

969
01:26:20,972 --> 01:26:22,633
Murray's not that old.

970
01:26:22,793 --> 01:26:24,413
I don't think it's five decades.

971
01:26:25,173 --> 01:26:28,574
But she does a tremendous job, Mr. President.

972
01:26:29,354 --> 01:26:33,975
And on behalf of this council, I just want to thank her for all she does for our community.

973
01:26:34,935 --> 01:26:35,315
Thank you.

974
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:36,833
Councilor Scott Bell.

975
01:26:37,654 --> 01:26:39,375
Thank you, Mr. President.

976
01:26:40,016 --> 01:26:58,468
As a young teacher, I remember this energetic, exciting teacher that would dress up and run around her classroom and excite her students and excite the school and get everybody going in such a positive way.

977
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:00,829
And that was Marie Cassidy.

978
01:27:00,869 --> 01:27:04,652
I remember her as a young teacher and saw the impact

979
01:27:05,222 --> 01:27:10,983
that just a smile of being positive and being energetic meant to a whole school district, a whole school system.

980
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:22,846
And what she's done is she's taken that knowledge and that love of children in a small classroom in one school, and she then turned our whole community around.

981
01:27:23,326 --> 01:27:27,066
If people talk about new and old Medford, one thing is constant.

982
01:27:27,907 --> 01:27:30,487
Marie Cassidy made everybody feel welcome.

983
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:34,448
So there was no new, there was no old Medford.

984
01:27:35,101 --> 01:27:41,325
Marie Cassidy to bring everybody together, and that's what this city needs more and more every day, people like Marie Cassidy.

985
01:27:42,066 --> 01:27:44,347
She's been here a long time, five decades.

986
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:45,788
I find that impossible myself.

987
01:27:46,288 --> 01:27:48,710
I think she's 21 and 21 and 20.

988
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,832
She's 21 years old, and she just keeps going and going.

989
01:27:51,852 --> 01:28:02,058
And I think that her impact and her way of living is, I think, an unbelievable example of how everybody should live.

990
01:28:02,139 --> 01:28:04,100
Has anybody ever seen Marie Cassidy?

991
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:05,868
not smile.

992
01:28:06,068 --> 01:28:07,408
I don't think I've ever seen that.

993
01:28:08,809 --> 01:28:11,571
You know, Marie's always there when family's in need.

994
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:13,412
Who do you turn to, Marie?

995
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:23,037
When you're new to the city and you need to find your way with different families, Marie's the person that's there for you.

996
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:34,023
So she has been just an amazing person, and I probably know why she's not on this call, because Marie doesn't like, every time you see her,

997
01:28:34,765 --> 01:28:36,526
They feed her with the accolades.

998
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:39,367
I think that's the only time you see her turn her head.

999
01:28:39,407 --> 01:28:43,129
So she's an amazing person, and I wish her a very happy birthday.

1000
01:28:43,749 --> 01:28:52,733
And let's pray that she has five more decades with our community, just to move our next generations on in such a positive way.

1001
01:28:52,753 --> 01:28:55,054
So thank you, Mr. President.

1002
01:28:55,614 --> 01:28:56,935
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1003
01:28:57,035 --> 01:29:04,058
And to Marie, I know you're probably at home watching, embarrassed because of all these kind words that the council is saying about you.

1004
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:05,528
but every one of them is true.

1005
01:29:07,049 --> 01:29:09,970
I always picture Marie Cassidy as a person that never has a bad day.

1006
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:13,652
Every time you see her, she's always smiling, full of energy, full of life.

1007
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:25,637
But most importantly, she's always focused on the end goal, focused on the mission, focused on the prize, which is furthering the Medford Family Network and its interests and objectives here in the community.

1008
01:29:26,097 --> 01:29:31,880
And she's done a great job doing that, Mr. President, as evident by the number of awards that you so eloquently spoke of earlier in the evening.

1009
01:29:32,652 --> 01:29:38,197
So with that being said, Mr. President, before Marie turns 71, I'd like to wish her a happy 70th birthday.

1010
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:43,401
So I join my council colleagues in extending these well wishes to her, and I wish her the best.

1011
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:44,462
Thank you.

1012
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:45,163
Council Member Rao.

1013
01:29:46,984 --> 01:29:47,965
Thank you, Mr. President.

1014
01:29:48,265 --> 01:29:59,735
Yeah, this is really something that when you ask people what they love about Medford, no matter how long they've been here, I know the Medford Family Network comes up often, and it's something people are really proud of to have in this community.

1015
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:00,836
So I'm so thankful

1016
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:08,919
that Marie has dedicated so much of her 70 years to the city's families and all she's done for the community.

1017
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:14,743
So I join with everyone else in wishing her a happy birthday and really thanking her for what she's done for this community.

1018
01:30:14,763 --> 01:30:17,165
Thank you, Councilor.

1019
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:17,746
Councilor Best.

1020
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:19,427
Thank you, Mr. President.

1021
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:27,653
And I'd just be repeating what everyone else has said, but I think what Marie Cassidy has done for young people and families in this community for so long,

1022
01:30:29,285 --> 01:30:35,467
can't even be valued, but I do hope that everyone will donate or try to support the virtual celebration.

1023
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:44,130
Of course, Marie is giving away her 70th birthday to provide donations to the Medford Family Network, which I think is exactly what we would expect of her.

1024
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:46,011
So please support that.

1025
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:52,313
It's on Friday, March 26, which I believe is this Friday at 8.30, and there are ways to give online.

1026
01:30:52,874 --> 01:30:53,214
Thank you.

1027
01:30:54,174 --> 01:30:54,914
Thank you, Councilman.

1028
01:30:55,335 --> 01:30:56,095
And if I could say,

1029
01:30:57,643 --> 01:31:01,566
I've been working with Marie probably 15 years.

1030
01:31:02,786 --> 01:31:04,027
It's a joy to work with her.

1031
01:31:04,087 --> 01:31:12,192
I mean, anytime she calls me, I run up there because I can't do enough for her and her group.

1032
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:18,775
You've seen a lot of pictures with me and Marie over the years, and she may be small in size.

1033
01:31:19,376 --> 01:31:20,676
She's very large in stature.

1034
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,078
And again, I just want to thank Marie

1035
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,943
all of what she does for the community, and she just continues to give and give.

1036
01:31:28,263 --> 01:31:31,566
She is the ultimate energizer bunny up there.

1037
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:35,208
My counselor tonight said, I don't think she's ever had a bad day.

1038
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:41,753
So again, I want to thank Marie for everything she's done for the community, and I hope she works here another 15 more years.

1039
01:31:42,854 --> 01:31:43,214
Thank you.

1040
01:31:44,575 --> 01:31:46,036
We'll place our file, Mr. President.

1041
01:31:46,056 --> 01:31:50,960
The motion by Councilor Scott Palacio to place our file, seconded by Councilor Falcone.

1042
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,981

Councilor Marks.

1052
01:32:10,003 --> 01:32:10,343
Yes.

Councilor Morrell.

1054
01:32:11,544 --> 01:32:11,804
Yes.

1055
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:13,225
Councilor Scarpelli.

1056
01:32:13,245 --> 01:32:13,305
Yes.

1057
01:32:14,305 --> 01:32:15,046
President Kerrio.

1058
01:32:15,126 --> 01:32:18,908
Yes, affirmative motion passes.

Councilor Scarpelli.

1062
01:32:53,043 --> 01:32:53,883

1063
01:32:54,503 --> 01:32:57,644
Refer this to uh, licensing chairman Councilor Scott Pelli.

1064
01:32:58,785 --> 01:32:59,605
Thank you, Mr President.

1065
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:00,545
Is the petitioner here?

1066
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:03,526
I see she was here.

1067
01:33:03,546 --> 01:33:04,527
Let me see.

1068
01:33:04,547 --> 01:33:04,947
She's here.

1069
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:06,467
Okay.

1070
01:33:06,487 --> 01:33:07,448
Hi, Joanne.

1071
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,408
Thank you.

1072
01:33:09,408 --> 01:33:10,929
Thank you, Joanne, for joining us this evening.

1073
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:13,009
I've reviewed all your records.

1074
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:14,470
Everything seems in order.

1075
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:20,632
If you can, just if you can give us just before any councilors have any questions, we were on this.

1076
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:22,832
Can you give us a brief synopsis?

1077
01:33:22,872 --> 01:33:31,775
I know this is a new dry cleaning, dying and dry cleaning location on Boston Ave, but could you give us a little brief insight?

1078
01:33:32,796 --> 01:33:33,536
So it's not new.

1079
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:34,817
I took it over.

1080
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:36,609
Okay.

1081
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,430
So it was, I took it over.

1082
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:40,751
So it's been here for a while.

1083
01:33:40,932 --> 01:33:43,373
There's been a bunch of owners.

1084
01:33:44,933 --> 01:33:46,294
It's not dry cleaning service.

1085
01:33:46,374 --> 01:33:47,415
It's just laundry service.

1086
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:56,279
So it's just wash, dry, fold, wash your sheets, dryers, drop off services, pickup services, pretty brief.

1087
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:58,720
Okay.

1088
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,161
No, that's a clarification.

1089
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:02,082
Wanted to make sure that,

1090
01:34:03,507 --> 01:34:05,108
that everybody understands what it is.

1091
01:34:05,168 --> 01:34:11,691
I see everything is in order, Joanne, and I know if anybody has any other questions, I move approval.

1092
01:34:13,392 --> 01:34:13,752
Thank you.

1093
01:34:13,832 --> 01:34:16,753
Any questions for Joanne?

1094
01:34:16,773 --> 01:34:19,595
Mr. President, I'd second the approval, Mr. President.

1095
01:34:20,155 --> 01:34:21,876
I wish Ms.

1096
01:34:21,936 --> 01:34:26,558
Campanoni the best of luck in her new endeavor, and hopefully things work out.

1097
01:34:26,878 --> 01:34:28,399
But I certainly see no problem with this.

1098
01:34:28,459 --> 01:34:29,500
It's an existing use.

1099
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,880
I think it's a wash vault now.

1100
01:34:31,561 --> 01:34:31,681
Yes.

1101
01:34:33,426 --> 01:34:33,746
Thank you.

1102
01:34:34,446 --> 01:34:38,508
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1103
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:40,148
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1104
01:34:40,749 --> 01:34:41,329
Councilor Behrs.

1105
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:42,169
Yes.

1106
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,010
Councilor Felco.

1107
01:34:44,110 --> 01:34:44,310
Yes.

1108
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:45,590
Vice President Knight.

1109
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:46,211
Yes.

1110
01:34:46,411 --> 01:34:47,011
Councilor Marks.

1111
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:47,771
Yes.

1112
01:34:49,172 --> 01:34:49,412
Yes.

1113
01:34:50,432 --> 01:34:51,152
Councilor Scarpelli.

1114
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:51,573
Yes.

1115
01:34:53,493 --> 01:34:54,514
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1116
01:34:54,954 --> 01:34:55,954
Motion passes.

1117
01:34:55,974 --> 01:34:58,155
Mr. President, while you're under suspension.

1118
01:34:58,635 --> 01:34:59,515
Councilor Scarpelli. 21194.

1119
01:35:05,105 --> 01:35:25,179
be a result that the city council as a city administration and traffic department to look into parking concerns raised by residents who live on main streets with limited parking that are not on permitted streets in a who can only find safe parking on adjacent streets that have permitted parking so these residents can park safely without being penalized.

1120
01:35:27,163 --> 01:35:28,023
Thank you, Mr President.

1121
01:35:28,203 --> 01:35:31,164
I know that received an email from a resident.

1122
01:35:31,464 --> 01:35:38,785
And as I started looking into this and talking to different people, different departments, I think that this is one of the, um.

1123
01:35:39,846 --> 01:35:56,449
One of the pieces when it comes to rules and regulations that, um, hurt hurt our residents and not being a permitted total permitted community, uh, people that are residing on major main thoroughways, main streets that

1124
01:35:57,074 --> 01:36:00,175
share parking spots with businesses.

1125
01:36:02,635 --> 01:36:07,876
And then, especially during the winter months with snow, finding it very difficult to park on main streets.

1126
01:36:09,516 --> 01:36:22,799
And you're asking people that are working second shift or nurses and so on that might be coming home late, looking for a parking spot, can't find a spot on the main road.

1127
01:36:24,261 --> 01:36:28,845
They're residents that are willing to pay for permit parking on the adjacent street.

1128
01:36:29,305 --> 01:36:51,105
What I'm asking the city administration to do with the traffic department is to find a resolution that we can assist those neighbors that, you know, even if we said people that live on Salem Street that abut the side street of Park Street that have permitted parking, that we find a way that they are permitted to

1129
01:36:51,646 --> 01:36:58,330
purchase a parking permit for that area or that one street so they have the ability to park in a safe manner.

1130
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:09,916
And the other piece is leaving those spots open for some local small businesses that really need that parking, especially as we get to a new normal here and open up our businesses.

1131
01:37:09,956 --> 01:37:20,462
So again, this is a little issue that maybe is just bypassed because of the simple blanket rule of the permit or no permit,

1132
01:37:20,742 --> 01:37:21,683
parking on the street.

1133
01:37:22,323 --> 01:37:30,870
And this is for one resident that turned into about four more that I reached out to and I'm sure there are more that we're looking for a solution.

1134
01:37:31,331 --> 01:37:36,315
And if city administration fabric the topic can help to find a solution to be greatly appreciated.

1135
01:37:36,355 --> 01:37:36,695
Thank you.

1136
01:37:37,656 --> 01:37:38,036
Thank you.

1137
01:37:38,136 --> 01:37:46,263
And I think we have somebody that wants to speak while we have the any other comments?

1138
01:37:46,283 --> 01:37:46,683
Mr. President?

1139
01:37:49,139 --> 01:37:52,321
Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Councillor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

1140
01:37:52,641 --> 01:38:03,829
I do know that the Commission for Parking Policy and Enforcement, the zoned, idea of zoned parking permits is one of the things they explored and I believe will be in their report or is in their report to the mayor.

1141
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:11,455
So just sharing that that's something that has been looked in and hopefully the administration will receive that and think of some solutions.

1142
01:38:11,535 --> 01:38:12,435
So I just wanted to add that.

1143
01:38:12,455 --> 01:38:14,877
Thank you.

1144
01:38:15,338 --> 01:38:15,618
Thank you.

1145
01:38:16,675 --> 01:38:20,337
I think we have somebody who wants to speak in regards to the streets.

1146
01:38:21,618 --> 01:38:22,438
Name and address of the record.

1147
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:49,175
Is this the time that you want to hear it?

1148
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:52,777
If Councillor Scarpe would want to amend his motion to add this on there.

1149
01:38:52,797 --> 01:38:54,298
Okay.

1150
01:38:55,838 --> 01:38:57,059
It seems we're on traffic.

1151
01:38:57,638 --> 01:39:05,920
So in Q4 of 2020, you've all seen the house on the corner of Forest Street and Westfield Road that was blighted for many years.

1152
01:39:06,401 --> 01:39:17,244
It's been being renovated, and after sinking all that money into the property, there was a day that city workers were installing a speed trap directly in front of the house.

1153
01:39:17,364 --> 01:39:21,325
The owner asked them not to do it, and in so many words was told, too bad.

1154
01:39:22,298 --> 01:39:24,580
I did reach out to Mr. Caraviello.

1155
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,641
He spoke with the traffic engineer.

1156
01:39:26,681 --> 01:39:28,523
We were told that this was going to be addressed.

1157
01:39:28,983 --> 01:39:30,224
It never got addressed.

1158
01:39:30,724 --> 01:39:34,067
It is still sitting in front of this house, and it's directly in front of the door.

1159
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:36,669
And I actually have a... Somebody wants to take these.

1160
01:39:36,749 --> 01:39:41,172
I have pictures for all of you that kind of show you exactly what's going on.

1161
01:39:43,136 --> 01:39:49,362
This B-trap, you stand in the master bedroom of one of these units, and I actually didn't know about it being installed that day.

1162
01:39:49,462 --> 01:39:53,105
I was upstairs in the master bedroom, and I see this flashing light.

1163
01:39:53,185 --> 01:39:55,187
It's this B-trap in front of the house.

1164
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:59,786
When I went to the other unit, I'm standing in the living room, and you see this flashing light.

1165
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:00,687
That is not fair.

1166
01:40:00,727 --> 01:40:05,350
If you guys all know Forest Street, he could have gone down a couple of houses.

1167
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:07,952
And you have houses that are set way back from the street.

1168
01:40:08,472 --> 01:40:10,134
That speed trap could have been put there.

1169
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:11,395
It wouldn't have bothered anybody.

1170
01:40:11,775 --> 01:40:13,576
He could have gone up a couple of blocks.

1171
01:40:13,676 --> 01:40:16,839
It could have been installed in front of the houses that are up off of Forest Street.

1172
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:18,340
It wouldn't have bothered anybody.

1173
01:40:18,991 --> 01:40:24,392
On the flip side of that paper that I just gave you is Highland Avenue.

1174
01:40:24,472 --> 01:40:28,874
So 914 Highland Avenue, that buyer paid $800,000 for that house.

1175
01:40:29,274 --> 01:40:41,457
And now the city of Medford has installed a crosswalk with a traffic light and another structure right there for you to press the button, not just in front of the property, but directly in front of the front door.

1176
01:40:42,177 --> 01:40:46,278
Nine houses down, the same exact thing was installed.

1177
01:40:46,738 --> 01:40:51,504
So you guys all know how the job there's a lot of places this stuff could have gone.

1178
01:40:51,524 --> 01:40:54,788
I don't understand why we need to have a nine house away.

1179
01:40:54,808 --> 01:40:56,650
I mean, we're all pretty healthy people here.

1180
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:57,451
But

1181
01:40:58,161 --> 01:41:04,606
And to put it in front of somebody's front door is to encumber their residence, but also to devalue their property.

1182
01:41:05,146 --> 01:41:08,789
I did try to take this up over the course of the last two days.

1183
01:41:08,869 --> 01:41:10,910
Thank you, Mr. Mark, Mr. Caraviello.

1184
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:16,434
I would include you in those emails to numerous people in this city, because I don't know who to address it to.

1185
01:41:16,455 --> 01:41:19,577
And the answer that I got from the traffic engineer today

1186
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:24,760
It was a beautiful email, but it didn't address the situation on why we're doing this for our residents.

1187
01:41:24,841 --> 01:41:32,506
So I'm coming tonight to the council to ask for your assistance in resolving this, because it's totally changing the landscape of Medford.

1188
01:41:33,947 --> 01:41:34,347
Thank you.

1189
01:41:34,748 --> 01:41:43,354
Mr. President, I think Council Marks brought the same issue forward in the Governor Zav Lawrence Estates, Lawrence Road issue.

1190
01:41:44,054 --> 01:41:47,877
And the traffic department moved quickly, I believe.

1191
01:41:48,588 --> 01:41:50,149
to rectify the situation.

1192
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:58,414
I know that safety is paramount, and I can understand where they're coming from, but with what Ms.

1193
01:41:58,454 --> 01:42:17,907
Catalo is talking about, it looks like these are put right in front of people's residence, and it does cause a bit of a concern where there wasn't much thought in maybe talking to the neighbors and maybe putting them more strategically

1194
01:42:18,183 --> 01:42:29,870
location or at least not as flashy or interruptive to a bedroom or not.

1195
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:47,100
I'd like to amend this to maybe send this paper, this issue and concern to Todd Blake, our traffic engineer, to see if he can look into this and see if we can find some solutions maybe to move these locations to a

1196
01:42:48,218 --> 01:42:51,721
more suitable area where it doesn't affect residents' front doors.

1197
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:53,342
I think it's very important.

1198
01:42:53,362 --> 01:42:53,823
So thank you.

1199
01:42:55,164 --> 01:42:55,484
President.

1200
01:42:57,446 --> 01:42:58,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

1201
01:42:58,186 --> 01:43:04,832
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for putting this on, and I want to thank Kelly Catalo for bringing up this very important issue.

1202
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:15,381
Mr. President, we did receive a response back from the email that was sent out by Kelly from the traffic engineer, stating more or less that these

1203
01:43:17,223 --> 01:43:24,064
particular sites are selected with due diligence and careful consideration for where they're being placed.

1204
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:33,846
However, if you look at the placement of these signs, I think that all goes out the window because I don't see that due diligence and careful placement of these signs.

1205
01:43:34,267 --> 01:43:37,107
I see them plopped in front of front doors of people's homes.

1206
01:43:37,647 --> 01:43:41,288
The thing is, Mr. President, with these signs, these are solar power signs.

1207
01:43:41,868 --> 01:43:46,249
So we're not dependent upon having them in a certain area because of electricity.

1208
01:43:46,659 --> 01:43:49,780
So these signs can be moved anywhere along the stretch.

1209
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:59,863
Naturally, you want to put them in an area that is conducive to slowing traffic down, making sure that people have the visual aspect to see the sign.

1210
01:44:00,183 --> 01:44:07,425
So there are other arrangements why signs are put in certain locations that the traffic engineer is best suited to answer.

1211
01:44:07,945 --> 01:44:11,626
But some of these, Mr. President, we're all very familiar with this area.

1212
01:44:12,042 --> 01:44:18,049
I'm not sure why I couldn't go another 15 or 20 feet one way or another and not directly be in front of someone's home.

1213
01:44:18,409 --> 01:44:19,730
And that's the one on Forest Street.

1214
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:33,185
And the one on Highland, I would say, even though it's very thickly settled over there, there's gotta be a better way of locating that sign rather than just putting it on the front door of someone's home.

1215
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:43,852
So I would ask to, I agree with Councilor Scapelli, and I would second that motion that this be sent to the traffic engineer for a second review of these locations, Mr. President.

1216
01:44:53,914 --> 01:45:01,476
To our traffic engineer, seconded by Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1217
01:45:08,497 --> 01:45:09,097
Councilor Behrs.

1218
01:45:09,717 --> 01:45:09,977
Yes.

1219
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:11,798
Councilor Fevella.

1220
01:45:11,878 --> 01:45:12,138
Yes.

1221
01:45:12,878 --> 01:45:13,618
Vice President Knight.

1222
01:45:13,838 --> 01:45:14,058
Yes.

1223
01:45:14,698 --> 01:45:15,299
Councilor Marks.

1224
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:16,439
Yes.

1225
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:17,379
Councilor Morrell.

1226
01:45:17,779 --> 01:45:18,059
Yes.

1227
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:19,760
Councilor Scarpelli.

1228
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,200
Yes.

1229
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,100
President Kerrio.

1230
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,660
Yes, second the affirmative motion.

1231
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:25,001
Motion to revert back to regular business.

1232
01:45:25,021 --> 01:45:29,642
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1233
01:45:30,182 --> 01:45:31,322
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1234
01:45:35,943 --> 01:45:36,544
Councilor Behrs.

1235
01:45:37,764 --> 01:45:37,964
Yes.

1236
01:45:39,361 --> 01:45:39,921
Councilor.

1237
01:45:40,282 --> 01:45:40,542
Yes.

1238
01:45:42,243 --> 01:45:42,463
Yes.

1239
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:44,264
Yes.

1240
01:45:45,765 --> 01:45:46,005
Yes.

1241
01:45:47,647 --> 01:45:47,927
Yes.

1242
01:45:49,188 --> 01:45:49,388
Yes.

1243
01:45:49,408 --> 01:45:52,250
So the motion passes.

1244
01:45:52,550 --> 01:46:04,578
21192 offered by the entire council being resolved the Memphis City Council expressed a sincere condolences to the family of our city clerk Adam her to bees on the passing of his grandmother, Helen Winnie Mulligan.

1245
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:06,539
That's a problem.

1246
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:07,900
Thank you, President.

1247
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:20,766
Adam, I know your grandmother meant the world to you, and I just want to express our condolences to you and your family.

1248
01:46:20,786 --> 01:46:23,088
I know your grandmother, I believe she was 102, just about 102.

1249
01:46:23,128 --> 01:46:24,109
28 days away from 102.

1250
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:25,010
Just about 102.

1251
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:25,871
Okay, God bless her.

1252
01:46:30,947 --> 01:46:35,109
I know she had the opportunity, I think, to visit Medford a number of times.

1253
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:40,773
She lived in New York, and she made the trek a number of times.

1254
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:43,394
And I know she told me she enjoyed her time here.

1255
01:46:43,454 --> 01:46:51,899
And I know this is a tough time for you and your family, and my thoughts and prayers go to you and your family.

1256
01:46:52,219 --> 01:46:52,839
Thank you.

1257
01:46:52,879 --> 01:46:53,580
Thank you, Mr. Clark.

1258
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:56,902
All right.

1259
01:46:58,307 --> 01:47:00,828
Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for putting this on.

1260
01:47:02,129 --> 01:47:07,871
Been a rough week and I'm grateful for all your support and all your prayers and well wishes.

1261
01:47:08,652 --> 01:47:09,972
I've conveyed them all to my family.

1262
01:47:12,033 --> 01:47:16,655
We're overwhelmed with gratitude for all the support we've gotten from the city of Medford as well.

1263
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:21,877
Quick little story, my grandmother did things her way her whole life.

1264
01:47:23,038 --> 01:47:25,359
And she was 28 days shy of 102

1265
01:47:28,535 --> 01:47:32,137
She woke up last Monday and she called her own shop.

1266
01:47:32,397 --> 01:47:34,518
She said, I'm tired.

1267
01:47:34,958 --> 01:47:35,878
I want to stay in bed.

1268
01:47:36,979 --> 01:47:38,780
And she said a prayer and she left the building.

1269
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,961
And may we all be that lucky when it's our time.

1270
01:47:42,461 --> 01:47:43,762
So thank you all very much.

1271
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:45,202
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

1272
01:47:56,287 --> 01:47:57,708
Mr. Webb, please call the roll.

1273
01:48:03,105 --> 01:48:03,745
Councilor Behrs?

1274
01:48:04,726 --> 01:48:04,986
Yes.

1275
01:48:06,247 --> 01:48:07,268
Councilor Fevella?

1276
01:48:07,668 --> 01:48:07,929
Yes.

1277
01:48:08,589 --> 01:48:09,310
Vice President Knight?

1278
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:10,090
Yes.

1279
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:10,811
Councilor Marks?

1280
01:48:11,231 --> 01:48:11,611
Yes.

1281
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:12,672
Councilor Morrell?

1282
01:48:13,212 --> 01:48:13,473
Yes.

1283
01:48:14,794 --> 01:48:15,534
Councilor Scarpelli?

1284
01:48:15,574 --> 01:48:15,894
Yes.

1285
01:48:16,035 --> 01:48:16,755
President Kerrio?

1286
01:48:16,795 --> 01:48:18,596
Yes, that being the affirmative, motion passes.

1287
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:31,086
On the motion by

1288
01:48:31,762 --> 01:48:34,223
Vice President Knight to suspend the rules and take communication.

1289
01:48:35,524 --> 01:48:37,044
Seconded by Councilor Belco.

1290
01:48:37,124 --> 01:48:38,585
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1291
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:41,286
Councilor Behrs.

1292
01:48:42,406 --> 01:48:42,627
Yes.

1293
01:48:43,527 --> 01:48:44,207
Councilor Fevella.

1294
01:48:44,507 --> 01:48:44,827
Yes.

1295
01:48:44,968 --> 01:48:45,688
Vice President Knight.

1296
01:48:47,148 --> 01:48:47,449
Yes.

1297
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:48,869
Yes.

1298
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:50,550
Yes.

1299
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:52,991
Yes, affirmative motion passes.

1300
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:53,671
2-1-2-0-0.

1301
01:48:54,271 --> 01:49:00,414
Mr. President, city councils, I respectfully request to recommend that the city council authorize a permit

1302
01:49:00,804 --> 01:49:09,546
on the Massachusetts General Law Chapter 91, Section 10A, the Charles River Canoe and Kayak for the 2021 season.

1303
01:49:09,586 --> 01:49:13,086
Sincerely, Mayor Brian O'Connor.

1304
01:49:13,126 --> 01:49:15,507
We have Chief of Staff Rodriguez on the call.

1305
01:49:16,307 --> 01:49:20,307
Mr. Rodriguez, would you like to give a brief synopsis of this?

1306
01:49:20,347 --> 01:49:29,589
Okay, are we gonna unmute, Dave?

1307
01:49:31,655 --> 01:49:32,456
Good evening, Mr. President.

1308
01:49:32,476 --> 01:49:33,136
Thank you very much.

1309
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:45,585
Yeah, this petition was placed upon at request of Paddle Boston as part of the regular operations that they do down on Mystic River, down by the shell.

1310
01:49:46,426 --> 01:49:47,867
So we just put it on at their request.

1311
01:49:48,327 --> 01:49:56,433
I believe somebody from Paddle Boston may be on the call, I'm not sure, but I'll defer to them as to the details of their programming and their operation moving forward.

1312
01:49:57,634 --> 01:49:57,955
Thank you.

1313
01:49:58,335 --> 01:49:58,995
Councilor Scott Belli.

1314
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:14,613
I just reviewed chapter 91, section 10A, and it says that the permitting authority would be the Harbormaster, not the council.

1315
01:50:15,073 --> 01:50:20,095
I don't recall previously approving this in the past when they were in.

1316
01:50:20,215 --> 01:50:24,858
I think we did a couple of years ago, but I don't think we have a Harbormaster anymore.

1317
01:50:25,398 --> 01:50:26,799
We don't currently have a Harbormaster, no.

1318
01:50:32,241 --> 01:50:35,603
I think I do recall this being brought up a couple of years ago.

1319
01:50:35,644 --> 01:50:39,767
I don't know if it was brought up last year, but it has been brought up in the past.

1320
01:50:41,288 --> 01:50:45,912
So I mean, I just want to make sure we pass the smell test that we're doing it right, Mr. President.

1321
01:50:45,952 --> 01:50:50,155
If the statute says we need to have the harbor masturbation permit, the harbor masturbation permit, not us.

1322
01:50:50,175 --> 01:50:52,016
That's the only thing that I was concerned about.

1323
01:50:52,056 --> 01:50:54,659
Point of information.

1324
01:50:54,939 --> 01:50:56,500
Is this the second time that they're applying?

1325
01:50:57,181 --> 01:50:59,903
Are these the same people that were here last year?

1326
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:02,630
I believe it is, yes.

1327
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:05,171
Yeah, they've been here a few years now.

1328
01:51:06,491 --> 01:51:06,911
I don't remember.

1329
01:51:07,811 --> 01:51:12,592
I do remember maybe two years ago approving it.

1330
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:15,893
I think 2019 is what I think I remember it coming before us.

1331
01:51:16,273 --> 01:51:16,853
Mr. President?

1332
01:51:17,613 --> 01:51:18,153
Council Marks.

1333
01:51:18,853 --> 01:51:30,295
If I could, just because I know time is of the essence with these particular companies, that if we approve this contingent upon whether or not the council has the statutory authority

1334
01:51:31,023 --> 01:51:31,623
to approve it.

1335
01:51:32,244 --> 01:51:33,804
And if we do, then fine.

1336
01:51:33,844 --> 01:51:36,125
If not, they'll have to revisit.

1337
01:51:36,265 --> 01:51:38,266
City administration will have to revisit it.

1338
01:51:38,906 --> 01:51:39,107
Thank you.

1339
01:51:39,807 --> 01:51:43,228
That's about it.

1340
01:51:43,428 --> 01:51:45,489
We're going to be hiring a Habermaster, David.

1341
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:48,431
I mean, it existed before.

1342
01:51:52,713 --> 01:51:53,754
They are tough to find.

1343
01:51:54,495 --> 01:51:58,398
So they aren't so easy as just designating someone that they do are.

1344
01:51:58,498 --> 01:52:05,904
There are certain requirements that are required for our master, including a captain's license and I believe a reserve, at least a reserve police academy.

1345
01:52:06,524 --> 01:52:08,666
So the two, yeah, they're tough to find.

1346
01:52:08,686 --> 01:52:15,131
Okay, I mean, is the city required to have a harbor master?

1347
01:52:15,151 --> 01:52:16,733
We have a river that cuts right through here.

1348
01:52:16,753 --> 01:52:19,435
So I would think maybe we should have one.

1349
01:52:20,622 --> 01:52:21,162
I don't know.

1350
01:52:21,262 --> 01:52:23,523
Is the administration exploring that option?

1351
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,263
We've spoken about it.

1352
01:52:25,983 --> 01:52:33,425
We haven't actively explored adding a harbormaster or designating someone as of yet, but we have talked about it with the chief of police and kind of how that's gonna work.

1353
01:52:34,825 --> 01:52:39,987
It hasn't been a subject of in-depth discussions, no.

1354
01:52:40,187 --> 01:52:46,848
Either way, I think that the council would need to issue a special permit on it, regardless of whether or not the harbormaster does, because it's a recreational use.

1355
01:52:47,328 --> 01:52:49,329
It's a private entity.

1356
01:52:50,692 --> 01:52:52,173
public consumption.

1357
01:52:52,233 --> 01:52:54,555
So the council needs to issue a special permit on anyway.

1358
01:52:54,995 --> 01:53:04,423
I just wanted to be sure that the Habermas, because all the appeals and the statutes say that the appeal of the Habermas decision to the state and the state makes a ruling on the Habermas decision.

1359
01:53:05,243 --> 01:53:08,666
I certainly have no problem with, you know, the kayaks down there.

1360
01:53:08,706 --> 01:53:09,407
I live in the neighborhood.

1361
01:53:09,427 --> 01:53:12,309
It's not something that I utilize actually.

1362
01:53:12,409 --> 01:53:19,234
I think councilor Mark suggested that we could approve it and look into, have the solicitor look into

1363
01:53:20,509 --> 01:53:25,650
continue on the solicitor, giving her a fool that seemed that we don't have a harbormaster.

1364
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:26,970
Mr. President.

1365
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:41,753
Yeah, just I just wanted to add clarity that section 10 A says the harbormaster of a city or town or whomsoever is so empowered by the said city or town may authorize by permit.

1366
01:53:41,813 --> 01:53:46,014
So it does allow another entity other than the harbormaster.

1367
01:53:47,183 --> 01:53:49,185
Point of information, Mr. President.

1368
01:53:49,345 --> 01:53:55,950
Should legislative action have been enacted to appoint somebody other than the harbormaster to do it, where the city's had a harbormaster for, I can't tell you how many years.

1369
01:53:56,190 --> 01:54:04,557
I don't think there's any legislative action that exists that would have been taken to authorize that authority to anybody else under the city ordinance.

1370
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:06,258
No, thank you.

1371
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:12,723
I think this is a discussion that I think that's needed, especially when you're talking about the city by the mystic.

1372
01:54:14,545 --> 01:54:23,573
I think that my discussion is more with the chief of staff, and I know that Paddle Boston has been a great partner with neighboring communities.

1373
01:54:24,354 --> 01:54:38,948
And there's often a partnership that you see with Paddle Boston, with different recreation departments that we look to enhance our waterways as we work in partnership with these

1374
01:54:39,516 --> 01:54:41,596
these for profit organizations.

1375
01:54:41,636 --> 01:54:48,798
So what I'm asked what I'd like to ask the chief is, is they just paying a permit fee or is there a partner fee?

1376
01:54:48,858 --> 01:54:56,180
Is there something that we're in partnership with paddle bosses just kind of awesome looking for a permit to use our parking lot.

1377
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,460
It's just a permit.

1378
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:03,201
There's no there's no agreement in place that would provide any ancillary benefit back to the town.

1379
01:55:04,561 --> 01:55:05,322
It would be great.

1380
01:55:05,402 --> 01:55:06,802
I think that this would be a great

1381
01:55:07,403 --> 01:55:14,027
time to capture a need that we have in our community with an excellent organization of Paddle Boston.

1382
01:55:14,547 --> 01:55:19,409
I know that different organizations like General Giant, Paddle Boston work with different communities.

1383
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:29,175
We look at our probably our most growing high school sport right now and activity when you're talking about waterways and rowing and our

1384
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:36,652
our dock that's at the Hormel site, and trying to work together.

1385
01:55:36,692 --> 01:55:43,920
I'd like to see if there can be a partnership with Recreation Paddle Blossom City of Medford that we could set up some kind of a

1386
01:55:44,525 --> 01:55:54,030
financial assistance where monies that are created could help enhance that docking system to help our residents of Medford.

1387
01:55:54,070 --> 01:56:14,020
I know it's a great benefit and it's amazing for our community, but I think whenever we offer a permit for a for-profit organization to come into the community and ask for a permit, I think that in good faith, there might be some way that we can work together to try to capture some funding to help

1388
01:56:15,388 --> 01:56:16,849
our own programs.

1389
01:56:17,409 --> 01:56:20,771
And again, I know it's a business, but so are we.

1390
01:56:20,952 --> 01:56:41,186
And a permit is, I'll support a permit tonight, but I think that if there's a good faith discussion with someone say from paddle Boston, that maybe they can work with our athletic director who works amazingly with different organizations to try to enhance what we have and using our waterways to for profit.

1391
01:56:41,286 --> 01:56:41,706
I think that

1392
01:56:42,778 --> 01:56:44,358
Just a permit just isn't enough for me.

1393
01:56:44,398 --> 01:57:10,283
I'd like to see some, maybe some commitment that we're using these areas to not only provide a service, but it's also maybe to grow with it and maybe have another stop down the line closer to Hormel where, you know, they have maybe a few locations, but also use Paddle Boston to help our rowing program

1394
01:57:12,612 --> 01:57:13,473
recreation program.

1395
01:57:13,753 --> 01:57:14,093
Thank you.

1396
01:57:14,373 --> 01:57:15,214
Thank you.

1397
01:57:15,874 --> 01:57:16,895
Any further discussion on this?

1398
01:57:19,436 --> 01:57:22,518
I don't see anybody from pedal Boston.

1399
01:57:22,538 --> 01:57:26,481
Are they, is it someone on the call here from pedal Boston?

1400
01:57:29,222 --> 01:57:31,384
I don't see anybody on my screen unless.

1401
01:57:31,404 --> 01:57:33,385
I don't see anyone.

1402
01:57:40,877 --> 01:57:45,419
There's nobody here from paddle Boston, but I can see someone seeing a different screen tonight.

1403
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:46,699
Okay, so then I'd make a motion.

1404
01:57:48,140 --> 01:58:04,286
So make a motion that we work with the recreation department with the city administration to work with paddle Boston, and trying to find maybe a common partnership that would help support our rowing organization and

1405
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,733
Again, if they're going to use our- You want to amend the paper?

1406
01:58:07,753 --> 01:58:08,694
I'd like to amend the paper.

1407
01:58:08,754 --> 01:58:16,098
Again, if they're using our waterways and using our land for profit, there should be something more and it's just going to permit.

1408
01:58:16,118 --> 01:58:22,663
So I'd appreciate that, you know, just something to enhance it, not to take it away, but to enhance it.

1409
01:58:22,683 --> 01:58:24,124
So thank you.

1410
01:58:24,144 --> 01:58:24,744
Second.

1411
01:58:25,384 --> 01:58:28,767
I have one question, Dave.

1412
01:58:29,227 --> 01:58:29,707
It's amendment.

1413
01:58:30,428 --> 01:58:32,349
Dave, I have one question and this is something

1414
01:58:32,873 --> 01:58:48,219
I've had on the agenda for the past couple of years, in the area where they launched their kayaks and canoes, there's some trees that are in the water, sticking out, especially right by the shallow.

1415
01:58:48,679 --> 01:58:56,842
That tree has fallen down, it's been there for about three years, and right up the turn, right by the Karate Bridge, there's some pretty serious logs sticking out there.

1416
01:58:56,942 --> 01:59:01,704
If you could use your authority and reach out to the DCR, if they can clean up those

1417
01:59:02,682 --> 01:59:04,243
those large logs that are there.

1418
01:59:05,424 --> 01:59:11,529
So again, these paddlers and these canoes are very popular during the season.

1419
01:59:12,330 --> 01:59:15,632
I'd hate to see someone hit one of them and get hurt.

1420
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:24,579
So if you can reach out to the DCI to get those trees out of there that are in the water, we'd greatly appreciate it.

1421
01:59:24,779 --> 01:59:27,782
Yeah, that's easy.

1422
01:59:28,402 --> 01:59:29,003
Yes, Mr. President.

1423
01:59:31,156 --> 01:59:34,257
Okay, so on the motion by vice president.

1424
01:59:34,517 --> 01:59:40,799
Yes, I was just wondering what the term of the permit was in terms of from when to when?

1425
01:59:45,201 --> 01:59:46,121
Dave, the term of the permit?

1426
01:59:47,042 --> 01:59:53,544
Yeah, it was placed on for the 2021 season, which we, once the kayaking season is over, the permit would expire.

1427
01:59:55,725 --> 01:59:56,185
And what's the fee?

1428
01:59:58,668 --> 02:00:02,169
There was no fee established within the permit request.

1429
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:11,253
So do soccer clubs have to get a fee to go to the park so they pay guys who run an operating game pool business with no permitting fee?

1430
02:00:11,873 --> 02:00:13,934
Well, there was no fee established under 10A.

1431
02:00:13,954 --> 02:00:17,255
That's the only thing that we were looking at.

1432
02:00:17,295 --> 02:00:17,775
Mr. President.

1433
02:00:18,615 --> 02:00:19,896
That's not on land either, right?

1434
02:00:19,976 --> 02:00:22,657
Council Meeks.

1435
02:00:25,693 --> 02:00:34,057
I just wanted to also, if the record can reflect if there's any liability waiver form signed as well.

1436
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:40,000
Okay.

1437
02:00:40,801 --> 02:00:41,581
Any further discussion?

1438
02:00:41,721 --> 02:00:45,183
So do we know when the kayaking season commences and concludes?

1439
02:00:46,644 --> 02:00:49,305
Dave, do you know when the kayaking season starts?

1440
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:50,861
I believe it's weather dependent.

1441
02:00:51,501 --> 02:00:55,902
So I was relying on paddle boss and be able to provide these details.

1442
02:00:55,962 --> 02:01:00,804
And they, I was told they will be on the call this evening, but I'll follow up with them and make sure that they can get these details over to you.

1443
02:01:00,864 --> 02:01:02,304
I don't know.

1444
02:01:02,324 --> 02:01:03,104
I appreciate it.

1445
02:01:03,124 --> 02:01:03,264
Yeah.

1446
02:01:03,724 --> 02:01:08,585
In essence, we could be given them a nine month or a 10 month permit to operate, right.

1447
02:01:09,466 --> 02:01:11,186
It's probably probably four or five months, six months.

1448
02:01:11,206 --> 02:01:11,466
I don't know.

1449
02:01:11,486 --> 02:01:12,426
It could be, but yeah.

1450
02:01:12,526 --> 02:01:13,807
You know, we don't define the parameters.

1451
02:01:13,927 --> 02:01:14,387
Yeah.

1452
02:01:14,427 --> 02:01:14,587
Yeah.

1453
02:01:14,647 --> 02:01:19,668
If you can get us the perimeter of what the season is, then yeah.

1454
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:22,532
Do you want to table it, Joe?

1455
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:25,634
I mean, I think they provide a benefit.

1456
02:01:25,734 --> 02:01:28,536
I personally, I think they provide a benefit to the community, the service they provide.

1457
02:01:28,556 --> 02:01:34,541
I'd like to see a little bit back to the community based upon what they're earning.

1458
02:01:34,601 --> 02:01:40,005
But at the same time, I know it's something that people love and it's something that I don't have a problem having in the community.

1459
02:01:40,486 --> 02:01:42,807
Okay, Joe, do we have a motion on the floor?

1460
02:01:44,469 --> 02:01:49,853
Motion of approval based on the contingency, Mr. President.

1461
02:01:50,335 --> 02:01:51,215
that I raised earlier.

1462
02:01:51,415 --> 02:01:51,595
Yeah.

1463
02:01:52,135 --> 02:01:56,476
So if we're the statutory authority of approval, if not, the administration.

1464
02:01:56,956 --> 02:02:11,158
So on the motion by Council Marks, as amended by Councilor Scott Kelly, as amended by person care of yellow, and as amended by Council Marks, seconded by second by Council Scott Kelly, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1465
02:02:16,339 --> 02:02:16,919
Council bears.

1466
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:17,960
Yes.

1467
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,680
Councilor Falco.

1468
02:02:20,794 --> 02:02:21,454
Vice President Knight.

1469
02:02:21,554 --> 02:02:21,855
Yes.

1470
02:02:22,155 --> 02:02:22,735
Councilor Marks.

1471
02:02:23,155 --> 02:02:23,455
Yes.

1472
02:02:23,796 --> 02:02:24,416
Councilor Morrell.

1473
02:02:24,876 --> 02:02:25,116
Yes.

1474
02:02:25,977 --> 02:02:26,737
Councilor Scarpelli.

1475
02:02:27,077 --> 02:02:27,377
Yes.

1476
02:02:27,537 --> 02:02:28,298
President Kerrio.

1477
02:02:28,478 --> 02:02:30,039
Yes, seven affirmative motion pass.

1478
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:31,900
Motion to revert back to regular business.

1479
02:02:35,521 --> 02:02:35,902
Second.

1480
02:02:37,302 --> 02:02:40,164
By Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falcone.

1481
02:02:40,204 --> 02:02:41,224
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1482
02:02:43,926 --> 02:02:44,466
Councilor Behrs.

1483
02:02:44,986 --> 02:02:45,246
Yes.

1484
02:02:46,107 --> 02:02:46,787
Councilor Falcone.

1485
02:02:46,987 --> 02:02:47,227
Yes.

1486
02:02:47,928 --> 02:02:48,568
Vice President Knight.

1487
02:02:49,164 --> 02:02:49,744
Councilor Marks?

1488
02:02:50,045 --> 02:02:50,365
Yes.

1489
02:02:50,665 --> 02:02:51,285
Councilor Morrell?

1490
02:02:51,745 --> 02:02:51,986
Yes.

1491
02:02:52,886 --> 02:02:53,666
Councilor Scarpelli?

1492
02:02:54,047 --> 02:02:54,267
Yes.

1493
02:02:54,427 --> 02:02:55,187
President Kerrio?

1494
02:02:55,427 --> 02:02:57,409
Yes, I'm in favor of the motion passes.

1495
02:02:57,429 --> 02:03:06,414
2-1-1-9-3 offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the City of Medford's Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee upcoming hearing on March 31st at 6 p.m.

1496
02:03:06,474 --> 02:03:13,037
to consider Verizon's 5G applications for the placement of small cell telecommunications rooms throughout the city be discussed.

1497
02:03:13,057 --> 02:03:13,637
Councilor Marks?

1498
02:03:14,718 --> 02:03:15,739
Thank you, Mr. President.

1499
02:03:15,979 --> 02:03:18,120
And I put this on the agenda tonight

1500
02:03:19,072 --> 02:03:32,207
This has been close to a two-year process when we were first presented by Verizon applications to erect small cell towers within the community.

1501
02:03:34,389 --> 02:03:38,894
I put this on first to raise public awareness.

1502
02:03:39,765 --> 02:03:54,317
Secondly, to inform residents of the practice and the policy of the city of Method regarding small cell placements and to address concerns that have been raised.

1503
02:03:54,337 --> 02:04:06,187
I'm sure we all received them by residents of this community regarding the public health concerns from exposure to radio frequency, Mr. President.

1504
02:04:07,288 --> 02:04:08,789
And I've read enough information

1505
02:04:09,353 --> 02:04:21,220
on both sides that I've come to the conclusion I still can't figure out whether or not it is a health concern based on everything I read.

1506
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:37,409
But I think there's enough information there that would raise a red flag, Mr. President, and residents that may be in close proximity to these particular 44 sites that is the first round of applications by Verizon

1507
02:04:38,437 --> 02:04:39,758
should be asking questions.

1508
02:04:40,418 --> 02:04:45,039
So that's why I'm raising this tonight, Mr. President, not to take a stance one way or another.

1509
02:04:45,480 --> 02:05:01,705
So the City of Method Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will be having a hearing to consider Verizon's application for placement of a small cell telecommunication or 5G equipment on utility poles in the City of Method Wednesday, March 31st at 6 p.m.

1510
02:05:02,145 --> 02:05:02,845
via Zoom.

1511
02:05:03,406 --> 02:05:06,247
The ID number, if people are interested, is 933

1512
02:05:09,269 --> 02:05:10,329
7697-5064.

1513
02:05:12,231 --> 02:05:17,495
So if you're able to get on Zoom, that is the ID that you plug in.

1514
02:05:17,955 --> 02:05:19,256
And the passcode is 035999.

1515
02:05:20,177 --> 02:05:30,284
There's also a call in number if you don't have the ability to get on the internet, you can dial in at 929-205-6099.

1516
02:05:36,573 --> 02:05:59,669
And according to the memo that was sent out by the administration, if you're unable to attend the meeting and would like to express your thoughts about the application or the application process, please email 5Gcomments at medford-ma.gov.

1517
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:05,393
And they didn't put this, but I'm also gonna add, or if you don't have access,

1518
02:06:06,038 --> 02:06:07,460
please call the mayor's office.

1519
02:06:08,241 --> 02:06:12,847
Just a point of clarification for the 5G, is that the digit five or the word five?

1520
02:06:13,288 --> 02:06:15,111
It is the digit five, thank you for that.

1521
02:06:16,252 --> 02:06:17,874
The digit 5G comments.

1522
02:06:20,278 --> 02:06:23,202
And you can also call the mayor's office to express your opinion.

1523
02:06:23,902 --> 02:06:30,828
It's also important to know this advisory committee that was created by the previous administration.

1524
02:06:30,868 --> 02:06:44,438
This ad hoc committee consists of Alicia Hunt, the Director of Office of Community Development, Tim McGiven, the Director of Engineering, Paul Mulkey, the Building Commissioner, and Mary Ann O'Connor, Board of Health Director.

1525
02:06:44,898 --> 02:06:51,964
So they are the four department heads that sit on this ad hoc advisory committee.

1526
02:06:52,670 --> 02:07:01,052
The interim policy was created by the previous administration based on the fact that the city did not have an ordinance to govern this.

1527
02:07:01,973 --> 02:07:05,414
And the Verizon applications were before us.

1528
02:07:05,894 --> 02:07:11,215
According to the FCC, there are time restrictions that a community has to act.

1529
02:07:11,896 --> 02:07:20,138
And I believe at the time, it was thought that an interim policy was the best approach until the city creates a full blown

1530
02:07:21,313 --> 02:07:30,997
ordinance that would govern the application process and the selection criteria and so forth of these 5G applications.

1531
02:07:31,938 --> 02:07:37,800
So if I could, Mr. President, I would just ask that you indulge me for a little bit.

1532
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:44,003
There were some, I went through the 44 applications that are on the city website.

1533
02:07:44,463 --> 02:07:46,604
I have several questions.

1534
02:07:47,264 --> 02:07:49,805
The meeting is a week from tomorrow.

1535
02:07:50,363 --> 02:07:56,528
which is the 31st, so residents that are interested really need to do their homework prior to the meeting.

1536
02:07:57,068 --> 02:08:06,995
But the application process, the applicant is responsible for obtaining the abutters list within 300 feet of each poll location within the application.

1537
02:08:07,556 --> 02:08:18,424
If you recall in 2019, I think many of the councils were here, we put out five recommendations regarding the mayor's interim policy that was created.

1538
02:08:19,123 --> 02:08:25,885
One of the recommendations was to expand the 300 feet notification to 500 feet.

1539
02:08:27,005 --> 02:08:38,348
That was voted, I believe, unanimously by the council back in 2019, October 29th, 2019, but it never made it into the mayor's interim policy.

1540
02:08:38,928 --> 02:08:44,970
So as way of an amendment, I would just like to ask that this administration

1541
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:51,521
add that to the interim policy that we notify about us up to 500 feet.

1542
02:08:51,961 --> 02:08:58,362
I think the additional notification will help ease concern in the neighborhood and concern of residents.

1543
02:09:00,343 --> 02:09:11,385
We also voted, Mr. President, this was unanimous by the council, that an amendment requesting that the policy of no public hearings take place before 6 p.m.

1544
02:09:12,305 --> 02:09:13,185
If we all recall,

1545
02:09:14,190 --> 02:09:22,353
The first original hearing was going to be held at two o'clock and there was outrage throughout the community for people working and so forth.

1546
02:09:22,393 --> 02:09:32,638
This was a time when prior to COVID and many residents said that's outrageous that you'd have a public meeting at two o'clock during the day when a lot of residents couldn't make it.

1547
02:09:33,948 --> 02:09:38,172
So we asked that no meeting take place after six, no, before six.

1548
02:09:39,273 --> 02:09:41,916
This meeting, I think, has called for six o'clock.

1549
02:09:42,737 --> 02:09:49,564
However, the policy still does not state that no meeting take place or hearing prior to 6 p.m.

1550
02:09:49,884 --> 02:09:57,552
And I would ask that be the second resolution, once again, asking this administration to address that within the interim policy.

1551
02:09:59,171 --> 02:10:13,919
We ask that copies of the plans be available on the city website for each petition, and I'm proud to say that is currently happening, and that was a request of this city council, and that is currently happening.

1552
02:10:14,519 --> 02:10:25,244
And we also offer the request that the abutments be expanded to 500 feet, and that correspondence come from the city,

1553
02:10:25,774 --> 02:10:27,115
and not the utility company.

1554
02:10:27,615 --> 02:10:31,516
The original letter that went out was directly from the utility company.

1555
02:10:31,996 --> 02:10:36,158
And if members recall, there was a lot of information missing on that.

1556
02:10:36,538 --> 02:10:43,000
The exact location and other information, contact information was missing on that.

1557
02:10:43,741 --> 02:10:48,903
And that Mr. President was never added to the policy as well.

1558
02:10:49,243 --> 02:10:55,125
And I would ask that as a third amendment that this correspondence moving forward

1559
02:10:55,729 --> 02:11:01,912
from the city of Method, which I hope that's the policy, but I think it is important enough to add into the interim policy.

1560
02:11:02,332 --> 02:11:04,733
And the last one was offered by Councillor Scott Pelley.

1561
02:11:05,433 --> 02:11:12,896
He offered an amendment requiring contact information for utility companies on all notices.

1562
02:11:13,576 --> 02:11:20,039
And as we know, the first notice that went out, there was zero contact information just stating that they're going to have a

1563
02:11:21,083 --> 02:11:27,347
a small cell tower at a particular location, and that was never added to the policy.

1564
02:11:27,708 --> 02:11:39,497
So I would ask that that be added as an additional amendment that requires contact information for the utility on all notices that go out from the city.

1565
02:11:42,219 --> 02:11:48,423
So Mr. President, upon completion of the hearing, which is going to take place on the 31st,

1566
02:11:49,630 --> 02:11:54,232
The ad hoc small cell committee may grant the application.

1567
02:11:55,132 --> 02:12:16,940
They can grant it with conditions or deny the application based on inadequate capacity of the pole or mounting structure, safety concerns, reliability concerns, failure to meet... As well as the construction and placement of structures.

1568
02:12:17,525 --> 02:12:25,350
that affect the installation of the primary use of the pole, residential concerns, and aesthetic considerations.

1569
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:37,599
So those are all the reasons that the small cell committee has to take into consideration, and I'm happy to see residential concerns are on the list.

1570
02:12:38,899 --> 02:12:47,065
The city of Method is particularly sensitive to the visual impacts of small cell wireless infrastructures, therefore it shall implement and impose

1571
02:12:47,578 --> 02:13:12,970
on an interim basis, reasonable aesthetic standards pertaining to the size of the antenna, the equipment box, and or related cabling, placement of equipment on support structures, establishing flush mounting requirements and spacing requirements, and aesthetic measures such as paint matching or design matching for small wireless facilities in specific areas.

1572
02:13:13,944 --> 02:13:30,136
camouflage and other concealment methods, and for residential areas, guidelines on structures, heights and lengths, and minimum setbacks, rules for dwellings, parks, playgrounds, or similar recreational areas.

1573
02:13:30,956 --> 02:13:35,820
So I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, what are the minimum setback rules?

1574
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:43,025
The policy does not talk about minimum setback rules for dwellings, parks, playgrounds,

1575
02:13:43,586 --> 02:13:46,148
or similar recreational areas.

1576
02:13:47,509 --> 02:14:05,842
And I call that out, Mr. President, because part of the reporting that Verizon has to do, part of the reporting package, and it's voluminous, there's a lot of requests, is that when they select a location, there has to be criteria why they selected that pole.

1577
02:14:06,522 --> 02:14:09,905
There's thousands of poles in the city, why did you select that pole?

1578
02:14:10,885 --> 02:14:17,554
And the one I pulled up from George Street, like I said, there were 44 applicants on that for all different locations.

1579
02:14:18,495 --> 02:14:21,479
The one I pulled up was the poll located at 50 George Street.

1580
02:14:22,187 --> 02:14:25,308
And Verizon came out with this as their selection criteria.

1581
02:14:25,908 --> 02:14:37,971
It says it's superior to other locations, given that it is set in a heavily trafficked area for the purpose to increase the bandwidth and cellular quality of Verizon network devices in the vicinity.

1582
02:14:38,691 --> 02:14:41,131
The location itself is set in the public right of way.

1583
02:14:41,651 --> 02:14:44,372
This location was not only chosen for its compliance

1584
02:14:44,715 --> 02:15:03,060
with Verizon Wireless and National Grid requirements, but respect to the municipality's desire for co-locations on existing structures, and it is not directly adjacent to a park, school, or playground.

1585
02:15:05,761 --> 02:15:13,303
I might be mistaken, Mr. President, but our requirement says proximity to residential dwellings, school, parks, or playgrounds.

1586
02:15:14,027 --> 02:15:16,428
So they omitted residential dwellings.

1587
02:15:17,628 --> 02:15:17,948
Why?

1588
02:15:18,889 --> 02:15:35,895
Because many of these 44 poles, these new towers, are all within 20, 30 yards of bedrooms, dining rooms, kitchens, front yards, play areas next to homes, porches.

1589
02:15:37,575 --> 02:15:43,077
So I'm curious, Mr. President, I would offer this as an amendment

1590
02:15:45,002 --> 02:16:03,249
Why in the location selection criteria from Verizon, and I assume this is the case on all 44 applicants, but in particular for 50 George Street, why did they omit this as a chosen location and not include the proximity to residential dwellings?

1591
02:16:05,570 --> 02:16:09,391
So that's another amendment I'd like to add, Mr. President.

1592
02:16:10,071 --> 02:16:14,013
And that is missing from our criteria, which is in

1593
02:16:15,636 --> 02:16:16,676
our interim policy.

1594
02:16:18,397 --> 02:16:42,144
And that's an important criteria, Mr. President, because as I'll state a little further down, there are reports out there, and I have several of them in front of me, Mr. President, that talk about the potential exposure and the risk for pregnant women, children, elderly, individuals that may have implants,

1595
02:16:42,814 --> 02:16:47,717
or cardiac concerns, Mr. President, or neurological problems.

1596
02:16:48,198 --> 02:16:51,320
There may be concerns, Mr. President, with exposure.

1597
02:16:52,801 --> 02:17:10,833
And the fact, Mr. President, that 5G, much of the information over the last 20 years, a robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radio frequency microwave radiation.

1598
02:17:11,382 --> 02:17:22,449
including clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, reproductive effects, and microwave sickness, Mr. President.

1599
02:17:23,790 --> 02:17:26,652
All affecting the individuals that I spoke about.

1600
02:17:27,772 --> 02:17:40,220
And human exposure guidelines for radio frequency microwave radiation used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and addressed only thermal,

1601
02:17:41,065 --> 02:17:43,206
not biological impacts of exposure.

1602
02:17:44,746 --> 02:17:49,187
So that also, Mr. President, is another concern that's out there.

1603
02:17:50,008 --> 02:18:01,691
And I raise this, Mr. President, on behalf of residents that may feel that their voice doesn't count, may feel that they don't have input on this and it's a done deal.

1604
02:18:02,531 --> 02:18:05,292
And I wanna raise awareness, Mr. President,

1605
02:18:05,730 --> 02:18:19,900
where many of these small cell towers will be located, like I said, within 20, 30, 40 yards of homes, bedrooms, porches, and where our families congregate, Mr. President.

1606
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,501
And that's very concerning for me.

1607
02:18:24,903 --> 02:18:30,006
These polls, Mr. President, they talk about cooling fans in residential areas.

1608
02:18:30,427 --> 02:18:33,889
The small wireless facility operator permittee

1609
02:18:34,232 --> 02:18:36,093
shall use a passive cooling system.

1610
02:18:36,813 --> 02:18:47,158
In the event that a fan is needed, the small cell wireless facility operator, permittee, shall use cooling fans with low noise profiles.

1611
02:18:48,919 --> 02:18:52,221
So we all know what that means, low noise profile.

1612
02:18:52,781 --> 02:18:54,762
So they're saying, don't worry about the noise.

1613
02:18:55,582 --> 02:19:01,225
Whatever we do is going to be permittable by whatever standards that are out there, Mr. President.

1614
02:19:01,825 --> 02:19:02,926
But I can guarantee you,

1615
02:19:03,499 --> 02:19:16,829
If you lived within 20, 30 yards of this, and you had your window open in July and August and June, that these low noise profile cooling fans may not be as low as you think.

1616
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:27,237
So also, it's a concern of a public nuisance, Mr. President, or I should say a potential concern of public nuisance.

1617
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:45,472
As I allude to the description and the location of these polls say that the community perspective, including visual aspects and proximity to residential dwellings, schools and parks shall be taken into consideration.

1618
02:19:46,073 --> 02:19:53,558
And I hope when our four members get together, the department heads, that that truly is taken into consideration.

1619
02:19:54,019 --> 02:19:56,541
Another aspect of this, Mr. President is

1620
02:19:57,841 --> 02:20:15,947
The petitioner is required to present a written plan indicating the protocol for turning off wireless facilities when utility workers are present on poles in order to limit their exposure to radio frequency emissions.

1621
02:20:16,647 --> 02:20:25,510
The plan should also include a description of any warning signs that will be posted to alert utility workers to radio frequency exposure.

1622
02:20:26,498 --> 02:20:39,188
So this safeguards any utility workers that are going to happen to stumble upon this poll to alert them, hey, we have high radio frequency exposure on this poll.

1623
02:20:39,649 --> 02:20:43,452
My concern, Mr. President, I put this in the form of a motion, as you know,

1624
02:20:44,510 --> 02:20:49,694
The city of Method now owns many of the streetlights, if not all of them, throughout the community.

1625
02:20:50,035 --> 02:20:55,619
There's thousands of them, and there's reasons for our electrical department to be up.

1626
02:20:55,939 --> 02:21:05,066
I know we subcontract the service, but there are reasons for our electrical department to be up around the radio frequency and get exposure, Mr. President.

1627
02:21:05,387 --> 02:21:13,353
And what safeguards do we have, Mr. President, for our city employees for exposure?

1628
02:21:13,869 --> 02:21:26,632
So that is in the form of a motion, Mr. President, to see what safeguards the city has on this, and not just what Verizon is doing for utility workers, but for our city workers.

1629
02:21:27,452 --> 02:21:37,194
And then there should be a written plan indicating the response protocol to be implemented in the event that the equipment is damaged by weather-related event or due to an accident.

1630
02:21:38,114 --> 02:21:41,415
So I think it shows you the serious nature of this equipment

1631
02:21:42,086 --> 02:21:47,268
and the reason why there's protocol set up around it, Mr. President, which is a good thing.

1632
02:21:48,908 --> 02:21:52,109
Then it goes on the interim policy to talk about prohibitions.

1633
02:21:52,929 --> 02:22:02,052
And it says no small cell wireless installation shall be installed on poles that do not meet sidewalk clearance requirements and standards.

1634
02:22:02,492 --> 02:22:07,014
This includes horizontal and vertical clearances for pedestrian passage.

1635
02:22:07,754 --> 02:22:11,575
Applicable requirements and standards may include but are not limited to

1636
02:22:12,418 --> 02:22:14,619
ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act.

1637
02:22:15,319 --> 02:22:23,061
So my other motion, Mr. President, is that has this been reviewed by the city?

1638
02:22:23,821 --> 02:22:34,344
So prior to having a hearing, is the city going out to these sites and making sure that it follows the prohibitions that are set forth for clearance requirements

1639
02:22:35,482 --> 02:22:37,462
according to the city standards.

1640
02:22:38,143 --> 02:22:50,285
If not, Mr. President, why are we wasting time notifying residents if this is not falling under the clearance standards that are already set forth by the city?

1641
02:22:51,185 --> 02:23:02,927
We're sending out notification, we're alarming residents, and then at the hearing, if they turn around and say, sorry, this doesn't meet the city clearance requirements for sidewalks, then we've wasted everyone's time.

1642
02:23:03,943 --> 02:23:09,848
And I think we should do our due diligence prior to that, Mr. President.

1643
02:23:10,768 --> 02:23:19,215
And last but not least, and I appreciate my colleagues indulging me on this, but it is an important issue.

1644
02:23:19,295 --> 02:23:20,376
It's been around two years.

1645
02:23:20,816 --> 02:23:21,897
Now it's coming to a head.

1646
02:23:22,358 --> 02:23:23,739
Verizon put us on notice.

1647
02:23:24,379 --> 02:23:27,602
They threatened legal action against the city of Method.

1648
02:23:28,342 --> 02:23:31,645
So now we're on notice, and that's why the city is moving forward now.

1649
02:23:32,325 --> 02:23:36,827
But the call that went out to the community was a good call.

1650
02:23:37,167 --> 02:23:38,267
It notified residents.

1651
02:23:38,347 --> 02:23:41,348
I am appreciative the administration did that.

1652
02:23:41,808 --> 02:23:52,552
I assume letters going out to property owners within the 300 feet, we asked 500, but within the 300 feet about us we'll get more direct information.

1653
02:23:53,112 --> 02:24:00,215
But Mr. President, I as one member of the council was eager to find out where these locations were.

1654
02:24:01,267 --> 02:24:02,268
and the applications.

1655
02:24:02,808 --> 02:24:09,413
So I went on the city website, and what popped up under the city website was a Google Map.

1656
02:24:10,314 --> 02:24:17,279
And you know how difficult the Google Maps are, you got to take your fingers, and you pinch your finger and your thumb and you start expanding them.

1657
02:24:17,859 --> 02:24:20,541
And these blue teardrops appeared.

1658
02:24:20,941 --> 02:24:27,066
And if you expand too far, I was in Connecticut, and then I started going a little bit smaller.

1659
02:24:27,406 --> 02:24:30,148
And I ended up in, you know, Revere and

1660
02:24:30,638 --> 02:24:35,059
It was very difficult, to say the least, getting where these streets were.

1661
02:24:35,099 --> 02:24:41,760
So I reached out to the city engineer, and he gave me a list of the streets, Mr. President.

1662
02:24:42,260 --> 02:24:46,301
That should be on the city website, an actual listing of the streets.

1663
02:24:46,721 --> 02:24:49,581
I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

1664
02:24:50,242 --> 02:24:53,522
The Google map is fine, but let's make it simple.

1665
02:24:53,882 --> 02:24:58,363
Let's show residents what the streets are, where the polls are gonna be located,

1666
02:24:59,374 --> 02:25:03,076
and it's easy access for someone to look up, Mr. President.

1667
02:25:03,516 --> 02:25:06,298
It is important where this is eight days away.

1668
02:25:06,718 --> 02:25:08,359
I would just like to read the streets off.

1669
02:25:09,459 --> 02:25:26,387
It's not that long, Mr. President, but for those that may not have internet access and can't figure out or maybe 301 feet from the site and not receive the correspondence from the city notifying of this important topic, I think this is important.

1670
02:25:26,747 --> 02:25:27,668
So the streets that,

1671
02:25:28,057 --> 02:25:30,798
were pulled by the engineer and I thank him.

1672
02:25:30,818 --> 02:25:38,480
25 Dexter Street, the pole is located on Bow Street, where the installation's gonna go.

1673
02:25:39,101 --> 02:25:42,582
50 George Street, the pole is located on Wedgmere Road.

1674
02:25:43,322 --> 02:25:47,043
148 Washington Street, pole is located on Otis Street.

1675
02:25:47,063 --> 02:25:55,666
204 Winthrop Street, 13 Newburn Ave, 8 Alfred Street, 39 Albion Street, pole located on William Street.

1676
02:25:56,585 --> 02:26:02,813
287 Main Street, 25 Brooks Street, 72 Salem Street, all located on Oakland Street.

1677
02:26:02,833 --> 02:26:10,281
4 Central Ave, 499 Main Street, 20 Winchester Street, all located on Wareham Street.

1678
02:26:10,582 --> 02:26:16,709
200 Boston Ave, 21 Fairmount Street, 333 Main Street, all located on Bowdoin Street.

1679
02:26:17,319 --> 02:26:41,112
24 Wayham Street, 71 Central Ave, 4 Colby Street, 16 Mystic Ave, 42 Quincy Street, 600 Boston Ave, 13 Higgins Ave, 89 Princeton Street, 97 Greenleaf Ave, 13 Bradley Road, 62 Marion Street, 24 Tulsa Ave, 28 Killsett Road, 17 Court Street, 10 Winthrop Street, 87 Farmer Street, 236 Harvard Street,

1680
02:26:46,275 --> 02:27:03,823
90 North Street, 48 Granville Ave, 32 Brookings Street, 281 Boston Ave, 10 Cherry Street, 4 Brogan Road, 42 Martin Street, near 451 Boston Ave, 549 Main Street, 101 Chardon Ave, and 104 College Ave.

1681
02:27:04,304 --> 02:27:06,985
I appreciate my colleagues for letting me announce that.

1682
02:27:07,385 --> 02:27:15,569
Mr. President, from what I recall from a year and a half ago, Verizon had close to 90 applications at that time.

1683
02:27:16,490 --> 02:27:17,831
They went forward and they submitted 44.

1684
02:27:19,652 --> 02:27:24,594
I still believe Verizon, this is only about half of what they're going to offer.

1685
02:27:24,954 --> 02:27:29,396
And if you look at the streets, you can almost tell it's about half the city.

1686
02:27:29,796 --> 02:27:32,538
It doesn't include a lot of the other half of the city.

1687
02:27:32,858 --> 02:27:36,940
So I think we can anticipate another 45 locations, Mr. President.

1688
02:27:37,333 --> 02:27:46,775
And that's why it's so important that we get this process and this interim policy down pat to safeguard the residents of this community.

1689
02:27:46,955 --> 02:27:50,976
So I want to thank my colleagues for indulging me.

1690
02:27:51,016 --> 02:27:58,158
I know that was a long presentation, but I think it's important enough to make sure that this two year process, people don't feel left out.

1691
02:27:58,418 --> 02:28:01,659
People feel like they have a say and people get involved on the march.

1692
02:28:02,563 --> 02:28:03,544
31st hearing, Mr. President.

1693
02:28:03,844 --> 02:28:04,204
Thank you.

1694
02:28:04,585 --> 02:28:07,106
Councilor Marks, thank you very much for your very thorough presentation.

1695
02:28:07,887 --> 02:28:10,068
Just in follow-up, we have nine amendments.

1696
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:13,870
The first amendment would be none of these hearings start before 6 p.m.

1697
02:28:14,291 --> 02:28:19,254
The second amendment would be that the notification radius be expanded to 500 feet.

1698
02:28:20,255 --> 02:28:24,237
The third amendment would be that the city handles issuance of the notice, not the applicant.

1699
02:28:24,897 --> 02:28:28,820
Number four is that all notices do have the applicant's contact info on it.

1700
02:28:29,666 --> 02:28:33,167
Number five is a question as to what the minimum setbacks are.

1701
02:28:33,947 --> 02:28:38,628
Number six is what safeguards are in place to protect our city's employees from radio frequency exposure.

1702
02:28:39,469 --> 02:28:42,790
Number seven is, has the ADA officer reviewed the proposed locations?

1703
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:48,031
Number eight is, can the city present a list of the poll locations on the city website?

1704
02:28:48,511 --> 02:28:53,612
And number nine is, why are residential districts omitted from the review criteria on certain applications?

1705
02:28:53,873 --> 02:28:54,933
Does that sound correct, councilor?

1706
02:28:55,313 --> 02:28:57,153
Excellent job, just one correction.

1707
02:28:57,574 --> 02:28:59,134
And I'm amazed with just one correction.

1708
02:28:59,535 --> 02:29:00,155
did excellent job.

1709
02:29:00,696 --> 02:29:08,779
The setback from dwellings in particular dwellings, because they did allude to parks, schools and playgrounds, but they did nothing about dwellings.

1710
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:12,081
So just if you couldn't, I appreciate you putting that together.

1711
02:29:12,121 --> 02:29:12,841
That was very thorough.

1712
02:29:14,662 --> 02:29:14,902
Excellent.

1713
02:29:14,922 --> 02:29:15,383
Thank you very much.

1714
02:29:15,403 --> 02:29:17,904
Council Max, the chair recognizes Councilor Scott Kelly.

1715
02:29:18,004 --> 02:29:18,364
Thank you.

1716
02:29:18,384 --> 02:29:23,006
I will not try to even come close to talk about the 5g issue.

1717
02:29:23,386 --> 02:29:28,909
Because Council Max, that is what a city councilor does what you just did right there.

1718
02:29:29,383 --> 02:29:33,046
because I had phone calls saying, what's wrong with Councilor Marks?

1719
02:29:33,106 --> 02:29:34,667
Why is he questioning 5G?

1720
02:29:34,688 --> 02:29:35,768
It's just gonna happen.

1721
02:29:36,609 --> 02:29:50,741
And what you just talked about right now are the other phone calls I got that, you know, Mr. So-and-so from Cherry Street that says, George, there's a 5G box going right across my daughter's bedroom window.

1722
02:29:51,582 --> 02:29:56,106
And we're here for her future because there's still not enough information out there.

1723
02:29:56,767 --> 02:30:03,596
And something simple as, why can't we just move it further down where it doesn't affect anybody's home?

1724
02:30:04,037 --> 02:30:07,541
Where there's a poll that would work, not even a compromise.

1725
02:30:07,962 --> 02:30:10,966
So whatever is being said in the public,

1726
02:30:11,634 --> 02:30:19,277
the idea that the work that you just put into that and making sure that everybody has the answers is exactly what a city council does.

1727
02:30:19,857 --> 02:30:27,040
And as a community member, and if that was going in front of my house, Councilmax, I appreciate your effort and your work.

1728
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:33,205
to make sure that everything that you put out is making sure that we're protecting our residents.

1729
02:30:33,645 --> 02:30:34,746
So I thank you.

1730
02:30:34,826 --> 02:30:37,308
I know that what we're hearing is it's a done deal.

1731
02:30:38,349 --> 02:30:53,542
It's a federal law and they can do X, Y, and Z, but you bring up so many valid questions from so many residents that I think that this meeting has to be so important that Verizon has to at least listen and they have to at least look at some compromises.

1732
02:30:54,162 --> 02:30:55,103
If we have homes that

1733
02:30:55,597 --> 02:31:10,905
are 10 feet away from an eight-year-old's window, and that's a fear for that family, why shouldn't Verizon look at moving it down another 50 feet where it doesn't affect any homes, or it's the homes further setback, so there isn't an issue?

1734
02:31:11,525 --> 02:31:15,387
So that's a thoroughness of what a true city council does.

1735
02:31:15,407 --> 02:31:21,891
So I appreciate and applaud your hard work, and that's what we should all aspire to, what you just did tonight.

1736
02:31:21,911 --> 02:31:23,472
So thank you very much for that.

1737
02:31:25,630 --> 02:31:28,091
Chair recognizes Council President Caraballo.

1738
02:31:29,231 --> 02:31:36,693
Thank you, Councilman again, Councilor Scott, you did the work for all of us on that motion.

1739
02:31:39,334 --> 02:31:49,377
I think I recall that the 40 was just the first submission of the day but I remember it was going to be somewhere, but 150 ish.

1740
02:31:51,411 --> 02:31:58,934
because there was one submission, and then they were looking to do a second submission, a second hearing for a little bit over 100.

1741
02:31:59,294 --> 02:32:10,358
So I think 40 is only the beginning, and I think we'll probably be doing this again for when they come up for their second round of putting them on the polls again.

1742
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:15,240
The chair recognizes Councilor Behrs.

1743
02:32:16,701 --> 02:32:18,561
Thank you, Council Vice President Knight.

1744
02:32:19,121 --> 02:32:20,442
And I wanna thank Councilor Marks

1745
02:32:21,067 --> 02:32:21,487
that we've been doing.

1746
02:32:21,507 --> 02:32:25,808
After the thorough work on this and continue to throw work around five G for several years now.

1747
02:32:26,728 --> 02:32:31,029
I just wanted to put a note in there that we could also move forward.

1748
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:40,632
In addition to recommending these changes to the policy move forward with codifying the small cell committee in an ordinance, and we could include some of the many items that

1749
02:32:47,827 --> 02:32:53,112
I know that this hearing is happening on the 31st, but going forward, I think it would be good to have this all set in stone.

1750
02:32:53,472 --> 02:32:53,792
Thank you.

1751
02:32:54,693 --> 02:32:59,778
I certainly agree with you, Councilor Baez, and when a council has legal representation, I think that's a great thing that we should start to pursue.

1752
02:32:59,798 --> 02:33:02,600
Touche.

1753
02:33:07,104 --> 02:33:08,165
Anybody else have any questions?

1754
02:33:10,007 --> 02:33:10,467
Move the question.

1755
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:24,145
On approval of the question, motions to approve made by Councilor Carabiello, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, as amended by Councilor Marks, nine times, as noted earlier in the meeting.

1756
02:33:25,346 --> 02:33:26,646
Will the city clerk please call the roll.

1757
02:33:32,269 --> 02:33:32,829
Councilor Paris.

1758
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,030
Yes.

1759
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:35,771
Councilor Falco.

1760
02:33:35,791 --> 02:33:36,011
Yes.

1761
02:33:36,471 --> 02:33:37,151
Vice President Knight.

1762
02:33:37,211 --> 02:33:37,532
Yes.

1763
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:39,533
Sorry, I called you last, but now that I called you.

1764
02:33:39,713 --> 02:33:40,253
Councilor Marks.

1765
02:33:40,613 --> 02:33:40,993
Yes.

1766
02:33:42,034 --> 02:33:42,554
Councilor Morrell.

1767
02:33:43,065 --> 02:33:43,345
Yes.

1768
02:33:44,185 --> 02:33:44,966
Councilor Scarpelli.

1769
02:33:45,326 --> 02:33:45,626
Yes.

1770
02:33:45,706 --> 02:33:46,466
President Caraballo.

1771
02:33:46,766 --> 02:33:47,026
Yes.

1772
02:33:49,167 --> 02:33:50,668
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1773
02:33:50,688 --> 02:33:51,808
The paper passes.

1774
02:33:52,228 --> 02:33:57,330
Council paper 21195 offered by President Caraballo.

1775
02:33:58,030 --> 02:34:04,072
Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council receive a report on if there is a plan to reopen the Medford Senior Center in any capacity.

1776
02:34:04,352 --> 02:34:05,233
Councilor Caraballo.

1777
02:34:05,673 --> 02:34:06,773
Thank you, Mr. President.

1778
02:34:06,793 --> 02:34:11,935
I don't think that a day goes by that I don't run into a senior

1779
02:34:13,315 --> 02:34:19,357
whether it's a school box, CVS, or somewhere asking me, Rick, when is the senior center going to open?

1780
02:34:19,377 --> 02:34:22,278
I don't have an answer for them.

1781
02:34:22,818 --> 02:34:38,963
And I know we're still in the COVID, as the governor starts to loosen the regulation up, and I know more and more seniors are being vaccinated, does the city have some kind of plan to open the senior center up?

1782
02:34:39,303 --> 02:34:40,704
I mean, this is a facility that is,

1783
02:34:42,617 --> 02:34:44,919
the lifeblood of the senior community.

1784
02:34:45,099 --> 02:34:52,024
I mean, these people have been stuck in their houses for almost over a year now.

1785
02:34:52,625 --> 02:34:53,566
I haven't been able to get out.

1786
02:34:53,586 --> 02:35:03,514
And as I said, this building is where they go to socialize, where they go to get information, where they go to get help, where they go really for everything.

1787
02:35:04,554 --> 02:35:11,620
Again, I'd like to know if there's a plan coming down the line in the near future

1788
02:35:12,487 --> 02:35:21,456
As more and more seniors get vaccinated and the governor starts to loosen the capacity, is there a plan to open the senior center up?

1789
02:35:23,779 --> 02:35:26,081
So that's my question to the administration.

1790
02:35:26,101 --> 02:35:29,665
And if they could give us a report back, it'd be really appreciated.

1791
02:35:29,965 --> 02:35:30,265
Excellent.

1792
02:35:30,345 --> 02:35:33,749
Is there anybody from the administration would like to chime in or would you like to file a report to the council?

1793
02:35:39,593 --> 02:35:42,495
Seeing no hands, I think we'll take that as then we'll file a report with the council.

1794
02:35:42,515 --> 02:35:44,316
Does any of the other councilors have anything to add?

1795
02:35:44,897 --> 02:35:46,698
Councilor Marks, the chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1796
02:35:47,198 --> 02:35:47,999
Thank you, Mr. President.

1797
02:35:48,019 --> 02:35:57,885
I want to thank Council President Caviello, because indeed, this is important and very important for many of the seniors in this community.

1798
02:35:58,746 --> 02:36:08,192
And I know over the past year, we've been all preaching social distancing, social distancing, and it's very important

1799
02:36:08,717 --> 02:36:18,981
that our seniors be able to communicate and meet with their friends and meet with other seniors and so forth.

1800
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:24,144
And that aspect of their life, Mr. President, for the most part has been missing over the past year.

1801
02:36:24,604 --> 02:36:34,448
And it's vital more than ever now that we start to bring some normality in a safe manner to our seniors, Mr. President.

1802
02:36:34,628 --> 02:36:37,109
And one thing that I know has been

1803
02:36:37,867 --> 02:36:41,368
that resource is our senior center in the square.

1804
02:36:41,788 --> 02:36:46,350
They offer a number of worthy trips for our seniors.

1805
02:36:46,710 --> 02:36:50,832
Any given time, you used to see the buses leave behind here at City Hall.

1806
02:36:51,132 --> 02:36:53,893
They'd be jam-packed with seniors throughout the community.

1807
02:36:54,573 --> 02:36:58,394
You'd have the meat bingo that they'd have every year.

1808
02:36:59,655 --> 02:37:01,195
They'd have a host of functions.

1809
02:37:02,696 --> 02:37:06,637
They really did a lot for the seniors at that center.

1810
02:37:07,232 --> 02:37:09,753
And I know a lot of seniors are sorely missing that.

1811
02:37:10,114 --> 02:37:19,859
So I wanna thank Councilor Caviello for recognizing that and whatever we can do as a community, if it's still a little too early, then so be it.

1812
02:37:19,899 --> 02:37:26,943
But I think that has to be in the back of our mind that the interaction for seniors is very important.

1813
02:37:28,024 --> 02:37:31,666
And in this time, I think it's important that we recognize that.

1814
02:37:32,166 --> 02:37:32,486
Thank you.

1815
02:37:34,082 --> 02:37:36,324
Thank you, Councilor Max, Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1816
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:37,265
Thank you, Mr. President.

1817
02:37:37,285 --> 02:37:40,848
I want to also thank President Caballero for bringing this forward.

1818
02:37:41,749 --> 02:37:47,794
As we all know, the Senior Center is a vital part of our community, and it's always full of activity.

1819
02:37:47,894 --> 02:37:50,036
So I thank you for bringing this forward.

1820
02:37:50,076 --> 02:37:56,482
And I think it is important that we get some sort of a timeframe, you know, from the administration.

1821
02:37:57,503 --> 02:38:14,393
If you were my consulate, President Carvajal, if we could amend the resolution just to see if there's a possibility with the warmer months coming, if there's not going to be any activity inside the senior center, is there a possibility of some sort of recreational activities that would happen outside?

1822
02:38:14,413 --> 02:38:19,976
So if I could make that as an amendment to the resolution, I greatly appreciate it.

1823
02:38:20,875 --> 02:38:23,618
you know, programming is key for the seniors.

1824
02:38:23,658 --> 02:38:29,225
And if we're not gonna do something inside, there should be options outside, or we should at least be looking at those options.

1825
02:38:29,285 --> 02:38:33,190
So if I could amend the resolution, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1826
02:38:33,210 --> 02:38:34,532
Thank you, President Caviello.

1827
02:38:35,695 --> 02:38:37,296
We've built that Bocce court for a reason.

1828
02:38:37,436 --> 02:38:46,681
You know, when I think of some of the services and programming that come out of the senior center, one of the big ones is help with the tax preparation.

1829
02:38:46,941 --> 02:38:48,642
This time of year is tax time.

1830
02:38:48,722 --> 02:38:52,043
And we always had somebody down there helping out with the taxes.

1831
02:38:52,224 --> 02:39:02,789
So with that being said, I'm on the motion made by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Mox as amended by Councilor Falco.

1832
02:39:05,637 --> 02:39:08,098
And will the clerk please call the roll?

1833
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:15,281
Councilor Bears?

1834
02:39:16,241 --> 02:39:16,481
Yes.

1835
02:39:17,902 --> 02:39:18,562
Councilor Falco?

1836
02:39:18,582 --> 02:39:18,862
Yes.

1837
02:39:19,322 --> 02:39:19,922
Councilor Marks?

1838
02:39:20,242 --> 02:39:20,542
Yes.

1839
02:39:20,783 --> 02:39:21,423
Councilor Morrell?

1840
02:39:21,823 --> 02:39:22,103
Yes.

1841
02:39:22,883 --> 02:39:23,644
Councilor Scarpelli?

1842
02:39:23,844 --> 02:39:24,984
Yes.

1843
02:39:25,044 --> 02:39:25,784
President Caravaglia?

1844
02:39:25,904 --> 02:39:26,165
Yes.

1845
02:39:27,085 --> 02:39:27,705
Vice President Knight?

1846
02:39:27,825 --> 02:39:28,125
Yes.

1847
02:39:29,906 --> 02:39:31,306
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1848
02:39:31,326 --> 02:39:32,687
The motion passes as amended.

1849
02:39:34,583 --> 02:39:40,024
Paper 21196 offered by Councilor Behrs.

1850
02:39:40,064 --> 02:39:57,609
Be it so resolved by the Memphis City Council that we stand in solidarity with the Asian-Americans in Memphis and across the country in opposing the increase in anti-Asian bigotry, violence, and hate crimes that is being fueled by white supremacist groups and rhetoric.

1851
02:39:57,989 --> 02:39:58,969
Councilor Behrs.

1852
02:40:00,149 --> 02:40:01,610
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1853
02:40:03,292 --> 02:40:18,177
know, I've had been reached out to by a lot of members of our Asian American Pacific Islander community this week expressing anger and frustration at what's going on in our country and asking for support right here at home.

1854
02:40:19,377 --> 02:40:29,700
There's a report from the Anti-Defamation League of New England just last week, March 17th, that says we were at an all-time high for white supremacist propaganda since the ADL has been looking at that.

1855
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:33,842
and that it increased by 87% in 2020 alone.

1856
02:40:34,883 --> 02:40:53,614
So I'm hoping that, you know, by taking statements and actions like this, we are directly pushing back on the dangerous rhetoric, and also letting residents know, in this case, Asian American, Pacific Islander residents, that they are welcome here in Medford, and that we don't tolerate that kind of behavior or rhetoric in our community, and I move approval.

1857
02:40:54,894 --> 02:40:59,057
I certainly couldn't agree with you more, Councilor Beas, on the motion.

1858
02:40:59,949 --> 02:41:00,309
Councilor.

1859
02:41:00,329 --> 02:41:01,290
Mr President.

1860
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:02,270
I see you there, Councilor.

1861
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:03,351
Just a second emotion.

1862
02:41:03,391 --> 02:41:05,612
Council of this seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1863
02:41:05,952 --> 02:41:07,533
The chair recognizes Councilor Merrill.

1864
02:41:08,254 --> 02:41:11,115
Thank you, uh, vice president night, Mr President.

1865
02:41:11,235 --> 02:41:13,877
Um so I think Councilor bears for bringing this forward.

1866
02:41:14,017 --> 02:41:17,559
I also want to thank the mayor for putting out her statement last week.

1867
02:41:17,699 --> 02:41:23,322
You know, uh, as, um, political leaders in the community as people at City Hall, our

1868
02:41:29,662 --> 02:41:41,427
It's so important to speak out and condemn these acts and also just stand with our Asian American Pacific Islander neighbors as these incidences increase and the reported ones increase.

1869
02:41:41,447 --> 02:41:44,028
So there's so much that doesn't go get reported.

1870
02:41:44,128 --> 02:41:52,251
So I think it's really important that we take a stand, that we take a stand at these meetings and that we really let people in the community know where we stand.

1871
02:41:52,311 --> 02:41:56,173
So I thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forward and I second the motion.

1872
02:41:57,293 --> 02:41:57,734
Mr. President.

1873
02:41:59,519 --> 02:42:01,380
The chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1874
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:02,380
Thank you, Mr. President.

1875
02:42:02,400 --> 02:42:04,501
I also want to thank Councilor Pierce for bringing this forward.

1876
02:42:04,541 --> 02:42:10,044
This is a challenging time for Asian Americans and our Asian community.

1877
02:42:10,124 --> 02:42:23,490
Numerous individuals have been subject to abuse, to attacks, and we need to engage our Asian community with compassion, empathy, kindness, and respect in response to these acts of intolerance and ignorance and hate.

1878
02:42:24,250 --> 02:42:27,192
So I thank Councilor Pierce for bringing this forward, and I also move approval.

1879
02:42:27,472 --> 02:42:27,672
Thank you.

1880
02:42:28,073 --> 02:42:39,817
Excellent, just if I may from the chair, I'd like to take this opportunity to also recognize the work that Tufts University did recently with the elimination of the Confucius Institute.

1881
02:42:40,258 --> 02:42:46,540
Institute funded by the Chinese government that has had a very spotty history.

1882
02:42:47,210 --> 02:42:50,371
here at Tufts University and across the world.

1883
02:42:50,812 --> 02:42:58,115
So with that being said, on the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded, I'm sorry, on the motion by Councilor, oh, Councilor Carviel, the Chair recognizes Councilor Carviel.

1884
02:42:58,575 --> 02:42:59,215
Thank you, Mr. President.

1885
02:42:59,235 --> 02:43:00,996
I want to thank Councilor Baird to bring this forward.

1886
02:43:01,636 --> 02:43:05,678
I have a special bond with the Asian community over the years.

1887
02:43:06,778 --> 02:43:16,662
My dad and his brother, his brothers in our business, sponsored dozens of Asian families to come to this country.

1888
02:43:17,848 --> 02:43:19,569
with their families over the years.

1889
02:43:19,589 --> 02:43:22,391
And so I have a little bond with them.

1890
02:43:22,431 --> 02:43:28,154
And again, there is no room for any kind of aid on the agency.

1891
02:43:28,314 --> 02:43:30,816
So I thank my fellow council for bringing this forward.

1892
02:43:32,136 --> 02:43:37,419
On the motion of Councilor Beas, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly as amended by Councilor Falco.

1893
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:38,340
Will the clerk please call the roll?

1894
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:38,640
Mr. President.

1895
02:43:39,641 --> 02:43:40,741
Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Moxley.

1896
02:43:40,761 --> 02:43:42,022
Chair recognizes Councilor Moxley.

1897
02:43:42,142 --> 02:43:42,943
Thank you, Mr. President.

1898
02:43:42,983 --> 02:43:45,444
I too want to thank Councilor Beas for offering this

1899
02:43:46,229 --> 02:44:01,199
I think this council has been pretty vocal about having zero tolerance for any type of bigotry or hate crimes, Mr. President, not only in our community, but across the country.

1900
02:44:01,959 --> 02:44:07,062
And I'm proud of our record speaking up, Mr. President, against this.

1901
02:44:07,182 --> 02:44:14,607
And we know that this is a welcoming community, the city of Method, and we will not tolerate any type of

1902
02:44:14,997 --> 02:44:19,318
hate crimes or bigotry, Mr. President, we will stamp it out as a community.

1903
02:44:19,418 --> 02:44:19,778
Thank you.

1904
02:44:20,258 --> 02:44:21,718
Thank you, Excellency.

1905
02:44:22,719 --> 02:44:24,199
The chair recognizes Councilor Scarapelli.

1906
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:43,703
Again, to reiterate, I think that Councilor Morrell said it perfectly that when we stand together, I think that it's a message that Santino DeMille, appreciate her message, but thanks Councilor Beas for bringing this forward and making sure that our community realizes that we have each other's backs.

1907
02:44:44,585 --> 02:44:47,066
we support our Asian community.

1908
02:44:47,106 --> 02:44:47,626
So thank you.

1909
02:44:49,326 --> 02:44:54,128
On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, as amended by Councilor Falco.

1910
02:44:54,168 --> 02:44:55,068
Chair, please call the roll.

1911
02:44:55,228 --> 02:44:57,249
Mr. President.

1912
02:44:57,309 --> 02:44:58,569
Councilor Morrell.

1913
02:44:58,929 --> 02:45:01,550
I do see Mr. Castagnetti is waving his hand.

1914
02:45:01,570 --> 02:45:03,191
What he's doing?

1915
02:45:03,631 --> 02:45:04,951
I thought he was smoking a cigarette.

1916
02:45:05,411 --> 02:45:06,331
He might be doing both.

1917
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:16,972
There's something all right.

1918
02:45:17,012 --> 02:45:17,252
Hello.

1919
02:45:17,272 --> 02:45:17,652
There we go.

1920
02:45:17,672 --> 02:45:18,072
He's back.

1921
02:45:18,112 --> 02:45:18,632
He's in action.

1922
02:45:19,052 --> 02:45:21,773
Mr. Castagnetti name and address for the record.

1923
02:45:23,774 --> 02:45:26,375
Castagnetti Cushman street method, Massachusetts.

1924
02:45:27,255 --> 02:45:31,137
Um, I like to agree strongly with counselor beers.

1925
02:45:31,177 --> 02:45:32,217
He makes a good point.

1926
02:45:32,817 --> 02:45:39,580
We all should be opposed to any kind of violence, violence against all sentient beings period.

1927
02:45:41,284 --> 02:45:46,187
because as you can see what happened this year, violence begets more violence.

1928
02:45:46,727 --> 02:45:47,947
We all need peace.

1929
02:45:48,048 --> 02:45:49,108
Let there be peace.

1930
02:45:49,208 --> 02:45:50,249
Thank you for listening.

1931
02:45:51,009 --> 02:45:52,150
Thank you, Mr. Castagetti.

1932
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:58,913
On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, as amended by Councilor Falco, will the clerk please call the roll.

1933
02:45:59,173 --> 02:45:59,774
Councilor Beers?

1934
02:46:01,274 --> 02:46:01,494
Yes.

1935
02:46:02,735 --> 02:46:03,375
Councilor Falco?

1936
02:46:03,395 --> 02:46:03,636
Yes.

1937
02:46:04,036 --> 02:46:04,596
Councilor Marks?

1938
02:46:04,996 --> 02:46:05,196
Yes.

1939
02:46:05,216 --> 02:46:06,097
Councilor Morrell?

1940
02:46:06,677 --> 02:46:06,897
Yes.

1941
02:46:06,917 --> 02:46:08,878
Councilor Falco?

1942
02:46:10,119 --> 02:46:10,319
Yes.

1943
02:46:11,488 --> 02:46:11,908
Yes.

1944
02:46:16,332 --> 02:46:18,514
Did you have a couple of papers in the hands of the clerk.

1945
02:46:18,595 --> 02:46:18,855
One more.

1946
02:46:24,838 --> 02:46:27,401
Paper 21197 offered by Councilor Beers.

1947
02:46:27,681 --> 02:46:43,337
Be it resolved the Medford City Council congratulate Finance Director Alicia Nunley Benjamin and the city administration on winning the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officers Association for the updated format of the city's FY 2021 budget.

1948
02:46:43,717 --> 02:46:44,618
Councilor Beers.

1949
02:46:47,935 --> 02:46:48,915
Thank you, Mr. President.

1950
02:46:48,996 --> 02:46:50,076
I'll keep it short and sweet.

1951
02:46:50,656 --> 02:46:54,939
We may not all have agreed on what was in the budget, but we could definitely agree that it was easier to read.

1952
02:46:55,339 --> 02:47:01,602
And I think it's wonderful that Director Nunley-Benjamin and the city administration have been recognized for that work.

1953
02:47:01,922 --> 02:47:04,643
And I hope to see that continue in the future.

1954
02:47:05,164 --> 02:47:05,484
Thank you.

1955
02:47:06,404 --> 02:47:07,125
Second, Mr. President.

1956
02:47:07,665 --> 02:47:11,487
On the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Caraballo, will the clerk please call the roll?

1957
02:47:13,908 --> 02:47:14,488
Councilor Behrs?

1958
02:47:15,089 --> 02:47:15,329
Yes.

1959
02:47:16,349 --> 02:47:17,010
Councilor Fevella?

1960
02:47:17,130 --> 02:47:17,310
Yes.

1961
02:47:17,838 --> 02:47:18,398
Councilor Marks?

1962
02:47:18,799 --> 02:47:19,059
Yes.

1963
02:47:19,359 --> 02:47:19,999
Councilor Morrell?

1964
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:20,620
Yes.

1965
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:22,221
Councilor Scarpelli?

1966
02:47:22,241 --> 02:47:22,301
Yes.

1967
02:47:23,122 --> 02:47:23,942
President Kerrio?

1968
02:47:24,022 --> 02:47:24,262
Yes.

1969
02:47:24,663 --> 02:47:25,363
Vice President Knight?

1970
02:47:25,423 --> 02:47:25,683

1973
02:47:45,197 --> 02:47:45,757
Councilor Behrs?

1974
02:47:46,958 --> 02:47:47,138
Yes.

1975
02:47:48,635 --> 02:47:49,235

1977
02:47:49,956 --> 02:47:50,536

Councilor Morrell?

1980
02:47:52,497 --> 02:47:52,777
Yes.

1981
02:47:53,737 --> 02:47:54,438
Councilor Scarpelli?

1982
02:47:54,698 --> 02:47:55,038
Yes.

1983
02:47:55,218 --> 02:47:55,938
President Caravaglia?

1984
02:47:56,118 --> 02:47:56,358
Yes.

1985
02:47:56,699 --> 02:48:00,020
Vice-President Nightingale?

1986
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:00,360
Yes.

1987
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:04,122
Paper 21-204, be it offered by President Caravaglia and Councilor Scarpelli.

1988
02:48:05,302 --> 02:48:11,325
Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincerest condolences to the family of James McKinnon on his recent passing.

1989
02:48:11,385 --> 02:48:12,205
President Caravaglia.

1990
02:48:13,006 --> 02:48:15,727
Thank you, Mr. President.

1991
02:48:15,767 --> 02:48:17,628
For those who may not know,

1992
02:48:19,524 --> 02:48:27,169
World War II veteran, longtime football coach, teacher in this community, passed away a few months ago.

1993
02:48:27,189 --> 02:48:28,550
No one really knew about it.

1994
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:32,693
And again, he's got a lot of families still living in the area.

1995
02:48:32,733 --> 02:48:34,414
I know his daughters and his family.

1996
02:48:34,814 --> 02:48:41,739
Just want to send them our condolences from the city for all his years of service to our community and to our school system.

1997
02:48:42,219 --> 02:48:43,340
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1998
02:48:43,633 --> 02:48:44,614
Councilor Scarpelli.

1999
02:48:44,674 --> 02:48:45,434
Thank you, Mr. President.

2000
02:48:45,454 --> 02:48:47,376
Thank you, Councilor Carvialho, for bringing this forward.

2001
02:48:47,416 --> 02:48:54,041
I know that I was planning on making a more detailed tribute to Mr. McKinnon.

2002
02:48:54,921 --> 02:49:00,305
Mr. McKinnon, again, when we talk about legends, Mr. McKinnon was a legend for sure.

2003
02:49:00,725 --> 02:49:10,673
He was bigger than life, a hero football player, a hero in this country, and a hero of a father and a husband.

2004
02:49:10,713 --> 02:49:11,093
I know that

2005
02:49:11,632 --> 02:49:19,135
His wife, Jean, and his children loved him dearly, and they made a huge impact in our community.

2006
02:49:19,835 --> 02:49:30,778
I know Mr. McKinnon, as a freshman at Medford High, when you first walk into Medford High School, I think they left Mr. McKinnon right in the front door so he could set the tone.

2007
02:49:30,838 --> 02:49:35,460
And I think that his tone was with his face, and he could scare you.

2008
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,460
I tell you that.

2009
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:41,442
He was someone that was very stern, but just a great educator.

2010
02:49:41,923 --> 02:49:47,128
and a great leader at Medford High School and the city of Medford and other communities as well.

2011
02:49:47,168 --> 02:49:55,057
But he will surely be missed and condolences to his family, the McKinnons, the Bradys.

2012
02:49:55,617 --> 02:50:00,182
He's definitely leaving a void in this community.

2013
02:50:00,242 --> 02:50:01,323
So thank you, Mr. President.

2014
02:50:02,763 --> 02:50:04,003
Chair recommends Councilor Felkel.

2015
02:50:04,143 --> 02:50:05,144
Thank you, Mr. President.

2016
02:50:05,184 --> 02:50:08,745
I want to thank President Caviello and Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward.

2017
02:50:09,445 --> 02:50:22,608
I had Mr. McKinnon as a teacher in Medford High School, and he was very caring, very committed to our city, and thoughts and prayers go to his family.

2018
02:50:22,708 --> 02:50:23,068
Thank you.

2019
02:50:24,509 --> 02:50:25,529
Chair recommends Councilor Beers.

2020
02:50:30,089 --> 02:50:36,132
I did not know Mr. McKinnon, but I do wish his family my sympathies and condolences.

2021
02:50:38,613 --> 02:50:39,914
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

2022
02:50:41,395 --> 02:50:43,816
Thank you, Mr. President.

2023
02:50:43,836 --> 02:50:49,239
I want to thank Council President Caviello for putting this on the agenda.

2024
02:50:49,979 --> 02:50:54,522
You know, as Councilor Scott Kelly mentioned, he was put at the front door for a reason.

2025
02:50:55,382 --> 02:50:56,703
And I remember being up there.

2026
02:50:57,343 --> 02:50:59,144
He was a very intimidating person.

2027
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:02,121
And you never gave him any back talk.

2028
02:51:02,461 --> 02:51:09,703
You never looked at him out of the corner of your eye because you knew you were in for something if you could, if you did.

2029
02:51:10,544 --> 02:51:12,964
But he was a great teacher and he really cared about the kids.

2030
02:51:13,325 --> 02:51:16,506
And I think that showed and my condolences go out to the family as well.

2031
02:51:17,906 --> 02:51:19,667
Chair recognizes Mr. Castagnetti.

2032
02:51:27,689 --> 02:51:29,490
Are you talking to me, Mr. President?

2033
02:51:30,383 --> 02:51:31,784
I believe you had your hand raised, sir.

2034
02:51:32,825 --> 02:51:42,793
I was going to, I was, I wanted to say some condolence prayer for Adam, Mr. Adam Hurdybee and his family because he's always been a constant gentleman.

2035
02:51:43,494 --> 02:51:52,001
But I think I coined a prayer last year with my friend Geshe-la Tenley at the Buddhist temple around two words, sentient beings.

2036
02:51:52,721 --> 02:51:57,365
I think I like to say my prayer for all of mankind.

2037
02:51:58,666 --> 02:51:59,527
Almighty God,

2038
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:05,923
creator of heaven, earth, and all sentient beings, and more.

2039
02:52:06,903 --> 02:52:17,369
Please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

2040
02:52:18,150 --> 02:52:18,490
Amen.

2041
02:52:20,171 --> 02:52:20,431
Amen.

2042
02:52:20,591 --> 02:52:21,692
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2043
02:52:21,852 --> 02:52:25,354
The chair recognizes Councilor Scott Felly.

2044
02:52:25,434 --> 02:52:30,537
If we could dedicate this meeting in Mr. McKenna's name, I would really appreciate it, Mr. President.

2045
02:52:31,721 --> 02:52:34,502
as amended by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

2046
02:52:35,383 --> 02:52:41,986
Paper 21204, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of James McKinnon in his passing.

2047
02:52:42,286 --> 02:52:43,427
Will the clerk please call the roll?

2048
02:52:46,528 --> 02:52:47,128
Councilor Behrs?

2049
02:52:47,869 --> 02:52:48,109
Yes.

2050
02:52:49,169 --> 02:52:49,890
Councilor Fevella?

2051
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:50,170
Yes.

2052
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:51,230
Councilor Marks?

2053
02:52:51,771 --> 02:52:52,051
Yes.

2054
02:52:52,411 --> 02:52:53,011
Councilor Morrell?

2055
02:52:53,411 --> 02:52:53,692
Yes.

2056
02:52:54,612 --> 02:52:55,392
Councilor Scarpelli?

2057
02:52:55,492 --> 02:52:55,793
Yes.

2058
02:52:56,033 --> 02:52:56,813
President Caraviello?

2059
02:52:57,173 --> 02:52:57,433
Yes.

2060
02:52:57,914 --> 02:52:58,574
Vice President Knight?

2061
02:52:58,654 --> 02:52:58,974
Yes.

2062
02:52:59,614 --> 02:53:00,735
Please rise for a moment of silence.

2063
02:53:24,987 --> 02:53:29,791
Paper 21-203 offered by President Caravaglia.

2064
02:53:30,431 --> 02:53:45,003
Be it resolved, the Medford City Council acknowledge March 21st, 2021 as being World Down Syndrome Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about Down syndrome and celebrating individuals around the world living with a genetic condition.

2065
02:53:45,623 --> 02:53:46,704
Councilor Caravaglia.

2066
02:53:47,164 --> 02:53:51,147
The number 21 signifies the 21st chromosome

2067
02:53:54,772 --> 02:53:57,913
which is significant with people with Down syndrome.

2068
02:53:57,993 --> 02:54:01,373
As many of you know, I have a member of my family that has Down syndrome.

2069
02:54:02,014 --> 02:54:09,055
And it's something that's very dear to me.

2070
02:54:10,055 --> 02:54:11,876
And it's something I've supported for many years.

2071
02:54:11,936 --> 02:54:15,297
And there's many parents that have children with Down syndrome.

2072
02:54:15,857 --> 02:54:19,277
And over the years, Down syndrome has come,

2073
02:54:22,412 --> 02:54:27,656
a monumentous way from when my family first had it.

2074
02:54:28,377 --> 02:54:32,580
Back then when, you know, children were born, they were institutionalized.

2075
02:54:35,082 --> 02:54:40,407
My mother-in-law chose never to do that to her son.

2076
02:54:41,027 --> 02:54:45,591
And nowadays, children that have that are taught different.

2077
02:54:46,151 --> 02:54:47,833
They lead productive lives now.

2078
02:54:48,713 --> 02:54:49,614
They're taught different.

2079
02:54:50,074 --> 02:54:51,035
And you can see how far

2080
02:54:52,605 --> 02:54:53,985
this disease has come over the years.

2081
02:54:54,085 --> 02:54:59,227
I just want to put something out to all the families in the community that have a Down syndrome child.

2082
02:54:59,307 --> 02:55:04,628
It takes a special type of parents to raise these special children.

2083
02:55:05,169 --> 02:55:06,329
And my heart goes out to all of them.

2084
02:55:06,369 --> 02:55:11,991
And I just want to make sure that everybody in the community is aware of this disease and that we acknowledge it properly.

2085
02:55:12,011 --> 02:55:14,811
Thank you very much, Councilor Caraviello.

2086
02:55:15,952 --> 02:55:20,633
On the motion by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scott Peller, the Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

2087
02:55:21,750 --> 02:55:22,551
Thank you, Mr. President.

2088
02:55:22,571 --> 02:55:24,372
I want to thank President Caviello.

2089
02:55:24,693 --> 02:55:30,457
Every year, he raises awareness for World Down Syndrome Day.

2090
02:55:31,238 --> 02:55:48,312
And he does a magnificent job not just explaining what it is to have a family member with Down syndrome, but he also does a lot in the community, Mr. President, as someone that raises funds and raises awareness as well.

2091
02:55:48,692 --> 02:55:50,854
And I appreciate the fact that you've been on top of this

2092
02:55:51,412 --> 02:55:52,172
that we've been able to do.

2093
02:55:52,192 --> 02:55:53,133
I think we've been consistent over the years.

2094
02:55:53,253 --> 02:55:54,654
Thank you, and I really appreciate that.

2095
02:55:54,714 --> 02:55:55,034
Thank you.

2096
02:55:57,735 --> 02:55:58,215
On the motion.

2097
02:55:58,455 --> 02:56:02,217
Uh and the chair recognizes Chief of Staff David Rodriguez.

2098
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:09,641
I have nothing further.

2099
02:56:10,081 --> 02:56:15,463
The mayor did put out a brief statement on Facebook over the weekend just to celebrate

2100
02:56:21,742 --> 02:56:22,102
Excellent thing.

2101
02:56:22,142 --> 02:56:22,943
I just saw your hand up there.

2102
02:56:22,963 --> 02:56:25,704
I'm sorry if you weren't.

2103
02:56:26,044 --> 02:56:27,025
I may have hit it by mistake.

2104
02:56:27,065 --> 02:56:28,145
That might be all on me.

2105
02:56:28,165 --> 02:56:28,886
I apologize.

2106
02:56:29,086 --> 02:56:31,107
We'll learn it up here in the big seat.

2107
02:56:31,387 --> 02:56:35,209
On the motion by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, will the clerk please call the roll?

2108
02:56:37,551 --> 02:56:38,151
Councilor Beers?

2109
02:56:38,791 --> 02:56:39,051
Yes.

2110
02:56:40,012 --> 02:56:40,692
Councilor Caput?

2111
02:56:40,752 --> 02:56:41,032
Yes.

2112
02:56:41,373 --> 02:56:41,933
Councilor Marks?

2113
02:56:42,353 --> 02:56:42,673
Yes.

2114
02:56:43,073 --> 02:56:43,694
Councilor Morrell?

2115
02:56:44,114 --> 02:56:44,394
Yes.

2116
02:56:45,175 --> 02:56:45,935
Councilor Scarpelli?

2117
02:56:46,015 --> 02:56:46,315
Yes.

2118
02:56:46,775 --> 02:56:47,576
President Caraviello?

2119
02:56:47,656 --> 02:56:47,996
Yes.

2120
02:56:48,336 --> 02:56:48,997
Vice President Knight?

2121
02:56:49,137 --> 02:56:49,377
Yes.

2122
02:56:52,687 --> 02:56:54,208
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2123
02:56:54,308 --> 02:56:55,189
The motion passes.

2124
02:56:59,552 --> 02:56:59,973
Records.

2125
02:57:00,593 --> 02:57:01,754
We'll pass the council at night.

2126
02:57:01,854 --> 02:57:02,715
Two committee reports.

2127
02:57:02,995 --> 02:57:06,858
Oh, sorry, we have two committee reports.

2128
02:57:06,898 --> 02:57:08,960
Reports of committees.

2129
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:08,960
20577.

2130
02:57:09,921 --> 02:57:10,761
Committee of the whole.

2131
02:57:11,922 --> 02:57:13,063
March 16th.

2132
02:57:13,683 --> 02:57:21,910
This committee of the whole was to discuss the data breach and Chief of Staff said that the investigation is ongoing.

2133
02:57:23,142 --> 02:57:23,983
Motion for approval.

2134
02:57:26,103 --> 02:57:28,324
