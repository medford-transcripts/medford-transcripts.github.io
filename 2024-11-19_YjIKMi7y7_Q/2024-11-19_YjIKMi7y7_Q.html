    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=177.547s">Marianne,</a>  hold on a second.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=180.329s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=186.772s">She's</a>  listed it, she's showing us unmuted.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=226.498s">Yeah,</a>  we had an issue earlier also.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=259.673s">about</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=260.313s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=270.118s">It</a>  says I'm unmuted.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=271.438s">So</a>  I'm happy to talk to you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=279.122s">Nice</a>  to see you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=280.823s">You</a>  do area.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=295.175s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=298.938s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=301.06s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=302.181s">Thanks</a>  for having nice to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=303.782s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=306.244s">So</a>  I just want to give you a little bit few updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=309.147s">So,</a>  so far to date in March, we've had 264 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=315.732s">So</a>  while I know the state is reopening and we're relaxing a little bit people still obviously <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=323.126s">need</a>  to be vigilant. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=324.407s">That's</a>  certainly not the surge we saw early in the winter, but it's still alive and well here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=330.572s">We</a>  need to be safe and follow the social distancing and the mask wearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=336.496s">We've</a>  had 18 cases just in Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=339.318s">Our</a>  highest week, we had 161 cases the week of March 7th to 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=346.084s">So</a>  we're still seeing the cases while we're still in the yellow <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=352.368s">As</a>  far as the state's concerned now positivity rate is looking good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=357.129s">We're</a>  not out of the woods yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=358.689s">And</a>  I think everyone needs to be aware of that 264 cases this month so far today. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=365.75s">So,</a>  good news is we completed the housing authority first dose vaccinations last Friday, so we completed all the housing authority units which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=377.733s">And</a>  the vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=381.705s">information</a>  is on in weekly updated I mentioned that last week they're now putting out the vaccination reports by community on the state website, every Thursday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=392.856s">So</a>  they updated again last Thursday and as of last Thursday which wouldn't include all of our housing authority because we did one on Friday, 72% of a 75 plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=405.387s">residents</a>  are vaccinated with at least one dose. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=408.928s">So</a>  that's really good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=411.509s">Out</a>  of the entire community, it looks like 26% has received at least their first dose, with 74% not yet, but we haven't hit the younger age groups yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=425.695s">So</a>  what we're hoping to see is that reversed, right, by June or July. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=429.137s">We're</a>  hoping to see <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=431.33s">76%</a>  vaccinated and 24% not vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=434.994s">But</a>  as far as the 64 to 75 group too, we're seeing good numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=441.081s">63%</a>  of that population has been vaccinated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=444.505s">And</a>  we're going to be posting all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=446.467s">We</a>  came up with some, I think, pretty nice ways to put this on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=451.612s">We're</a>  going to be using pie charts <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=453.395s">So</a>  it's easy to kind of see the percentages going to do it by age and by race and by race is really interesting and, and we're really working hard on outreach in the, in the, in the diverse groups because we're worried about vaccine hesitancy, we're not seeing the numbers we want to see in some of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=474.106s">So</a>  this group so we are working hard on some outreach efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=478.928s">more</a>  to come on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=479.969s">So,</a>  and again as you know this week we entered into phase four step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=486.692s">So</a>  that increases gathering limits, the sports guidelines were just updated yesterday, youth and amateur sports guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=495.217s">They've</a>  released or relaxed I should say the spectator guidance where it used to be just two parents and siblings were allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=503.882s">It's</a>  now 50% occupancy of whatever, whatever the indoor venue is now can have spectators, and the same with an outdoor venue with with a stated capacity limit will be 50% of whatever that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=520.175s">But</a>  obviously, only if social distancing can be maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=527.721s">And</a>  I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=530.152s">I</a>  think that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=531.613s">Is</a>  that anyone questions or thoughts?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=537.555s">Councilor</a>  Bailão.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=539.716s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=540.996s">Thank</a>  you very much for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=542.637s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=543.177s">Appreciate</a>  all the hard work put in by you and your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=547.759s">Just</a>  got a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=550.54s">You</a>  mentioned the new, I think, data or metrics that are gonna be on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=556.082s">Do</a>  you know when those will be on the city website?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=559.049s">Hopefully</a>  tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=560.909s">We</a>  just figured them out, got them in the easiest format, I think, for people to understand, because what the state has is just a bunch of numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=568.231s">I</a>  mean, the state data is not bad, if you want to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=570.812s">It's</a>  a good report, but it's more the numbers and the percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=574.793s">We</a>  put it in a pie chart format, so it's easier to kind of see visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=581.674s">So</a>  we're hoping that that's ready today. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=583.315s">It</a>  should be on tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=585.015s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=585.615s">And</a>  I think that's one of the key points, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=589.015s">it's</a>  put in a way where everyone or almost anyone can look at it and be able to visualize it and understand what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=595.825s">So</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=597.527s">And</a>  do you know when that data is there, is it through a certain week? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=601.233s">Is</a>  that through like last week or through this week or?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=604.429s">Yeah,</a>  it follows the same guidelines as the case reporting data that the state does. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=609.333s">So</a>  it's that Sunday to Saturday reporting, but they're doing this on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=616.658s">So</a>  I think the data up there now, I want to, I shouldn't even say, I think it's up as of the 16th, but I'm not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=626.646s">But</a>  yeah, it's a weekly data reporting on the vaccinations.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=630.768s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=631.569s">And</a>  last week, I believe you mentioned the possibility of a regional vaccine clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=638.734s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=639.214s">Is</a>  there any update on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=641.676s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=642.316s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=642.656s">Thank</a>  you for reminding me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=643.957s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=644.478s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=645.258s">After</a>  I spoke to you <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=646.738s">The</a>  state did approve that regional clinic, which is great news. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=652.4s">So</a>  Medford, along with eight other communities, will be hosting a regional site called the Metro North Regional. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=661.043s">And</a>  we don't still have a firm date from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=664.704s">They're</a>  telling us potentially the earliest it would open would be April 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=669.367s">that</a>  we would have the doses to actually start distributing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=674.43s">But</a>  that one of the sites of the main site, one of the main sites would be the Gansher Center at Tufts University, which is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=681.975s">And</a>  what they do allow us to do as a regional and we still haven't <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=687.078s">got</a>  the details figured out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=688.359s">We're</a>  still looking at MOUs and trying to do those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=692.742s">But</a>  the nice thing is that 25% of all doses can be put aside for our regional communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=701.689s">So</a>  that's a nice thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=703.01s">But</a>  you would access that site the same way you're going to access the new pre-registration site that the state's using. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=711.696s">That's</a>  the same way you would access this site now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=714.739s">But</a>  if you do that pre registration process, what it does is it puts you tries to get you an appointment in the closest mass vaccination site to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=725.548s">So</a>  it's not going to send you to Foxborough, when the next appointment opens, it's going to search for the closest appointment to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=731.273s">So</a>  once this regional site opens, and we're in that pre registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=736.998s">people</a>  here in Medford, that'll be the site that they'll be that they'll be looking for an appointment for for you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=747.44s">And</a>  as far as the you mentioned, the 25% is that 25% of the doses will go to Medford residents or is that regional communities?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=756.703s">It's</a>  regional, it's regional right now, but we haven't figured again, we haven't figured out the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=761.204s">So</a>  would we all regionally say, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=763.245s">subset</a>  of a community, like we're going to do 25% of everybody's 75 plus a or whatever, that those details again have not been, we just got the approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=774.09s">So</a>  we're still trying to work out those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=777.011s">But</a>  it's nice to have reserved doses for our area.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=780.913s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=781.773s">And</a>  as far as the two in a nutshell, who's responsible for like coordinating this and putting it together? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=789.516s">Would</a>  this be you?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=791.312s">Good</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=792.052s">No,</a>  if this is being the we've partnered with Cambridge Health Alliance, so they will actually be the ordering facility and handling all of the billing and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=803.379s">Again,</a>  when it comes to us trying to reserve at 25%. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=809.274s">That</a>  may be put back on the communities that may be put back on us as far as privatizing those 25% for a separate clinic as opposed to everybody in the state, being able to register for the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=823.306s">Does</a>  that make sense.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=824.767s">No,</a>  no, that makes sense it as far as the last questioning it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=828.09s">You</a>  mentioned I think, you know, working to, I think, trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=835.768s">just</a>  looking at my scribble notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=837.67s">As</a>  far as I believe you said we need to do more work with reaching out to some of our more diverse community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=844.095s">Did</a>  you say you're going that we're beginning to do some outreach or comment more on that.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=849.319s">Yeah,</a>  we are we're definitely doing that we're putting together some. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=855.434s">We're</a>  hoping to put together videos and pictures of people from diverse communities testimonials about getting their vaccine and maybe some of the hesitancy they may have had prior to but realizing it was a good thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=874.739s">those</a>  would be coming out shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=876.66s">And</a>  we have been doing this outreach, we have the resource line and multi languages we have, you know, we can answer people's questions if they want to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=886.162s">So</a>  we're hoping we're hoping to get more investment from those diverse communities into vaccinations.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=892.704s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=893.485s">And</a>  one last final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=894.705s">I</a>  just thought of this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=896.426s">Right</a>  now is City Hall open? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=898.446s">Is</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=899.427s">I</a>  know City Hall is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=900.287s">But</a>  as far as the number of employees, is it restricted to 50% or something like that?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=905.232s">still</a>  at the 50% capacity.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=908.194s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=908.574s">Is</a>  that going to be changing anytime soon? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=910.496s">Or</a>  is that if you could just have any on that?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=914.238s">It</a>  depends on what the state does. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=915.799s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know when that would happen.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=920.382s">Okay,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=921.423s">Thank</a>  you so much for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=922.464s">And</a>  now they can be a hard work to both you and to your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=924.906s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=927.788s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=929.108s">Thank</a>  you again, Marianne for being here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=931.987s">week</a>  after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=933.208s">I</a>  just have two questions Councilor Fargo actually asked a bunch of mine but going back to the groups which might have had vaccine hesitancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=940.755s">Has</a>  there been collaboration with community groups I know other cities are doing that working with trusted community groups to be a conduit to get people to get vaccines.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=948.767s">Yeah,</a>  that's what we're working on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=950.848s">Yeah,</a>  and that's what we have been working off the last several weeks actually, and doing some outreach in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=957.59s">So</a>  in West Bedford Community Center was a real good partner as far as trying to get us people registered for the vaccination clinics we were able to have, but we're still, yeah, we are definitely working with community groups.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=970.015s">Okay,</a>  great, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=970.975s">That's</a>  what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=972.216s">And</a>  then just other follow-up question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=975.84s">the</a>  vaccine numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=977.681s">How</a>  frequently do we think that'll be updated on the website?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=981.223s">So</a>  hopefully every week, I think it comes out on Thursday nights with this on the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=986.607s">So</a>  once now that we have this set up, it shouldn't be hard to just plug in the new numbers and have it updated the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=994.252s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=995.032s">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=995.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=997.534s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=997.914s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1002.677s">Um,</a>  Marianne, I just got one question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1005.081s">Um,</a>  you mentioned a number of the positive cases that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1008.706s">Do</a>  you have an age group or age range that those cases are in?</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1014.153s">It</a>  varies, obviously, but it's it's trending to the younger <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1019.513s">younger</a>  ages, and we are seeing a lot of younger cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1026.596s">About</a>  the senior school age and such. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1030.858s">Not,</a>  not as much with the seniors, it's really trending younger. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1034.22s">So</a>  both of the younger.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1036.401s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1036.801s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1037.761s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1038.342s">Any</a>  further questions, Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1039.342s">All</a>  right, motion to receive a place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1044.164s">Thank</a>  you, Marianne.</p>

    <p>[0SdCkR9KuqQ_SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1045.525s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1045.925s">Thanks</a>  for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1047.246s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1049.527s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1051.129s">While</a>  we're on this, Mr. Fadjen, can we look at number 21094, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1057.555s">Resolution</a>  21094.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1058.736s">We're</a>  already on suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1062.96s">21094,</a>  Department of Ed dates from the police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1067.104s">I</a>  see we have Chief Buckley and Commissioner Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1071.528s">Which</a>  one of you two gentlemen would like to go first?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1074.803s">I</a>  unmuted first, so I'll go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1076.786s">Thanks</a>  for having us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1078.528s">I</a>  love that view.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1079.269s">Mr.</a>  Kern, you got to get an office like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1081.932s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1082.713s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1093.102s">We</a>  have the Chief Buckley on to give us a department update. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1098.504s">Chief,</a>  would you like to give us an update?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1100.964s">Yeah,</a>  so first question I have for you is I was able to, it was late this afternoon, but provide a document to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1108.426s">I</a>  don't know if he provided that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1110.807s">We</a>  did receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1113.002s">It's</a>  a big document. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1113.863s">I</a>  know you probably don't have time to review it, but it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1116.544s">It's</a>  the 2020 crime statistics report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1120.087s">I'm</a>  not quite we haven't done in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1122.748s">I'm</a>  not sure that you have seen a document like this in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1127.631s">But</a>  this is an updated statistical report for everything that we've dealt with in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1133.655s">But</a>  this document provides a statistical comparison analysis and provides you <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1138.678s">statistics</a>  from 2017, 18, and 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1139.858s">So</a>  it gives you a kind of a four-year overview of sort of police operations and the criminal statistics that we would have in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1151.621s">One</a>  of the advantages we have, I have Rob McIntyre on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1156.842s">He's</a>  a crime analyst that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1158.682s">We</a>  hired him in 2019 and Rob has been tremendous for us to be able to provide <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1163.957s">not</a>  only to look at how we capture data, but to really project it onto chats and make it a lot more user-friendly and visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1172.341s">And</a>  so you're the first to sort of receive this document and it will be released publicly starting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1179.624s">It's</a>  somewhat good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1181.225s">I</a>  think we trend as everyone else has across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1184.647s">Crime</a>  is, even though we took more crime reports this year, crime tends to be down across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1191.69s">I</a>  will tell you that <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1193.611s">And</a>  I don't know how far you want to get into this right now, but I want to take a moment to thank the officers in the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1199.972s">There's</a>  one sort of like amazing statistic, and I'm going to give you just a few of them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1207.434s">Just</a>  pulling it up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1209.194s">One</a>  second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1210.794s">Calls</a>  for service to the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1214.095s">In</a>  2017, the Medford Police Department responded to 23,136 calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1223.907s">Come</a>  2019, we were up to 36,000 plus calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1229.53s">2020,</a>  slight dip, pandemic, 34,153 calls for service. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1236.134s">That's</a>  an increase of 12 to 13,000 calls for service per year for the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1242.298s">And</a>  one of the, I seem to be somewhat surprising, but there are some related factors, but emergency calls, our 911 calls, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1250.929s">2017,</a>  441 calls, 2018, 360 calls, 19 is 825 calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1251.93s">2020,</a>  we had 2,375 911 calls for emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1252.791s">So</a>  there is, there's a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1272.682s">there's</a>  a lot being put upon the police department these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1275.023s">We</a>  are in a national pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1276.664s">And</a>  as I started my sentence earlier, I just wanted to thank the men and women of the police department because they are working in under sort of extraordinary conditions and doing a phenomenal job. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1288.291s">And</a>  their workload is pretty much doubled in the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1291.453s">So</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1293.594s">can't</a>  pass up the opportunity to say, you know, thank you to all of the officers for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1300.319s">And</a>  if you have questions related to, I know this is somewhat, but Rob McIntyre is also present. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1306.243s">So</a>  if you have specific questions or statistical data on what can be gathered, I brought him here tonight to answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1311.227s">But</a>  I also have a detective Brooks Stanton Hurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1314.329s">Detective</a>  Stanton Hurd is our new domestic violence officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1318.052s">And</a>  over the last year to two years, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1323.031s">put</a>  together a new domestic violence initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1326.153s">And</a>  a lot of it was really fast-tracked when COVID hit in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1332.617s">And</a>  one of the things that we did in the city of Medford was to automatically go to an outreach for domestic violence through Detective Stanton and the Detective Bureau and the patrol division. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1345.664s">They</a>  all kind of came together. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1347.225s">We</a>  went out and reached out to our prior <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1352.555s">anyone</a>  who was listed on a prior domestic violence report to check in with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1356.718s">You</a>  know, there's a lot of concerns of, you know, when people are quarantined, whether they're together or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1362.622s">And</a>  so I think it's an extraordinary effort that was put together by the domestic violence unit in the Method Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1368.747s">So</a>  I brought her here tonight in case there was specific questions related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1374.301s">And,</a>  but I, you know, overall as a chief, I'm happy to finally get this document out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1378.224s">It</a>  is the plan has always been a plan to kind of keep statistics out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1381.607s">It'll</a>  get out on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1383.548s">I'm</a>  sure it will get out to the media and we want to be able to provide this sort of statistical facts to the city on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1394.257s">And</a>  we now have the opportunity afforded the ability with our crime statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1400.322s">Any</a>  questions as it relates to that?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1405.658s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you were first, then Mike.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1408.92s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1410.181s">And</a>  I want to thank my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this on the agenda to get an update, starting with the police chief, the fire chief, and the commissioner of DPW, and moving on to other departments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1427.615s">I</a>  think it's always helpful to get information from our department heads <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1433.27s">especially</a>  the ones that we don't run into too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1436.594s">Chief,</a>  this is the first thorough crime statistic report that I've seen in the last 20 years, and it's much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1444.599s">And,</a>  you know, I'm always looking as one member of the council, when I get emails and concerns from constituents regarding traffic controls, regarding speeding and regarding other issues of concern, such as crime and so forth in certain neighborhoods, this information would be most valuable to have to be able to report back to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1468.187s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1470.087s">And</a>  I think you did mention that it's on your <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1473.298s">website,</a>  is that correct, Chief?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1475.059s">It</a>  will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1475.519s">I'm</a>  hoping by tomorrow, it's beyond my technical capabilities, but I'm sure you're the first to really receive this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1483.242s">So</a>  it will be put out publicly and on the website, hopefully tomorrow, but by the end of the week, definitely.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1489.924s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1490.624s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1492.625s">And</a>  I too want to thank the brave men and women of the police department for all they do on behalf of our community in these trying times. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1500.928s">It's</a>  not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1502.165s">to</a>  be a public safety official. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1504.626s">And</a>  they've been doing tremendous work on behalf of keeping our residents safe as well as their personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1513.729s">And</a>  it doesn't go unrecognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1516.129s">Chief,</a>  I had just a couple of basic questions that I was wondering if you can answer, not regarding crime statistics, but a general follow up from the meeting that we had, this council met on site <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1530.795s">on</a>  Fulton Spring Road back some several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1533.816s">And</a>  I know along with the Traffic Commission and yourself, there's been much improvement made to that area regarding signage, regarding pedestrian crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1546.065s">And</a>  one thing that I think we still need to follow up, Chief, and I've had this discussion with you, was regarding resident-only access on Fels Ave, Fulton Spring Road, Murray Hill Road, Fels Ave Terrace, Grover Road, and that particular vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1564.7s">I</a>  understand that some of the state roads lead into that road, and it may be difficult to put signs, but I think that's one missing component <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1574.392s">of</a>  creating an area. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1575.653s">I</a>  think we promised residents that we were going to try to eliminate the cut through traffic the best way we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1584.116s">And</a>  I think the resident only access <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1587.253s">may</a>  not be a solve all, but it'll definitely help. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1590.274s">So</a>  that is my first question, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1592.575s">And</a>  I know you said you're going to review and look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1594.596s">I</a>  was wondering if you had the opportunity to do so.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1597.377s">So</a>  we have started that review and we're probably a little bit behind on it, but we'll continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1603.06s">And</a>  I can get you an update on that through my traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1607.001s">But</a>  we had talked, maybe it was a month ago, councilor, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1612.133s">you</a>  know, there are some valid concerns up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1613.994s">It's</a>  the state road access, and then it's obviously, if you close these streets off to residents only, where does the overflow go? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1621.197s">Because</a>  we want to only, we don't want to only just concentrate on the area of the problem, but where we will create additional problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1628.44s">So</a>  it's not an easy problem to solve and an easy task, and we've gone at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1637.175s">and</a>  attack the problem a number of different ways up there with the street markets and the patrols. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1640.776s">I</a>  think it has had some improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1642.836s">I</a>  have received some, you know, thank yous and notes of positivity as it relates to the traffic up there in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1651.639s">But</a>  I don't have a solution yet on those signs and we are still working on it, but I will be sure to keep you up to date on that.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1659.941s">That</a>  would be much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1661.461s">And</a>  let me tell you the response I got from residents so far <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1665.232s">Many</a>  residents are happy, and I'm sure Councilor Falco, who lives in the area can attest to it, are very happy with some of the progress that has been made to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1675.044s">I</a>  just think we have to close the loop on some of the other major issues of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1682.092s">That</a>  would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1683.987s">My</a>  other question, Chief, over the last year, I know there's probably been an uptick, at least from the calls I've received in the community, but because of COVID, the fact that people are home now 24-7, I think you see a lot of particular things escalating that may not have happened during other times, but because of COVID, I think it's escalating some of this within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1712.928s">And</a>  I get a fair amount of calls from residents that may have issues with a neighbor or someone a couple of doors down and don't know how to resolve an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1723.195s">And</a>  for whatever reason, they can't get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1726.257s">And</a>  I think it's important, Chief, and I'm not sure if this is currently being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1731.02s">I</a>  know I mentioned it to you before, having some type of community mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1736.265s">where</a>  the police can intervene on certain instances that may require them to get two parties together to somewhat come to a resolve, so it doesn't come to something other than a peaceful resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1752.152s">And</a>  that would be my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1754.353s">I</a>  was just wondering, Chief, is there any type of community mediation program that exists? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1759.795s">If</a>  not, is that something you'd be interested in moving forward in this community?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1767.063s">In</a>  a different way, we do community mediation, but we have to be careful about getting the police department involved in civil matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1772.565s">So</a>  for example, if there's two neighbors who are arguing over tree or a fence, we wouldn't necessarily want to step in as a lawful authority, but the theory of mediation in the community, I think is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1785.629s">And</a>  I just think it would have to involve a lot of other different parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1790.271s">And</a>  if we have to be a party or present at the table, I think that that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1795.881s">absolutely</a>  something that we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1797.182s">You</a>  know, we do a lot of community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1799.963s">We</a>  have our domestic violence teams and, you know, we have, we collaborate completely with all other organizations and, you know, from mental health organizations to domestic violence organizations to our hospitals and our EMT personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1819.495s">And</a>  we meet regularly to solve a lot of the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1822.356s">So,</a>  well, that is sort of sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1825.493s">you</a>  know, focused on specific clients, I don't imagine that something along those lines is impossible to do for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1833.455s">It's</a>  just, it's a tenuous thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1835.315s">I</a>  would request that legal, you know, somebody of legal authority be there because a lot of what we see in neighbor disputes is civil and we have very little authority when it comes to it and we just have to be careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1846.457s">But</a>  I guess if we're talking generalities in theory, I'm all on board with <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1852.325s">making</a>  a nicer, peaceful city, but I think we have to take sort of baby steps as we get there and how we handle this.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1859.466s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1860.146s">I</a>  think we're on the same page and I look forward to working with you to try to develop something in the community that we can use on a local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1869.988s">And</a>  I appreciate the fact that, you know, there are certain items that we can't get involved in, but there are other items that I think we could successfully mediate, especially as the police department <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1882.032s">position</a>  of authority can help assist, maybe ease some of the tension that may exist in certain areas and among certain neighbors and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1892.119s">So</a>  I think that would be a useful tool to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1895.441s">Chief,</a>  I have a lot of other questions I'm gonna reserve to our budget meetings, and it's regarding personnel and your maintenance and regarding your vehicles and so forth, and I will reserve that <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1911.28s">to</a>  when we meet for budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1913.341s">I</a>  appreciate your time.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1914.781s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1915.401s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1917.322s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1920.123s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1921.143s">Yeah,</a>  thanks to the chief for being here tonight and the detectives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1924.464s">I</a>  do have a question based on, I didn't get the report you're referencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1928.785s">I</a>  don't know if just hard copies were delivered so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1931.066s">So</a>  apologies if this is in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1934.278s">But</a>  I did have residents reaching out very much to your point of concerns of domestic violence increasing in light of the pandemic, people being stuck in living situations, being stuck at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1945.428s">So</a>  I'm curious if there is data related to that calls as far as domestic violence and how that's been addressed, if that can be shared or to the extent that it can be shared.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1955.477s">Well,</a>  so there's some information that we can share. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1958.58s">Interestingly</a>  enough in 2020, and I <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1961.483s">you</a>  know, we're going March through till current into 2021 that COVID has been present. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1966.865s">We</a>  really didn't see an uptick in domestic violence cases, but we have seen from 2019 to 2020 an increase in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1976.089s">But</a>  I think the person who probably we could talk to, and I think has a lot to do with why our numbers are down, because we have such an outreach and involvement in partnerships with organizations is Detective Brooke Stanton-Heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=1991.488s">If</a>  Mr. President, if you would allow for her to speak on the matter just a little bit, she could probably go a little bit further into answering the question of the Councilor, would she see it as a primary domestic, excuse me, domestic violence officer?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2006.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2008.02s">Detective</a>  Rastead. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2010.661s">Hi,</a>  can you guys hear me?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2012.623s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2015.044s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2016.425s">So</a>  we did address a little bit of that in the packet about domestic violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2020.809s">Personally,</a>  it was a large concern of mine during the pandemic that people will be stuck at home, they're not going to be able to get the help that they usually would go into school or work and seeing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2030.676s">So</a>  what we did is we created a domestic violence follow-up team. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2034.539s">What</a>  we did with that is detectives like myself, my partner, my boss, and other patrol officers actually called any victims from the past year just to even just check in. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2043.686s">I</a>  also created a domestic violence follow-up packet that is now being distributed to all <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2049.67s">domestic</a>  violence calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2051.391s">Inside</a>  the packet, it has an example where it shows different ways they can get help, like telling the public about text 911, where you can real time text a dispatcher and the person you're with may not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2062.454s">I</a>  also updated information on safe houses, other resources like Portal to Hope that we work with that will help them get resources if they're maybe not the most comfortable going to law enforcement, because unfortunately, sometimes people want help, but they don't want it to rise to the level of legal action. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2079.98s">So</a>  we gave them various resources from getting help from us as well as through other communities around us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2086.303s">We</a>  also did see through doing this that we were able to get at least 10 definitive new reports that would have gone unreported otherwise if we didn't check in with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2096.286s">But</a>  we also had <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2097.987s">a</a>  ton of other people who have recently moved from Medford who had new domestic violence incidents, and we were able to contact outside resources to make sure that they followed up with those individuals and got them the help they needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2110.662s">So</a>  although we may not have all the numbers just for Medford, I know of at least 15 other incidents that I called and I had those departments reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2119.791s">And</a>  even if somebody didn't have a new crime or they didn't want to report a new crime, most of the people we spoke to said that they were willing to get these new packets and I mailed them to people, I emailed them to people, and now they're also being distributed. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2132.399s">So</a>  that even if they're not open to getting help right now, they at least can have this in their back pocket for future or if they have a friend who needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2141.705s">I</a>  know we also did put some things out on social media about listening from home and calling 9-1-1 or texting 9-1-1 if you have concerns about a neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2149.83s">So</a>  the response has been pretty good from the public, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2153.072s">Aside</a>  from that, we also got some numbers of old people who were still in contact with abusers or quarantined at home with abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2160.577s">Just</a>  for in the future, if we get a call from them, we can know, okay, this person is not able to get help because they're quarantined at home with somebody who used to abuse them in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2168.862s">So</a>  I thought it was very useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2172.003s">Moving</a>  forward, also, just to kind of wrap it up, I also created a high-risk assessment tool where officers or detectives, when they go to a domestic violence call, we can actually use 14 questions that are yes, no, and kind of assess how high on the scale for re-offense they may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2188.39s">Or</a>  if there's someone who's been through us multiple times, we can see if behavior is escalating and address it <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2194.352s">more</a>  carefully so we can get them the resources they might need. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2198.195s">And</a>  we're keeping all of those in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2199.777s">They're</a>  obviously not public information, but it helps us be able to understand our victims better and better serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2207.163s">Oh,</a>  and the last thing, I'm sorry, I also, we have a strangulation worksheet as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2210.746s">So</a>  if there is a strangulation incident, we can better document it and have all of the injuries and have a better response for those kinds of very serious crimes.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2222.587s">Thank</a>  you for that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2223.648s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2224.87s">And</a>  just for, you know, the department's attention to this specifically and work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2229.135s">And</a>  thanks for highlighting the text 911, because obviously, you know, if people are trapped at home, you know, or stuck at home, it's difficult to actually make those phone calls in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2239.802s">feel</a>  safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2240.442s">So</a>  I'm curious how, how do people learn about the existence of that program? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2246.106s">How</a>  is that pushed out? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2247.067s">Just</a>  letting people I know it's kind of like a challenging thing to let people know about the texting program for text 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2252.31s">Oops.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2259.347s">Sorry,</a>  I think I unmuted myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2261.447s">So</a>  every time I speak with somebody through domestic violence, when I do my follow up investigations, I inform them of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2267.829s">But</a>  it's also a part of this packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2269.669s">So</a>  when you're able to get a hard copy of it, it actually has a list of domestic violence resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2275.231s">And</a>  the second one, aside from calling 911, I've listed text 911, which explains that it's an alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2282.172s">to</a>  contact and also what I did is I created a packet for the officers who were doing these follow-up calls and I kind of had a script for them to read kind of an explanation for it if they even weren't familiar with it and I explained to them that it works outside of Medford as well and if <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2299.657s">for</a>  some reason they try to use text number one, it's not in an area that accepts it, it'll actually send a text message back so that they don't think that they're getting help when they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2308.342s">So</a>  I've been having officers explain that to people, I've been explaining it to people, and it's now on this packet that goes out to every domestic violence call so that even if people are just looking through it, it might be a useful tool that people can tell others about and try and get as much safe help without alerting the possible abuser they may be in the situation with.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2328.152s">Great,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2330.814s">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2331.314s">Thank</a>  you both.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2332.555s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2333.055s">And</a>  I know Detective Stanton explained it very clearly, but all our offices now are up to date in this and they carry this package. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2338.799s">Even</a>  if it's a question of abuse or something along those lines, they hand those things out, the packets out so that there's a clear understanding to all parties involved in these cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2349.426s">So</a>  we do get it out there as best we can.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2352.788s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2354.77s">Councilor</a>  Scott, I apologize for taking you out of track.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2359.705s">Sorry,</a>  Mr. President, you've lost my vote, but that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2364.81s">First</a>  of all, Chief, thanks for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2366.551s">I</a>  think that one of the biggest questions, what are we asking chiefs and department heads to come out for? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2371.796s">And</a>  one of the discussions we talked about every time we meet, it's usually about budget and it's, you know, we need this, or can we give you this? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2378.923s">But</a>  I think that it's important that we <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2381.328s">spent</a>  some time talking about what, you know, the information you gave us today, I had a brief opportunity to look through and it's pretty amazing what numbers can show you and how well our police department works with our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2397.015s">And,</a>  you know, I know that, you know, you talk about so many of your officers doing so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2402.497s">I</a>  know Councilor Falco really pushed for the community meetings and hopefully they get started again. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2407.719s">I</a>  know we have Officer Rory Rockowitz, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2410.563s">works</a>  and method cares about prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2413.367s">Officer</a>  Rudolph we've had here to talk about 9-1-1 and any issues and concerns and that he put to rest and, you know, talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2423.01s">Officer</a>  Hartnett and Officer Brooks and Sergeant is talking about probably the biggest phone calls we get the most dealing with traffic issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2432.277s">It's</a>  great to see the Civil Rights Division now with Officer Purifuri having someone there in place and you really see and then, you know, one unbelievable addition and Officer Stanton Hurd and domestic violence <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2451.789s">and</a>  having her on board, I think that there's a common thread here that Method Police really do work well with our community and they hear what our needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2464.115s">And</a>  if there is something there, you're a chief that's willing to really work together with the community to make sure that if there is something that people need to talk about or that aren't being heard, you're ready to jump in <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2476.804s">and</a>  into action. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2479.605s">So</a>  again, these are the reasons why that having these meetings, Council Member Mox had some great questions and you gave a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2487.707s">And</a>  I just want to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2489.167s">I</a>  don't want to continue with the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2491.768s">I</a>  know some of the others have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2493.589s">I</a>  just, if I can, I do have one question for Officer Stanton Hurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2501.571s">Can</a>  she tell us who her favorite high school softball coach was?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2506.349s">Oh</a>  boy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2506.809s">I</a>  honestly knew that was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2508.271s">I</a>  knew it was coming, Mr. Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2512.354s">Okay,</a>  are you just saying my name? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2514.175s">Is</a>  it Coach Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2515.156s">It's</a>  you, I promise it's you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2517.158s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2517.839s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2520.08s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2521.902s">I</a>  probably could, you know, comment on everything you said, but I think you said it eloquently. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2526.326s">And</a>  I just want to say that, you know, we understand that we faced a lot this year and there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2533.064s">There's</a>  a lot being asked of the police department, and there's a lot that the police department have to be responsive and responsible to. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2540.507s">And</a>  we are moving in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2542.188s">I</a>  just openly say on behalf of all the officers, we're working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2545.949s">We</a>  just want to work with people to come up with solutions and resolve matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2551.131s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2553.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2553.992s">Councilor</a>  Parker.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2555.853s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2556.913s">And</a>  I'd like to thank my colleagues for asking some great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2562.208s">I</a>  thank Chief Buckley for his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2565.009s">And</a>  also thank the woman and men of the Medford Police Department for all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2571.131s">I</a>  think especially over the past year with COVID, it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2576.994s">And</a>  I know the number of calls that I'm looking through this report, it's really amazing to look at the data, look at the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2584.637s">I</a>  know there's a slight dip this past year, but I think probably a lot of the calls were a lot more challenging as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2591.461s">with</a>  COVID and it's, you know, it's amazing how, you know, you put your own safety and well-being on the line every day, you know, in a normal day, and then you put COVID into it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2602.949s">I</a>  know it's been a very challenging year, but I want to thank you for your leadership and all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2608.613s">And</a>  thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2610.594s">This</a>  is really, I mean, I love to see data and this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2614.176s">You</a>  can look at this over the past three, four years, and you can really see <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2618.798s">the</a>  uptick in the number of calls and it's, you know, I haven't had a chance to really read it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2625.021s">I</a>  may have just received it when I came to the meeting, but I know I'll be reading it over and I'll definitely be giving you a call probably with more in-depth questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2633.965s">I</a>  also wanted to thank Detective Stanton, especially this domestic violence piece in the back of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2641.468s">It's</a>  really good to take a look at this documentation to see what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2647.005s">And,</a>  you know, it helps answer a lot of questions that sometimes people might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2651.528s">And,</a>  but Chief Buckley, if I may, really quick, and I know this is just because, like I said, I haven't had a chance to really digest this report yet, but when you look at this report, do you see, is there like a number one issue or number one concern or top one, two, three list of things that you would be concerned about or think need to be addressed?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2675.041s">know,</a>  I think that's an interesting question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2677.782s">I</a>  think we're always concerned with the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2679.842s">Our</a>  numbers are always going to be up on crimes of assault, crimes of theft and crimes of property damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2690.005s">And,</a>  you know, we used to say in policing that, you know, you know, more police more reactive, you know, to this sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2697.026s">And</a>  I don't know that that necessarily <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2700.229s">is</a>  proven to have worked out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2701.79s">But</a>  I do think that police officers being part of the community and educating the community brings crime down, right in a visible presence, not just standing there as police officers, but being absorbed into the community helps to address those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2714.994s">So</a>  those are sort of the things that we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2717.415s">And</a>  I think it's finding when you collaborate with your partners in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2723.037s">whether</a>  it's not just the municipal partners like the schools and the DPW and the fire, but with your hospitals and your mental health and your substance use disorder agencies, that you really start to have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2734.161s">And</a>  we have to find different ways of policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2736.802s">And</a>  I think we're really doing a good job of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2739.583s">And,</a>  you know, I know I'll get teased a little bit about this, but I don't know how many of you saw the WH, it's in the back of my report, but WHCH listed Medford as the fourth safest <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2751.934s">largest</a>  city in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2755.697s">And</a>  I'd like to tell you that I'm proud of that, but, which I am, but I think all the credit goes to the police officers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2766.264s">You</a>  know, COVID was tough and, you know, you, you're out there publicly and you, when this first came out, you didn't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2775.148s">It</a>  was scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2776.288s">And</a>  our officers and others, the firefighters and the Method Police Department and their EMTs and the nurses and doctors, there was a lot of us that were out there in the public, but it was a tough job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2786.33s">And</a>  it was an experience that, you know, I hope we don't have to relive, but I can speak directly to the officers of this police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2795.212s">They</a>  came to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2796.192s">They</a>  weren't taking sick time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2797.632s">They</a>  weren't taking vacation time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2800.253s">They</a>  showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2801.839s">They</a>  responded to calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2803.4s">I'm</a>  telling you, I don't have the statistical data to back this up, but I swear we were the busiest police department around. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2809.485s">No</a>  doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2809.905s">I</a>  talked to other chiefs and our officers just really, they went above and beyond during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2820.793s">And</a>  it was also during a time where, you know, we weren't exactly looked upon as, you know, man's best friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2826.176s">And</a>  so, but they kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2829.642s">you</a>  know, they come to work and they do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2831.663s">And</a>  I think it's very altruistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2833.284s">And</a>  I think it's very, you know, they signed up for this and they know it and they do their job and they do it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2839.187s">So</a>  it gives me an opportunity to thank them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2842.508s">And</a>  I probably don't get to do that too much publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2845.529s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that that was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2848.991s">But</a>  those few things you'll see are <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2851.408s">that</a>  I talked about, property crimes, assaults, and lastly, things that as police officers, you're looking out for, but they're interacting more with people now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2859.929s">And</a>  as COVID goes away, we're able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2861.79s">And</a>  community meetings will help, and we can talk about these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2865.05s">And</a>  once we have these community meetings, one of the things that I like is that the community starts to talk back to us and says, hey, chief, you know, there's people hanging here, and we're worried about this, and, you know, there's crimes that are occurring at this park, and we get more intelligence, and those all work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2879.213s">So,</a>  you know, as COVID, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2881.336s">Quiet's</a>  down, I knock on wood because I don't like this plateau that we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2887.179s">Maryann</a>  would kick me if I say this, but I want to be able to bring people back together and have these conversations as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2893.522s">But</a>  lastly, I just want to say one other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2895.263s">We</a>  thank a whole lot of people in the police department, but this crime report wouldn't have been done if it wasn't for Rob McIntyre, and he's on here tonight, and I know you probably don't have many questions for him because he's kind of that statistical, he calls himself a nerd, but I can't thank him enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2909.97s">I</a>  can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2910.79s">I</a>  mean, I can pull, they can give me data all day long, but to put it together and make it read well and look well in charts and documents, Rob has been an all-star for us in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2920.393s">And</a>  so his presence and his work ethic allow us to be able to continue to give documents like this to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2927.795s">We're</a>  going to try to push these out more and more on a, you know, if we can do quarterly basis, we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2934.317s">And</a>  then we'll have the year end kind of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2939.116s">I</a>  hope I answered your question, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2940.657s">I</a>  kind of went off a little.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2943.638s">Chief,</a>  that was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2944.658s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2945.258s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2946.239s">And</a>  thank you to Rob for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2949.24s">I</a>  deal with a lot of this type of work where I work during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2955.202s">And</a>  a lot of time, effort, and energy goes into stuff like this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2959.844s">And</a>  you can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2960.824s">And</a>  the report, just by going through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2965.073s">I</a>  mean, it tells a story and, you know, about the hard work that you in the department go through on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2970.577s">So</a>  I just want to thank you for your leadership and your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2974.901s">And</a>  like I said, I'm going to go through this more thoroughly and I'll be calling you with some additional questions, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2982.066s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2984.949s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2986.25s">Thank</a>  you, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2986.79s">And</a>  I actually do have a question or two for Rob. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2988.832s">So</a>  I hope he'll be, he'll be ready to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2993.855s">And</a>  I want to answer these questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2996.858s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2998.9s">So</a>  just jumping into the statistics, real quickly, and I'll get you unmuted, Rob. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3004.845s">I</a>  haven't had a chance to look at the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3006.286s">So</a>  I'm sorry if I'm asking questions that you actually answer in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3010.169s">But,</a>  you know, that 2020 911 call number really stood out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3014.953s">It's</a>  such a huge increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3017.885s">Do</a>  you break that down at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3018.886s">Was</a>  a lot of that around medical emergencies, you know, people calling because of they were afraid they're sick with COVID or, you know, any other statistics on why the 911 calls jumped so much?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3031.594s">I</a>  didn't really break it out as far as what the 911 calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3036.077s">I</a>  mean, that's certainly something we can do if there's questions on it to determine what types of calls were involved there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3045.143s">Most</a>  of the information on that, part of it is our records management system. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3051.044s">The</a>  911 calls are better recorded, especially now that we're in the new building with a good system. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3057.765s">We're</a>  really making sure we're keeping track of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3061.086s">We've</a>  done a lot of work with the department since I came on in 2019 to really improve our record keeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3071.992s">Every</a>  report that you see, all 1,660 that went through that were reported as actual crimes in this report, there's a number of other reports too that we took for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3083.701s">I</a>  read every single one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3087.043s">I</a>  checked them for, we use a coding system around that, and the FBI sends out a guidebook on the National Incident-Based Reporting System. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3099.072s">I</a>  review that and then determine based off the call and the definition that they give which kind of bucket it fits into. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3106.214s">But</a>  there's a lot of data points that go with that too because the FBI also tracks age of offenders, relationships, they track what property was taken, what type of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3118.528s">If</a>  there was a relationship involved, what kind of location it is, date, time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3124.753s">The</a>  system we have does a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3128.016s">But</a>  what the FBI hasn't tracked, we've kind of implemented our own system. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3135.063s">So</a>  next year, you should see numbers for what kind of outreach and referrals we did around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3141.747s">We're</a>  doing a number on our, we added 13 questions at the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, which is why it's not included in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3153.315s">And</a>  it's 13 questions looking for if there's <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3157.967s">if</a>  there's domestic violence, if there's mental health issues, if there's substance abuse, if it involves someone who's elderly, if it involves children, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3167.853s">So</a>  really my big focus is on getting the right data and trying to present it as best I can, so.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3179.261s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3180.081s">I'm</a>  sorry to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3180.842s">If</a>  I could just add, he's being slightly modest because a lot of this is, it's a lot of hard work and it's a lot of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3188.903s">patients</a>  involved, but one of the things that we're changing around here, and a lot of it's thanks to Rob, is your data out is only good as data in. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3197.027s">So</a>  we're trying to really change how we capture the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3200.849s">As</a>  years go on, and the months go on, we're going to start really producing better documents than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3208.032s">I</a>  hope one day someone looks back at this and says, ah, look what they've done since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3212.868s">he's</a>  going to lead us into that direction and really work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3215.869s">I</a>  will add one last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3217.07s">And</a>  I am, you know, like I said, I was surprised that the 911 calls, but there's also another factor here that we're not sure how much it plays into, but 911 wireless calling services have also, the technology has increased and the E911 capabilities where before, if you dialed 911 on your phone, you would go to a state police directory and then it would be rerouted and come through different phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3238.817s">Now</a>  we have the capability, wherever you are in Method, if you dial 9-1-1, you're getting them at the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3243.88s">And</a>  that absolutely has played to some of the uptick in those calls, and it should be noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=3248.882s">And</a>  I don't think we can really, right now, tell how much of an impact, but there certainly was, during the national pandemic, a very large uptick in that number of calls.</p>
