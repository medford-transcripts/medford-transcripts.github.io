1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:08,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling to order meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on the evening of July 9th, 2024, 6.30pm.

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,441
[SPEAKER_02]: We are meeting hybrid.

3
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:14,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us are in person in City Hall and some of us are meeting via Zoom.

4
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:20,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And a recording of the meeting will be made as soon as possible afterward.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:30,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And so 1st, before we get started, I wanted to welcome a brand new member that we have joining us.

6
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:31,944
[SPEAKER_02]: That is out of gunning.

7
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:35,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to take a moment to introduce yourself?

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

9
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.

10
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:39,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.

11
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.

12
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:47,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a therapist by day, mom by, I guess, 24 hours a day.

13
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:57,970
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I come to CPC stuff, just from being involved in the community and seeing all the projects happening and getting excited about them.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to be here, happy to learn from you guys.

15
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:01,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

16
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,152
[SPEAKER_11]: We're so happy to have you here.

17
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:04,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

18
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:05,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

19
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:15,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'd like to start the agenda this evening with a small grant application review from the Winthrop street community gardens.

20
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe we have Georgiana here to present a request.

21
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to make a motion to approve the proposal.

22
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:27,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I move to approve the proposal.

23
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:59,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And this pergola project is to both enhance the garden itself so that community members can enjoy being down by the riverside and then also being another space where there can be gatherings to learn about

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:16,904
[SPEAKER_10]: the environment, the effects and importance of growing local foods, as well as the different ways in which the community is helping to keep Medford healthy with the pollinators that are continuing to keep the vegetation around the river alive.

25
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:20,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, thank you.

26
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:27,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And currently right now, Georgetown, there's like little to no shade in this entire garden space, correct?

27
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:29,727
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

28
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:38,010
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to say over the years of being a member there, it was I think in the last couple of years, there was more asphalt added around our community garden.

29
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:48,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that has increased the temperature in the area, which this year, too, with overall rising temperature has made it quite challenging to keep our soil

30
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,212
[SPEAKER_10]: moist and keep our vegetation growing.

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And so yes, there would be great to have this additional shade for people.

32
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:08,302
[SPEAKER_10]: But then also just in that general area along that extended walkway that happened along the river there for people to actually find some shade as they want to enjoy just being outdoors in that area.

33
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:20,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, I just wanted to ask for some clarification Teresa in our application materials.

34
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:22,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we.

35
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:30,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we changed the guidelines for the small grant program?

36
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I recall that it was originally.

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:40,659
[SPEAKER_02]: $5000 max CPA ask that can be matched with outside funding for up to $10,000.

38
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, so this is coming through as an off-cycle application.

39
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:46,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an off-cycle application.

40
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's not a small grant, it's an off-cycle application.

41
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

42
00:03:53,248 --> 00:04:05,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The community gardens, as much as they try to fundraise, Georgiana, I think you can confirm with me that the coffers are lean there, so there's not much in the way of matched money available.

43
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:06,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

44
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:08,396
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

45
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:09,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

46
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:17,705
[SPEAKER_10]: The garden is supported by member fees, and we try to keep that affordable so that anyone can participate in being a community garden member.

47
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:24,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, are there other questions from committee members?

48
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:29,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sorry.

49
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:51,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I read the proposal, and I was going to ask Georgiana if it said that the pergola comes assembled or they'll assemble it, but I realized that it needed a footing, and I was wondering who was going to provide the footing.

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,621
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, the $10,000 seems like a reasonable amount,

51
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:08,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Just putting that together, it still needs supporting in order to last for at least the six years that they proposed for it.

52
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:11,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

53
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you clearly know more about construction than I do.

54
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:20,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So in terms of the footings, they would need to be there for security reasons as far as I know, right?

55
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:28,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So that the structure does not fall over and it also doesn't blow out of the ground and hit someone or go into the river and become debris.

56
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:33,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're looking at how we can purchase kits

57
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:39,558
[SPEAKER_10]: because kits would be more affordable and the less than $5,000 range for the actual pergola.

58
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:52,261
[SPEAKER_10]: That would leave us about 5,000 or so to do the footings in a way that also align with the environmental standards for putting in footings into the ground because of the distance that the location for the pergola is to the river.

59
00:05:54,482 --> 00:06:03,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Be looking definitely for additional support around any existing vendors who are working to do that kind of work in the city and know how to make sure that it's compliant

60
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,726
[SPEAKER_10]: to one, be safe, and two, being environmentally safe as well.

61
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that answer your question?

62
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, you need another $5,000?

63
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is the kit $5,000, and the cost of the footing $5,000?

64
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,370
[SPEAKER_05]: The latter.

65
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to understand.

66
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:23,271
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

67
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:24,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, correct.

68
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So the latter.

69
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:31,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So the kit would be $5,000, and then the footing to be able to install the kit and secure it would be $5,000.

70
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.

71
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:34,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

72
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:35,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand you.

73
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

74
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:36,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

75
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

76
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:41,308
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually a very good question that you opened.

77
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

78
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there someone else?

79
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:51,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good question that you opened with, Reg, because you asked who would be installing the footing.

80
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,739
[SPEAKER_05]: The company said that they would.

81
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, according to the application, the company would do it.

82
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also indicated that they needed a footing.

83
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

84
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So that doesn't actually match with what I see in the application.

85
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:11,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an amendment to the application?

86
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:16,368
[SPEAKER_11]: So the application, and Georgiana, feel free to correct me here.

87
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:25,414
[SPEAKER_11]: It has the pergola kit from New England Outdoor at $8,600, and then the base and footings at $1,400 for a total of $10,000.

88
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,956
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you're seeing, Joan?

89
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:27,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:28,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

91
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:37,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe the numbers, Georgiana, weren't 50-50, it was split 8,600 for the kit and then 1,400 for the footings?

92
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:41,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that was at the time of submitting the application.

93
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:51,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I did more research around what the cost would be with some potential vendors that are already working with the city of Medford, it looked like the cost was going to be more than that $1,400.

94
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: They were not able to do a project for that cost.

95
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,281
[SPEAKER_10]: That wasn't something that they would do.

96
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:16,832
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know how that factors into this conversation, but it is a piece that would need to, I guess, be adjusted because of the environmental concerns and then also the scope of a project that vendors would be willing to take on to actually install the footings.

97
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:21,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

98
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:29,590
[SPEAKER_07]: It does to me, but I feel like the application then now isn't complete.

99
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,672
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some missing information.

100
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not clear information.

101
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:40,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

102
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,322
[SPEAKER_10]: It was my understanding that I couldn't.

103
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:50,826
[SPEAKER_10]: really engage further with vendors of the city without having an actual project.

104
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:59,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to do a guesstimate because they said I cannot give you a complete number until we've engaged.

105
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:10,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a range of 1,400 to 5,000, but the more I press and said, guys, it'd be really helpful to know so that I can have an accurate conversation tonight.

106
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:18,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I then was told, yeah, it's more likely to be closer to 5,000 because we do not do small projects for the $1,400.

107
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:31,516
[SPEAKER_10]: So that wasn't anything that I was able to ascertain at the time of submitting the application because I was not provided that information until I continued to press and press and press.

108
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:40,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Knowing that this conversation today was going to happen, I didn't realize as part of the application itself that I should have maybe gotten some.

109
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:47,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Contract quotes from these vendors, if that would have been helpful, I would have been happy to do that.

110
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:50,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Deb?

111
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,644
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with Georgiana.

112
00:09:53,864 --> 00:10:06,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just my back of the envelope calculations, $1,400 for what I assume are four cast in place or even precast concrete footings, that sounds way too low to me.

113
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,671
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't feel in the right ballpark for what it should cost.

114
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an actual image of the trellis that you can put on screen?

115
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see that in the package, but I might have missed it.

116
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:18,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a kit.

117
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:24,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that there were photos included.

118
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:25,217
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.

119
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:31,939
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't get that to you, I'm driving, but I'd be happy to share that if that would be helpful.

120
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:39,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it will prevent us from voting on it if everyone feels comfortable, but I think it's important that people understand what this thing is.

121
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:46,584
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard to understand it now, but the need is clear to me and I think that

122
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:54,991
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you think you can do the 10,000 to cover everything, the footing and the kit, I don't see a big issue here.

123
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:58,933
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

124
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:08,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, and I'm going to keep my video off because my internet has been freezing when I turn it video on, so apologies.

125
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,505
[SPEAKER_08]: not a deal breaker, but I'm curious.

126
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:20,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fairly familiar with the community garden and I didn't see a map of the garden.

127
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,772
[SPEAKER_08]: You're cutting out, Ari.

128
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:33,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ari is saying that there's no map of where to go.

129
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

130
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:39,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I can pull up a satellite view really quick here.

131
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to interject while Teresa pulls up the satellite view.

132
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:51,364
[SPEAKER_02]: A question about the... Oh, go ahead.

133
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:53,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

134
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it into the chat.

135
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:58,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like you didn't hear me.

136
00:11:59,048 --> 00:11:59,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

137
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not it.

138
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:06,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, folks.

139
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I really hate having the two screens here.

140
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Continue your thought there, Roberta.

141
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, maybe somebody can read what Ari wrote into the chat while you look for that.

142
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Where in the garden?

143
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:20,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

144
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:21,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is where I'm looking at.

145
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: We intuited that's what you were trying to get at.

146
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:25,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

147
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:27,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

148
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:33,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm struggling is what I'm doing, Rich.

149
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:44,584
[SPEAKER_11]: See this.

150
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody see in the garden as a satellite view?

151
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:48,905
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

152
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.

153
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now I see it.

154
00:12:52,286 --> 00:13:03,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So right where it says the Mystic River path here, and then there's a cluster of trees, the pergola would go in that very exposed area between the two clusters of trees.

155
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe tuck a little bit underneath there, but that's the general area.

156
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Georgiana and I walked it together.

157
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for pulling that up.

158
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:17,909
[SPEAKER_11]: This was a 12 by 12.

159
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:23,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Structure 12 foot by 12 foot.

160
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:26,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what yes, I think that's what you estimated that.

161
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:26,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

162
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:49,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question that I had is about the urgency of our making a decision tonight respecting Georgiana's time and what questions that we have that we feel like we need to answer before we can make a decision on this project.

163
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, what is the possibility of

164
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:11,818
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to have the project be approved by City Council and be able to get under agreement so that we could proceed with ordering the product before the end of this growing season.

165
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,624
[SPEAKER_11]: City Council meets next Tuesday, so if we approve tonight, I can get that on the agenda.

166
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:26,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, realistically, the funding agreement in place, I would say probably end of August is a good realistic time period right now.

167
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,621
[SPEAKER_11]: To being able to purchase and put in the ground.

168
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the best case scenario is end of September.

169
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd actually have a shade structure in place if they went out and got it.

170
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately, right?

171
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that's that's a realistic.

172
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:52,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that a helpful timeframe for us to rush a decision this evening?

173
00:14:53,414 --> 00:15:07,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would it make more sense for us to include this in the regular funding round and be able to gather any other information that we feel we need before proceeding with an off-cycle application?

174
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:28,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, because the whole idea about an off cycle is if there has to be some sort of outward reason why we have to take it off cycle, like a discount that we will lose or a matching grant that we will not be able to take advantage of if we don't do it by date certain.

175
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:35,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really for just putting in applications when we want to.

176
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,962
[SPEAKER_07]: We should stick with the round, especially since it's not a small grant.

177
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And when does the round end?

178
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you just opened it, Teresa.

179
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,221
[SPEAKER_07]: When does the cycle end?

180
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:49,602
[SPEAKER_07]: September 9th.

181
00:15:51,003 --> 00:16:05,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the applications, and then we're making a decision, hopefully by the end of the year, but sometimes it goes into the next year, so that the funds would be available in February.

182
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

183
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So, John, you were going to say what the reason was.

184
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,932
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to submit it now.

185
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because the costs are going up, right?

186
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:23,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Costs of lumber, cost of projects like this to create these kinds of structures are just going up because of the interruption from COVID for supplies.

187
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:36,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So the only concern would be that any further delay actually would increase the cost of the project for the same product because it's already gone up in the last year.

188
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:42,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's probably true for every project we've had since we started.

189
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:43,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

190
00:16:43,618 --> 00:17:03,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just in terms of it becoming feasible, because then we're back to the issue which was before in terms of we're keeping our costs low at the garden in terms of membership fees, but this is a growing need because it's getting hotter in that area to be in that space or to even enjoy that space.

191
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:07,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Time is just only going to keep compounding this concern we're trying to resolve.

192
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:11,386
[SPEAKER_10]: and the cost of actually purchasing the materials.

193
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:14,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Haley?

194
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:21,212
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just question the assumption you made earlier about off-cycle having a need.

195
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:22,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that written into our bylaws?

196
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,954
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually say that you can only do that if you have a need.

197
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:29,476
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't evaluate projects throughout the year when they come?

198
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:31,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

199
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:35,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have it in front of me because I'm not in my office, but maybe it's worth looking.

200
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:40,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I thought it was trying to spread things out a little bit too.

201
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:42,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to voting on this.

202
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,959
[SPEAKER_00]: If people don't want to vote on it, I completely understand that.

203
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:53,901
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of me thinks something built tomorrow or a year from now is five or 10 percent more than today no matter what we do.

204
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:54,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

205
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:57,522
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is, and it's not a big number either.

206
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm leaning towards voting for something even with conditions.

207
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:08,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I mean, just it is in our criteria.

208
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in our instructions in a number of places, but.

209
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:22,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We also made those criteria ourselves and we can re, evaluate whether the criteria makes sense.

210
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:35,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we did it because the city council asked us to get in a schedule that didn't interfere with the rest of the work so that it would have its due diligence and its time in front of the council.

211
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:41,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we'd be working all year long in terms of it would be a never-ending thing.

212
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,833
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd never be able to do other things like re-evaluate the plan and reach out and that kind of thing.

213
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

214
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:58,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm sorry I met Haley and I was reading.

215
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.

216
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,552
[SPEAKER_12]: What was I going to say?

217
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:11,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate, you know, Georgiana's argument here about prices increasing.

218
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,218
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I'm just going to echo what Joan said.

219
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:23,328
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, prices for any project that's going to apply, they would love to get money now, but they're waiting for the application period and they're doing it, you know, through the steps, the procedures that we've laid out.

220
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,411
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that that's kind of where this project's going.

221
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:28,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I work in local government.

222
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how procurement goes.

223
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how long this is going to take.

224
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:35,894
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, best case scenario, we think a September installation.

225
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,256
[SPEAKER_12]: My gut says it's more of an October, November type thing.

226
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:44,498
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think it should just wait for the regular funding period.

227
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:45,498
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my two cents.

228
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

229
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Ari?

230
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to risk my internet again.

231
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I also typed in some of what I am thinking.

232
00:19:56,951 --> 00:20:01,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this project, big fan of community gardens.

233
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:04,716
[SPEAKER_08]: This is in no way coming from a lack of enthusiasm.

234
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:11,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do agree that all projects at this point face inflated costs.

235
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:17,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember when I started on this committee, we had many more off-cycle

236
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:22,724
[SPEAKER_08]: applications and that made it very difficult to compare apples to apples.

237
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:27,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is an apple that would come out ahead of other ones.

238
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:43,056
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think barring truly exigent reason, we should, and given that it realistically won't go up until the fall, I think we should move it to the main cycle, at which point I will be very happy to vote for it.

239
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

240
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,532
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't vote for it if you don't wait for the cycle.

241
00:20:55,272 --> 00:21:00,373
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't wait for the cycle, the vote doesn't come until the second spot.

242
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't flip flop on it.

243
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You either got to go with it or not go.

244
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:11,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if somebody wants to make a motion or something like that.

245
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:16,478
[SPEAKER_14]: There would be two

246
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,955
[SPEAKER_02]: To if we were to vote to recommend this evening, it would require 2 motions.

247
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:28,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The 1st motion would be a motion to accept as an off cycle application.

248
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:34,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 2nd motion would be to recommend funding for the project.

249
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:38,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I hear a.

250
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:48,093
[SPEAKER_02]: More consensus around the 2nd of those and less consensus among within the group around the 1st.

251
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I, sorry, can I ask a clarifying question?

252
00:21:53,118 --> 00:21:53,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

253
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

254
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:03,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologies if this is like an ignorant question, but I was just, while we were talking, I was just like quickly Googling 12 by 12 cedar pergolas.

255
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just like, seemed to be in like 1500 to 2K range.

256
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:17,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just made me wonder if there's something I'm missing about like, do we, for these types of projects in Medford, are there like certain,

257
00:22:18,122 --> 00:22:21,965
[SPEAKER_01]: types of materials that need to be used to meet criteria.

258
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:24,547
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you need to use Medford approved vendors.

259
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:35,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious because I was thinking, like, could it fit into that small grant framework of the five K if it was you just went with like a cheap pergola that still met your needs?

260
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:37,817
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my mind was going.

261
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:41,059
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I might be like missing some details about how these projects.

262
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:42,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Work.

263
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:46,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the the

264
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:55,359
[SPEAKER_11]: The $1,500 to $2,000 range is more of a consumer grade, whereas this is a structure on a city-owned property.

265
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:59,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to be of a little bit more fortitude than... Got it.

266
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I hear you.

267
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:04,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a great, great solution.

268
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:05,248
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought of the same thing.

269
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:10,532
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, this needs a little bit more of a stick build rather than a pull out of the box.

270
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:11,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

271
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:12,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

272
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the suggestion.

273
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:16,337
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that, Reg?

274
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:17,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with Ari.

275
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:19,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that we should have something like this.

276
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:24,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like a good opportunity to create a nice cool space for the community garden.

277
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:25,371
[SPEAKER_07]: My concern is

278
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,881
[SPEAKER_07]: that our application is not a small grant.

279
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a regular application.

280
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:44,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It's incomplete.

281
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:48,325
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have a quote or it doesn't have anything like that.

282
00:23:48,445 --> 00:24:04,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, Georgiana, you said the city told you not to or not exactly sure how that goes because we've gotten lots of other applications for city-owned property that included quotations and stuff like that that they supported and the mayor signed off on.

283
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to set a precedent of

284
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:15,793
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just taking an application that's incomplete off cycle to me is 2 strikes against, you know, what we're supposed to be following our rules.

285
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't want to stray from that.

286
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:29,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I can clarify, Joan, I was just saying I was not aware based on the application itself that those quotes needed to be submitted is what I'm sharing.

287
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:36,931
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I also didn't have any awareness from the application materials that a sign off from the mayor's office would have been favorable.

288
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:37,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

289
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:38,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

290
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:45,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you said you did the small grant application, first of all, which I think is a little different from the regular application that you would use for an off cycle.

291
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I get it.

292
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:47,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

293
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:54,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, yeah, there are a couple of things that I would clarify, like, pieces of information that would be helpful to add.

294
00:24:54,876 --> 00:25:02,819
[SPEAKER_02]: 1st of all, as, as Joan just pointed out, the small grant application is a little simplified from what the full application would be.

295
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:10,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So there would be additional information that we would be asking, but also this isn't it's a city.

296
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:15,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Initiative, but it's actually located on property.

297
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:26,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as the property owner, what we would want to have is not a sign off from the mayor, but a sign off from, or it could be because I know can be difficult to work with in that respect.

298
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,944
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is some documentation of the cities.

299
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:38,151
[SPEAKER_02]: user agreement for that site.

300
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there needs to be some documentation that we have permission to erect a pergola on DCR property.

301
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be... Like Hund and Schell, we have a user agreement, support agreement there.

302
00:25:52,318 --> 00:26:01,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah, so submitting that user support agreement or letters specifically stating that this that they support this project would be helpful.

303
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:09,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, with respect to the quotes, if we have any concern that 1400 is going to be insufficient.

304
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:29,942
[SPEAKER_02]: it is much easier for us to ask for more money now and refund, like just drop the rest of the rent that you don't need to complete the project than to go later and ask for more money.

305
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:37,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a second due diligence that would be helpful to go through the full application process

306
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:46,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Would be those quotes if you can go, I think it's fine if so for a small project, it's under 10,000 dollars.

307
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:51,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go with a, like, there's not a full procurement process.

308
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:51,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get.

309
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:59,132
[SPEAKER_02]: go to any vendor who can provide that service and get asked for a quote from the vendor.

310
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:02,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And the service you're asking for is to install the puddings.

311
00:27:02,736 --> 00:27:04,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to go to the city vendors.

312
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:06,581
[SPEAKER_02]: You can choose one of the ones that you've listed here.

313
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:15,010
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they could give you a written quote, that would give us better assurance that the budget is going to be sufficient to cover this.

314
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:22,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one last point that I wanted to raise, and this has nothing to do with your project.

315
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:40,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great project, but a reason why we want to be careful about planning improvements on DCR property for city managed parks is because we are still waiting for that storage shed and concession stand across the street at Memorial.

316
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: play, um, ball field.

317
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:50,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what, you know, I don't know what the prospect is for that coming to fruition.

318
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:55,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought that there was a plan that would be really easy.

319
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:59,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to a vendor, get a ready-made product and plop it in place.

320
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:02,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ended up being more complicated than that.

321
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know it's,

322
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:21,248
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous legwork that has to be done for such a small thing, but I'm afraid we either not have enough money or tie up money for something that ends up getting caught in the bureaucracy.

323
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:26,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure that I'm following this conversation.

324
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:37,532
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds to me like what's being recommended is to complete a full application by adding these additional pieces, even though that's not the application that was submitted.

325
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:43,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Although the application that was submitted followed the guidelines of the application.

326
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:47,877
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure that I am clear on the discussion and if I'm following it correctly.

327
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:56,287
[SPEAKER_02]: The application that's submitted is a small grant application for which the maximum request is $5,000.

328
00:28:57,687 --> 00:29:02,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And the committee, it sounds like, welcomes a full application for this project.

329
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a project that the committee would be very supportive of.

330
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:15,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But the process for a $10,000 or more request is a different application form.

331
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:20,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could take what's in this form, cut and paste it into another form.

332
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:21,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not meant to be make work.

333
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:33,944
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are perhaps some additional questions and additional instructions that you missed that would answer some of the questions that we've had this evening.

334
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:40,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And Georgiana, I apologize that I should have given you some more direction on that.

335
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:43,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So you and I can work on the full application together.

336
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:49,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm publicly owning some miscommunications there.

337
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:51,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

338
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:53,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.

339
00:29:53,223 --> 00:30:06,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what I'm just trying to understand is if there is a conversation about off-cycle or if this off-cycle application is actually opening up a new conversation, which is please submit a full application.

340
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:11,097
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to consider the off-cycle application because that's what it sounds like to me.

341
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:14,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to make sure I'm following because it's not clear to me.

342
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:19,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's 2 pieces that you actually pointed out.

343
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:21,220
[SPEAKER_07]: 1st of all, it came in the wrong application.

344
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to have the right application.

345
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:24,785
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other point is.

346
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:32,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this application an application that meets the criteria for an off cycle application?

347
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:46,606
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd have to review what the rules that we wrote up at the beginning when we said what defines an off-cycle application.

348
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:52,352
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the very first application this committee looked at was an off-cycle application for Harris Park.

349
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:54,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And we accepted it because

350
00:30:55,655 --> 00:31:06,425
[SPEAKER_07]: They were going for a grant, a matching grant that if we didn't supply funding by a certain date, which was outside the application cycle, we would lose the grant.

351
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was a good reason to consider it off-cycle.

352
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the information in front of me, I apologize, but there were really specific reasons why we would consider, and I think I recall,

353
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:35,966
[SPEAKER_07]: When Brianna was a counselor, she was very concerned about the number of off-cycle applications that we considered because she felt like others who waited for the cycle had less of a chance of getting funding if we started funding everything off-cycle.

354
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:53,284
[SPEAKER_07]: There's reasons for why we set the rules up like we did, and I know that we could always reconsider them, but I don't want to just willingly push them aside just because we haven't had a chance to review that to see if it still makes sense to do it that way.

355
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:58,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those criteria available as part of the application?

356
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:00,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's great to know.

357
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:03,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's either part of the ordinance or part of the application.

358
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:04,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't remember.

359
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:10,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the application and it's actually not a complicated set of criteria.

360
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only two criteria are that it is, it's driven by a timeline that's outside of your control.

361
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,803
[SPEAKER_02]: and that it is a high priority project.

362
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And high priority is defined in our plan.

363
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also very discretionary.

364
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:47,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think like we, I would not put too much emphasis on the high priority aspect, but the driven by a timeline outside of your control, that is more the

365
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:55,001
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the principle that that we apply most frequently.

366
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:57,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, no, I appreciate that.

367
00:32:57,844 --> 00:33:00,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I just did not realize that I was.

368
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:06,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I submitted the wrong application based on the materials available online.

369
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:16,949
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just why I'm asking for this clarification because based on what is online, it to me presented that this was the correct application form to complete.

370
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:25,351
[SPEAKER_10]: But to hear the feedback you're giving is why I'm asking because somewhere there is something that's not connecting in terms of- Curious, which website?

371
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:28,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you go to the city's website or the Preserve Bradford website?

372
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:29,892
[SPEAKER_10]: The city's website?

373
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:34,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have to go back and look at the exact link, but I think it's through the city's website.

374
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, because we can look at that.

375
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're obviously keeping information in two different places.

376
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:42,002
[SPEAKER_07]: We should make sure it's aligned.

377
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:47,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that's why when you said I submitted the wrong application, that surprised me.

378
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:56,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, huh, I didn't realize that based on the information that was there and just curious, what is the application that I submitted used for?

379
00:33:58,969 --> 00:33:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: under $5,000.

380
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We had an application from a student group that wanted to paint the benches, I think at Duggar Park or something, and it was less than $5,000.

381
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what that's for.

382
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:12,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

383
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:20,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I don't even know if those benches ever got painted because COVID came.

384
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,894
[SPEAKER_11]: They did.

385
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:24,695
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually going to install them over the summer.

386
00:34:30,475 --> 00:34:37,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you need a motion to move this to the regular funding or do you want to ask them just to reapply?

387
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:42,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ask you to reapply, Georgiana.

388
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for bringing this application.

389
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great project and I really appreciate the work that you've already done to plan and bring this to

390
00:34:55,603 --> 00:35:04,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Into the form that you brought it so apologies for the confusion about the application form and instructions.

391
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope.

392
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:26,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That we all benefit by taking some time to complete the full application and to provide the additional information that's needed in that that will ensure that we have the budget and the permissions that are necessary to be able to move the project forward.

393
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:30,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Efficiently once we're able to make a decision.

394
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:40,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So Georgiana, I'll follow up with you on next steps and how we'll do the application together, okay?

395
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:43,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

396
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:44,550
Okay.

397
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

398
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:59,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanna ask one last question, that there's no consideration at all if the information where I got it from is not aligned with your process, in which case that'd be an administrative error, not a submission error.

399
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:01,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that an option to explore?

400
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:04,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say no.

401
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:05,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

402
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:20,716
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, I think we should make it a point to track down where that error is and make sure that it is corrected for the future.

403
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:29,381
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that I very much take and I hope that that's something that Teresa can make happen because it

404
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:42,565
[SPEAKER_08]: As you make it a point, it's frustrating and I'm sure feels very frustrating and not the best use of your time to be in this situation.

405
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:49,827
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make this a very supportive environment, so we're going to fix it.

406
00:36:58,686 --> 00:36:59,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you Georgiana.

407
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

408
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:15,473
[SPEAKER_14]: All right everyone, thank you for the discussion.

409
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:25,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to receiving their full application when they come back and we'll have to look into the

410
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,281
[SPEAKER_02]: clarity of the application materials.

411
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:37,309
[SPEAKER_02]: The next item on the agenda is the fire station windows study.

412
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We've received a memorandum.

413
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Has everyone had the opportunity to review the memorandum?

414
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:48,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps, Teresa, you want to describe the content?

415
00:37:49,222 --> 00:38:00,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, in fiscal year 22, the city came to the CPC for funding to conduct a historic window study on engine three.

416
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:04,266
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the Salem Street station that has been out of commission now for a couple of years.

417
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,066
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually just about to come online.

418
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:10,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, this body funded $75,000 in fiscal 22 to conduct a historic window restoration study.

419
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:32,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Lo and behold, fast forward to 2024, we have discovered that, in fact, 95, 96% of the windows that are at Engine 3 are vinyl, replacement having been done sometime within the past 10 to 15 years.

420
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:38,076
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no historic windows in which to study or restore.

421
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:46,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So that being said, the city, the facilities director in particular, has asked if this body would consider

422
00:38:47,356 --> 00:39:04,449
[SPEAKER_11]: pivoting $25,000 of the original $75,000 that was awarded, giving that $25,000 so that they can install a new HVAC system in the community room, which is the public facing section of Engine 3.

423
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,971
[SPEAKER_11]: The memo, I can read it aloud.

424
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very short.

425
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:15,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, the HVAC system at Engine 3, which is 276 Salem Street, is non-operational.

426
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:28,347
[SPEAKER_11]: The system provides both air conditioning and heat to the common room on the first floor of the station, which is not only the gathering spot for the staff of Engine 3, but it is also the area in the station that the public is welcome to interact with the Medford Fire Department.

427
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:32,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Current HVAC system has been non-functional for about two years.

428
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:39,553
[SPEAKER_11]: It has not been an issue during this time as Engine 3 has been closed almost the entire time the HVAC system has been non-functional.

429
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:51,434
[SPEAKER_11]: With Engine 3 about to come back online, they're asking if we would consider carving out $25,000 from the original award to go towards HVAC.

430
00:39:52,534 --> 00:40:04,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I will also say that the conversations I've had with the city, whether that's the chief of staff, chief of fire, or the facilities director,

431
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:10,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how much precedent we set by funding.

432
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:20,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was in fiscal 20, fiscal 21, the Chevalier Theater HVAC system that was put in there so it can be a functioning building space.

433
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:29,645
[SPEAKER_11]: That was kind of the reasoning here for coming to this committee and asking for that consideration.

434
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:32,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Chevalier was about it being a

435
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:38,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's sort of a recreational area.

436
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,974
[SPEAKER_02]: At theater theater.

437
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:47,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can, you can have a functioning fire station without an HVAC system.

438
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:50,480
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have a functioning theater without an HVAC system.

439
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:57,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a lot of other thoughts and feelings about this, but maybe I'm going to let other people talk 1st.

440
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So, 1st of all.

441
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:12,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when we originally funded this, we funded window restoration for three fire stations, not one.

442
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:24,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says in the original application that they had a walkthrough with a contractor who gave the scope of the project, who advised on the scope of the project.

443
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:29,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So if their walkthrough that was the basis of the original $75,000 ask did not find

444
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:42,346
[SPEAKER_02]: any impediment to restoring historic windows at that time.

445
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:48,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why we've discovered that we can't restore the historic windows today.

446
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We can replace vinyl windows with appropriate wood windows.

447
00:41:54,822 --> 00:42:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a project that I've done in CPA funded projects elsewhere where inappropriate windows were installed, so we restored a building by taking out the inappropriate windows and putting appropriate windows in.

448
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:16,977
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what we- Like Royal House, we took the asphalt shingle roof off and replaced it with the historically wooden roof.

449
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:17,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

450
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:29,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that that is very cost prohibitive, and we just don't, the city does not have the budget to be able to do that.

451
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:33,724
[SPEAKER_11]: There are many windows, and a vinyl window is 500 bucks, 600 bucks.

452
00:42:34,624 --> 00:42:47,507
[SPEAKER_11]: These historically accurate windows with mullions and whatnot, divided lights, I think their costs, the facilities director did try that route and got pricing, and it was something like six times more expensive.

453
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:48,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like $3,000 a window

454
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:51,678
[SPEAKER_11]: For the sizes we need.

455
00:42:51,738 --> 00:43:07,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to yeah, that was thought through and evaluated and I would appreciate seeing that documentation before they ask us to walk back on the intention to restore the historic buildings.

456
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:09,561
Okay.

457
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:19,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, Roberta, that the nature of historic preservation is the windows are not going to be what an Anderson window off the shelf is going to be like.

458
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:20,389
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole point.

459
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:25,254
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking it back 80, 100 years in some cases to do that.

460
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,944
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of mistake is odd.

461
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:31,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

462
00:43:32,245 --> 00:43:38,812
[SPEAKER_00]: To not understand what the age of the windows were, but to put a grant in seems odd to me.

463
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:47,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, there was nobody looking at the window who knew what they were doing, I think, if they couldn't see that those windows were not historic.

464
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that person who put in the application may very well agree with you.

465
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:58,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Happily, we have a facilities director now in place.

466
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:00,898
[SPEAKER_11]: At the time of the original application, we did not.

467
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:08,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It was reliant upon well-intentioned people who just weren't sure what they were looking at.

468
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:08,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.

469
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:17,861
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about Roberta's earlier comment about the three buildings, the breakdown of the 75?

470
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:24,406
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I read this, it was we're going from 75 to 25, but is that really what they want to do?

471
00:44:24,546 --> 00:44:31,332
[SPEAKER_00]: To give back the $50,000 and reduce the scope and not deal with any of the windows on any of the fire stations?

472
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:37,678
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be dealing with windows, just not in a historically accurate way, unfortunately.

473
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:43,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not a problem if we already deem those buildings historic?

474
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:44,934
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made that decision, right?

475
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:51,802
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes with, usually that comes with some sense of you need to think about this building differently.

476
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:55,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure they could just make that decision in a vacuum.

477
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing is that we had hoped when we approved this funding that we would find a way to put a preservation restriction on these buildings.

478
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:13,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have abandoned hope for a preservation restriction.

479
00:45:13,616 --> 00:45:22,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we ought to do is to put all of the buildings that we fund under local historic districts.

480
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we can do for both city and non city buildings.

481
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:34,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, we did not mention his local historic district when we gave them the funding for this project.

482
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:40,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can't fault them for not pursuing that option there, but a year ago, we did.

483
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:48,265
[SPEAKER_02]: request a local historic district for the cemetery buildings.

484
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:55,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have not seen an effort yet to follow through with that request.

485
00:45:55,628 --> 00:46:03,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't see good faith in the city committing to protecting its historic buildings.

486
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:06,113
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no teeth.

487
00:46:06,173 --> 00:46:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: We've designated it.

488
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:22,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We recognize it as a historic building, but there's no teeth to ensure that the building is treated as a historic building unless we either have a local historic district or a preservation restriction.

489
00:46:22,703 --> 00:46:25,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So the local historic district would give us teeth.

490
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:26,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

491
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:40,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So with some buildings like the cemetery that our primary purpose in the current day is kind of historic, I think that makes sense.

492
00:46:41,355 --> 00:46:48,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that I'm super excited about putting an active fire station under a historic preservation.

493
00:46:50,401 --> 00:47:05,011
[SPEAKER_08]: The way I don't think I was on the committee when that request came in, but the way I would be thinking about it if it came now is, is this a way we can use CPA money to support the functioning of a fire system?

494
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:22,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Firehouse, I actually want them to just be able to do what they need to do to fight fires and protect people in Medford and have a community space that can be used as a cooling space and a heating space and a kind of space in emergencies.

495
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:23,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And I

496
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:38,892
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, the historical preservation is second to that for a firehouse and for similarly active functioning buildings versus something like the Brooks Estate whose function is, at this point, historic.

497
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I say that with great affection to the Brooks Estate.

498
00:47:45,718 --> 00:47:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Haylene.

499
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:01,361
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is, so the windows to HVAC, there's no nexus.

500
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:06,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how they correlate and I don't know what are, because I'm semi-new here too.

501
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:11,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a history of doing this, where an application comes in for one thing and then they pivot to a different thing?

502
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:13,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this allowed?

503
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:19,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if we wanted to fund an HVAC system for a fire station, that's not what they originally applied for.

504
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:21,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Me personally, I would say,

505
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:31,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, okay, sorry, the window thing didn't work out, like resubmit an applicant, like give us, you know, we'll take back the money and resubmit an application, and then we can reconsider it at that point.

506
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:39,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to say, this is a fire station in the city.

507
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:45,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you're telling me like, if we don't give them money for HVAC, there's no other money for HVAC?

508
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I don't believe that.

509
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:49,065
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know, I'm kind of like,

510
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:50,055
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

511
00:48:50,836 --> 00:48:53,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Kayleen, you're absolutely right.

512
00:48:53,217 --> 00:49:00,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the first time a pivot has been requested, but we tell them just as you said, you know, you applied for this.

513
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:05,224
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to apply for something else, you can apply for something else, but you can't just take the money and move it.

514
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:07,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Because first of all, we don't approve the money.

515
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:08,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We recommend funding.

516
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the city council that approves the funding.

517
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:14,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can't change their decision.

518
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:15,070
[SPEAKER_07]: That's their decision.

519
00:49:17,192 --> 00:49:22,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm on the Community Preservation Coalition page about projects that are allowable.

520
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:28,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got your three areas, open space and recreation, historic preservation, and housing.

521
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:34,318
[SPEAKER_07]: You can acquire, create, preserve, support, or rehabilitate depending on the type.

522
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,380
[SPEAKER_07]: HVAC doesn't really fall into any of that.

523
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,981
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that Chevalier did because it was a historic and to a recreational facility.

524
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:48,401
[SPEAKER_07]: It was making it functional for its intended use.

525
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:50,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And making it functional for its intended use.

526
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:51,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

527
00:49:51,524 --> 00:49:52,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Reg.

528
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:57,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they still going to give us back the $75,000?

529
00:49:57,731 --> 00:49:57,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

530
00:49:58,672 --> 00:49:59,213
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what.

531
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, they never actually got it.

532
00:50:03,238 --> 00:50:07,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a promise to pay.

533
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just for everybody's benefit.

534
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:14,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime it's a city organization that is the grantee.

535
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's not a reimbursement.

536
00:50:18,103 --> 00:50:20,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It's they send me the invoice and I pay it.

537
00:50:20,444 --> 00:50:22,944
[SPEAKER_11]: So the money never went out the front door.

538
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:24,405
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still in the basement.

539
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,231
[SPEAKER_05]: asking for money that they haven't received?

540
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've asked us to consider transferring the funding to a... So, can we get a motion?

541
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:48,419
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion to... Oh, I'd like to make a motion that we deny this.

542
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:50,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anyone like to second that motion?

543
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second it.

544
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:54,862
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

545
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:55,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I will call the roll.

546
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to first call the people in the red.

547
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, for myself, Joan?

548
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:12,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Respectfully, yes.

549
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug?

550
00:51:15,644 --> 00:51:15,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

551
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:17,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Ada?

552
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:18,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

553
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:19,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Ari?

554
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:29,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and if they want to pursue HVAC, maybe they can discuss a separate application for us to consider.

555
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:32,642
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I don't think that we can do this.

556
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give them that feedback.

557
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:35,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

558
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:36,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kaylene?

559
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

560
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,684
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

561
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:44,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion on this?

562
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:44,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

563
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:46,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Reggie.

564
00:51:46,385 --> 00:51:47,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go after you.

565
00:51:48,135 --> 00:52:01,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like to say that if it doesn't fall into the three categories that we're supposed to be dispensing funds for, I don't think that that would fall into that category, to be honest with you.

566
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:06,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously, if they don't have historic windows, they're not really a historic site.

567
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:08,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And so subsequently, they don't qualify.

568
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:10,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just my opinion.

569
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:13,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

570
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:14,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.

571
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:14,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug?

572
00:52:15,935 --> 00:52:17,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of with Reggie on this.

573
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:41,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should try to give them a sense, rather than have them resubmit something that we think has very little support, if that's the sense of the group, I'd rather kind of tell them that and not have them spin their wheels in September and October to present something that is dead on arrival, if that's the consensus of the group.

574
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:42,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

575
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:45,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask a question?

576
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any window of opportunity, pardon the pun, for ADA-compliant work, HVAC being an ADA-compliant thing?

577
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:00,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know.

578
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:06,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The HVAC is, I think, I mean, it's both heat and air conditioning.

579
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,663
[SPEAKER_12]: But to make something ADA compliant is a much bigger scope of work.

580
00:53:18,225 --> 00:53:20,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, maybe down the road if you're going to do that.

581
00:53:20,707 --> 00:53:25,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think it's shoehorned HVAC into an ADA.

582
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:37,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think where I was thinking with the potential is the community space, if that's used for recreation in any way or the heating, cooling, emergency shelter.

583
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget if they're on the list of

584
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:46,207
[SPEAKER_08]: like weather shelters that are open right now during a heat emergency.

585
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:53,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But if that were the case, I could maybe see an argument for that being recreation.

586
00:53:53,249 --> 00:54:03,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is important to have third spaces, and I don't know if that would be legally permissible, but that's where I was thinking it could potentially be shoehorned in.

587
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:06,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with the importance of their spaces.

588
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:18,279
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular use, I think, would be a great fit for CDBG funding because especially if it's a community space that's been to serve vulnerable people in the community.

589
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what CDBG is for historic preservation to what Reggie just said.

590
00:54:25,872 --> 00:54:34,421
[SPEAKER_02]: If they tried an approach, say, to focus on 1 building, not all 3 of them restore the windows in that 1 building, then.

591
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:43,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Restoring the mechanical systems within the building would look more like a historic preservation project.

592
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be part of a whole project.

593
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:54,744
[SPEAKER_02]: To do this piecemeal part that isn't really related to historic preservation just because it's a historic building without actually restoring the building.

594
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:58,586
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, making a determined decision to not restore the building.

595
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:10,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Then ask for historic preservation money for mechanical improvements is just too far off the reservation.

596
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:14,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask a question really quickly?

597
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

598
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:23,313
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding was that the recreation that we cover in this committee is specifically outdoor recreation.

599
00:55:23,593 --> 00:55:24,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I misunderstand that?

600
00:55:24,774 --> 00:55:28,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you guys seem to be talking about recreation more broadly than that.

601
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:31,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It is outdoor recreation.

602
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So the project that we funded before was where there was H back.

603
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,111
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a theater.

604
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:46,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It was built to be a theater and in today's climate, the theater literally couldn't be used for three months of the year.

605
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to shut it down because they could not operate during the hot season.

606
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:59,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So adding an AC, it wasn't even theoretical, adding an AC was making the building actually able to function as a theater.

607
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:06,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So by recreation use, I think what we're saying is that it was a building that was a public place of assembly that

608
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:10,472
[SPEAKER_02]: we couldn't use without HVAC.

609
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:11,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

610
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:18,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So outdoor recreation purposes can be understood more broadly as public places of assembly?

611
00:56:19,018 --> 00:56:19,058
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

612
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:23,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor recreation literally means outdoors.

613
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:29,264
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chevalier Theater is a historic building, so that was a historic preservation project.

614
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:31,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

615
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:34,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for asking all of the questions.

616
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some times where they cross it can fall under 2 different things.

617
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:44,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

618
00:56:46,293 --> 00:56:48,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add 1 thing I don't know how.

619
00:56:49,570 --> 00:57:00,553
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's HVAC drawings, but they'd have to be able to prove that this HVAC, if it did actually rise to the level that we agreed to, it could only serve this space, not the rest of the building, right?

620
00:57:00,753 --> 00:57:10,036
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the things, one of the restrictions that would need to be put on it, because HVAC for the entire building is not, it's only the public space we're talking about, isn't it?

621
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:13,617
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it is just the public space, yeah.

622
00:57:14,357 --> 00:57:14,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

623
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And also just additional feedback to give back to them is that the purpose for the CPA would be to actually fund the restoration of the windows, not just the study.

624
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they wanted to apply for whatever it costs to restore the windows, that would be a legitimate CPA request.

625
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:59,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go one step further and say, you might even consider a triple glazed window, something that is 21st century, like truly something that would cut down on their heating and cooling dramatically versus a new window, but looking like an historic profile.

626
00:57:59,044 --> 00:58:07,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we talked about earlier, there's ways to kind of do what you're saying, I think, and make it feel more forward thinking, not just restoration.

627
00:58:14,735 --> 00:58:17,516
[SPEAKER_14]: So, any other discussion on this.

628
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:28,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And next on the agenda is a brief review of the.

629
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Potential applications that have submitted.

630
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: The eligibility determination forms to date.

631
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:41,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they haven't submitted the EDS.

632
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:45,777
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just conversations that I've been having with various folks.

633
00:58:46,637 --> 00:58:48,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that these ones are coming.

634
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:49,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

635
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

636
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to get it all on one.

637
00:58:54,861 --> 00:58:55,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

638
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:56,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It was funny.

639
00:58:56,401 --> 00:59:03,224
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was printing, I was like, Reggie's going to yell at me.

640
00:59:03,264 --> 00:59:07,266
[SPEAKER_11]: For the folks at home, it is in the meeting packet, but I'll just kind of briefly

641
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:09,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to jump through it.

642
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:20,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul Riggi, who again is our facilities director, will be applying in tandem with DEI for the bathrooms here at City Hall to become ADA compliant.

643
00:59:20,214 --> 00:59:21,035
[SPEAKER_11]: They are currently not.

644
00:59:23,036 --> 00:59:25,137
[SPEAKER_07]: There is also... They sure aren't.

645
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:27,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even get into those things.

646
00:59:27,859 --> 00:59:28,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

647
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:39,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not great, but it's a very preliminary estimate about 100,000 per bathroom, of which there are eight public facing bathrooms.

648
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:46,737
[SPEAKER_11]: This would not apply towards any private bathrooms, of which I think there are only two in this building.

649
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, nurse's office and mayor's office.

650
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:52,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything else is public.

651
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:58,120
[SPEAKER_11]: So 800,000-ish, this might be phased in, I don't know.

652
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,342
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still thinking about it, but that's coming.

653
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:05,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, our affordable housing trust is hitting the ground running.

654
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:11,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe they're meeting next month, the first or second week of August.

655
01:00:12,626 --> 01:00:17,687
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just a very rough estimate of what type of seed money that they would be looking for.

656
01:00:19,008 --> 01:00:22,129
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't quite figured it out yet, so this number is arbitrary at $250,000.

657
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:23,129
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be more, it might be less.

658
01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:28,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, St.

659
01:00:28,736 --> 01:00:29,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph and St.

660
01:00:29,636 --> 01:00:31,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis.

661
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:32,298
[SPEAKER_11]: St.

662
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:43,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph is curious about if they can do some chimney repair as well as look at a study for their historic stained glass windows.

663
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:48,065
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about 75,000 between those two projects.

664
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:50,806
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's exciting, Dr. Cushing,

665
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, super superintendent assistant assistant superintendent.

666
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

667
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:06,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Is looking to do a study for the Curtis Tufts high school, which is a very underutilized building here in Medford.

668
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:08,975
[SPEAKER_11]: So, just a study to figure out what could be done here.

669
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:15,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, increase enrollment, maybe.

670
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:25,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this is a study to figure out what the best usage is, but increased enrollment, perhaps diverse programs to that one in particular, what happened.

671
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:27,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

672
01:01:27,758 --> 01:01:28,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, I'm sorry.

673
01:01:28,378 --> 01:01:28,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

674
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:29,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed what you said.

675
01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:29,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Which building?

676
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:36,043
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for the Curtis Tufts High School next to the pool.

677
01:01:36,343 --> 01:01:36,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

678
01:01:36,723 --> 01:01:40,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that what's described is a CPA project.

679
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:42,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I support it, I think it's fantastic.

680
01:01:42,807 --> 01:01:46,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be looking what is the best use of the Curtis Tufts School.

681
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:54,594
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I really want them to apply for is to restore the cupola before it falls down.

682
01:01:55,719 --> 01:02:02,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the cupola on top of the Curtis tough school before it falls down.

683
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:04,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little.

684
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:28,595
[SPEAKER_02]: The little decorative yeah, it's, it's, it's in rough condition and yeah, it's not quite as bad as Somerville City Hall, which actually did came in and we just put some CPA funding into restoring that this year, but we're going to get there pretty soon.

685
01:02:28,655 --> 01:02:29,775
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't do anything about it.

686
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:36,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to find a good picture, sorry.

687
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:38,311
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the current use of that school or that building?

688
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:41,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the alternative school.

689
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:43,054
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an alternative school.

690
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:48,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for the students who have a very difficult time in the general population at Medford High School.

691
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:49,640
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an excellent way of putting it.

692
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

693
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,003
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's part of the public school system?

694
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:54,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

695
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:59,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to do a quick share.

696
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:02,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully, everybody's seeing a picture of a building right now.

697
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:10,359
[SPEAKER_11]: The cupola is this little deck.

698
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:11,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's decorated-ish.

699
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it might be functioning, but this is kind of an older picture.

700
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,882
[SPEAKER_11]: It is in rough shape.

701
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:22,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to stop sharing now.

702
01:03:25,084 --> 01:03:28,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Could they apply for both a study as well as repairing that?

703
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that something we would entertain within the

704
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Same funding cycle?

705
01:03:31,331 --> 01:03:36,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how the use study is historic preservation.

706
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:40,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll bring that feedback.

707
01:03:40,895 --> 01:03:42,276
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 different applications.

708
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, definitely 2 different applications, but I have a very hard time envisioning how you study would be eligible for CPA.

709
01:03:55,883 --> 01:04:04,185
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe he has designs on it beyond school, but since the building itself, I believe has a form B. Yeah.

710
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:14,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything related to restoring the building is eligible, but what we do in the building is not really the CPC's business.

711
01:04:14,628 --> 01:04:14,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

712
01:04:15,668 --> 01:04:17,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, like I said, I'll take that feedback.

713
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:20,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps I misunderstood his conversation.

714
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:24,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he can readjust his thinking based off of that feedback.

715
01:04:25,218 --> 01:04:29,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll bring that to him.

716
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:34,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up we have, Car Park is still a maybe.

717
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:41,548
[SPEAKER_11]: They've applied for grant funding here, but we may need an additional 200,000 tranche for phase two of Car Park.

718
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:46,051
[SPEAKER_11]: For the new folks, we have funded Car Park before.

719
01:04:46,131 --> 01:04:52,895
[SPEAKER_11]: We funded the master plan years ago, as well as the Pickleball Courts, which are opening up next week.

720
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:58,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so car park is a frequent flyer here at CPC.

721
01:04:58,198 --> 01:04:59,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um.

722
01:05:01,259 --> 01:05:04,540
[SPEAKER_11]: To be determined, I'm sure they'll come back and ask for something.

723
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

724
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:12,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Next, the unitary universalist church passed right over the car park invasive plant study.

725
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:14,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I did sorry car park.

726
01:05:14,183 --> 01:05:14,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It is small.

727
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:15,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I am reading this.

728
01:05:16,024 --> 01:05:16,764
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's mom.

729
01:05:16,804 --> 01:05:18,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

730
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:18,805
[SPEAKER_11]: The car park.

731
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:21,886
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of a new idea that actually came from me.

732
01:05:21,906 --> 01:05:21,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

733
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:27,271
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of invasive plants, especially in our park lands.

734
01:05:27,892 --> 01:05:29,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Car park is my my baby.

735
01:05:29,313 --> 01:05:30,654
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my part.

736
01:05:31,675 --> 01:05:37,160
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've noticed that a lot of the invasives on the outskirts are starting to encroach on private property.

737
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:37,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

738
01:05:39,162 --> 01:05:41,144
[SPEAKER_11]: But nobody knows how to deal with invasives.

739
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:43,526
[SPEAKER_07]: We did that.

740
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:46,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

741
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Brooks Estate and Wrights Pond.

742
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:50,930
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't made some work done.

743
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,631
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm getting at, let me rephrase it then.

744
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:59,294
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not a point person in this building whose job it is to own invasives.

745
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:06,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to make it somebody's job by suggesting this PDS was amenable to it.

746
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:14,563
[SPEAKER_11]: But figured we'd just start at Car Park because it's topical, it's prominent.

747
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,934
[SPEAKER_11]: but just to see what we can do about invasives on our public lands that are starting to encroach on private lands.

748
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:30,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Unitarian Universalist Church will be coming to us for some exterior, I can't remember if it's shingle or siding repair.

749
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:37,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I have not yet seen the EDF, but the building envelope is in need of some historic specialized labor to repair it.

750
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:44,654
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be seeing an application for tennis court resurfacing at Berry Park.

751
01:06:45,094 --> 01:06:49,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like we do one or two of these every year, so Berry Park is up this year.

752
01:06:49,576 --> 01:06:50,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

753
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

754
01:06:52,557 --> 01:06:52,917
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

755
01:06:54,217 --> 01:06:56,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Oak Grove Cemetery Master Plan.

756
01:06:56,518 --> 01:07:07,362
[SPEAKER_11]: This I put on there, Roberta's staring at me and I can feel it, just for potential additional funding to conduct a master plan study at Oak Grove.

757
01:07:07,842 --> 01:07:09,263
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a professional.

758
01:07:09,956 --> 01:07:13,203
[SPEAKER_11]: to come in and own this project.

759
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:17,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Bandwidth is just not really there for our current staff.

760
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:29,632
[SPEAKER_11]: ABCD is our local administrator for both our fuel assistance as well as our Medford move-in.

761
01:07:29,772 --> 01:07:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So the ABCD is a big partner for the city.

762
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:46,687
[SPEAKER_11]: CPA funds the Medford move-in program, which helps folks either coming into Medford or moving within Medford, helps them put up funding for their first, last, and security to move into the city.

763
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:53,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this different than the other rental assistance requests we had from last year?

764
01:07:53,712 --> 01:07:55,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I forget who that was, but it was not ABCD.

765
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:58,054
[SPEAKER_11]: That one was from Housing Families.

766
01:07:58,114 --> 01:08:02,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So Housing Families manages our program that helps with rental arrears.

767
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:06,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they also do help with another program that's funded by CDBG.

768
01:08:06,997 --> 01:08:15,480
[SPEAKER_11]: But for CPA scope, we fund ABCD for the method of move-in program, as well as Housing Families, which again, helps with rental arrears.

769
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:23,421
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the one you're remembering Kayleen was from from our last cycle, we might change up the program.

770
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:27,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe next year for the next time that they come back to us.

771
01:08:28,286 --> 01:08:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in talks with ABCD's director of housing.

772
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:40,353
[SPEAKER_11]: about evaluating the program to see if it's meeting current needs, because the guidelines were put in place during COVID.

773
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:43,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Things are a little bit different now, maybe worse.

774
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:45,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say worse.

775
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:49,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So just making sure that what our current program is meeting the current needs.

776
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:59,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And also making sure that people know about the program because it has had very slow uptake in Medford, despite

777
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:05,692
[SPEAKER_02]: other communities that have similar programs having a lot of demand for those programs.

778
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:21,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a gap somewhere and I think we need to explore how we can close that gap and see that the resources are being utilized by the people who very much need them.

779
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:52,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And tomorrow evening, I have a meeting with our prevention and outreach folks who also are community liaisons that go out into the communities that are non-English speaking and seeing what they can do to help make awareness of these, all of our resources here at City Hall, but specifically bringing this information, arming them with it, seeing if we get stuff translated, I'm not sure, but just trying to get this information more out there

780
01:09:54,099 --> 01:09:59,101
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I have a meeting with them about how they can be helping push CPA agendas forward.

781
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:06,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So we might be coming back to this committee and asking your feedback on what that program might look like.

782
01:10:06,604 --> 01:10:07,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So more to come on that.

783
01:10:09,224 --> 01:10:18,167
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think for this funding round, we don't wanna change too much and just kind of push it out as an additional tranche to fund that program.

784
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:22,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anything's changing this year, but for next year, I'm gonna try.

785
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:42,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, the Chevalier Auditorium, we had, I wasn't quite here during that time, but we had funded historic window restoration at the Chevalier before, or at least a study.

786
01:10:43,862 --> 01:10:45,882
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a restoration, thank you.

787
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:50,003
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some windows that were omitted at that time.

788
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,995
[SPEAKER_11]: For a reason, I'm not quite sure, but they're they're come back and asked us.

789
01:10:54,535 --> 01:10:58,657
[SPEAKER_11]: We're ready now to do the additional windows that are at ground level.

790
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,798
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be putting together.

791
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:06,040
[SPEAKER_11]: An idea for that, that's it.

792
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:07,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you a question?

793
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:08,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

794
01:11:09,202 --> 01:11:10,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about St.

795
01:11:10,162 --> 01:11:10,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Joseph's.

796
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

797
01:11:11,483 --> 01:11:11,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

798
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: They said something about windows.

799
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:15,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

800
01:11:15,345 --> 01:11:16,565
[SPEAKER_11]: The stained glass windows are so.

801
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We would make it clear that the stained glass windows can only be for windows that don't have iconography or illustrations.

802
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember much.

803
01:11:32,992 --> 01:11:35,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting old.

804
01:11:35,894 --> 01:11:38,416
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do remember that we were talking about.

805
01:11:41,452 --> 01:11:44,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I wondered whether Shiloh should also be on the list of potential.

806
01:11:44,957 --> 01:11:45,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

807
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:45,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

808
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:46,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

809
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:47,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

810
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:51,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Shiloh will be coming and asking for, I believe, an additional 200,000 as well.

811
01:11:54,762 --> 01:12:01,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Another 1 yeah, it's it's additional build out that they're as they're starting to really get into this elevator installation.

812
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're realizing and that's kind of how we funded it before.

813
01:12:04,868 --> 01:12:07,329
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, this is how much you need to do the elevator.

814
01:12:07,429 --> 01:12:12,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they're realizing, well, we've got to do some more work here, expand that out, put in a new work way here.

815
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:16,054
[SPEAKER_11]: So, they're working on putting together.

816
01:12:16,514 --> 01:12:18,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I heard, but it's public.

817
01:12:23,682 --> 01:12:28,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you've heard it, then it better be public.

818
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:29,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to last a year.

819
01:12:29,906 --> 01:12:31,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't want to be the one to say that.

820
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:36,130
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of comments.

821
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in St.

822
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:38,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph's Church.

823
01:12:38,311 --> 01:12:45,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought every single stained glass window in that building was pretty much telling some story of the Old and New Testament.

824
01:12:45,976 --> 01:12:46,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong.

825
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:53,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go to that church for the first 18 years of my life, so I hope I'm wrong there, because I obviously would be good.

826
01:12:55,429 --> 01:13:01,031
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is, if you go to that list, the Chevalier looks a little light.

827
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:05,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many windows, 25,000, it seems like, given the scale.

828
01:13:06,834 --> 01:13:07,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only eight windows.

829
01:13:08,394 --> 01:13:08,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.

830
01:13:08,915 --> 01:13:10,195
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not so bad.

831
01:13:10,715 --> 01:13:11,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's OK then.

832
01:13:12,256 --> 01:13:12,736
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

833
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:15,097
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one.

834
01:13:17,023 --> 01:13:24,752
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the Brooks Estate will not be submitting any grants this time this year.

835
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:24,872
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

836
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:25,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

837
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:25,493
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

838
01:13:26,334 --> 01:13:26,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Shocking.

839
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:27,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

840
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:30,378
[SPEAKER_03]: My God, what a reaction.

841
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:44,890
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is we have a new president now, and by the way, you're all welcome to come to the picnic on Saturday.

842
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:48,892
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free picnic at the estate, our 20th or something like that.

843
01:13:48,932 --> 01:13:53,814
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Tom Lincoln's last public event, and we have a new president.

844
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,680
[SPEAKER_00]: The caretakers are leaving.

845
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:02,101
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on right now.

846
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:02,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

847
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:04,903
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many things happening.

848
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:12,626
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to finish the products we have on our plate, not start new ones just for this one year.

849
01:14:12,966 --> 01:14:15,727
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back with a vengeance next year, I promise you all.

850
01:14:16,487 --> 01:14:18,268
[SPEAKER_07]: When are the caretakers leaving?

851
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:23,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one is already left as of July 1st.

852
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:24,651
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two.

853
01:14:25,651 --> 01:14:27,732
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure that out now.

854
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:33,231
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of moving parts there.

855
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:37,833
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been there for six years and the world has changed in that time.

856
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:40,653
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.

857
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:50,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hiring more money for others, obviously, and you only have 1.8, so there's hundreds of thousands of dollars that are available now.

858
01:14:51,406 --> 01:14:51,906
[SPEAKER_00]: for a product.

859
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your sacrifice.

860
01:14:57,729 --> 01:15:03,671
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been more than generous with the Brooks Estate for the last five years to the tune of 800 plus thousand dollars.

861
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:07,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see what else is.

862
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:11,895
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be other ones on the table plus a lot of those numbers, Teresa, you said are estimates anyway.

863
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,856
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to make some tough decisions as always.

864
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:15,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward.

865
01:15:15,897 --> 01:15:16,117
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

866
01:15:20,102 --> 01:15:21,463
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a question.

867
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:27,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I remember there was a project about building a daycare into a church?

868
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:30,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that one of the three churches we've talked about?

869
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:32,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's Shiloh.

870
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:40,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that may need more funding for their elevator project, and the elevator facilitates the daycare.

871
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:42,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

872
01:15:42,457 --> 01:15:42,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

873
01:15:46,773 --> 01:15:48,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, this is good.

874
01:15:48,994 --> 01:15:55,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So, since the application period is open right now, if there are any.

875
01:15:55,977 --> 01:15:59,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Committee members who have ideas about.

876
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:09,704
[SPEAKER_02]: People or groups organizations that you think could potentially have projects or locations that could potentially be improved.

877
01:16:10,144 --> 01:16:13,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to Teresa about it and or.

878
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:21,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to other organizations and see whether they, they might want to consider applying.

879
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,486
[SPEAKER_02]: There's it's what is the deadline for the eligibility determination 31st 31st of July.

880
01:16:26,506 --> 01:16:26,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Doug.

881
01:16:31,024 --> 01:16:32,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I forgot one last thing.

882
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:40,014
[SPEAKER_00]: At the historic commission meeting last night, a woman from the UU church came and talked to us about the project.

883
01:16:40,635 --> 01:16:50,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's a good project, but it seems like they didn't have a preservation architect on board, and they were just looking at contractor quotes, and it didn't feel like it was

884
01:16:52,453 --> 01:16:55,554
[SPEAKER_00]: enough meat on the bone, so to speak.

885
01:16:55,574 --> 01:17:10,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Teresa, I would urge you to have them define that scope as best they can, but I think they're going to need to ultimately hire someone to do some drawings and details to make sure that it's truly a restoration project historic standards that we've established.

886
01:17:10,557 --> 01:17:17,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a repair, it's definitely restoration, but they just need documentation that supports that a little bit more than I think they're currently planning.

887
01:17:19,005 --> 01:17:29,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just like last year when we funded the wall restoration for the cemetery in Medford Square and Salem Street.

888
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:43,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They originally just wanted money to restore the wall and we said, why don't you come back and CPA will fund us the architectural plans to make sure that we do it correctly and then come back.

889
01:17:43,304 --> 01:17:47,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually that might be a potential project that comes back this year as well.

890
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:53,170
[SPEAKER_02]: to construct that work.

891
01:17:53,710 --> 01:18:07,496
[SPEAKER_02]: For any historic building, that's always good advice or for any open space project, it's always good advice to ask for planning money first and then come back next year for implementation money.

892
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:16,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's an excellent point because even the young lady who came to us in the beginning,

893
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:25,692
[SPEAKER_05]: in regards to the, you know what I'm talking about, whatever.

894
01:18:26,272 --> 01:18:34,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there wasn't an awful lot of information that she had as far as, you know, she went through a couple of contracts and so on and so forth.

895
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, people should really have a solid plan that when they present it to us, we don't have to answer a thousand questions.

896
01:18:46,552 --> 01:18:52,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, they should have a pretty good idea of what the scope of their project is and so on and so forth.

897
01:18:53,194 --> 01:19:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, you know, I mean, it costs me the money to have a professional do it, but if a professional does it, then we'll have a pretty good idea as to whether or not the funding is adequate, you know, for what they're looking for and whether or not we want to really do it.

898
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:27,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've, in our experience, um, projects have been completed that started with a plan and some of the projects that didn't start with a plan ended up stalling out and being canceled eventually.

899
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that's why it's a good way to, um, to feed it into the pipeline.

900
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:39,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another.

901
01:19:40,745 --> 01:19:41,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Pipeline ID.

902
01:19:41,946 --> 01:19:45,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh about so couple years ago.

903
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:52,890
[SPEAKER_02]: We funded a feasibility study or to figure out where to put the coven.

904
01:19:52,911 --> 01:19:53,391
[SPEAKER_02]: 19 grow.

905
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:55,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I don't know.

906
01:19:55,752 --> 01:19:58,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We've identified a potential location for that.

907
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:05,976
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in the midst of finalizing what the location would be and then they'll start going into community feedback for design.

908
01:20:06,317 --> 01:20:09,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but it's riverbend park looks to be.

909
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:15,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my Riverbend Park looks to be the park that it will go in.

910
01:20:16,894 --> 01:20:25,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether or not with Clipper, they kind of want to wait for ClipperShip to kind of get done, because I think they're eyeing a spot that's over by where ClipperShip will be.

911
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:27,722
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's in the works.

912
01:20:27,742 --> 01:20:36,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Another pie-in-the-sky idea that comes to me is a feasibility study to locate another community garden.

913
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Or to just pick up spot and put another community garden.

914
01:20:44,168 --> 01:21:00,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere I know 7 or 5 years ago, I remember sitting in a public meeting where people came out with pitchforks and that's probably why we haven't seen more proposals for community garden since then.

915
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:01,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But.

916
01:21:02,968 --> 01:21:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: There are new people in the community and maybe we could find a new consensus about adding community gardens to parks.

917
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:18,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, finally figured out how to raise my hand on zoom.

918
01:21:18,377 --> 01:21:22,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So question, can you guys clarify bike lanes?

919
01:21:22,659 --> 01:21:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, does that fall under.

920
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:31,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Cp, I mean, because I know clipper ship is the project you guys funded, but I feel like just regular bike lanes.

921
01:21:31,584 --> 01:21:32,924
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't can you.

922
01:21:34,205 --> 01:21:41,268
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's off completely outside of the road right-of-way, we can fund that as a recreation.

923
01:21:41,748 --> 01:21:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But sidewalks and bike lanes that are part of the road right-of-way, those are not eligible projects.

924
01:21:51,412 --> 01:22:01,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any other projects like clipper ships that are in discussion, or is that kind of the only one of its kind that is happening at the moment?

925
01:22:03,683 --> 01:22:12,069
[SPEAKER_11]: very preliminary discussions about what to do with the whole Main Street Route 16 by the police station that area.

926
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:13,090
[SPEAKER_11]: There is discussion.

927
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:15,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that's a mascot project.

928
01:22:15,372 --> 01:22:20,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, here in the city, we can ask them nicely to do things, but it's their project.

929
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:29,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mystic River Watershed Association is currently planning for a path

930
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:43,510
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, this was in our very first funding around a CPA project that the city council actually turned down, but they got funding from another source and right now are preparing a plan for a path along the Mystic Lakes.

931
01:22:44,311 --> 01:22:48,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could comment on that plan right now.

932
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:55,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not City of Medford, but that will also add something like a commission.

933
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:56,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

934
01:22:57,233 --> 01:23:01,175
[SPEAKER_11]: The bicycle commission, there is a bicycle commission here in the city.

935
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:05,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe they meet on the fourth Thursday or fourth Wednesday of every month.

936
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:08,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in touch with them.

937
01:23:08,438 --> 01:23:17,303
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard is that they can make recommendations, but they can't comment, but they can't propose.

938
01:23:17,903 --> 01:23:24,606
[SPEAKER_11]: They're an advocacy group, not necessarily an authority, which I know they struggle with that.

939
01:23:26,017 --> 01:23:28,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

940
01:23:28,578 --> 01:23:32,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, my other question is just on your document here, the yeses and noes.

941
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,261
[SPEAKER_01]: What do the noes mean?

942
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:36,843
[SPEAKER_11]: For where it says eligible?

943
01:23:36,863 --> 01:23:39,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not seeing the top one.

944
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,825
[SPEAKER_01]: City-owned property.

945
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:43,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, city-owned property, sorry, completely.

946
01:23:43,586 --> 01:23:44,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, yeah, there's two.

947
01:23:44,727 --> 01:23:47,448
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one where I wrote out yes, and then there's just whys.

948
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,410
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, it's on city-owned property.

949
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:53,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, thank you.

950
01:23:55,824 --> 01:23:58,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Teresa, how goes the signs on the parks?

951
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:01,911
[SPEAKER_07]: The signs on the parks?

952
01:24:02,732 --> 01:24:04,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Car Park?

953
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:05,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's McDally Park?

954
01:24:05,695 --> 01:24:07,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's that?

955
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:13,984
[SPEAKER_11]: I think BDS has been very gracious in all the ideas they bring to them.

956
01:24:19,498 --> 01:24:28,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I think that as they're doing total park renovations like they're doing with car park right now that is something that they're going to be looking into, but it's it's.

957
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:33,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't say it's a priority, but I, I agree with you.

958
01:24:34,228 --> 01:24:34,648
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

959
01:24:35,349 --> 01:24:36,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have another question that.

960
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:49,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other comments, ideas, suggestions about potential applicants for this year?

961
01:24:49,903 --> 01:24:54,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do the math here.

962
01:24:54,145 --> 01:25:01,769
[SPEAKER_07]: What are our EDS estimates up against what we potentially expect to have for funding this year?

963
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:07,751
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually, if you scroll down on that sheet, there are a couple.

964
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:09,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look at that, the whole other section.

965
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:16,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now the asks are about 1.8, which again, some of them are estimates.

966
01:25:17,036 --> 01:25:21,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them may be split into multiple phases, like that 800,000 for the bathrooms.

967
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:27,745
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how much I think it's going to cost in total, whether it's two years, one year, what have you.

968
01:25:27,765 --> 01:25:29,687
[SPEAKER_11]: But 1.8 right now is the estimated.

969
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:34,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, once we add in Shiloh, let's just make that a cool 2 million.

970
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:37,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Our budget

971
01:25:37,805 --> 01:26:01,380
[SPEAKER_11]: is uh you can see i'm sorry again it's so tiny for for folks who are reading the print version in the room right now fiscal 25 we have 1.96 available to us there is uh if you keep scrolling down 82 000 left over in our extra coffers right now so that's why you're seeing that actually is that

972
01:26:04,277 --> 01:26:06,498
[SPEAKER_07]: That's undesignated fund, it says.

973
01:26:06,658 --> 01:26:06,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

974
01:26:07,318 --> 01:26:10,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the leftovers.

975
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:11,679
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not.

976
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:12,240
[SPEAKER_11]: It does not.

977
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:12,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Add another $75,000.

978
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:12,740
$150,000.

979
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:12,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

980
01:26:23,207 --> 01:26:28,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the $75,000 is still committed to them.

981
01:26:29,148 --> 01:26:32,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They could turn around and say, okay, forget the HVAC.

982
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,670
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually do want to go forward with the windows.

983
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:42,411
[SPEAKER_11]: But at this point, would we still fund a study if all we know is we need to put in this type of a window?

984
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they picked 1 building, and I don't think it would cost 25,000 dollars.

985
01:26:50,828 --> 01:26:53,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, like, just the architect to.

986
01:26:55,613 --> 01:26:57,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Prepare the five hours worth of work.

987
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:08,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I don't know if it's five hours worth of work like the there's the the identifying all of the windows to put in place and then making sure that the windows are actually operable.

988
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, it's needed.

989
01:27:12,558 --> 01:27:16,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a $10,000 study would be needed to like.

990
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:22,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out what to do with the windows and guessing so if they wanted to do that.

991
01:27:23,082 --> 01:27:28,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we put the rest of the money back and then they could come back and apply for actual restoration windows.

992
01:27:29,646 --> 01:27:36,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm not going to put the 75 back into our undesignated until they send us a memo.

993
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:38,331
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is actually the process.

994
01:27:38,372 --> 01:27:42,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to send us a memo saying project is canceled.

995
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:43,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Please put it back.

996
01:27:50,603 --> 01:28:08,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to guess that the $800,000 for the city hall bathrooms, unless the city fronts money to do some, I mean, they can't bid an $800,000 project without having construction drawings.

997
01:28:08,092 --> 01:28:09,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to have to be a two-year.

998
01:28:10,153 --> 01:28:12,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be $200,000 project.

999
01:28:12,414 --> 01:28:12,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And then $800,000.

1000
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what's going to happen for the city hall.

1001
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:36,871
[SPEAKER_11]: But if anybody comes across projects, programs that you think would be eligible for CPA, feel free to email, text me, call me, and then we'll go from there.

1002
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:39,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless anybody had any other ideas right now.

1003
01:28:43,112 --> 01:28:44,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting everybody on the spot.

1004
01:28:44,753 --> 01:28:45,733
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't know you had homework.

1005
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:54,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, if you think of anything, send it on over.

1006
01:28:55,172 --> 01:29:00,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to reach out to Stuart and talk to him about the high school you study.

1007
01:29:00,437 --> 01:29:04,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1008
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll reach out.

1009
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:06,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Peter's.

1010
01:29:06,582 --> 01:29:08,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very well deserved vacation right now, but.

1011
01:29:09,044 --> 01:29:12,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And see if you can give me some more insight into what the plan is.

1012
01:29:12,968 --> 01:29:13,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1013
01:29:13,752 --> 01:29:21,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be we're already at 8 o'clock, so we can quickly move through the rest of the agenda in a couple of minutes.

1014
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So minutes from the June 11 meeting.

1015
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:25,977
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in the packet.

1016
01:29:26,337 --> 01:29:31,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Would anyone like to make a motion that we accept the minutes as presented from the June 11 meeting?

1017
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:33,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1018
01:29:34,741 --> 01:29:36,641
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and I will call the roll.

1019
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with screen.

1020
01:29:39,302 --> 01:29:39,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

1021
01:29:40,403 --> 01:29:40,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1022
01:29:41,663 --> 01:29:41,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

1023
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:42,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1024
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:48,299
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, yes, feeling yes, Doug.

1025
01:29:52,181 --> 01:29:52,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

1026
01:29:55,942 --> 01:29:57,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Red myself, yes.

1027
01:30:00,264 --> 01:30:04,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And 6 yeah, 1 absent 1 absent.

1028
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then the next is other business other business.

1029
01:30:12,316 --> 01:30:21,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Really quick, I'll send an email out to, but they have final, they being the mayor's office has finalized the ribbon cuttings for Gillis.

1030
01:30:22,525 --> 01:30:24,827
[SPEAKER_11]: As well as for phase 1 for car park.

1031
01:30:26,832 --> 01:30:34,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday, next Thursday, I'll send this out again, Thursday the 18th at four o'clock, Gillis, ribbon cutting.

1032
01:30:34,298 --> 01:30:39,822
[SPEAKER_11]: What's actually really fun is they're doing a one inning game of city staff and elected officials versus the kids.

1033
01:30:40,442 --> 01:30:47,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anybody here wants to play some baseball, I believe they're looking to fill out the roster.

1034
01:30:48,168 --> 01:30:51,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe mayor is pitching, which is the only thing I could do.

1035
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:56,054
[SPEAKER_11]: It is at four o'clock on Thursday, four o'clock in the afternoon.

1036
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:08,727
[SPEAKER_11]: On Monday, the 22nd, so the following Monday, not this coming, but the 22nd, also at 4 o'clock, will be the Car Park Phase 1 opening.

1037
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:22,676
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be a little ceremony, and then culminates in a pickleball demonstration, followed very closely by a pickleball tournament, of which we are all also invited to participate in.

1038
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:25,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Reg, will we see you there?

1039
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:29,949
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we're all invited to that.

1040
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:30,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll send that out.

1041
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:35,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And a reminder again of the Brooks State this Saturday.

1042
01:31:35,152 --> 01:31:36,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Brooks State Picnic.

1043
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:45,398
[SPEAKER_11]: They've asked if you can, and if you feel like it, bring like a salad or desserts, anything I think that doesn't need to be heated or cooled.

1044
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:48,239
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it's from 12 to 3.

1045
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,941
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be some festivities, some games, music.

1046
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:54,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to be there around two.

1047
01:31:54,744 --> 01:31:58,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a prior engagement, but I'm going to try to be there at two.

1048
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:00,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately.

1049
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:02,229
[SPEAKER_07]: When's a long cross?

1050
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,711
[SPEAKER_11]: When's a long cross?

1051
01:32:03,931 --> 01:32:11,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to have to send out new dates for now that we have Otto joining us.

1052
01:32:11,176 --> 01:32:17,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also didn't put down past committee members, which was not purposeful.

1053
01:32:17,161 --> 01:32:19,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't mean to slight anybody, but I'll send out new dates for that.

1054
01:32:21,396 --> 01:32:24,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the July dates didn't work for enough people.

1055
01:32:24,738 --> 01:32:26,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think that.

1056
01:32:28,261 --> 01:32:30,142
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I had in other business.

1057
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think that we needed to cover this evening.

1058
01:32:35,786 --> 01:32:37,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1059
01:32:37,728 --> 01:32:40,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1060
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:44,277
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1061
01:32:45,779 --> 01:32:46,520
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1062
01:32:47,101 --> 01:32:47,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:48,464
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1064

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1066
01:32:51,088 --> 01:32:52,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1067
01:32:53,271 --> 01:32:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:32:54,533 --> 01:33:01,164
[SPEAKER_07]: They still are red.

1069
01:33:02,486 --> 01:33:02,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:33:03,267 --> 01:33:04,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself Yes.

1071
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.
