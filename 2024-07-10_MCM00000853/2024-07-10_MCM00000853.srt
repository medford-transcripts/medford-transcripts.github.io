[SPEAKER_07]: Adam McLaughlin, not here.

40
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:48,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so yeah.

41
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm joining us.

42
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so yeah.

43
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked him to show me bread.

44
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:55,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So the meeting is called over.

45
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:55,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

46
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping that we won't need the full two hours tonight.

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everyone probably definitely wants that to be true, so we'll see what we can do.

48
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:24,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa, if you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand.

49
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,472
[SPEAKER_06]: You can all see your square, so that might just help us know that you want to get an award each at twice.

50
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:36,490
[SPEAKER_06]: The next thing on the agenda is what we call a consent agenda.

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:46,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's essentially a place where you put items that have to be initially approved by the committee, but to which there's probably no conversation really to have.

52
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:58,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So the three items that are in there that we need to approve tonight are our meeting minutes from our personal meeting, from our lead and onboarding subcommittee meeting, from our communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting.

53
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:03,614
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take a look at the meeting minutes, you will see that they are very late.

54
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: That is because those meetings, by and large, did not have a lot of action in terms of motions and votes and things to approve or deny.

55
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, in the electronic version of this, you can click a link to the YouTube channel and see the actual recorded meeting there.

56
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:27,638
[SPEAKER_06]: We try to err on the side of slimmer,

57
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,550
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes.

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:37,792
[SPEAKER_06]: These are still totally permissible under the OPA law, but the more detailed they are, the more like you have to read and recount and say, was it accurate?

59
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:39,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say that in the right way?

60
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:50,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just find that that sort of leads to just a lot of work that I can try to avoid again.

61
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:54,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So the consent agenda is basically approving the meeting minutes.

62
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And the meeting minutes also include several documents that we'll actually talk about in detail.

63
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:06,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first thing is for somebody to make a motion to approve the consent agenda.

64
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion by Mayor Wendell Kern, seconded by Reese.

65
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:10,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

66
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:10,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

67
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was something that you were like, I want to talk about this thing separately, you just let me know and we will sever that, we'll pull it out, we'll put everything else through and then pass the conversation.

68
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:46,584
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, we're going to try to drop the Robertson's order without boring you all with like lots of financial about Robertson's order.

69
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:50,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So like the general thing is if you have a question and you don't know how to do it, just ask.

70
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,904
[SPEAKER_12]: the people at the table actually know what we're going to include.

71
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So, is that right, colleagues?

72
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:56,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that done on the fly?

73
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:57,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

74
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,608
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah, it can be done right at the meeting.

75
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:11,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that's worth noting about OPD Law is that there are people, it is a hybrid meeting in terms of participants.

76
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,774
[SPEAKER_07]: We do a roll call.

77
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:17,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm going to do a roll call so that we can vote this through.

78
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:19,097
[SPEAKER_07]: There was no other questions, right?

79
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:19,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

80
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:25,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so on the motion to approve the consent agenda, they have the longest term.

81
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:26,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

82
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:26,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

83
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:27,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

84
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:27,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

85
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

86
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:27,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

87
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:27,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

88
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:27,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

89
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:28,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

90
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:28,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

91
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:29,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

92
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:29,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

93
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:29,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

94
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:30,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

95
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:30,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

96
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:53,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, 15 in the affirmative, zero at the negative.

97
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:53,806
[SPEAKER_06]: The minutes are up.

98
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:56,168
[SPEAKER_06]: For three.

99
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:21,791
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we charge the rules and onboarding team to do is provide a set of operating rules for this committee and give some thought to onboarding both for all of you as well as for people who may join this committee over time because that's sort of inevitable when you talk about a seven, six, seven year project.

100
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:25,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you flip through your packet,

101
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:34,202
[SPEAKER_06]: What I wanted to do was just go through these rules and ask you all, like, what questions do you have?

102
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:38,606
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think anything's missing, this is a place where we can certainly amend these rules.

103
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:44,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we're done reviewing the rules, we will take a vote to adopt them.

104
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rules committee met.

105
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,973
[SPEAKER_06]: for about an hour, so they were incredibly efficient.

106
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:57,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a fast job of trying to create a set of rules and an onboarding checklist.

107
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll start with the rules.

108
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:11,173
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing that we have in here is essentially that we will simply use SBC as the acronym for this, because if you add all of the Medford Comprehensive

109
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:19,317
[SPEAKER_06]: high school building committee it's a lot of letters so we will adopt SPC as our sort of common acronym.

110
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:31,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number two we had some discussion about so if you watch council meetings or school committee meetings everyone is member so-and-so Councilor so-and-so we sort of

111
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:33,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Landed on a slightly different approach.

112
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We are residents and neighbors, and as such, we will refer to each other by our first name unless somebody requests.

113
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:44,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, the mayor of Medford will be referred to as mayor and the superintendent will be referred to a superintendent.

114
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, we're gonna be friends and neighbors 1st and committee members 2nd.

115
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's item number 2.

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Members of the SBC are urged to speak for themselves using I statements.

117
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:59,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Allow for one speaker at a time.

118
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Be present, engaged, and prepared.

119
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Engage in honest and open conversation.

120
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:11,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Assume the best intentions and understand and acknowledge intent and hold themselves and one another accountable.

121
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:17,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number four, public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda.

122
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:21,633
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak.

123
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:26,012
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair will announce the timeline before any public comment period at every meeting.

124
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:31,680
[SPEAKER_06]: The public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing by emailing the SBC account.

125
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Those emails will be auto forwarded to all members when they come in.

126
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:41,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number five, the SBC will operate following Robert's Rules of Order.

127
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:47,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we try to do here is give you like the ones you need to know in order to sort of function in a basic way.

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So voting happens when a motion to do something is made and seconded after debate.

129
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:57,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the open meeting law, voice votes are allowed when everybody is physically present.

130
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we say all those in favor, all those opposed.

131
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,768
[SPEAKER_06]: and you just say aye or nay.

132
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:07,210
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when any voting member is remotely participating, a roll call is required.

133
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Any voting member may request a roll call vote.

134
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:21,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we were all here in person and there was something sort of squirrely going on and you're like, no, I really want to know where everybody stands, you just say roll call and then we will do an official roll call so everyone has to register their vote.

135
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:25,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Any voting member may suggest an amendment to the motion.

136
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:29,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair will guide and support members in following Robert's rules during the meetings.

137
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:32,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Members may speak twice on any debatable motion for up to three minutes.

138
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:38,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And once voting begins, no member may speak other than to indicate how they are voting.

139
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:53,770
[SPEAKER_06]: If a voting member of the committee believes a mistake was made with a motion that passed or failed and that member was in the majority for that motion, they may make a motion to reconsider to do so by speaking to the chair on how to proceed.

140
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in other words, if something happens really fast and

141
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:06,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of a split vote, and somebody that was on the winning side says, wait a minute, I don't think we all know what we just did there.

142
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,867
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a process for us to reconsider, as long as that is raised by somebody who was in the majority vote.

143
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:20,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that happens, just say, wait a minute, I have a question, and we'll work through the mechanics of how to do that.

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:31,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then if items on the agenda will be taken out of order from how they are presented on the agenda, a voting member must make a motion to spend the rules and take them specifically out of order.

145
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:37,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number six, the chair will create the agenda and place certain items within the consent agenda item.

146
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:44,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number seven, all SBC meetings and or any SBC subcommittee shall operate according to the open meeting law.

147
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: The SBC shall to the best of its ability ensure its meetings are reported by Medford Public Media and broadcast live to the district YouTube channel.

148
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:57,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Media requests for comment from the SBC will be directed to the chair of the SBC.

149
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:04,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Number nine, non-voting members will be called during the roll call at the beginning of the meetings, but their presence will not be counted towards a forum.

150
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I did that sort of while I was calling the roll.

151
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-voting members will not be called for the adjournment of meetings, as this is just simply a vote to adjourn the meeting.

152
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:18,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And our non-voting members cannot be counted in that group.

153
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:25,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And then item number 10, new members of the SBC will be onboarded following the checklist, which will be maintained by the responsible committee.

154
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:30,705
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sort of our proposed set of rules.

155
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:39,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So the subcommittee both created and considered these rules and is bringing them here tonight for discussion.

156
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:52,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will open the floor if anyone has questions, comments, thoughts, anything they want to change, like this is the time for us to do that because we will adopt those changes as we go.

157
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:53,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

158
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:54,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick question, thank you.

159
00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:18,146
[SPEAKER_12]: chair did you discuss giving everybody three minutes and then limited it to one first one time per topic yes um and the limit to one time per topic did not

160
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:25,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Because make it in here and that actually completely mirrors how we do public participation at school.

161
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:31,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So people are welcome to speak on any item that we're discussing, like, members of the public could be weighing in on the rules right now.

162
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:37,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yes, we generally do limit to 3 minutes, 3 minutes per person and you can't.

163
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:41,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get back in line and come back up again and talk for three more minutes.

164
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:48,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's a lot of public participation, we sort of can make those adjustments on the fly under our rules.

165
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:54,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would, yeah, so we would add one time to that item.

166
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:59,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I see somebody's question?

167
00:12:59,194 --> 00:12:59,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Luke?

168
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:19,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's something that we can all collectively decide to do without having to partner with that school.

169
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think we can.

170
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:23,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, we can do that for the next meeting.

171
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:27,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily?

172
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:34,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we following all of the rubber-toothed order and this is just a reminder of the basic ones that are most common?

173
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:34,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

174
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:41,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think they're hopefully for our purposes, the ones that will need to be used here.

175
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:58,552
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a lot of like other things that happen when things get wild, and I'm hoping we can navigate through those without having to have y'all go by the 200 page book and read about parliamentary procedure.

176
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of the goal, and if things get out of hand, we'll adjust.

177
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,571
[SPEAKER_09]: approval as much.

178
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:08,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any?

179
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything missing?

180
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, um, so motion to approve as amended by Mayor Lungo-Koehn second seconded by Nicole.

181
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my list.

182
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:25,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

183
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:25,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

184
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:27,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr Edouard-Vincent?

185
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

186
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr Glusi?

187
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

188
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:31,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr Cushing?

189
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

190
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Marta?

191
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:33,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

192
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:33,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Libby?

193
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:34,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

194
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:34,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa?

195
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:36,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

196
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:39,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria.

197
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:39,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

198
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:40,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian.

199
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:41,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy.

200
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:42,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

201
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:42,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily.

202
00:14:42,868 --> 00:14:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

203
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:43,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicole.

204
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:44,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

205
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:44,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron.

206
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:45,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

207
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:45,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke.

208
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:46,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

209
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Jenny.

210
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:48,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

211
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,935
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

212
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:52,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules have been adopted.

213
00:14:54,916 --> 00:15:03,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, item number four is, oh, sorry, also under item number three is the onboarding checklist.

214
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:17,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the next page, what we tried to do was just create like a little checklist of like the kinds of things that we're going to want to remember to do when somebody new joins this committee, which is somewhat inevitable, and things that we want to make sure this group has,

215
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,643
[SPEAKER_06]: has done and is comfortable with.

216
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So open meeting law training, for those of you who were here last week, you went through open meeting law training.

217
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:33,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We will send you like a little thing to attest that you did it just so we can put it in the file and move on.

218
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:46,797
[SPEAKER_06]: If you missed it, there is training offered by the Attorney General's office and we'll get the presentation from Janelle at KP and make sure that you all have what you need just so that you understand sort of the role open meeting law plays.

219
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:50,458
[SPEAKER_06]: our SBC rules, which we just adopted.

220
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:57,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We would want to make sure new members get an overview of the MSDA process, which we did in the last meeting.

221
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone will get an email address.

222
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:01,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're still working on that.

223
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right, Dr. Cushing?

224
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you all, if you don't already have an MPS email address, you will get one.

225
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:16,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, highly encourage that all communications about the SBC happen via that email.

226
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:24,638
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use your personal email to do this, sort of open up your personal email to records requests, so it is not

227
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:25,958
[SPEAKER_06]: recommended.

228
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:29,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one quick question.

229
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Emily previously worked for the district.

230
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:33,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, we will.

231
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there, and Larry, your email is still active?

232
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:37,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still active.

233
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're good.

234
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anyone else that previously may have not met to publish this email with us?

235
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just need to know.

236
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:46,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

237
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:47,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

238
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:54,893
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make sure people have access to the MSBA website and our School Building Authority website.

239
00:16:56,094 --> 00:17:00,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a bit of work in progress, but I'm expecting we'll be able to look at it at the next meeting.

240
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked a little bit about that at our communications meeting, so more on that in just a second.

241
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we'll provide people a meeting schedule and add people to our distribution list.

242
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:17,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert's was an order, an email to everybody else to introduce a new member so that everybody knows who to expect.

243
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,034
[SPEAKER_06]: This acronym listing is obviously quite short, and I'm sure it will get much, much longer before we're done.

244
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's sort of like our brief onboarding checklist.

245
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,058
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that we talked about was

246
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:45,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Collecting up exemplar documents from other districts, so we can start to look at, like, how other people are navigating this process stone and Belmont Arlington Somerville Winchester.

247
00:17:46,862 --> 00:18:08,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And possibly Mohawk as a vocational school are some places that we would like to go out and sort of collect that information and make it available, not just to the members of this group, but to other members of the community who might be interested in sort of taking a deep dive into the phase that we're at or what we're up to and how other communities are handling these documents.

248
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:12,599
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's our onboarding checklist.

249
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions, thoughts, Tom?

250
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to offer one correction.

251
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Scrivener's error, I think, Jenny.

252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,802
[SPEAKER_03]: But under important websites, I think we mean to say BedfordSBC website as opposed to SBA website.

253
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:28,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

254
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:31,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

255
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Other questions, comments, thoughts?

256
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:39,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

257
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We sort of felt like this would be a living document rather than something to get through.

258
00:18:48,103 --> 00:19:03,412
[SPEAKER_05]: As we move through this process, like, you know, when we've got shovels in the ground, some of these things may be irrelevant, which is our fault, but we want to make sure that this, it's not overwhelming, but actually appropriate for something to be completed.

259
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:05,665
[SPEAKER_05]: seats.

260
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:10,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't know if that was actually written somewhere.

261
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:14,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It is at the bottom right.

262
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But we would just modify it as we did.

263
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:23,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything that you think should be there should let Jenny or me or somebody else add it.

264
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be a meeting conversation.

265
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

266
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:32,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Other questions, things that look

267
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:33,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Maria?

268
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:37,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a question about that list of exemplars.

269
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

270
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:47,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a limit on how many years since they built their buildings that we should limit it to within the last five years?

271
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, anything like that?

272
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:48,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

273
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:52,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think ideally, they would be close in time.

274
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Winchester, I think, is a little bit further out.

275
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:02,158
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the thing that intrigued me about Winchester was like, they're like,

276
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:13,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Their overhaul of the building was maybe possibly something that would be similar to what happens here, where the facade changed and they did it in state.

277
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:15,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So there might just be something interesting there.

278
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:19,507
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think they were a little bit further back than some of the others.

279
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:22,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Stoneham's right in the middle of their process.

280
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Arlington is.

281
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Belmont is.

282
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:26,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rest of them are all very recent.

283
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But Winchester sort of jumped out at me because it's a building I know with my eye that

284
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:38,497
[SPEAKER_06]: has gone through like sort of started out looking a little bit like our building and has gone through that restoration.

285
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:39,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

286
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:39,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

287
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Adelbert on what?

288
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Admit it man.

289
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:52,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a question to Jane.

290
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

291
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the idea that they're in close proximity?

292
00:20:55,555 --> 00:21:00,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Alvaro change that the idea that they're in close proximity or ideally?

293
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but they don't have to be.

294
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, we know of a district that has gone through this and like.

295
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:11,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Particularly the ones where it went smoothly, maybe, like those documents are the ones I want to see.

296
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:17,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know, obviously, to me, Fuller River went through where they kept their field house.

297
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,253
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that may be relevant to us.

298
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:21,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just opened, right?

299
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:22,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably a year ago.

300
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:26,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Nattleboro was around the same population.

301
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

302
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:30,181
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

303
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Other thoughts about this checklist?

304
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:42,767
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I think might be helpful is it's not as easy as you might think to find some of these exemplar documents.

305
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Tom, I think we started creating a folder.

306
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:48,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how far we got.

307
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:49,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to check.

308
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a couple of weeks.

309
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll check.

310
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:52,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

311
00:21:54,261 --> 00:22:01,625
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's anybody who's willing to take on one of these communities and go find their documents, that would be amazing.

312
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:08,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think the quicker we can sort of pull all these into some place, the more accessible it will be for everybody.

313
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if there's any volunteers to take on going to track down Luke.

314
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:15,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a silhouette.

315
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:16,873
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

316
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:18,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

317
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:23,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can send those my way, I'll get them dropped in the, I'll get them to Tom.

318
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,345
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get them to Tom so they can be shared.

319
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:28,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else?

320
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:29,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron?

321
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:30,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

322
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,126
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

323
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:35,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron will go digging, for example, our documents.

324
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody want to sign on to help Aaron?

325
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:39,848
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

326
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:40,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Which documents?

327
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for right now, what I'm particularly interested in is their eligibility documents, right?

328
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:06,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So the same documents we're going to have to send it in, like, they, they have to be in the public records somewhere.

329
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,665
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think if you look at a project, that's just about done, those documents are going to be.

330
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already well varied, I'm guessing.

331
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So it might just take a little bit of digging to find.

332
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:21,478
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would be interested in what did other people put in their educational profile?

333
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:33,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's a pretty meaty document, and I'm interested in what all goes in there, because that could give us good inspiration when we start reviewing our educational profile.

334
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:36,022
[SPEAKER_06]: The same thing with the Chapter 74 form.

335
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the two big ones in the eligibility base.

336
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:42,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

337
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:51,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I spoke with the OPM Watertown.

338
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,741
[SPEAKER_05]: They were remarkably like- Yeah.

339
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:01,802
[SPEAKER_05]: They reached out a whole bunch of other projects they were involved with and other OPMs they do.

340
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:05,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was looking for rules, so I didn't ask about any of the documents.

341
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you want to show me on the list?

342
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:08,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

343
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,883
[SPEAKER_05]: dialogue going on.

344
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:20,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume they have access to them.

345
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:20,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

346
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:23,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

347
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:28,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions about onboarding?

348
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

349
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

350
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:42,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we'll move on to item number four, which is review and amend proposed communications and community engagement strategy for the eligibility phase.

351
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:54,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So the communications and community engagement team met and actually I thought we had like a really fun discussion of some of the opportunities that we have.

352
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:58,318
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly sort of focused around the eligibility phase.

353
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:01,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing is like first draft of the website.

354
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:04,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Our website will be connected to the MPS website.

355
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:08,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a standalone thing with a separate architecture.

356
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be connected.

357
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a dedicated domain.

358
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,212
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our sites are secure.

359
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:17,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that should be fine.

360
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,457
[SPEAKER_06]: The basic structure that we landed on was like,

361
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,842
[SPEAKER_06]: A welcome page like welcome and why, like, why are we doing this?

362
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:30,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll so Tom and I will work on pending something for that page.

363
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:37,501
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a meetings page where, like, you can go get all the meeting doc agendas and minutes and all that good stuff.

364
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:46,057
[SPEAKER_06]: A news page where like when we submit documents, where we're doing press releases, that all of that can sort of live.

365
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:53,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a documents space so that as we finish and complete documents, they can be posted.

366
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:58,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Bios for all of you will also be available on the site.

367
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:04,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, FAQs, which we'll talk about in just a second, but you know, ultimately sort of an evolving list of

368
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:10,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Answers to questions people want to know about what we're up to some extent so far.

369
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the website sort of broadly and then we did talk about, like.

370
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: some of our community engagement opportunities in the eligibility base specifically, because I think people are really excited to be part of the things that are going to happen a little bit further down the line, like focus groups with students, focus groups with teachers, focus groups, community members, but like it's going to take some time for us to get there.

371
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:38,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in this eligibility phase, we talked about a couple of things.

372
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,522
[SPEAKER_06]: One was a community survey

373
00:26:41,828 --> 00:27:03,799
[SPEAKER_06]: um where we would collect um some information so the questions that we have on our list is um you know we want to answer your question so tell us what questions do you have about the building committee itself and what questions do you have about the eligibility process um we want to know what kind of features are important to you so tell us like what do you see in a reimagined bedford high school just to like

374
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,460
[SPEAKER_06]: get everybody sort of thinking and excited about that.

375
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And what suggestions do you have for the building committee?

376
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us who you are.

377
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a caregiver, a student, a resident, MPS faculty?

378
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:15,822
[SPEAKER_06]: What neighborhood are you from?

379
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you a Medford High student, past, present, or future?

380
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:29,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to sort of get an understanding of like, is there a set of questions that's coming from primarily students, primarily faculty, et cetera?

381
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,407
[SPEAKER_06]: And tell us how you want to be involved in this process.

382
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:36,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take surveys during the process.

383
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:37,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a tour of MHS.

384
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know about your meetings in advance.

385
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the highlights, please.

386
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us how you want to know and be involved in this process.

387
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So one proposal that we have is to send out a community-based survey to collect some input that will help inform those FAQs and start to get people thinking about the fact that this is

388
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:01,069
[SPEAKER_06]: a community-based project for everybody.

389
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:13,837
[SPEAKER_06]: We did talk about scheduling some tours of MHS, probably not before the end of school this year, because I don't think there's like a single extra minute in the schedule.

390
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:27,926
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, really thinking about like, as we give people a tour, I think that would be very, I think that would be very appealing to people who don't spend any time in this building or don't have kids in this building yet to be able to come in and see like,

391
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:30,489
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we talking about here?

392
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:32,892
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what it looks like outside.

393
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:34,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they know what the pool looks like, et cetera.

394
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:40,942
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there some sort of curated tour we can provide people so people start to get an understanding of what this building is?

395
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:42,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, what some of the challenges are.

396
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:46,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that needs to be baked into any sort of tour that we're doing.

397
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We did talk about being willing to do more staff meetings with your team.

398
00:28:54,252 --> 00:29:00,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if there is another staff meeting coming up for the end of the year, or even next year that you want us to participate in, you can do that.

399
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We did talk, we had this, Luke had this great idea.

400
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:09,263
[SPEAKER_06]: There's apparently a video from this back in the 70s when Medford High opened.

401
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:22,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And that it would be really cool to do some sort of like then and now of like what these spaces look like and how they've aged since the 70s.

402
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:26,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And Maria is also in the middle of digitizing yearbooks.

403
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:28,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So she has some history of the old, old MHS.

404
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:44,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we talked about this as, like, maybe a program for, you know, potentially our vocational students to get involved in creating something that would be available.

405
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:49,210
[SPEAKER_06]: for us for really marketing purposes as we go.

406
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:57,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, nothing that has to be done before the end of June, but these kinds of cool creative things obviously take time.

407
00:29:57,474 --> 00:30:04,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So really thinking about how do we start to create some energy around what's happening in the building and what the potential is.

408
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did talk about developing a roadshow presentation.

409
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:14,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nicole and Marissa Desmond volunteered to work on a draft of that.

410
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:22,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We think that content will change all the time, but we do anticipate a lot of reasons to go tell people what's happening here.

411
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:32,366
[SPEAKER_06]: And so whether it's at school committee, whether the council wants to be briefed on a regular basis, whether we're talking to community groups,

412
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:39,275
[SPEAKER_06]: We want there to be some common set of talking points so that any member of this committee could say, yes, I'm available on that day.

413
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:43,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go do that talk and sort of carry forward before the committee.

414
00:30:44,715 --> 00:31:08,172
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of other things we talked about, certainly including some periodic updates in the superintendent's weekly update, but also investigating some sort of like, register your email to subscribe to this particular kind of news, which will be important for people who maybe don't have kids in MPS right now and aren't seeing the superintendent's weekly updates but might be interested in this.

415
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:22,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also talked about for the website, creating a roadmap that's visual, that demonstrates like, where are we in the process and what steps have we already completed and what's next?

416
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something that we'll work on.

417
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:37,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria is going to collect some info for us so that we can start to have tables at some of the community-based events like the Farmers Market, Family Concert Series, Circled Square, those kinds of things.

418
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:43,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And so once we get there, we may want to have some poster boards of what NHS looks like.

419
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:54,725
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, something visual about our road map and where we are, but really just to be there to answer questions and create interest in the community and encourage people to to be part of this process.

420
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:05,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions about that in terms of our, like, communication plan and strategy and the eligibility phase.

421
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the event tables, I like that a lot.

422
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think there are a number of businesses that get a lot of foot traffic where we can put things up as well, like Colleen's.

423
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:18,564
[SPEAKER_05]: CB Scoops.

424
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:19,545
[SPEAKER_05]: CB Scoops.

425
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,826
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, yes.

426
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:28,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's probably others as well where we can be very supportive and have a lot of foot traffic.

427
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:29,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm shocked.

428
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter works at Colleen's.

429
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm shocked how many people are in and out of that place.

430
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild.

431
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

432
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:38,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

433
00:32:59,272 --> 00:32:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

434
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:12,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

435
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:26,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think some of the youth sports organizations will have a vested interest in what becomes of the property as well, because they rely on the fields and that kind of thing.

436
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's actually a great idea.

437
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,887
[SPEAKER_06]: We can add that.

438
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:30,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy?

439
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:37,573
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that stuck out that I want, also internal but external, is this reimagined improvised school.

440
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: collective determination of how the committee is going to talk about it during this phase.

441
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it re-imagined?

442
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we don't want to go out and start out and say we're building new or things like that.

443
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:56,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that, I underline it as I was reading it, say re-imagined gives you a lot of possibility.

444
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:06,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we as a community, when we're communicating or however we're putting it out there, we're using a certain term, whether it's re-imagined or something else that we can come up with.

445
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:07,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're all speaking.

446
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:12,408
[SPEAKER_08]: same language when we're talking about the process that we're in now?

447
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:16,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a great question.

448
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Our website is building MHS because building can mean like all of those things, but I think reimagine is the other word that I like to use when I'm talking to people because

449
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:35,337
[SPEAKER_06]: What it's going to be is not decided yet, right?

450
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:39,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when people say, well, what's it going to look like?

451
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to do this or that?

452
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I typically say, we don't know that yet.

453
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,183
[SPEAKER_06]: But part of this process is really an imaginative process.

454
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us got to see Arlington High School.

455
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:54,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And we went into a room, and it was called the discourse room.

456
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:06,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a classroom, but it was a little bit more like a college classroom, but it was intended to be big enough for multiple classes to be in there at the same time.

457
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you could like, co teach a lesson and there could be like.

458
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:20,449
[SPEAKER_06]: A debate happening in the room was structured for that right and so that's it like an imagination like point, we don't have anything like that here today.

459
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:27,839
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's possible and not only is it possible it exists right and so really thinking about like.

460
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:35,732
[SPEAKER_06]: What is possible, I think, is hard to do when you are tied to a building and how it functions, right?

461
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:41,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You can say, I want the windows to open, or I want the lockers to be bigger or smaller.

462
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:46,774
[SPEAKER_06]: But to really think about what isn't here does take a lot of imagination.

463
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:51,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think reimagining is a good word for us to think about using.

464
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if others have thoughts about that.

465
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom?

466
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I completely agree.

467
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I think reimagined has been a really attractive and salient message.

468
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking about this project, I also think that when we're engaging with folks in the community, and they're looking for more specificity, that's where we say, well, look, the two big buckets are rebuild or renovate, right?

469
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:19,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two kinds of MSBA projects.

470
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:22,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hoping to do one or the other.

471
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's still space to be more specific.

472
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that

473
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,821
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in this early stage, there's so much value in it.

474
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:55,329
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an imaginative process, like you were saying, Jenny, it's really talking about what is here that we care about and want to preserve, and the things that we do like about the space, as much as we talk about the things that need to be remedied, there are things about this building that we like and that the community values, but then also thinking bigger about, you know,

475
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:58,378
[SPEAKER_03]: do we change programming?

476
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we expand certain programming?

477
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we move things around in a different way?

478
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, those are all imaginative questions.

479
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I would certainly be in favor of emphasizing that reimaginability.

480
00:37:08,986 --> 00:37:10,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

481
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:19,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also the bureaucratic aspect of the public space where we're like a bureaucrat.

482
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:23,037
[SPEAKER_04]: We're creating tools where

483
00:37:34,485 --> 00:38:01,403
[SPEAKER_04]: is a big snowy, which is truly, I think, where creative juices get tapped, and have a professional design and planning team that's brought on board, that's put on retainer, given the job of locating that what's here, in terms of acreage

484
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:18,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what levels of replacement or renovation, and that's where the imagination really kicks in.

485
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:19,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

486
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:23,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So I totally agree with it.

487
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:31,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Reimagining is a good catch-all for the general process, but there is a sort of bureaucratic aspect to it.

488
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:31,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

489
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:42,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think what I tell people about eligibility is like, we've got to get through this in order to get on to answering the questions you really want to know about.

490
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:53,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're going to move as quickly as we can through this eligibility phase so that we can start the real engagement and the imagination about what this could be.

491
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:57,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions?

492
00:38:57,528 --> 00:39:00,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

493
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:15,023
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that I worry about is the people who are like coming at us with stuff about the feasibility of reimagining they want to do now is, you know, when we get through that gate, we'll get through it.

494
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:15,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

495
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:16,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we will.

496
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:18,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting through that gate.

497
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: It isn't the time to then start engaging the community to start thinking about reimagining because like the race began.

498
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:41,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And catching all those people in their reimaginings and interests, even though we can't do anything with them right now, so that on day one of that process, they're all queued up, ready to be balled.

499
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:47,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, well, I mean, it is just a lot of paperwork right now.

500
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:54,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't, like, hook them and keep them, because frankly, none of them are probably interested in paperwork.

501
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:09,348
[SPEAKER_05]: on day one, you know, I mean, I know, like, when I run for office, like, for two full years, I had people contact me, and they support me, and then time to start my campaign up, and I'm like, who are all those people again?

502
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:25,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't want us to, I mean, I don't know if we create a shared document where we just add names of people who have interests, maybe a little note, how did you meet them, what was their interest, so that when we have a reason to meet them,

503
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:32,979
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not all just, like, digging through our memories of this long process of reading a bunch of books and documents.

504
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that my own, like, intent to do that every day falls flat.

505
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:43,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think about that as a committee, something to formalize.

506
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm too formal.

507
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:49,766
[SPEAKER_06]: We did talk about creating a mail list, essentially.

508
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:59,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the place for capturing those folks, because we can create the list in such a way that you can tell us what you want to know about.

509
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:04,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, what else do you want us to keep in mind about you?

510
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:09,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have that running list, and people can self-subscribe.

511
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:09,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke?

512
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:14,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, since you want to serve it, you would need to add a question.

513
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:31,480
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we were to talk about a survey, that's kind of part of our work here, but certainly identifying specific people and affirming that they want to come back with us and are still willing to share.

514
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:44,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a great suggestion.

515
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:46,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will, I've got that on my list to add.

516
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Other thoughts about the community engagement piece so far?

517
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:54,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria?

518
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:57,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to what Luke mentioned about sports teams.

519
00:41:57,163 --> 00:41:58,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

520
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:06,568
[SPEAKER_07]: My mind jumped to the PTOs because it's not only they're a powerful group, but it's a way to reach everyone who's in schools.

521
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:16,289
[SPEAKER_07]: but also the Catholic schools, the private schools, the local charter schools, because if we want to bring people back, they're the ones that have less of what we deserve.

522
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:17,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

523
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

524
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I will put that on the list.

525
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:25,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Just feel free to tap into the city side as well, because of course it's important for

526
00:42:26,438 --> 00:42:31,223
[SPEAKER_12]: families to want to be involved, but I think we need to build excitement amongst the entire community.

527
00:42:31,263 --> 00:42:35,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not going to help robocalls, newsletters, start building that excitement.

528
00:42:36,107 --> 00:42:39,510
[SPEAKER_12]: So I need everybody's support, but hopefully we'll be there.

529
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:40,952
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, we can do that.

530
00:42:44,889 --> 00:43:04,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the city side of things, we also talked about how best to engage our boards and commissions, because there's a huge number of boards and commissions across the city, some of which have lots of obvious touch points with this school building committee, and others maybe not as obvious, but maybe there are some that we're not thinking about.

531
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:08,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will build a separate survey for them, for the boards and commissions, to say,

532
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:14,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Does your board or commission have an overlapping and or aligned interest in our SBC?

533
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:18,120
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, please describe at what phase in the process.

534
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we reach out to you?

535
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:26,114
[SPEAKER_06]: to your board and commission for that sort of integration, what's the best way to reach you, and do you have any questions for us?

536
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:31,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also offer to hold informal sessions for those boards and commissions.

537
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:34,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they may say, can you come speak at a board meeting?

538
00:43:34,436 --> 00:43:43,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll have this little roadshow presentation that we can bring with us, and somebody can go and speak to them and sort of bring back to the group what they talked about.

539
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:49,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the idea of how to make sure we're casting sort of a wide net across our boards and commissions.

540
00:43:50,441 --> 00:44:03,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also, in my mind, I know REC has a board now, but we would also be trying to tap into the folks at Medford REC because they obviously have sort of another vested interest in what's going on there.

541
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

542
00:44:16,848 --> 00:44:22,729
[SPEAKER_04]: third-party candidates, because there are organizations that are possibly outside of our community.

543
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

544
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:31,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That rent, the building, the fields, on a regular basis, on a regular basis.

545
00:44:31,992 --> 00:44:32,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

546
00:44:32,872 --> 00:44:44,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of engagement there, is there already a concept for how to sort of see their thing there?

547
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes out to our community, or is there a certain issue?

548
00:44:50,784 --> 00:44:58,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think there might need to be some sort of slightly different survey for them, much like there's something different for the boards and commissions.

549
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:11,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we can talk about that in our next, we have another communications meeting coming up, but we can talk about that in our next meeting and just figure out how do we properly get them into the fold as well?

550
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:16,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think you're right, this building is never quiet, ever.

551
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:18,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

552
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So even when school's not happening, something's happening in this building more than likely.

553
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So just, you know, I think that is actually a really good point.

554
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a list of all those things?

555
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm aware of some, but just an idea of who all the schools are.

556
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sure we have a list.

557
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to work on whether it's an actual list or if it's

558
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,825
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of things all over the place that we have to pull together, but yeah.

559
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:52,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions?

560
00:45:53,107 --> 00:45:53,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Larry?

561
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:57,671
[SPEAKER_02]: This may be stupid, but get used to it.

562
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:07,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I've all seen the cooking shows where they give the guys a grocery cart, and they have to use certain ingredients to make the best thing.

563
00:46:10,027 --> 00:46:23,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me what would be helpful early on, and I don't know that this has particular application to your specific comments today, but I would like to know what we have to work with in terms of sites in the city.

564
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:30,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to know specifically, I have some questions about this building, having been in it now for 10 years.

565
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter and I have discussed it on a couple occasions.

566
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:39,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I gave a superintendent a paper maybe a year or so ago,

567
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:46,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that idea you mentioned earlier of the tour might be good for this group as well.

568
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:47,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

569
00:46:47,924 --> 00:46:50,766
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just be honest with the good, bad, and young.

570
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:52,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do we have here, really?

571
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

572
00:46:54,307 --> 00:46:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have most of the answers, but I think I have a few things that I'm certainly concerned about.

573
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:09,489
[SPEAKER_02]: One being subterranean groundwater in the fells, which is caused, I believe it's exacerbated a lot of the structural settling.

574
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just kind of leave that there for now.

575
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:15,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe it can be remediated.

576
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:31,203
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think if everybody's kind of up to speed on what we have here, and there are some environmental, shall we say, things that we can stay in this building,

577
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:46,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But additionally, like the other pieces of property that could be available can, you know, be squeezable out of the bells, that we have a loop around and maybe integrate, particularly if we're going to have a lot more sports things here and somehow

578
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,371
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to the soccer fields below the synagogue down there.

579
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Playstead Park?

580
00:47:53,211 --> 00:47:57,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's just, and then what about the whole thing of Hormel Stadium?

581
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a big, nice piece of valuable property sitting there that doesn't get used very often.

582
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:10,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is worth a lot of money, a lot of money, because potentially it can help finance some other things we're doing elsewhere.

583
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:15,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of the tax revenue perspective.

584
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a bunch of people, say, in high-end condos, not that I'm suggesting, I'm just trying to, like, what are we dealing with here?

585
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:24,469
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have to work with?

586
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,190
[SPEAKER_02]: What are our options?

587
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And thinking outside the box.

588
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this site, maybe not, maybe a couple sites.

589
00:48:33,134 --> 00:48:38,057
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to know what ingredients we have to make the recipe.

590
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:39,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

591
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:40,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So two things.

592
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:42,789
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a meeting on 6-4.

593
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:49,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think having a tour of this building during that meeting makes a lot of sense.

594
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:51,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll put that on our agenda.

595
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:54,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a finance subcommittee meeting before that.

596
00:48:55,559 --> 00:49:01,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the finance subcommittee includes more of the city staff, like Bob and Fiona, et cetera.

597
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:07,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my goal for that meeting is for us to be talking about the sort of

598
00:49:09,425 --> 00:49:20,009
[SPEAKER_06]: getting to a place where we understand better what kind of funding needs to be set aside for feasibility study and for what, so that we can be ready to work with the council to do that.

599
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:29,613
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the other question we can put on their agenda is like, what are those possibilities across the city that this group needs to know about and start to be able to think about?

600
00:49:30,874 --> 00:49:31,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do that.

601
00:49:31,814 --> 00:49:32,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

602
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So with respect to the feasibility, is there

603
00:49:38,953 --> 00:49:45,036
[SPEAKER_04]: formal RFP process or collect the bids so that we know what it costs.

604
00:49:45,617 --> 00:49:49,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll only know if somebody's delivering the bids.

605
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully in the spring.

606
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there something else?

607
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:57,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, people are chomping at the bit for this project.

608
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:06,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so once we get through this, the first thing that we do is we put out an RFP to bring on our OPM.

609
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:10,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And that OPM has to be done by competitive bid.

610
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also chomping at the bit to be part of this.

611
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:24,936
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we have to do before we can even get there is demonstrate to MSBA that we have a pot of money set aside that is reasonable to cover

612
00:50:26,877 --> 00:50:28,498
[SPEAKER_06]: what will be the feasibility study.

613
00:50:28,538 --> 00:50:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So that includes the OPM and then ultimately the feasibility study.

614
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:42,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So the mayor will need to send something to the council that says this is how much money that we're going to set aside and this is where it's going to come from and then the council will need to take a vote.

615
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:48,210
[SPEAKER_06]: How we think that's going to happen is that that money will be moved into the newly created stabilization fund.

616
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be an earmark of like this is money for

617
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: The feasibility study for MSBA and it will get moved into the stabilization fund.

618
00:50:55,275 --> 00:51:03,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's there and it's ready for us when we are ready for it rather than waiting for free cash to come all the way back around sometime around now next year.

619
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to be in place before MSBA will move us on to the next step.

620
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:12,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working through the mechanics of that and we've been in touch with the president of the council.

621
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:13,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So he knows it's coming.

622
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:19,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, yeah, we have some flexibility because there's not a vote required.

623
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:24,249
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a city wide vote required to fund the feasibility study.

624
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:27,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will that will come from our free cash reserves.

625
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's been our plan.

626
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:34,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, regards to feasibility studies, I've had some limited experience.

627
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them, of course, have been in free enterprise.

628
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:40,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to do with, is this going to be profitable?

629
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:41,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we sell it?

630
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:42,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot.

631
00:51:42,343 --> 00:51:44,083
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part of it.

632
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:45,124
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different.

633
00:51:45,304 --> 00:51:48,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying we shouldn't have a feasibility study.

634
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We really should.

635
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we can do a lot of the initial homework ourselves.

636
00:51:52,686 --> 00:51:55,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows what's more feasible than the people in this room.

637
00:51:56,542 --> 00:52:00,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody knows, like I was saying about the ingredients, what's available to us.

638
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:08,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's get it as far as we can before we turn it over to them, because all they're going to do is ask us all the same questions we're asking each other.

639
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So MSBA requires

640
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:25,772
[SPEAKER_06]: a certain process and that process really is like you can't sort of jump the line through their steps so our goal needs to be to bring those feasibility folks on as quickly as possible and be ready to hand them something.

641
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:34,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a really important idea but more importantly like we need to get them on the bus as quickly as we can so that they can make progress because

642
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:36,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We could hand them a whole thing.

643
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:39,516
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still going to do it again because they have to.

644
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of the prescription of the MSBA process is that there's no jumping the line, so to speak.

645
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:50,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can pre-think through things.

646
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

647
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:52,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

648
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:59,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just feel like as a communications professional, like we're going all over the place a little bit.

649
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:05,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're helping to find out what questions should maybe be on the website that people want to have answers to.

650
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:11,276
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would think just for like folks following along at home or just all of us trying to follow along to make sure, are we still on the communications?

651
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:17,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we just kind of like going a little bit here, there, just with general questions, which I totally get as far as.

652
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,837
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it back to the communications and community engagement.

653
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:21,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

654
00:53:21,597 --> 00:53:24,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we probably veered off track a little bit, but that's okay.

655
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,421
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back.

656
00:53:27,382 --> 00:53:39,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing that we did talk a little bit about is that there is a question on the educational profile that does say like, what is your communication strategy during this time period?

657
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:41,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a couple of

658
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:47,679
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple of thoughts there about how we are going to answer this question.

659
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:56,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll certainly make this outline of what we plan to do a little bit jazzier and more cohesive.

660
00:53:56,044 --> 00:54:02,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will go in there, as well as describe some of the topics where we're expecting school committee engagement.

661
00:54:02,347 --> 00:54:06,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, at our next meeting, which is on the 20th,

662
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Fallon will be bringing forward a conversation about expansion of certain vocational programs that they'll be seeking support from the school committee, like sort of to green light those ideas.

663
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:31,055
[SPEAKER_06]: That's important for us to do and for us to take a vote on at school committee so that then it can be incorporated into our chapter 74 profile before it goes in.

664
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:35,796
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a conversation tomorrow, is it tomorrow?

665
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:46,190
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Wednesday.

666
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:46,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday.

667
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:51,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a special education subcommittee meeting of the school committee on Wednesday.

668
00:54:51,133 --> 00:55:04,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And that group will be talking about the possible inclusion of the Curtis Tufts program to the campus through this project.

669
00:55:05,622 --> 00:55:06,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know,

670
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:32,959
[SPEAKER_06]: we are all feeling like the time that there's an opportunity to create increased educational opportunities for our students at Curtis Tufts by co-locating them here and they're in in a way that still like meets their needs because they do have a particular like a sort of a different set of needs than being in a gen ed setting so how do you sort of do both of those things is an important question

671
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:43,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've asked the special education subcommittee, which is chaired by Paul, to explore that with students and members of the staff and come back to the school committee with a recommendation.

672
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:51,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if that group sort of recommends that this is not a good idea, we should not pursue this, then we would not put it in our educational profile.

673
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:57,700
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they confirm that there is broad agreement, then we would make sure that that programming is in here as well.

674
00:55:58,393 --> 00:56:15,550
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a Medford resident who runs Somerville's sort of similar program and he happened to be at our meeting last week when we put the need for that meeting to happen on the agenda and he had just a million amazing things to say about

675
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:27,274
[SPEAKER_06]: the benefits for students in the Somerville program, how the program has expanded, how this student participation in athletics has increased, and all the rest.

676
00:56:27,354 --> 00:56:36,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're all thinking there will be like a pretty favorable outcome from that, but that is another place where we're asking the school committee to get engaged in something.

677
00:56:36,962 --> 00:56:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last thing is we'll have, I think it's next week,

678
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:52,490
[SPEAKER_06]: a meeting, a school committee meeting about our capital planning process, and that has to be sort of tightened up and in good order before we put in our maintenance documents.

679
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of those things are happening at the school committee, so we'll wrap all of that in as well.

680
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke?

681
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, we can do that.

682
00:57:18,262 --> 00:57:18,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

683
00:57:20,184 --> 00:57:25,628
[SPEAKER_05]: The very stuff is not just part of the ISP.

684
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems different because it's a separate program.

685
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:32,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got its own name and it's in a different location.

686
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:34,095
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's part of it.

687
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:39,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's how we're going to dodge that.

688
00:57:40,218 --> 00:57:42,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it won't be a problem.

689
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And the program today is how many students, Lori?

690
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,366
[SPEAKER_12]: On the rules, 15.

691
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:48,366
15.

692
00:57:48,726 --> 00:57:56,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not talking about true consolidation that many communities go through.

693
00:57:57,054 --> 00:57:57,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

694
00:57:57,314 --> 00:57:59,296
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

695
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:06,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions about the communication and community engagement plan?

696
00:58:11,036 --> 00:58:16,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to approve the communication and community engagement plan as amended by our discussion?

697
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:23,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, motion to approve by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Emily.

698
00:58:23,484 --> 00:58:27,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Mayor?

699
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:27,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

700
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:29,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent?

701
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:30,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

702
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Galusi?

703
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:31,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

704
00:58:32,129 --> 00:58:32,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing?

705
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:33,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

706
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Marta?

707
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:34,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

708
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:35,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Libby?

709
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:35,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

710
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:36,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa?

711
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:38,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

712
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Maria, yes.

713
00:58:41,437 --> 00:58:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian, yes.

714
00:58:42,538 --> 00:58:43,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy, yes.

715
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:44,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily, yes.

716
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:45,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicole, yes.

717
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron, yes.

718
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke, yes.

719
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:49,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Janet, yes.

720
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

721
00:58:53,645 --> 00:58:54,746
[SPEAKER_06]: The plan is approved.

722
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:59,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're making good time at 7 o'clock.

723
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:10,634
[SPEAKER_06]: The last thing on the agenda was just to give you all a first draft look at 1 of our deliverables.

724
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:12,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as, you know, there's.

725
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,083
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 5 deliverables that we need to submit.

726
00:59:16,544 --> 00:59:18,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The 1st, 1 is an agreement that has been submitted.

727
00:59:18,807 --> 00:59:19,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It's complete.

728
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:24,354
[SPEAKER_06]: The 2nd, 1 is a list of all of your names that will be done before we meet next.

729
00:59:25,135 --> 00:59:30,182
[SPEAKER_06]: The 3rd, 1 is the educational profile and that 1 really sets, like, sort of the vision for, like.

730
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:32,423
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we do in this building and how do we do it?

731
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:34,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Both today and how do we want to do it in the future?

732
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:44,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And then because we have such a big vocational program, item number four is this chapter 74 viability program document.

733
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth one is the authorization to fund the feasibility study.

734
00:59:50,228 --> 00:59:56,089
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason that we're sort of, I won't say we're out of order, but we're starting with vocational first because this document is the most complete.

735
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The vocational programs have

736
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:08,862
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of the luxury, I guess, in this process of having already customized things happening in each of their programs.

737
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:17,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So where on the comprehensive side, on the sort of traditional side of the high school, there's sort of big, broad questions about, like,

738
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:26,266
[SPEAKER_06]: how are we teaching and how might we do things differently, the vocational programs all have that customization sort of implicit in their programming.

739
01:00:26,806 --> 01:00:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of it is driven by what chapter 74, which governs all of our vocational programs sort of requires.

740
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:40,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So what this document requires us to do is give them some information about our program.

741
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:43,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the second page, what you can see

742
01:00:44,971 --> 01:00:48,917
[SPEAKER_06]: here is a list of programs that we have that are existing.

743
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:57,292
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also see that we have our current enrollment for 23-24 listed.

744
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:01,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our current enrollment in the program for each program.

745
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:05,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a column for proposed capacity.

746
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:17,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a handful of programs where we believe that after our school committee meeting next week, that we will be seeking some expansion

747
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:08,306
[SPEAKER_09]: of certain programs because there is wait there's a wait list that's for

748
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:38,307
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be talking about Monday.

749
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:42,128
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be talking about Monday.

750
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:56,739
[SPEAKER_11]: um and what the staffing commitment would be to um

751
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:29,585
And.

752
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:33,427
Oh, yeah.

753
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:37,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

754
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:51,446
I'm going to go ahead and open it up for questions.

755
01:04:52,246 --> 01:05:00,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to open it up for questions.

756
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:26,036
And I think that's what we're trying to do here.

757
01:05:39,748 --> 01:05:46,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

758
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:33,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

759
01:07:11,618 --> 01:07:17,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

760
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

761
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

762
01:09:48,327 --> 01:09:50,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

763
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:54,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

764
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:39,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's an area that I just want someone to educate me on.

765
01:10:49,188 --> 01:10:50,468
[SPEAKER_08]: into their own space.

766
01:10:50,648 --> 01:10:52,169
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not often.

767
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:54,389
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it?

768
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:13,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if we are offering that offer, does that change the scope of this doctor didn't send before to lift it up or I think you're going to expand.

769
01:11:15,222 --> 01:11:17,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have done it before, right?

770
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:29,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have had students from other schools tuition in to our program, but the demand here is that we don't have the space for that anymore.

771
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:36,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk a little bit about what is the right mix of accounting for that possibility?

772
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:42,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a question for this group to really think about.

773
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:58,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, trying to build capacity for a revenue generating program is going to come at a cost, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it also, there's not super clear pipeline of like,

774
01:12:01,952 --> 01:12:05,773
[SPEAKER_06]: could how many tuitions could count on in a year.

775
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:25,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't know that we necessarily like really land anywhere but just to say that our first priority for this group has to be like our students and and half of that half of every class is deciding to go into a vocational program and I think that's in part because it's not

776
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:32,060
[SPEAKER_06]: the vocational programs are not what you think of as the vocational programs from when you went to school.

777
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,460
[SPEAKER_06]: They're quite different now.

778
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:38,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's just a tremendous number of them.

779
01:12:38,282 --> 01:12:42,443
[SPEAKER_08]: All you know, I'm building a new building, and it's coming with all new bills and lists.

780
01:12:43,003 --> 01:12:45,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody is talking, can we rent it?

781
01:12:45,884 --> 01:12:47,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get into it?

782
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:48,085
[SPEAKER_08]: What can we do?

783
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:53,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I see this data that there was one time an opportunity for our district

784
01:12:55,016 --> 01:13:05,003
[SPEAKER_08]: that has the latest model, whatever equipment, and Arlington people find out about it, can we come over and use that equipment?

785
01:13:05,223 --> 01:13:16,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want us to think about, as we think about how big this department is going to be, this part of the building is going to be, that there is going to be that desire to keep one up.

786
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:18,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

787
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you were going to have something to say.

788
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:23,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this goes way back, but

789
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:33,880
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started teaching here, it was my understanding it would cost $56,000 a year for us to send a kid to Minuteman to have plumbing.

790
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:43,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we go down that road, it should be nice if there was some sort of standardized fee schedule.

791
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,629
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think also, Chad, there is for the state.

792
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:47,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all done.

793
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:50,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Minuteman's sold $30,000 right now for the capital expense.

794
01:13:53,368 --> 01:13:58,493
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really know how the calculation works, but a sending count, sending a kid here for $10,0017, that's it.

795
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:03,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have 20 to 25 extra kids.

796
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:06,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I sure did bring kids in, and it was nice.

797
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:13,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep in mind as we're doing this work, there are 15,000 kids statewide who don't get into any CTE spot.

798
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:18,070
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's fun to think about if we were in a spot where we could bring in 10 students a year,

799
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:25,429
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't get into the Northeast.

800
01:14:26,189 --> 01:14:27,830
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I think that's something to think about.

801
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,551
[SPEAKER_13]: But to your question, Larry, yeah, it's all covered by the state.

802
01:14:30,571 --> 01:14:31,451
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all calculated.

803
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:33,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not really sure how, but... Okay.

804
01:14:36,554 --> 01:14:37,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick question.

805
01:14:38,014 --> 01:14:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

806
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:45,398
[SPEAKER_04]: This past weekend, I was talking to Mr. Christie about robots, and he indicated that there was a pretty substantial

807
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll have to feed all of that back into this before it's done.

808
01:15:04,803 --> 01:15:14,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul, the other thing about having space for kids to other communities, and I believe this happened with Everett, I don't know if this is for your time, but we have Everett students coming.

809
01:15:28,447 --> 01:15:32,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And Everett is like, wow, we're sending, I don't know, 10 kids over to Medford.

810
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should have our own program.

811
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:37,792
[SPEAKER_05]: They start their own program, and then suddenly we don't have those 10 kids all at once.

812
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this year, we no longer have them.

813
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:52,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a risk-free thing to build capacity for surrounding communities, especially if they have any capability to actually do it themselves.

814
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:57,663
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't have a vocational school at all, obviously the risks are very different.

815
01:15:57,763 --> 01:16:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But when they have something, or it's a program where the upfront costs are not exorbitant, just need a teacher, those I think of as more risky because they just, they would want to keep their money too.

816
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:21,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's no easy path, but like, I don't know if plumbing is one of the ones where there's easy places.

817
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:26,979
[SPEAKER_05]: There are opportunities, but they're not all risk-free.

818
01:16:57,186 --> 01:17:03,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's also this cyber security, which I'm sure you're thinking about this, too.

819
01:17:03,809 --> 01:17:08,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So one part of the IT systems, I think, might be bad for cyber.

820
01:17:08,931 --> 01:17:13,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already on the closing trajectory.

821
01:17:13,172 --> 01:17:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: But is the internet a thing to surround us?

822
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:19,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be some ways to respond to these questions.

823
01:17:20,175 --> 01:17:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just say, I think the reply to Catherine Klosko,

824
01:17:27,688 --> 01:17:28,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you can do that.

825
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:40,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions, thoughts, things you're wondering about in terms of our vocational programs?

826
01:17:41,006 --> 01:17:43,430
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that was sort of interesting is like this does

827
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:57,035
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a completely separate track that we would have to pursue with DESE to be approved to have these programs, which is sort of separate and apart from having the space to have the program, which is what MSBA is here to do.

828
01:17:57,115 --> 01:18:04,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of a different work stream that would have to sort of move alongside of us, but more on the administration side.

829
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:11,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other thing that if you look at section C, if you're adding new programs,

830
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:17,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It does ask a series of questions to make sure that what you're adding

831
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:23,552
[SPEAKER_06]: is in alignment with what your area requires.

832
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:37,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you were like, well, I have an agricultural program, and you look around the immediate area, and there's no call for that in the field, then MSBA and DEFI, because DEFI will review and approve this as well, will say, no.

833
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:41,046
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do that, but we're not going to pay for it, right?

834
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Chad did look at the regional blueprints in terms of like getting to this, cultivating this list of programs that we're going to potentially seek to expand because these are the ones that are supported by our regional blueprint.

835
01:18:54,978 --> 01:19:00,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's sort of a straighter line there in terms of what we might be able to offer.

836
01:19:04,326 --> 01:19:08,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions, thoughts, comments about this form.

837
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:11,868
[SPEAKER_06]: the easier of the two.

838
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:15,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought we'd start here.

839
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:22,772
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of you have questions or thoughts as you're reading this, as you're thinking about it, can they send them to you, Chad?

840
01:19:22,913 --> 01:19:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

841
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:28,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So Chad will take your individual questions and comments.

842
01:19:28,254 --> 01:19:37,138
[SPEAKER_06]: On Monday at the school committee, Chad will be presenting about this, about the potential expansion of the particular programs.

843
01:19:38,098 --> 01:19:41,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And you all are welcome at the school committee meeting all the time.

844
01:19:41,682 --> 01:19:43,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it would be another lively meeting.

845
01:19:44,425 --> 01:19:48,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to schedule the agenda such that Chad doesn't have to be there all night.

846
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll look at that.

847
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:55,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, my ideally, the presentation will go well, and the school committee will.

848
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: take a vote to approve support of Chad's plan that he's going to outline for us and then we can include that in this before you all see it again when we finalize.

849
01:20:06,528 --> 01:20:06,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter?

850
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:10,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a specific MSBA language for how a vote should be?

851
01:20:10,832 --> 01:20:17,638
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it just says that they need to provide a copy of the meeting minutes which include the language and outcome of the vote.

852
01:20:22,555 --> 01:20:27,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does say to be studied as part of the feasibility study for the proposed project.

853
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:32,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll craft a motion that wraps all those buzzwords in.

854
01:20:35,559 --> 01:20:37,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions about this document?

855
01:20:37,839 --> 01:20:41,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

856
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel free to reach out to Chad if you have any other thoughts.

857
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:54,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Allen at medford.k12.ma.us.

858
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:58,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you all have your email addresses, you'll be able to find him in the directory.

859
01:20:58,039 --> 01:21:02,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next meetings.

860
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:10,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next full committee meeting is on June 4th here so we will plan a tour of Medford High.

861
01:21:12,255 --> 01:21:25,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We will hopefully approve our chapter 74 form for submission and we'll do a first review of the educational profile and I will do my level best to make sure you have that a couple of days ahead of time so you don't have to speed read on the fly.

862
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:30,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of that to come for June 4th and then

863
01:21:31,645 --> 01:21:35,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Our subcommittee, we have another communications and community engagement subcommittee.

864
01:21:35,226 --> 01:21:43,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we have the support of this group, we'll get working on some of the surveying and that kind of thing so that can get ready.

865
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:49,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Then also before our next full committee meeting is a finance subcommittee meeting.

866
01:21:49,968 --> 01:21:57,790
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who weren't here the last time, if you are interested in being part of any of the subcommittees, you can just let me know and we'll add you to the list provided that there's not

867
01:21:58,583 --> 01:21:59,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Too many people on the list.

868
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:04,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks are welcome to join any of those subcommittees.

869
01:22:04,068 --> 01:22:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so far we have rules and onboarding, communications and community engagement and then finance.

870
01:22:11,775 --> 01:22:13,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?

871
01:22:14,918 --> 01:22:18,001
