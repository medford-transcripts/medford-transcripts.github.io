1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,713
That's been going on, I think, since the snowstorm.

2
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:04,814
I was getting reports that there was no heat.

3
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:11,358
So I think it's pretty pertinent for at least a discussion, even if it's next week, we have a discussion on that.

4
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:18,682
And I don't know if it's worth putting this off a week and seeing if we can get a response from the mayor's office on that resolution.

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:24,226
But it was a strong 6-1 vote, and a number of people were in this audience in support

6
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:36,374
looking into a cost analysis and getting some numbers together, better than what we were provided, so we can really see if we can't afford the dual station and get a better idea.

7
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:46,501
I know a number of things were thrown around and certain contradictions were made a few weeks back, so I think some more clarity is in order.

8
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:51,244
I don't know how my colleagues feel.

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,011
Councilor Knight, second the motion for approval.

10
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,813
On the motion, seconded by Councilor Knight.

11
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:05,618
Name and address of the record, please.

12
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:08,200
My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Metford, Mass.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,661
I'm a former member of the Saugus party.

14
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:14,664
I can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkern is going to because apparently

15
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:21,023
I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening, and here we are.

16
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:26,465
We have nobody here from the fire department or the police department.

17
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:31,587
But if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the

18
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:45,155
The Mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raise itself well over $2.5 million as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it.

19
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:52,222
A lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March, the day of the storm.

20
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:57,555
The unfortunate circumstance, the fire department and the police department, their generator went out.

21
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:01,616
Their backup generator to be supportive of their police operations.

22
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:04,758
Their telecommunications, their communications back and forth.

23
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,419
From what I understand and I believe it to be true,

24
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:14,309
one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity.

25
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:23,796
Their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, was out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm.

26
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:27,187
You really have a whole host of issues here.

27
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:31,970
You talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that.

28
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:37,474
None of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was submitted in January of 2013.

29
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:55,438
You're going to be having here a little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars, and you really need to ask the same question.

30
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,861
You're going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there too.

31
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:02,242
I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer.

32
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:05,204
Just like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city.

33
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:07,626
The building was built in 1962.

34
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:20,411
Same thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category, and they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be.

35
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:26,136
But the question really needs to be asked, it's obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings.

36
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:37,001
You, Councilor Caviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which were 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures.

37
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:42,023
And now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later.

38
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:50,206
And you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was.

39
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,607
You built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained.

40
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:56,069
And you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself

41
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,455
as it relates to the high school later on this evening.

42
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,757
But this is too important of an issue.

43
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:03,839
You're talking about at the outset, $22 million.

44
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:13,465
$2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from, because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station.

45
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:24,273
And as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this.

46
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:31,500
So I think in all fairness, as Councilor Longo-Kearns has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight.

47
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,624
You've waited a long period of time.

48
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:39,809
You haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department.

49
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,812
And if we remember correctly, I think it was

50
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:51,452
When the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go.

51
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:56,536
To this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved.

52
00:04:57,316 --> 00:05:01,099
And you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing.

53
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,200
And it just doesn't make sense.

54
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,461
It's not good political sense.

55
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,303
It's absolutely not good financial sense.

56
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:10,920
You know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system.

57
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,844
You have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million.

58
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:20,245
And if that comes through, the city of Memphis pays 40% of that.

59
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:29,070
And you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

60
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,781
20, $25 million there of taxpayers' money.

61
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,242
You're looking at a fire station and a police station.

62
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:38,144
Can you please tell me who's going to pay for this?

63
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:42,406
This is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override.

64
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:44,968
And if you look at your sister city of Somerville,

65
00:05:45,508 --> 00:06:01,296
With all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community.

66
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,917
You really need to look at the long-term approach.

67
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,832
And the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think is gonna make a big thing.

68
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:16,335
And you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor.

69
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:22,738
Well, where is her olive branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this?

70
00:06:23,318 --> 00:06:23,958
It's not there.

71
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,119
It's not fair.

72
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,120
And what you're doing is the bottom line.

73
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,142
And what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument

74
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,420
to have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community.

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:45,203
Because people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included.

76
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,505
And the council, likewise, not including them in the process.

77
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:51,005
You're not talking about $100,000.

78
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:55,527
You're talking about $22,000,000 right now.

79
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,488
$2,000,000 for the study, $20,000,000 allegedly for the station.

80
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,349
None of you can explain how it's gonna be paid.

81
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,051
None of you can explain how she got to the $2,000,000 seismographic study.

82
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:08,213
You don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be.

83
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:11,214
I think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this.

84
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:12,775
That sends the wrong message.

85
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,456
And it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer.

86
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,497
People are police department friendly.

87
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:18,954
Thank you.

88
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:19,654
Thank you.

89
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,696
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, Councilor Langel-Kern.

90
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:38,760
I would, with due respect, with regards to the resolve that was approved several weeks back, that we sit down and discuss this in more depth and ask the questions.

91
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,702
I mean, like I said before, the headquarters building went down last week.

92
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,222
The backup generator went down.

93
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:48,435
there are a whole host of issues within that whole building.

94
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:54,659
And when we're talking, I mean, the last speaker just hit the nail on the head.

95
00:07:54,679 --> 00:08:08,869
We're talking about potential library, promised new fire station somewhere between 2022 and 2025, Medford High School potential updates, and maintenance of the rest of our schools and city buildings.

96
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,753
I think we need to be on the same page and not just, I mean, I feel like

97
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:17,475
This was so reactive, we need to be on the same page.

98
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:25,383
And I would ask that we table this for one week to sit down with the mayor before we vote on it or potentially vote on it next Tuesday so we can hash some things out.

99
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:36,273
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kern to table this for one week so we can have some discussion with the mayor.

100
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:38,976
Vice President Marks.

101
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:42,429
Thank you, Mr. President.

102
00:08:43,149 --> 00:09:05,786
I remember the vote that, uh, counsel Longo Kern is speaking about, and it was a six to one vote, uh, requesting that we, uh, meet with the administration in particular, the mayor and discuss, uh, not only, uh, the building of the police department, uh, also the feasibility and capital improvement plan of where we're going for future, uh, projects.

103
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,148
And as we'll hear tonight, we have the superintendent of schools here.

104
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:14,380
And we're going to hear about a need for improvements within the Meffitt Public Schools.

105
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,462
As was mentioned by Councilor Longo, we already know the public library is in need of some repairs or total rehab.

106
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:29,923
And there are a number of other issues, Mr. President, that I'm sure will be addressed when the superintendent gets up.

107
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,103
But we should have a master plan, Mr. President.

108
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,384
And I know Councilor Falco has spoken about a master plan in the past.

109
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,841
and I've raised the issue, to give at least a direction on where we're gonna go.

110
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:49,183
And we can't continue to operate and do business with the mayor's draft proposal of a capital plan.

111
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:54,224
It's not even a capital plan, it's a draft proposal that the mayor's still working from.

112
00:09:54,864 --> 00:10:04,627
And many of the issues in the draft proposal are not present in the letter that she wrote on March 17th to this council stating what the public schools needs.

113
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,117
needs are.

114
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:11,519
So I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, where all this dialogue and debate is happening.

115
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:19,662
It's probably happening in a vacuum in the mayor's office, but it's clearly not with the elected officials of this community and with the general public in this community.

116
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:29,645
And I would agree, I think one week is not too long to wait to get some feedback on where we're going with the capital plan, Mr. President.

117
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:34,127
And as the council president, I think you should be wary of

118
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,582
the fact that we're receiving things piecemeal again, and we've stated in the past that we refuse to do business like that.

119
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:48,884
I wouldn't operate my business, or I don't run my home that way, and we shouldn't operate a city government that way either, Mr. President.

120
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:53,025
So I support Councilor Lungo's motion to table for one week.

121
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:55,465
Councilor Lungo, go ahead.

122
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,886
Just briefly, thank you, President Carviello.

123
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:02,347
I think one simple thing that needs to be done, even if we can't discuss

124
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,345
you know, everything within a week.

125
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:12,048
I think one thing that needs to be done is that capital plan that we were given about nine, six, six, nine months ago, it's completely changed.

126
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:18,029
Um, something that was supposed to be done seven years from now is now being asked for the third reading tonight.

127
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,450
So that needs to be revamped.

128
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:28,472
I mean, redrafted basically because the largest thing within that five year plan was the Medford police station or, you know, an update in that of that building.

129
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:30,773
And that is completely changed the whole,

130
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,884
draft capital plan.

131
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:40,328
And I think that's just one simple thing that could be looked into and given to us within a week's time so that we have a better idea.

132
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:45,031
Even if it is just a draft, it's a better idea of where we're going, how we're moving forward.

133
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:52,975
And I think it's something that's necessary and we're not going to get it unless if we keep rubber stamping everything that's put before us.

134
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:54,736
Thank you.

135
00:11:56,997 --> 00:12:00,039
On the motion by Councillor Longo-Kern to table this for one week.

136
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,490
Roll call has been said, seconded by Councilor Marks.

137
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:05,831
Table and meet with the administration.

138
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,232
Table and meet with the administration.

139
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:09,854
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

140
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:14,576
Councilor DelaRusso?

141
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:15,176
Negative.

142
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:16,877
Councilor Felco?

143
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,257
No.

144
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:18,618
Councilor Knight?

145
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:19,318
No.

146
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,959
Councilor Locker?

147
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:21,179
Yes.

148
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,920
Vice President Marks?

149
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,360
Yes.

150
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:24,581
Councilor Scarpelli?

151
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:25,081
No.

152
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:26,642
President Calvillo?

153
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:27,062
No.

154
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:30,284
Two in the affirmative, five in the negative,

155
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:31,908
Motion fails.

156
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:40,093
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, that the bond package take its third reading.

157
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,235
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

158
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:44,236
Councilor Dela Russo?

159
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:44,617
Yes.

160
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:46,158
Councilor Falco?

161
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:46,438
Yes.

162
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:47,719
Councilor Knight?

163
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,099
Yes.

164
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:49,620
Councilor Alan Kern?

165
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:51,481
Yes.

166
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:53,563
Vice President Mox?

167
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:53,883
Yes.

168
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:55,384
Councilor Scott Kelly?

169
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:55,864
Yes.

170
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:57,365
President Calvillo?

171
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:58,006
Yes.

172
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:01,323
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

173
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,164
Motion passes.

174
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:05,945
Councilor Falco.

175
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:17,871
Can we take 17-312 out of order?

176
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:18,191
17-312.

177
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:25,094
To the Honorable Presidents and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Method Mast.

178
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,715
Dear Mr. President and City Councils,

179
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:39,180
On behalf of the school committee, I respectfully request to recommend that the city council approve and authorize the submission to the Massachusetts school building authority, a statement of interest.

180
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,561
The city of method school committee has previously approved the same.

181
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,462
The documentation will be provided by superintendent Royal Bay.

182
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:52,743
Royalson will be in attendance to explain this matter in further depth and detail.

183
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,899
Good evening, Mr. Superintendent.

184
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,040
Name and address for the record, please.

185
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,742
Roy Bellison, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.

186
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,223
Mr. President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening.

187
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:20,508
The Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program,

188
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:31,519
that is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward?

189
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:36,240
This particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way.

190
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,222
What it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA

191
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:55,113
to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible and to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward.

192
00:14:56,134 --> 00:15:13,102
Now, if, in fact, they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design and then later construction documents, which would then

193
00:15:13,768 --> 00:15:15,390
lead to an actual implementation.

194
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:32,069
But at this point, all we're asking you for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team, to review what we have at our schools, and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure.

195
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:34,457
I think it's a very proactive thing.

196
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:40,939
I think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time.

197
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:54,103
And I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state.

198
00:15:54,723 --> 00:16:01,665
I think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up.

199
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:12,422
and the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease.

200
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:18,147
This is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity.

201
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:27,194
It wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA.

202
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,737
So with that, I just ask that the city council

203
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:45,833
approve what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we could have the state share the cost of.

204
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,535
Happy to take any questions.

205
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,836
Thank you, Mr. Superintendents.

206
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,457
Counselor Lungo-Kern.

207
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:54,179
Thank you, President Caviel.

208
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,702
Thank you, Mr. Billson for, Superintendent Billson, for coming before us with this paper.

209
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:00,743
If you could

210
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:16,608
maybe with your experience, go over what type of projects would be funded through these types of 55% reimbursement grants, just so we can kind of have an idea of, I guess, the history of the grants.

211
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,149
And that would be my first question.

212
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,473
So there are two programs at MSBA that take place.

213
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,174
One is called Accelerated Repair.

214
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:27,556
That's not the program we're applying under.

215
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,057
This is the core program.

216
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,851
for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction.

217
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,831
There are priorities.

218
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:39,512
There are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider.

219
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:44,933
We have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you.

220
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:55,115
Now, all the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible

221
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,361
and see what their interest level is.

222
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:05,024
So for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers at Medford High School.

223
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:08,686
But we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems.

224
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:15,449
An important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system at Medford High School.

225
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,509
It goes back to 1970.

226
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,670
So it's clear that, you know,

227
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,635
this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system.

228
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:25,699
We know that the roof was replaced in 2001.

229
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,283
We know that at some point in time the roof is going to need

230
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:37,068
a replacement, we think it's five, six years out, but if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that.

231
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:54,001
We know that there are, the vocational school is moving into very high tech areas, and anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state of the art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage.

232
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,143
So anything that moves the show forward

233
00:18:57,489 --> 00:19:03,252
enables us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore.

234
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,593
Another example would be the floor tiles.

235
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,394
The floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them.

236
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,795
Now, they're not dangerous because they're not friable.

237
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,617
But you can't pick them up without an abatement.

238
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:17,518
And an abatement costs a lot of money.

239
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:26,962
So if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it.

240
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,862
So those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have.

241
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:38,429
We certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need.

242
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:43,413
But there are some things that might actually fly through, and we'd like to find out what they are.

243
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:54,802
And that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again, but it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding

244
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:56,999
which would be necessary to do.

245
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,899
Technology is another major area.

246
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:14,886
With testing now being done on computers, with reporting all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area.

247
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,467
That's an area that might be of interest to the state.

248
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:19,188
We certainly would move forward with that.

249
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:24,810
We've also applied or will apply under the E-Rate Program, the Universal Libraries Program,

250
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:29,036
And we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this.

251
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,417
So these are things that, you know, we're looking at.

252
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,618
We want to advance our possibilities.

253
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:39,761
We want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding.

254
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:48,724
And the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford.

255
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:51,325
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

256
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:52,566
No, that kind of answered, like,

257
00:20:53,596 --> 00:21:04,521
what was gonna be my second question, kind of as what is Medford looking for for our high school versus what in the past these grants have been used for in other cities and towns.

258
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:17,528
So with that being said, did the school committee or did you bring anything for us tonight with regards to a list, something in writing that says what the city of Medford's needs are for the high school?

259
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,469
Well, the SOI includes everything.

260
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:24,506
The SOI just simply talks about everything possible.

261
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:33,089
We would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding.

262
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:41,092
The school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases.

263
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:42,946
The fire alarm system.

264
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:43,927
These are things, the roof.

265
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:49,693
These are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years.

266
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,015
And we have a very solid building.

267
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:55,178
It's not a building that needs to be replaced.

268
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,102
You can't buy a CMU building anymore.

269
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:01,764
with the kind of money out there.

270
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,326
Somerville is, what, $250 million to replace a building?

271
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,968
Minuteman is $155 million.

272
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:10,309
Waltham's looking at a couple hundred million.

273
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,411
We're not going to spend that kind of money.

274
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:24,399
We have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life.

275
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,695
So that's sort of what we're looking at.

276
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:30,896
I think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund.

277
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:36,657
And I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.

278
00:22:36,677 --> 00:22:39,418
Thank you.

279
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,679
So you have the list to provide to us?

280
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,359
It's on here.

281
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:48,420
If you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.

282
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:57,898
Where is that list?

283
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:02,881
I have like a list that says number one and then on the second page it says number six, number seven.

284
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,042
That it references.

285
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:13,287
So each under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.

286
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,609
Is that on the last page, number six, number seven?

287
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:21,011
I just, those are one, uh, the last two pages.

288
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:23,952
Point of information.

289
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:24,433
Point of information.

290
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:25,153
Counselor DelaRusso.

291
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:30,879
Is that on the document dated March 17th, 2017?

292
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,060
March 16th, yeah.

293
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,080
My address is March 17th, mine is March 16th.

294
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:36,381
Thank you, Counselor LaRosa.

295
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:52,605
So just so I understand it better, would the SOI come in and bring in their own experts so they would know how out of date our systems are or when they're going to eventually need updating?

296
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:53,927
Exactly.

297
00:23:54,108 --> 00:24:01,433
So the heating experts, so they would be telling us the first priority is the roof, then the heating, then the boilers have another 10 years.

298
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,277
So they'd give you a list and say, you are eligible for these funds and not, you know, not these.

299
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:06,937
Exactly.

300
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,500
They would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you.

301
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,701
These are the things you're going to do yourself.

302
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,583
Point of information if I can.

303
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:17,825
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelli.

304
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:22,689
From what you just said, Mr. Superintendent, for what Councilwoman

305
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:33,004
Longo just mentioned, the confusion that I want to make clear is, you're telling us they'll tell us what we can do.

306
00:24:33,885 --> 00:24:41,791
But let's say something is needed today.

307
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:45,934
And we're saying, let's say the HVAC needs to be done today.

308
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:49,096
But they had that on their list as three to be funded.

309
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:57,910
Are we gonna fund their request instead of what we think is, like the HVAC, that's probably the, Mike.

310
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,451
So that's a discussion, counselor, that we would have.

311
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,872
First we wanna know who's gonna join with us on what projects.

312
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:13,454
And then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority.

313
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,535
Because otherwise, you know, we have a plan that

314
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:25,147
might avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them.

315
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:35,018
But we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth.

316
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:38,581
Now, it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term.

317
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,076
But we can keep it on the boards.

318
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:44,859
But once they determine it's eligible, we can go back in and apply for it.

319
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:58,209
So the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.

320
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,875
And one of my last questions, with regards to the amount of these grants that are given,

321
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:13,597
if you know from other cities and towns that have got them in the past, or if Medford has gotten any, what are we talking?

322
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:18,300
Are we talking you'll maybe get a grant for one or two things?

323
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,481
Is there a cap amount-wise?

324
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:24,383
Or are we talking potentially $20, $30 million?

325
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:28,205
It really depends on what they determine eligibility.

326
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:33,621
Somerville, when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million.

327
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:38,725
Now, I don't think we're in that category.

328
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:40,526
We're looking at something much smaller than that.

329
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:47,311
But clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work.

330
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:53,115
And then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward.

331
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:54,757
But at least we know.

332
00:26:55,832 --> 00:27:05,676
what our partners are willing to put up on the table, so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.

333
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:22,143
And my last question, I guess, would be with regards to, I guess, the whole system, Medford High School and all of our other elementary and grade schools, with regards to every school needing maintenance, having maintenance issues, I've heard from a few

334
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:28,214
parents over the last month or so and beyond with regards to issues within each school?

335
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:38,881
Have the grade schools and the elementary schools also been looked at with regards to their needs and how we are going to assess it all, this and the grade schools?

336
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,783
So the school committee had several meetings on this topic.

337
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:48,347
And it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up.

338
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:53,194
The major issues will be going forward at the high school.

339
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:57,258
High school is now the oldest major building in our possession.

340
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:18,615
One of the things I told the school committee so I feel comfortable sharing it here is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state funded planning.

341
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:23,255
We also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money.

342
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:28,600
For example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently.

343
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,165
We got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday.

344
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:38,928
And we've got some other grants out there they're looking for.

345
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:45,573
There's about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposal for.

346
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,215
It's an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements.

347
00:28:48,698 --> 00:29:03,745
So we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.

348
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:05,686
That's it for now.

349
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:06,006
Thank you.

350
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:06,886
Thank you.

351
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,147
Councilor Falco.

352
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,808
Thank you, Mr. President.

353
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:13,769
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent Felsen.

354
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,370
Thanks for the report.

355
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,691
I agree with you.

356
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,791
The building is 50 years old.

357
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:20,432
It was going to be 50 years old.

358
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:23,093
It definitely needs improvements.

359
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:32,038
I talk to parents on a daily basis, and a lot of parents that don't have kids at the high school yet, but they've been up to the high school.

360
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,339
And the building does need work.

361
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:43,764
When I was on the school committee with Counselor Scott Pelley, we had the science lab renovation, 17 new science labs, which was

362
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:54,098
a great project for the community, for the school system, and really, you know, the state-of-the-art school labs and science labs.

363
00:29:54,558 --> 00:30:00,459
And these are important, especially for programming, future programming for the vocational school.

364
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,680
And, you know, we want to make sure that we have these programs in place.

365
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,241
We want to make sure our buildings are up to date.

366
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:12,181
I mean, there's one thing that I learned when I was on the school committee, is people have an option.

367
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,502
People have a choice.

368
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,262
Years ago, you went to Medford High School,

369
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,146
Maybe you went to parochial school.

370
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,668
Now you can go to public school, public charter school.

371
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:21,709
You can go to private school, parochial school.

372
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,611
I mean, there's all kinds of options for people now.

373
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:40,203
So, you know, I think a lot of people would like to go to school right here in Medford, but they want to make sure that their facilities are first class in nature and make sure that the programming or the programming programs that are being offered, for example, at the vocational school, are first rate.

374
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:42,144
And I think we're heading in that direction.

375
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:46,291
But I think we do need a cash infusion to make sure that a lot of this happens.

376
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:54,076
And it's nice to see that, you know, to potentially get 55% reimbursement from the state, that doesn't come along every day.

377
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,778
And we took advantage of that opportunity.

378
00:30:57,158 --> 00:31:06,624
When the science labs came across, I think we got 55, maybe even a little bit more, 55, between 55 and 60%, I think, reimbursement on those.

379
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:08,785
So I think this is a great opportunity.

380
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,728
And I think that it's something that we should take advantage of.

381
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:17,786
One of the questions that I had with regard to, you mentioned HVAC.

382
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:22,910
So would the HVAC include the actual individual heating systems in each of the classrooms at the high school?

383
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:33,377
Okay, that's perfect because I know one of the complaints that I got when I was on the school committee was, you know, it'd be hot and cold in some of the buildings and sometimes there'd be no heat at all.

384
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:37,420
So I think that would be a definite good addition.

385
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:41,763
I also wanted to talk about the,

386
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:56,071
Let's see, you mentioned here in this memo, it says, number seven, replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements.

387
00:31:56,231 --> 00:32:08,994
MPS is seeking additional space on the high school campus by adding a cafeteria that can accommodate up to at least 500 students, a performing arts center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests, adequate locker room facilities for male and female athletes,

388
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:17,051
a fitness and wellness center, an expansion of vocational technical space to create a career pathway model.

389
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:19,071
Can you comment on that a little bit?

390
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:24,952
Is that talking about possibly a new structure, or is that building off the structures that we currently have?

391
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:26,533
So let me give you a couple of examples.

392
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:40,415
Anyone who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them at some point if you're interested, but the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that.

393
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:43,519
But let's take the locker rooms at the high school.

394
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,481
You've been up to the locker rooms at the high school.

395
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:49,784
You know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be.

396
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:52,826
The girls' locker room, it is what it is.

397
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,908
There's a lot of old things in there.

398
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:57,490
There's a lot of old marble, old shower stalls.

399
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,772
It's a lot of empty space, unutilized space.

400
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:10,300
That needs to be redone, because if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women

401
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:11,407
to use it.

402
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:14,689
The same thing is true with the men's locker room.

403
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:16,409
We need to do that.

404
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,030
It's just these are the things that are there.

405
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:33,557
When you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now.

406
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:39,179
So that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know,

407
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:43,429
Let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that.

408
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,050
I think those are the kinds of cafeteria.

409
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,911
Right now there's three cafeterias.

410
00:33:49,291 --> 00:34:04,256
It may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, or maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money.

411
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:08,049
And that's critical, because that's going to be up on the first floor.

412
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,690
That's going to be a restaurant for the public.

413
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,113
That's going to tie into our partnerships with Wynn.

414
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:18,280
which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities.

415
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:25,325
That's going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue-generating activities that will support other programs.

416
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:30,188
And that will free up space where Cafe Elektor is now, and we can do some other things with that.

417
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:36,693
So this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage.

418
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:41,376
Now, the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place.

419
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:46,499
We don't have to give them the big cavern that they have, because they don't use that anymore.

420
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,639
That's not what printing is about anymore.

421
00:34:49,360 --> 00:35:07,506
So Dr. Ritchiell, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies, putting programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other.

422
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:11,688
So that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area.

423
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:15,282
That creates great opportunities for our young people.

424
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,824
Instead of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas.

425
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:22,126
You may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman.

426
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,068
By next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman.

427
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:31,371
We'll have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together.

428
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:36,154
By bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue.

429
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:41,501
possibly projecting over two or three years, a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it.

430
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:49,746
This is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have.

431
00:35:50,386 --> 00:35:52,947
So these are ways that I think we're moving forward.

432
00:35:53,307 --> 00:36:03,232
And I believe that looking at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now.

433
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:05,994
Plan, recognizing we've got to come back to you.

434
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:08,115
You're not voting for money tonight.

435
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,496
You're voting for planning tonight.

436
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,597
You're voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible.

437
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,618
And that's what we were asking you to do.

438
00:36:14,658 --> 00:36:15,958
And I think it's a great opportunity.

439
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:16,639
Thank you.

440
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,359
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

441
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,341
I agree with you with regard to the vocational school.

442
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,322
I mean, my opinion, I think it's the hidden jewel of the district.

443
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:29,023
I mean, there are so many great opportunities that are happening at the vocational school.

444
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:29,924
You know, Ms.

445
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:32,205
Riccio and her staff are doing a great job.

446
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:38,403
I mean, there's so much demand now to go to the vocational school, and it's kind of the best of both worlds.

447
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,485
You learn a trade, and you can still go to college if you want.

448
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,928
So you really, you have the best of both worlds.

449
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:46,109
It's an exciting time.

450
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:48,911
There are more and more young kids going to the vocational school.

451
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:55,476
So I think it's a great time to reinvest, not only in the high school, but in the shops of the vocational school.

452
00:36:55,856 --> 00:37:00,300
I mean, when you think about it, at the end of the day, our buildings are our most important assets with regard to

453
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,042
the future of Method students.

454
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:10,847
We need to make sure that they are first class and make sure that all of our technology is current as can be.

455
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:16,490
You had mentioned previously about the potential for feasibility studies.

456
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:27,316
So if we have to do a feasibility study, is that something that we would have to pay for or is that something that would be, would the MSBA help out with the cost of something like that?

457
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:28,677
If we become eligible,

458
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:41,782
We would then petition MSBA for a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for or with.

459
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:47,465
And they would reimburse us at the same rate they would reimburse the construction.

460
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:54,629
So if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back.

461
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,810
We lay it out, but they reimburse us.

462
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,341
I'm all set, thank you.

463
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:01,462
Thank you, Councilman.

464
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:02,142
Councilor Knight.

465
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:04,062
Mr. President, thank you very much.

466
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,163
Mr. Belson, thank you for being here this evening.

467
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:09,024
I think you do a great job, and I appreciate you coming down here this evening.

468
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:17,246
So I think it's safe to say that you feel as though going forward with this statement of interest is the most prudent course at this point in time?

469
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:23,468
It gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important.

470
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:25,268
Earlier this evening, I heard you talking.

471
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:26,328
You want to consider options?

472
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:27,789
Well, you want to know who's going to pay for what.

473
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:34,878
And if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.

474
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:39,001
And this matter did come before the school committee, and it was endorsed by the school committee?

475
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:39,341
Yes.

476
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,023
I have the copies of the votes if you need it.

477
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:42,664
Do you recall what the vote was I just offered?

478
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:42,964
Pardon me?

479
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:43,885
Do you recall what the vote was?

480
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,026
7-0.

481
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:45,306
7-0.

482
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:47,267
So it's endorsed by the superintendent of schools.

483
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,428
It's endorsed by the school committee.

484
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:54,793
And the purpose of the paper before us this evening, as I understand it, is that you're really seeking permission to meet with the state

485
00:38:55,233 --> 00:39:03,536
to examine what competitive grant opportunities the Massachusetts School Building Authority has out there for us that the Medford Public School District may be eligible for?

486
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:04,296
That's correct.

487
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:15,640
And by submitting this application in the statement of interest, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees that we're going to receive money, and the city of Medford in no way guarantees that we're going to expend money?

488
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:16,241
Right.

489
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,622
Thank you very much, Mr. Belson.

490
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:19,742
Move for approval, Mr. President.

491
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:21,983
Vice President Mox.

492
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,224
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Superintendent Belson for being here tonight.

493
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:43,397
As the superintendent stated, Mr. President, this council over the last several years has approved many building programs within the Meffitt High School and the Meffitt Public Schools.

494
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:46,920
And I think we've been very supportive as a council.

495
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:53,219
My question tonight, Mr. President, is not regarding whether or not the high school needs improvements.

496
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:01,308
I have two students that attend Meffitt High School, and I can speak firsthand that Meffitt High School, indeed, needs improvements.

497
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,393
But my question to the superintendent is,

498
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:23,569
My first question, back in September of 2016, the school committee, along with Mayor Burke, formulated a priority facility improvement list, of which they outlined $13,787,000 worth of repairs in the high school and our other school buildings, of which $10,100,000 was earmarked to Meffitt High School.

499
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,349
Of that $10,100,000, Mr. Superintendent,

500
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:40,263
What percentage of that $10,100,000 is in the current SOI?

501
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:47,389
So I can't tell you that, because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI.

502
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:52,934
So it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible.

503
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:58,519
I would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them.

504
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,541
There may be some things that they would say, that's your problem.

505
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:28,384
Okay, so, and the reason why I ask, Mr. Superintendent, is, and I'll get into this a little bit later on, but we were recently told three weeks ago that in order to build a combined police and fire center, that, and we were told this by our treasurer-collector and also by the mayor, that the amount of money we were looking to bond would cause the city to have to go into a Proposition 2 1⁄2 override.

506
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:31,686
And that was one of the factors the administration stated

507
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:34,191
why we couldn't bond for $38 million.

508
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:47,815
So the reason why I'm trying to get some facts and figures tonight is I want to make sure that we're not going down the same avenue that the mayor and the treasurer-collector were so adamantly opposed to three weeks ago.

509
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:51,776
And I'm hoping to get those answers from you tonight.

510
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:56,878
So as part of the SOI, from what I can see,

511
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:21,956
The capital plan that was put forth by the mayor and the school committee back in September of 2016 did not include a 500-student cafeteria, did not include a performing arts center for 1,000 students, did not include a fitness center, and did not include, from what I can see, windows and boilers.

512
00:42:23,646 --> 00:42:24,607
Okay, so let me.

513
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:25,708
Now, if I could just finish.

514
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:26,729
Yeah, sure.

515
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:46,865
So based on the $10 million that was out there for other renovations, which included Medford High School flooring, which you mentioned had asbestos, which I would agree needs to be removed, roof replacement for $2 million, fire alarm system, which we know has been on the blink for a number of years, for $1,200,000,

516
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:57,173
and $1 million to deconstruct the skateboard area and install modular units in the back of the high school.

517
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:14,461
So at what expense is the addition of a cafeteria for 500 students, a performing arts center for 1,000, fitness center, windows and boilers gonna add to the 10 million that the school committee came out in September of 2016?

518
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:16,782
Okay, so let me try and answer this way.

519
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:18,083
They're all good questions, thank you.

520
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:25,702
Personally, I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things.

521
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:30,004
Now, I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria.

522
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:31,845
Personally, I don't think that.

523
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:38,229
But I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK?

524
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:44,733
So I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias.

525
00:43:45,353 --> 00:43:48,755
And they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things?

526
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,140
So I don't think that's an issue.

527
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:51,861
Point of information.

528
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:52,341
Yeah.

529
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:56,204
And I appreciate what you're saying, but doesn't that just muddy the waters?

530
00:43:56,224 --> 00:44:02,990
Because when I look at the SOI request, I'll be quite frank, it looks like we're building a brand new building.

531
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:10,796
I mean, if you go through the list from roof to boiler to windows to flooring, I mean, it looks like we're building a brand new building.

532
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:19,002
And I think to add stuff into the SOI that maybe you didn't agree upon as superintendent or thought it wasn't a priority,

533
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:20,556
I think muddies the water.

534
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:35,948
And what we have here, in my opinion, is a project that is probably closer to 30 or $40 million if we were to get total funding or total approval, I should say, from the state.

535
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,050
And I know there's reimbursement.

536
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,372
The number 55% has been tossed around.

537
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:43,334
I talked to the state building assistance program.

538
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:45,496
Don't bet your bottom dollar on 55%.

539
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:47,658
In the past, we've received

540
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:52,852
upwards of 59% for the science labs, but there is nothing set in stone.

541
00:44:53,452 --> 00:45:01,563
I know the mayor put that in her letter, but according to the school building assistance, they have not arrived at any funding percentages as of today.

542
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:03,366
So in a,

543
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:05,878
Good predicament, we could get 50%.

544
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:10,680
But my question, Mr. Superintendent, why throw everything into the mix?

545
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,282
Shouldn't we be looking at our major priorities?

546
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:17,723
We should be looking at the major deficiencies in the school?

547
00:45:17,743 --> 00:45:19,244
Because that's what the SOI calls for.

548
00:45:19,704 --> 00:45:21,465
It calls for the major deficiencies.

549
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:30,208
And you yourself are saying, I don't think our deficiency is adding a 1,000-person performance center or a 500-person cafeteria.

550
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:39,636
But it may be the alarm system, or it may be an issue like Councilor Scott Pelly talked about, other building improvements that need to be done immediately.

551
00:45:40,456 --> 00:45:42,018
So I think that's the question.

552
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:45,061
Why are we throwing everything at the wall right now?

553
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:48,524
Again, as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document.

554
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:51,427
It's to get you into an exploration process.

555
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,483
and to find out what the state is willing to pay for.

556
00:45:54,923 --> 00:46:03,707
So you put down everything to talk about, and you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us.

557
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:05,087
But we'll find out.

558
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:15,531
The document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time.

559
00:46:16,132 --> 00:46:17,212
Different things emerge.

560
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:18,862
People want to talk about them.

561
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:26,365
There are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that we put it down so that we could explore them with the state.

562
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:30,327
Not because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things.

563
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:37,951
We want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding.

564
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,872
And then we'll merge the documents.

565
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:44,154
The key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money.

566
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:48,960
And any amount that we're going to spend, you're gonna prioritize along with the school committee.

567
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,121
It's not gonna be the superintendent who makes the final call.

568
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,642
The superintendent might make a recommendation.

569
00:46:54,222 --> 00:47:01,586
But you're gonna decide, and the mayor's gonna decide, and the school committee's gonna decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time.

570
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:07,088
But knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on.

571
00:47:07,488 --> 00:47:11,710
And as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time.

572
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,031
I know what the relative things are.

573
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:16,420
The state's not going to commit to something before they see it.

574
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:23,844
I know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible because I know what the economics are between the different communities.

575
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:29,808
It doesn't mean that it won't, it won't go down a little bit because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.

576
00:47:31,629 --> 00:47:31,790
Right.

577
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,851
So, so Mr. Superintendent, if I could,

578
00:47:34,972 --> 00:48:00,370
So based on the laundry list that we're submitting in the SOI, and it is a laundry list, wouldn't it make more sense for us to prioritize what our needs are so we don't count on or have to count on some state bureaucrat coming back saying, you know what, Method, we know you need a fire alarm system and a sprinkler system and windows and an HVA system, but we're gonna give you a cafeteria for 500 students.

579
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,331
They're not gonna do that.

580
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:04,192
Mr. Superintendent, we don't know what's going to happen.

581
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:12,496
But why not put together a list of what our priorities are and not just put together a list of, it sounds great.

582
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:16,638
You put everything in there in the kitchen sink and say, hey, look, we're looking to get funding.

583
00:48:16,998 --> 00:48:19,880
It sounds great in theory, but it's not practical.

584
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,301
I don't believe it's practical to put everything in the SOI.

585
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:31,045
And I'd rather see, like Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, a list of what our top priorities are and have them go through our top priorities

586
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:47,529
Mr. Superintendent, and then make a selection from our top priorities, and if a 500 student cafeteria is not on the top of your priority list, as superintendent of the school committee's priority list, then that should be at the bottom of the list.

587
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:52,010
Or not on the list at all, Mr. Superintendent.

588
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:58,972
I hear what you're saying, but my experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before, as you know, we've had science labs,

589
00:48:59,274 --> 00:49:00,594
We've built new buildings and so on.

590
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:09,997
My experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first, and then we'll look at whether these things, any of these other things are possible.

591
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:16,699
But they know the difference between a fire alarm system and a roof and a cafeteria.

592
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:20,700
They know the difference, and they know where we would like to go first.

593
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:28,882
This is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder who is involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together a chance to be heard,

594
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:34,503
rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state.

595
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:36,185
We're giving them a chance to be heard.

596
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:42,073
But you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs.

597
00:49:42,777 --> 00:49:46,019
and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.

598
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:46,199
Right.

599
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:57,785
And if we were so concerned of having every stakeholder seat at the table, why don't we see the middle school and elementary schools as a separate SOI, Mr. Superintendent, which can be done.

600
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:08,571
I'm sure you know that as superintendent, uh, there was no mention about the needs of, as council Longo Kern mentioned, the secondary schools, um, within this and no, it shouldn't be.

601
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:10,052
Cause this is a high school proposal.

602
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:16,135
But there's also proposals that are in need, as you know, in our other schools, in dire need.

603
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:29,726
So my question is then, my second question, Mr. President, is the fact that I realize the order which takes place is you submit the SOI.

604
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:34,049
I didn't realize after you submit the SOI, then you go sit down with the state people.

605
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:35,050
I didn't know that.

606
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,952
You're telling me you now then go sit down with the state people.

607
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:41,227
What do you do, compromise with them?

608
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:51,731
You sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund.

609
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:56,333
I mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well.

610
00:50:56,853 --> 00:51:04,636
So I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things.

611
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:07,437
But we're giving them all these things and they might say,

612
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:09,903
We're doing something with this.

613
00:51:10,163 --> 00:51:13,146
Who knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs?

614
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:16,129
But we put it in front of them, and we got it.

615
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,331
You know, you have to try all these things.

616
00:51:19,351 --> 00:51:21,431
You put it in front of them and say, are you interested in this?

617
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:25,012
Could you consider this to be a reasonable investment?

618
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:29,613
Maybe someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time.

619
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:33,414
So we're moving forward with a planning process.

620
00:51:33,454 --> 00:51:42,057
That's all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community.

621
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:43,397
And this is going to take,

622
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:46,794
probably two to three years to actually actualize.

623
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:53,516
And in the meantime, that will inform our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded.

624
00:51:54,457 --> 00:51:58,418
And we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded.

625
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:01,660
And then grant applications we make.

626
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:10,003
If someone were to say we can't get grants for this, for example, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center, that wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA.

627
00:52:12,017 --> 00:52:13,458
But we got a grant to do it.

628
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:16,220
So we have to know where we have to go.

629
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,324
We have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding.

630
00:52:20,964 --> 00:52:21,985
And then we can then lay it out.

631
00:52:22,445 --> 00:52:27,169
And of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money.

632
00:52:27,742 --> 00:52:30,443
that's going to be needed to move the project forward.

633
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:34,645
This isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want.

634
00:52:35,106 --> 00:52:39,788
This is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down.

635
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:47,051
And it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city.

636
00:52:47,652 --> 00:52:48,712
And we look forward to that.

637
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:54,735
So if I could, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're probably not prepared tonight to put a

638
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:07,754
a dollar amount onto your deficiency request, but you were able to put a dollar amount back in September of 2016 on the laundry list of items that you mentioned needed repair at the high school.

639
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:12,940
Are you prepared tonight to put a dollar amount on your SOI request to the state?

640
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,742
No, because I don't know, you know,

641
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:18,300
the extent to which any of these things would be funded.

642
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,020
But I do know.

643
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,481
Now, I'm not talking about funding.

644
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:23,363
What is the actual cost of your SOI request?

645
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:31,628
You know, I wouldn't want to give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them.

646
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:38,312
And any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe all doors.

647
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,294
I don't think we can do that right now.

648
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,776
When we get back from a planning process,

649
00:53:45,531 --> 00:53:49,113
and we get to a financial phase, then we can do that.

650
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:53,796
That's the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now.

651
00:53:54,337 --> 00:53:58,559
And if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.

652
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:14,069
Okay, so what you're asking then is the council to let you go forward, and then in deliberations, when you submit your SOI with the state, you'll go back and forth with the state, and they'll determine what projects will be done or approved,

653
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:27,492
And if they come back and say, you know what, Method, we like everything in your SOI, there's been a lack of requests for school building assistance this year, and we're gonna fund you for $60 million, Method.

654
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:30,453
Congratulations, and we're even gonna give you half.

655
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,816
We're gonna give you 30 million, so you're gonna have to bond for 30 million.

656
00:54:35,196 --> 00:54:42,660
Are you prepared to come back to this city, Mr. Superintendent, with a $30 million bond request within the next two to three years?

657
00:54:43,595 --> 00:54:54,561
I'd be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools.

658
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:56,062
That's all just like anything else.

659
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:57,022
We come to you with a budget.

660
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:59,223
We come to you with other kinds of financial things.

661
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:02,345
You can tell us how much more you want to put into it.

662
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:07,027
But you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school.

663
00:55:07,247 --> 00:55:07,988
You are going to do it.

664
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:09,749
The question is, who's going to pay for it?

665
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:15,981
But if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now?

666
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:21,464
You know that there are some heating things that we wanna do at the high school that we should do.

667
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,886
If you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it.

668
00:55:25,206 --> 00:55:27,808
So we should find out if we have a partner.

669
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,789
And so on and so forth.

670
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:31,710
We know that technology is moving at a rapid rate.

671
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:37,974
And if we know that it's gonna be expensive to increase all the technology that's gonna be required of public schools,

672
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:43,025
So if someone's willing to partner with us, great.

673
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:43,665
You'll know that.

674
00:55:44,365 --> 00:55:45,385
That gives you those things.

675
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:54,429
But you can decide that I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in.

676
00:55:54,469 --> 00:56:00,391
So even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do.

677
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,792
My job is to give you options.

678
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:05,373
My job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.

679
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:07,434
And who's going to make that decision?

680
00:56:07,899 --> 00:56:12,441
So let's just say, in a perfect scenario, the state comes back and said, Meffitt, we're giving you everything you wanted.

681
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:14,782
Who ultimately is going to make that decision?

682
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:17,123
Are you saying it's this council that's going to sit there?

683
00:56:17,183 --> 00:56:22,085
School committee, mayor, and council are the arbiters of dollars and cents.

684
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:22,465
Right.

685
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:26,607
But we ultimately have the final funding say, Mr. Superintendent.

686
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:34,710
So you think this council is going to sit back after the SOI is put in, and if everything works out perfectly, and they come to us and they pay for half,

687
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,031
And we're getting everything we want.

688
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:48,518
You think the City Council is going to sit here and start slashing different items in the budget to make sure that we don't have a Proposition 2.5 override?

689
00:56:49,088 --> 00:56:50,729
Is that what you expect this council to do?

690
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:53,171
And that's my questioning, Mr. Superintendent.

691
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:57,514
Why are we throwing everything at the wall when we know what deficiencies we have?

692
00:56:57,774 --> 00:57:00,616
We should prioritize them right now and move forward on them.

693
00:57:00,816 --> 00:57:02,117
This program is going nowhere.

694
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:06,139
So to make people believe that, hey, that's, you know, let's get a partner today.

695
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,642
We can get a partner today, tomorrow, next year, the year after.

696
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:14,705
This program has been around for years and we've taken advantage for many, many years, Mr. Superintendent.

697
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:25,500
You know, we got, for a core program, 59.79%, it doesn't give the year, 2008, I'm sorry.

698
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,481
Then the science labs, we got 59%, $6 million reimbursement.

699
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:36,783
Then the accelerated repair, $2,409,000, they gave us a million dollars.

700
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:39,844
So I know we've been great partners with the state.

701
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:43,945
My concern is, eventually, because I've been on this council a number of years,

702
00:57:44,453 --> 00:57:47,475
is that eventually the issue's gonna come back before this council.

703
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:52,198
And we're gonna be the ones that are gonna be sitting there saying, geez, you know what?

704
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:57,020
The state wants to give us all this money, but the city council doesn't want to approve it.

705
00:57:57,421 --> 00:58:00,662
They want to pay half of this and this and this, but they don't want to approve it.

706
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:03,304
And we know what the purse strings are, Mr. Superintendent.

707
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:13,590
When we hear from the mayor three weeks ago saying that she can't afford to do a combined center for police and fire, because according to her and the treasurer-collector,

708
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:20,273
that the school bonds will be coming offline in the year 2022, which is five years.

709
00:58:20,773 --> 00:58:25,795
And she said we can't afford the spending that we want to do for a combined center until 2022.

710
00:58:27,776 --> 00:58:31,778
Now you're telling us that this project, they could be looking for funding maybe two or three years.

711
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:32,658
Is that correct?

712
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:41,862
Well, what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get construction going on something, any project that gets approved.

713
00:58:42,336 --> 00:58:50,300
and the like, but we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in.

714
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:58,244
And in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number.

715
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:03,367
I mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years.

716
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:09,162
The reality is, is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.

717
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:09,862
Correct.

718
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:11,242
And that is the reality.

719
00:59:11,262 --> 00:59:12,523
And that, that's why I'm bringing this up.

720
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:14,263
There is a reality behind this.

721
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:27,208
And when I hear from the administration and the treasurer collector saying that we can't afford any more bonds other than what we just did for the police department until the year 2022, unless we want to look at a prop two and a half override.

722
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:31,463
I think every member of this council and every citizen should be concerned about it.

723
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:35,203
And we should have a handle on what we're potentially looking at.

724
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:41,045
And from what you're telling me now, the process is, you just submit, you really don't know what the dollar amount will be.

725
00:59:41,065 --> 00:59:45,345
You just submit it, you hope for the best, and when it comes back, it comes back.

726
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:48,286
And then at that point, you look at the financials.

727
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:53,987
And what I'm telling you is, the mayor just told us three weeks ago, we're looking at five years down the line.

728
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,203
And that doesn't seem what we're looking for for these schools.

729
00:59:58,703 --> 00:59:59,764
I mean, I read the SOI.

730
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:09,372
It says an SOI should only be filed for a facility where a district has the ability to gain the proper local approvals and a fund to fund a project in the next two years.

731
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:14,476
So they're putting, you know, they want to see commitment.

732
01:00:14,716 --> 01:00:19,140
That's why they're asking for a vote, the school committee, the council, and they want to see a funding commitment.

733
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:22,253
And we're at such an early stage.

734
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,475
I know that.

735
01:00:23,656 --> 01:00:30,230
And quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money, on

736
01:00:30,947 --> 01:00:33,348
policies, on zoning, on any number of issues.

737
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:40,232
You can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.

738
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:49,496
With all due respect, you just stated that you put things in this SOI that you didn't want in there because you were hiding from dealing with other people at the table.

739
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:51,257
So don't say people are hiding, Mr. Superintendent.

740
01:00:51,437 --> 01:00:54,098
I said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things

741
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:05,086
that they consider to be important to them because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate.

742
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:10,050
You're the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent.

743
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,911
And I like the participation of people.

744
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:13,532
I don't have to make all the decisions myself.

745
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:19,957
But the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it.

746
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:22,166
Nothing's going to go forward.

747
01:01:22,186 --> 01:01:25,307
We're trying to explore who wants to partner with us.

748
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:30,929
And you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school.

749
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:36,792
The operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational.

750
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:37,652
You know that.

751
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:44,641
So if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years.

752
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,844
But certainly, you're going to face a roof.

753
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:48,907
Certainly, you're going to face technology.

754
01:01:49,267 --> 01:01:52,611
Certainly, you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems, and other things like that.

755
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:56,436
And if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer.

756
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:58,767
before we get funding.

757
01:01:59,187 --> 01:02:06,629
And if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that.

758
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:10,150
We talk about these things and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off.

759
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:16,711
Let's get in the game and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority.

760
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,911
That's what we need to look at.

761
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:20,192
I think it's my job to put it in front of you.

762
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:26,913
I hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.

763
01:02:28,173 --> 01:02:37,298
So Mr. Superintendent, just getting back to some of the building deficiencies, would you agree that the restrooms at the high school are a deficiency of Meffitt High School?

764
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:42,621
I would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes.

765
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,023
How come they're not part of the SOI?

766
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,944
Because they're part of the general building envelope.

767
01:02:47,284 --> 01:02:48,685
That's something that we can talk about.

768
01:02:49,025 --> 01:02:49,925
They're part of the plumbing.

769
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,787
They're part of the heating system, believe it or not.

770
01:02:52,107 --> 01:02:54,388
It's all part of the same consideration.

771
01:02:54,742 --> 01:03:01,304
And just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA.

772
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:05,045
If we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well.

773
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:13,568
This is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.

774
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:17,389
So just so I understand, you brought up a good point.

775
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:22,150
So after the April 7th deadline, you're stating that we can add stuff to the SOI?

776
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,071
We can talk to them about it, yes.

777
01:03:24,621 --> 01:03:27,102
Not talk, we can add stuff after the deadline.

778
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:28,683
We can talk stuff, yes.

779
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:30,603
We can talk with them about it.

780
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:32,184
Maybe they'll let us add, maybe they won't.

781
01:03:32,484 --> 01:03:36,265
But I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.

782
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:47,970
With all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, I've been an advocate for a number of years regarding the cleanliness and the deplorable condition of the bathrooms at the high school.

783
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:53,172
And there's been some headway made, I have to give credit, there's been some headway made

784
01:03:53,565 --> 01:03:55,186
with the water bubblers and so forth.

785
01:03:55,567 --> 01:04:04,174
But many of the restrooms at the high school are locked down, not because we don't have the manpower to supervise them, it's because they're in deplorable condition, Mr. Superintendent.

786
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:07,557
And this is coming from firsthand knowledge.

787
01:04:08,217 --> 01:04:15,043
And I can tell you that the fact that it's not addressed in a deficiency in this program and say, well, it's covered under other things.

788
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:19,969
I think is not adequately addressing the deficiencies that we have at that school.

789
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:31,774
It may not be educational in nature, but what I can tell you is that there are kids at the high school that will hold in going to the restroom a whole day because they're so filthy dirty.

790
01:04:32,154 --> 01:04:33,335
And you can't get toilet paper.

791
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,195
There's no soap.

792
01:04:34,455 --> 01:04:35,536
There's no paper towels.

793
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:38,277
There's no doors on the urinals.

794
01:04:38,738 --> 01:04:45,802
And I'm just telling you reality, Mr. Superintendent, because you have your own private bathroom and probably don't frequent other restrooms in the building.

795
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:52,646
And I could just tell you that from what I hear from students, Mr. Superintendent, is that's what's happening up there.

796
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:56,388
And I'm saddened to see that it's not addressed in the SOI.

797
01:04:57,249 --> 01:05:03,833
But if you're telling me it could be added at a later date, that's fine, and I hope it does get added, because that would be my addition.

798
01:05:04,802 --> 01:05:06,423
I guess I'm a stakeholder.

799
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:14,529
I certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities.

800
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:21,134
There may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well and are in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.

801
01:05:21,154 --> 01:05:22,174
That's my exact point.

802
01:05:23,015 --> 01:05:26,778
I know you don't share them and that's why they've been in deplorable condition for so many years.

803
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:29,820
That's my exact point, Mr. Superintendent.

804
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:32,362
So we can go back and forth on that.

805
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:40,583
And also, Mr. Superintendent, you were here several months back when we were talking about safety at the high school.

806
01:05:40,623 --> 01:05:42,984
We had a great debate going back and forth.

807
01:05:43,484 --> 01:05:56,310
And I see you mentioned in the SOI that you have the inability to close off certain parts of the building and have the inability to keep it cordoned off to people from outside and so forth.

808
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:01,712
I'm glad to see that you're finally admitting that there is a security issue at the high school.

809
01:06:02,386 --> 01:06:18,254
and that there is concern, Mr. Superintendent, with access to that building throughout the course of the day, and that we've been unable to control the access, and I'm glad to see that you're offering some solutions to that effect, Mr. Superintendent.

810
01:06:18,354 --> 01:06:21,156
So for the record, I'm gonna tell you the high school is a safe place.

811
01:06:21,996 --> 01:06:29,300
There's always more we can do to improve it, and some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.

812
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,710
That's all for now, Mr. President.

813
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,711
Thank you, Vice President Mox.

814
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:41,371
Council Member Kern.

815
01:06:41,691 --> 01:06:44,512
Thank you, President Carviello.

816
01:06:45,552 --> 01:06:55,455
I think it's important that we do, as a group, as a city council, understand what the immediate needs are, a five-year plan.

817
01:06:55,475 --> 01:07:03,497
And I think that was my question in the beginning, and it's not really answered, and I have to review on this in depth.

818
01:07:03,657 --> 01:07:05,638
It does seem like everything is included

819
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:22,179
But when you stated that when the state comes in, you will let them know what the priorities are, I would just request through the chair that we do get a top five, top 10 list of things that need to be done and maybe why they need to be done.

820
01:07:22,219 --> 01:07:30,003
Nothing extensive, just the first thing we would need is a, just so we could better understand what those 10 things are.

821
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:35,346
If the state is gonna give us money, I think the city council, who will have to,

822
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:42,239
agree or disagree to bond for it should know that up front before we submit something like this.

823
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,541
I think that's number one.

824
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:59,813
Number two, I just agree with Councilor Marks in the respect with regards to putting everything in the kitchen sink into this document because we were told that we can't afford a fire station until 2022, 23, 24.

825
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:01,234
And the fire department was also promised

826
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,671
to be almost the next on the list.

827
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:21,140
So the administration told us that we can't afford probably a number of these larger items unless it's, you know, obviously a substantial need like a leaking roof or a blown boiler.

828
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:35,029
And so I would hate to have one of these larger projects that is not necessarily a necessity be approved and us be given a grant and then we come and see 500 students here advocating

829
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:49,825
that 500-person cafeteria or something that's almost a novelty that we can't afford and then have 75 firefighters in here, but wait, saying, wait, we were promised a new station, a healthy, safe environment for us to work.

830
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:52,266
And that's the way politics runs in Medford.

831
01:08:52,306 --> 01:08:55,706
It's not going to be up to all the elected body.

832
01:08:55,886 --> 01:09:00,207
How it's worked is it's going to come before the council to take that tough vote.

833
01:09:00,707 --> 01:09:04,808
So whether or not, I think this needs to be narrowed down just a bit.

834
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:06,803
Because I understand both sides.

835
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:10,885
I understand you want to include everything your staff and administration wants in the document.

836
01:09:11,365 --> 01:09:12,465
But it's a lie.

837
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:14,466
We can't afford all these items.

838
01:09:14,586 --> 01:09:22,048
And what we should be able to afford are the necessities, health, safety, and obviously the security within that school.

839
01:09:22,668 --> 01:09:24,609
And that should be what's in this document.

840
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:27,650
And that's what I'd be comfortable approving tonight.

841
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:34,892
And you would have my approval if it was narrowed down a little bit to maybe the top 10 items that need to be done at the high school.

842
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:42,035
And then we can do the necessities, do things that need to be done within the next five, six, seven years.

843
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:43,676
So I mean, I agree.

844
01:09:43,716 --> 01:10:05,029
And I think that those are two points, two things maybe that I think we should have before us, maybe a little updated document, a little less extravagant, and then also just a top 10 list of what needs to be done, what we're going to need to do within the next five to 10 years so that we can say, yes, this is a

845
01:10:05,507 --> 01:10:09,850
good request, and then see what the state is willing to give us.

846
01:10:10,271 --> 01:10:18,357
Because we cannot afford, we were told we cannot afford 10 extra million now, and we won't be able to afford it until we do the fire station.

847
01:10:18,397 --> 01:10:21,259
And then at that point, we won't be able to afford a library.

848
01:10:21,339 --> 01:10:25,782
And basically, what I heard is we won't be able to afford a lot of these items in this document.

849
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:30,165
So I'd rather ask for, hey, state, please, we need a roof.

850
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:33,548
We need a new electrical system in a building

851
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:41,679
These things are going to, obviously, we need them evaluated and they're going to fall apart or are going to have to be replaced within the next five to ten years.

852
01:10:41,699 --> 01:11:02,970
And I would ask the council to really think about that because that's a situation we're going to face for whoever's sitting behind this rail four, five, three years from now if we do get the monies for an extravagant item that we just really can't afford, that the kids are going to want so badly and the administration's going to want, but will they need it and will we be able to afford it?

853
01:11:03,365 --> 01:11:05,146
And we were told, no, it's not going to happen.

854
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,908
So let's, I think we need to be a little bit more realistic.

855
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,151
Mr. President, thank you very much.

856
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:17,213
I think we're getting the cut way, way, way ahead of the horse here.

857
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:25,558
Mr. President, if we look at the history of the Memphis city council, just several weeks ago, we voted unanimously for the administration to hire a grant writer before us right here.

858
01:11:25,598 --> 01:11:32,802
We have a grant that's been written and an opportunity to let the school department go and explore options and opportunities for the city to be given free money.

859
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,393
I don't think that's a bad thing, Mr. President.

860
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:38,534
We get elected to make tough decisions.

861
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:51,778
And if there comes a point in time when there's a room full of students and a room full of firefighters that are sitting here arguing about whose project is going to get funded, I think that everybody behind this rail is committed to the understanding that public safety is our first priority, Mr. President.

862
01:11:51,798 --> 01:11:53,779
But we will be the ones that have to make that tough decision.

863
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:55,159
But that's what we're here for.

864
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:04,162
Ultimately, Mr. President, all this is, is the school district seeking permission to go and sit down and have a conversation.

865
01:12:05,147 --> 01:12:07,788
That's what this is, the school district sitting down to have a conversation.

866
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:10,649
As such, Mr. President, I've made a motion to move for approval.

867
01:12:10,669 --> 01:12:11,970
I make a motion to end all debate.

868
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:13,091
Move the question.

869
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:21,774
Mr. Clerk, would you read the amendment, please?

870
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:37,796
Mr. President, motion to end all debate requires a two thirds roll call vote.

871
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:39,696
Vice president marks.

872
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:43,017
Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Mr. President.

873
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:45,058
Point of parliamentary inquiry.

874
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:46,558
Mr. President, non-debatable motion.

875
01:12:48,019 --> 01:12:49,579
No, it's up to Robert's rules of orders.

876
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,060
Why are we in the debate?

877
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,801
We just got the paper tonight and we're in the debate now.

878
01:12:56,561 --> 01:12:57,501
We just got the paper tonight.

879
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:58,042
We're in the debate.

880
01:12:58,062 --> 01:13:02,763
Do we want to allow the school district to move forward and pursue whether or not they have an opportunity to receive free grant money?

881
01:13:03,099 --> 01:13:04,240
based upon the history of the council.

882
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,200
That's what we're here discussing.

883
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,881
Voting in favor of hiring a grant writer.

884
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,062
That's what we're here discussing.

885
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:09,522
So the question is yes or no.

886
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:11,783
Do we want him to go forward and apply or not?

887
01:13:12,004 --> 01:13:12,944
Why do you want to end debate?

888
01:13:13,684 --> 01:13:14,405
Where are we going with this?

889
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:15,245
We're discussing it.

890
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:16,806
It doesn't seem to me like it's going anywhere.

891
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:18,447
It doesn't seem to me like it's going anywhere.

892
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:19,767
Oh, maybe to you it doesn't.

893
01:13:20,388 --> 01:13:21,468
The rest of us have questions.

894
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:22,969
Well, there's a motion on the floor.

895
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:23,830
It's an undebatable motion.

896
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,870
It requires a two-thirds vote.

897
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:25,390
Mr. President.

898
01:13:25,871 --> 01:13:28,012
Again, you want to stifle the people's speech.

899
01:13:28,652 --> 01:13:28,872
Again.

900
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,071
Pretty sure three times in 10 minutes has been met, Mr. President.

901
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:34,671
Thank you.

902
01:13:36,472 --> 01:13:37,772
Councilor Del Rosso for the last question.

903
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:42,954
The chair is just giving... I let you speak.

904
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:44,795
Do I or do I not have the chair?

905
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,596
Councilor Del Rosso has the chair at the moment.

906
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:48,436
Do I have the floor?

907
01:13:48,476 --> 01:13:48,856
Thank you.

908
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:50,497
Councilor, that is correct.

909
01:14:01,548 --> 01:14:02,168
make a call for it.

910
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:07,890
On the motion by council at night to end all discussion, and it takes a two thirds vote.

911
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,430
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

912
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:17,392
Councilor Dela Russo?

913
01:14:17,592 --> 01:14:17,852
Yes.

914
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,953
Councilor Falco?

915
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:21,813
No.

916
01:14:24,074 --> 01:14:25,574
I second the original motion.

917
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:26,994
That is adopted.

918
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:36,668
Councilor Scarpelli?

919
01:14:37,749 --> 01:14:37,889
No.

920
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:38,889
President Calviano?

921
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:41,149
No.

922
01:14:41,169 --> 01:14:44,130
Two in the affirmative, six in the negative.

923
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:44,991
Motion fails.

924
01:14:45,531 --> 01:14:46,911
Councilor DelaRusso has the floor.

925
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:49,432
Mr. President, I had the floor before that, Mr. President.

926
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:52,233
No, Councilor DelaRusso, you... No, no, no.

927
01:14:52,373 --> 01:14:54,293
He said it was undebatable.

928
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:56,214
He said it was undebatable.

929
01:14:57,374 --> 01:14:59,395
Councilor DelaRusso had the floor when we were asking that question.

930
01:15:00,895 --> 01:15:01,175
Thank you.

931
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,016
Councilor Knight, do you have any more to add?

932
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:04,556
That was my motion, Mr. President.

933
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:05,841
Motion fails.

934
01:15:06,521 --> 01:15:07,802
Councilor Marks, do you want to add anything?

935
01:15:08,243 --> 01:15:08,743
I do, mister.

936
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,244
I have a question for the superintendent.

937
01:15:10,264 --> 01:15:10,384
Speak.

938
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:11,025
Aren't we here tonight?

939
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:11,545
Speak.

940
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:14,888
To discuss, the superintendent came up here, took his time out of his busy schedule.

941
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:17,710
No one's denying you an opportunity to speak.

942
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,292
We're just trying to deny freedom of speech.

943
01:15:19,312 --> 01:15:20,413
I was not trying to deny you.

944
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:23,355
The board spoke, and you were able to speak.

945
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:29,280
The board spoke is right, and I'm thankful for my colleagues that know what this legislative process is all about.

946
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,801
You have the floor.

947
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,583
I know I do, you keep them interrupting.

948
01:15:35,126 --> 01:15:43,632
And I want to thank my colleagues that had the gumption, Mr. President, to allow this dialogue to keep going on and not be rubber stamps.

949
01:15:47,735 --> 01:15:54,859
Mr. Superintendent, are you willing to put together a priority list, as Counselor Longo Kern mentioned, in the SOI?

950
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,302
It seems like this is an ongoing, fluid discussion with the state.

951
01:15:59,342 --> 01:16:00,623
Are you willing to do that?

952
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:02,865
I think that the school committee

953
01:16:03,695 --> 01:16:05,135
would meet to talk about that.

954
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:09,917
And we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them.

955
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:14,519
They have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list.

956
01:16:15,219 --> 01:16:16,779
And they're not going to meet for another two weeks.

957
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,660
And so I think that that slows this down.

958
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,462
This is due in a very short period of time into the state.

959
01:16:23,522 --> 01:16:30,764
And I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards, but the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state.

960
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:33,505
But I think you should allow us to go forward.

961
01:16:34,141 --> 01:16:36,543
And to get this going, I mean, it doesn't hurt.

962
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:39,585
You're not committing anything in terms of money.

963
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:49,333
You're just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues.

964
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:52,856
And they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure.

965
01:16:53,556 --> 01:16:55,798
They won't even get to us for a short period of time.

966
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,420
But having said that, we have to be in.

967
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,562
Because there are other communities going to submit as well.

968
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,652
And if we're not in, we don't get any consideration.

969
01:17:05,033 --> 01:17:12,278
So I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list.

970
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:14,619
But I don't think you should stop it tonight.

971
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,041
Mr. Superintendent, if I could.

972
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:22,845
And I don't think anyone behind this reeling, and I'll speak for myself, was looking to stop this tonight.

973
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:25,908
We were looking to ask questions, Mr. Superintendent.

974
01:17:26,568 --> 01:17:30,451
And that's not confused questioning with being in opposition.

975
01:17:31,195 --> 01:17:32,296
It's part of the process.

976
01:17:33,356 --> 01:17:34,297
It's part of the process.

977
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,678
I know this is an early step and it's the first step.

978
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:39,139
And now we're hearing April 7th is the deadline.

979
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:46,223
No surprise, not for you, but no surprise to this council because we're always presented with, Oh, the deadline's next week.

980
01:17:46,884 --> 01:17:47,624
Make a decision.

981
01:17:48,304 --> 01:17:50,506
Can't table it for a week because the deadline's next week.

982
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,047
So we're always presented that way.

983
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:56,529
But you know, I'm not going to stand in the way of this tonight, Mr. Superintendent.

984
01:17:56,789 --> 01:17:58,410
I think what council Longo Kern offered,

985
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:06,337
about going back, and if you need to go back to the school committee and get a priority list, I think that's a great suggestion, Mr. Superintendent, to do that.

986
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:08,257
And I would ask that that be done.

987
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:22,780
And I would also ask that this council be privy to any discussions that you are having with the state regarding projects of which projects may be taken off the board, which projects may be added to the SOI.

988
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,281
So we're up to date and not just presented something

989
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:28,689
on the last hour again for approval.

990
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:34,555
And I would ask that you keep this council privy to that information, Mr. President.

991
01:18:34,995 --> 01:18:36,757
I certainly have no problem with any of that.

992
01:18:36,817 --> 01:18:38,899
I think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves.

993
01:18:39,459 --> 01:18:45,425
Any project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state.

994
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:51,863
So there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place.

995
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:58,847
But if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that.

996
01:18:59,307 --> 01:19:04,150
I think that that's a good thing, but I don't think we should stop getting in on the

997
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:08,123
uh, into the state with this.

998
01:19:08,163 --> 01:19:13,945
So we can continue to move and get them to come out to a sooner rather than later, because everybody's going to be submitting.

999
01:19:14,425 --> 01:19:21,167
And if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen till August, September, October, whatever the case may be.

1000
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:23,208
Yeah.

1001
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:27,689
I was told just so you know, there's, there's no priority according to when the SOI is received.

1002
01:19:27,749 --> 01:19:35,992
So whether the last one in the door, first one in the door, second one on the door, I was also told that they're not going to look at applications or make any recommendations until December.

1003
01:19:36,357 --> 01:19:36,417
of 2017.

1004
01:19:36,457 --> 01:19:43,643
So there's plenty of time and I'm just asking that we be part of any discussions that are ongoing.

1005
01:19:44,324 --> 01:19:47,206
You will have my support here tonight, Mr. Superintendent.

1006
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:49,628
I could just tell you eventually

1007
01:19:50,534 --> 01:20:06,038
And as a longtime member of this council, eventually when something comes before us, whether it's a year, two or three years before us, and if it does, if and when it does require, maybe require a proposition two and a half override, you will not have my support.

1008
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:11,760
And I just want to let that be known right now because, you know, I'm not going to hold back any punches.

1009
01:20:12,596 --> 01:20:22,119
Um, you know, I voted not to have, uh, the combined center because we were told that it would require proposition two and a half override for the police and fire.

1010
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:28,481
And you know, we have a library coming down, uh, the, the Pike pretty soon, uh, with some grant funding.

1011
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:32,522
Uh, we're gonna have this project and eventually we're gonna have the fight apartment coming down.

1012
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:42,245
So, um, I would just ask that, um, uh, whatever's done that it, it, it stay within the confines of a budget without a proposition two and a half override.

1013
01:20:42,628 --> 01:20:46,670
I respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them.

1014
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,610
I mean, I'm not a rookie.

1015
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:55,633
I've been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support.

1016
01:20:56,213 --> 01:20:57,134
So I respect that.

1017
01:20:58,094 --> 01:21:01,856
But it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know.

1018
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:02,656
Know your options.

1019
01:21:04,857 --> 01:21:05,497
Thank you.

1020
01:21:05,537 --> 01:21:06,258
Counsel Max, are you finished?

1021
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:07,418
Thank you, Mr. President.

1022
01:21:08,618 --> 01:21:09,459
Counsel De La Rosa.

1023
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:12,360
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1024
01:21:13,088 --> 01:21:17,951
And thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your leadership and your clarity and your foresight.

1025
01:21:19,392 --> 01:21:31,840
The way I understand this request, it is to get us, as you've presented, into the door and to have items for discussion on the table for us to see what can be funded and what we can receive help with.

1026
01:21:32,561 --> 01:21:37,324
I'm all in favor of a priority list from the school board.

1027
01:21:38,224 --> 01:21:42,327
My concern with priority lists from anybody is that they be responsible.

1028
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:55,584
and that they have in mind a larger picture that though this body makes the final decision that we all share a responsibility in.

1029
01:21:57,165 --> 01:22:01,727
I approve of this request and I will support it, Mr. Superintendent.

1030
01:22:02,267 --> 01:22:08,230
I must say that I hope that when we get into further discussion on how or

1031
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:23,212
in what way some of this money and some of these grants might be directed that we're able to address some of the money that we've spent in the past on the same thing several times.

1032
01:22:24,752 --> 01:22:34,475
It seems as though we're chasing leaks in those roofs and replacing them and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on those roofs in a frequent manner.

1033
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:39,646
I'm concerned about that, and I hope we can get to the bottom of the top of the building.

1034
01:22:40,446 --> 01:22:45,869
And so, I think I've said enough, and I think perhaps we've heard enough tonight.

1035
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,411
And so, I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

1036
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:50,352
Thank you.

1037
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:53,233
Mr. President, just one quick thing to Councilor, if I may.

1038
01:22:54,114 --> 01:22:56,715
Just that we did an infrared study of the high school roof.

1039
01:22:57,656 --> 01:23:02,319
We will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer.

1040
01:23:03,099 --> 01:23:03,379
Okay?

1041
01:23:03,419 --> 01:23:04,400
That's about all we need to do.

1042
01:23:05,078 --> 01:23:14,562
The long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out, and, you know, if we were to take it to the end.

1043
01:23:14,642 --> 01:23:16,123
So that's really where we're at.

1044
01:23:16,823 --> 01:23:28,528
We had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those.

1045
01:23:28,568 --> 01:23:30,849
But other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.

1046
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:31,669
Thank you.

1047
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:33,710
Council Member Kern.

1048
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,697
Mr. Caviello, through the chair, I just want to ask for clarification.

1049
01:23:37,777 --> 01:23:43,400
So we're asking for a priority list and we're asking, I mean, I guess it would be a good compromise.

1050
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,482
Are we asking to keep the document as is and then put the priority list in there?

1051
01:23:48,582 --> 01:23:49,842
Did you state that Councilor Marks?

1052
01:23:50,323 --> 01:23:52,184
Put the priority list within the application?

1053
01:23:57,486 --> 01:23:59,667
I thought I heard you say that it will be within the document.

1054
01:24:00,547 --> 01:24:04,309
We could put in the document or the superintendent says he sits down and meets with the state.

1055
01:24:05,203 --> 01:24:07,364
I have no problem with him presenting the priority list.

1056
01:24:08,464 --> 01:24:12,105
So it doesn't, I don't care about the avenue it gets to the state.

1057
01:24:13,145 --> 01:24:13,405
Okay.

1058
01:24:13,445 --> 01:24:13,706
Yeah.

1059
01:24:13,806 --> 01:24:28,870
I just wouldn't make like to add that, that our priority list that is drafted within the next week or two, even be added as a, an attachment to the application so that the state knows, yes, we're looking for everything, but these are our top

1060
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:36,622
whatever it might be, 10, 11, 12 things that we need done within the next five to 10 years that we're going to be putting money forward anyway for.

1061
01:24:36,642 --> 01:24:40,184
And we would love some state reimbursement.

1062
01:24:40,304 --> 01:24:42,385
I think that I'd just like to add that to the paper.

1063
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:48,289
And I'd also like to just point out that I think I heard that this document maybe was produced in September.

1064
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:53,753
And I think the school committee voted on it on the 6th of February, which was a month and a half ago.

1065
01:24:53,773 --> 01:24:58,976
And for some reason, it came before us tonight with only a week or two left before it's actually due.

1066
01:24:59,598 --> 01:25:10,022
So in the future, it would be nice to, obviously the school committee has the right to review and to discuss first, but a little bit sooner so that maybe we could prepare a little bit more.

1067
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:11,063
We got it on Friday.

1068
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:20,526
I think a lot of us review our packet over the weekend, leaving us only a couple of days to form questions, do research, make calls, and get the questions we want answered before we have to vote on it.

1069
01:25:20,587 --> 01:25:28,990
And it always just feels, no offense to the superintendent, but no matter what we're presented, half the time, especially if it's something important, we're giving it

1070
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:45,367
the week of and it's just not the right way to run a city and to be transparent with not only us as the people who are elected to make the votes but to the people who are electing us who are going to come and ask us the questions or who ask us the questions after they hear the meeting.

1071
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:58,551
So I think just think in the future and I'll say that all the time and whether or not it happens, highly unlikely, but I think it's extremely important to be more transparent and to give the city council more time for review.

1072
01:25:59,093 --> 01:25:59,373
Thank you.

1073
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:01,514
So, Mr. President, if I could just respond.

1074
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:02,955
I mean, I feel I have to.

1075
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:06,277
The document you're referring to in September was a different document.

1076
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:19,365
That's the capital plan that came from the mayor, which through the school committee, the document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee, the whole meeting that they had the week before on that.

1077
01:26:19,846 --> 01:26:22,267
And you received it, what do you call it tonight?

1078
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,569
Uh, because what do you call it?

1079
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:26,810
You were busy dealing with other capital

1080
01:26:27,412 --> 01:26:31,753
considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so that we didn't confuse those two items.

1081
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:35,134
But the reality is that that's the two things.

1082
01:26:35,174 --> 01:26:39,176
And the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form.

1083
01:26:39,596 --> 01:26:40,636
We filled out the form.

1084
01:26:41,016 --> 01:26:42,817
You don't add to the form.

1085
01:26:42,877 --> 01:26:45,617
We'll be happy to provide that priority list to them.

1086
01:26:46,378 --> 01:26:47,518
But the form is the form.

1087
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:48,398
That's what you submit.

1088
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:52,620
You don't add things to an application that is not required.

1089
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:57,181
I think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal.

1090
01:26:57,984 --> 01:27:11,107
Um, so, but certainly we respect the right, you know, that the council has asked and we've certainly will honor that to come up with a priority list, provide it to you and provide it to MSBA as part of the discussions that take place.

1091
01:27:11,767 --> 01:27:12,107
Thank you.

1092
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:13,167
Councilor Del Rosso.

1093
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:25,330
I would, uh, my point was to be, uh, in support of that priority list attachment in so much as it, uh, it doesn't act as a hindrance or as an appropriate in that forum.

1094
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:38,725
I, uh, trust that the superintendent, uh, through the process of meetings, uh, with the authority and, uh, his presence and his negotiating skills won't lead us to be bamboozled.

1095
01:27:39,906 --> 01:27:40,266
Thank you.

1096
01:27:40,326 --> 01:27:44,089
Counselor Dela Rosa and Mr. Superintendent, I thank you for your leadership.

1097
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:50,515
Our technical school and high school has moved forward on the last few years under your guidance and I hope to see it continue moving forward.

1098
01:27:50,595 --> 01:27:50,995
Thank you.

1099
01:27:51,095 --> 01:27:51,415
Thank you.

1100
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:54,418
I think we have somebody that wants to speak and back me up.

1101
01:27:54,558 --> 01:27:54,738
Okay.

1102
01:27:57,223 --> 01:27:59,424
Excuse me, Mr. Penta, the gentleman was first.

1103
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:04,487
Name and address of the record, please.

1104
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:06,728
David McKillop, 94 Rock Glen Road.

1105
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:10,450
I was listening to all the conversation tonight.

1106
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:15,333
And I guess being a business person, I'm all about planning.

1107
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:19,175
And it seems to be that for whatever reason, we're struggling with planning.

1108
01:28:20,176 --> 01:28:23,557
One of the things that really strikes me as curious is the MSBA.

1109
01:28:24,998 --> 01:28:26,359
The MSBA was presented.

1110
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:29,029
Now, when it was presented is the question.

1111
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:38,352
Because if it was presented two months ago, six months ago, a year ago, then you may have had the opportunity to actually get more information a lot sooner.

1112
01:28:38,372 --> 01:28:39,953
So that should be a question that should be asked.

1113
01:28:40,493 --> 01:28:44,855
When is the MSBA turn around and say, hey, when does the door open?

1114
01:28:45,815 --> 01:28:48,116
Mr. Subutani, can you answer the gentleman's question?

1115
01:28:50,177 --> 01:28:55,519
The MSBA opens up a window for statements of interest in January.

1116
01:28:56,115 --> 01:29:00,078
and then expects it to follow through by the April date.

1117
01:29:00,438 --> 01:29:02,000
They actually pushed it out a little bit this year.

1118
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,920
Normally it's in March.

1119
01:29:03,341 --> 01:29:05,963
But they open up the window for the SOIs in January.

1120
01:29:06,744 --> 01:29:06,844
OK.

1121
01:29:06,904 --> 01:29:07,244
Thank you.

1122
01:29:07,564 --> 01:29:08,485
So that's the first thing.

1123
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:18,647
So if it's being opened up in January, the meeting is being done in February, the finalization is then, now it's March, April, really the window is much, much smaller than you might actually anticipate.

1124
01:29:18,688 --> 01:29:21,730
So the question isn't answered in the respect of how to plan this better.

1125
01:29:22,211 --> 01:29:29,038
So now to be proactive, the next time the MSBA opens up, I think as a city council, I personally,

1126
01:29:29,858 --> 01:29:37,704
if it were me, would say, hey, the next time this opens, we want from day one to know when and how and what we need to do.

1127
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:39,105
We want to be part of that.

1128
01:29:39,525 --> 01:29:47,591
So when the school committee goes into the committee of the whole, the discussion is made, you're already aware something's going to be coming to your desk.

1129
01:29:47,651 --> 01:29:48,572
And I think that would help.

1130
01:29:49,392 --> 01:29:55,817
To me, again, looking at a business perspective, I've been in business for 14 years.

1131
01:29:57,655 --> 01:29:59,656
Business needs a facelift, really, really bad.

1132
01:29:59,896 --> 01:30:02,058
So if you guys want to help me with that, please contribute.

1133
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:08,782
But in order to do that, four years ago, I had to start planning for this coming year, not 2017, 2018.

1134
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:13,365
Four years ago, I started to put that plan together.

1135
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:15,526
Four years ago, I did a cost analysis.

1136
01:30:15,626 --> 01:30:20,749
Four years ago, we started to meet with people that could help us put this project together.

1137
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:25,252
This year, we're meeting with a designer who's going to take an entire year to put this together.

1138
01:30:26,531 --> 01:30:40,946
I don't understand how we're looking at the police station, the fire station, the high school, and we're saying, oh my God, the world is coming to an end today when this has been happening for 10, 15, 20, 30 years.

1139
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:44,971
So the other thing I ask is, where's the plan?

1140
01:30:45,812 --> 01:30:47,934
We just heard that it would be five years out for

1141
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:49,380
a new roof?

1142
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,560
Where's the plan?

1143
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:52,602
Do we have a plan in front of us?

1144
01:30:53,302 --> 01:30:55,224
Do we know how much it's going to cost in five years?

1145
01:30:55,384 --> 01:30:57,265
Have we started to map that out?

1146
01:30:57,865 --> 01:30:59,386
Are we planning for that?

1147
01:31:00,427 --> 01:31:08,773
Secondly is, if we're going to get 40 more years out of this high school, okay, what's the plan in 40 years?

1148
01:31:09,433 --> 01:31:10,414
What's the new high school?

1149
01:31:10,949 --> 01:31:19,676
Let's be visionaries and let's try to figure out how we can make this happen in the future for all of the people that are voting for you and all the people in this community.

1150
01:31:19,716 --> 01:31:22,098
Because I look at Medford as a gateway city.

1151
01:31:22,638 --> 01:31:23,639
Cambridge is maxed out.

1152
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:25,040
Somerville is maxed out.

1153
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,861
This is the next city on the line.

1154
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,985
You want it to be Medford or do you want it to be Malden or do you want it to be Everett?

1155
01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:40,492
I think you guys really have to take a look at that and start planning ahead and putting your best foot forward because if you don't start investing now, it's going to catch up later on.

1156
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:41,672
Thank you.

1157
01:31:42,673 --> 01:31:43,013
Thank you.

1158
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:48,097
Name and address of the record, please.

1159
01:31:48,437 --> 01:31:52,440
Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former member of this board.

1160
01:31:52,741 --> 01:32:08,032
With all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here knowing that in January that the application is out there and knowing that the school committee met, I believe a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council.

1161
01:32:08,433 --> 01:32:15,042
You know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council.

1162
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:23,635
While the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down.

1163
01:32:24,015 --> 01:32:24,916
I'll bring this out soon.

1164
01:32:25,316 --> 01:32:25,897
It's not right.

1165
01:32:25,937 --> 01:32:26,477
It's not fair.

1166
01:32:26,497 --> 01:32:27,438
It doesn't make any sense.

1167
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:31,081
The job is here to deal with everything that the city involves you with.

1168
01:32:31,561 --> 01:32:33,543
Finances, education, whatever it might be.

1169
01:32:33,823 --> 01:32:37,105
And if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be.

1170
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:45,452
Maybe if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on.

1171
01:32:46,385 --> 01:33:01,477
Mr. Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist.

1172
01:33:02,197 --> 01:33:12,986
You go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Memphis City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times,

1173
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,741
And as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass.

1174
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:28,285
And further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current.

1175
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:36,047
Now, how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met?

1176
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:41,345
That should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis.

1177
01:33:41,905 --> 01:33:42,766
That's an everyday thing.

1178
01:33:42,786 --> 01:33:45,308
You're talking about the safety of the children in the school.

1179
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:54,714
You indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be, it's approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that.

1180
01:33:55,475 --> 01:34:00,018
You also indicated that there is no way to close off the sections of the building

1181
01:34:00,489 --> 01:34:04,470
to prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours.

1182
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:08,352
You can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council.

1183
01:34:08,592 --> 01:34:14,974
And that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there.

1184
01:34:15,354 --> 01:34:22,196
And in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings.

1185
01:34:22,816 --> 01:34:28,058
And now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in.

1186
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:37,343
You can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out.

1187
01:34:37,383 --> 01:34:38,144
It's totally unfair.

1188
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:38,804
It's not right.

1189
01:34:39,865 --> 01:34:55,495
I can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance?

1190
01:34:56,865 --> 01:35:00,871
That's the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school.

1191
01:35:01,172 --> 01:35:02,674
That's what you pay your taxes for.

1192
01:35:02,894 --> 01:35:05,959
That's what a parent believes their elected officials are doing.

1193
01:35:05,979 --> 01:35:10,926
They're making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day.

1194
01:35:13,885 --> 01:35:23,808
Mr. Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be.

1195
01:35:24,288 --> 01:35:25,849
We've been talking about this thing for years.

1196
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:35,352
The new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves.

1197
01:35:36,132 --> 01:35:39,493
And now, Councilor Caviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars.

1198
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:42,233
The buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years.

1199
01:35:42,453 --> 01:35:44,534
We're right back to where you were in the beginning.

1200
01:35:44,554 --> 01:35:48,375
That's the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place.

1201
01:35:49,255 --> 01:35:51,115
Granted, Medford High School is a big school.

1202
01:35:51,235 --> 01:35:52,515
It's a big school to take place.

1203
01:35:53,636 --> 01:35:58,897
But you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one.

1204
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:04,458
The question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right?

1205
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:09,250
Are we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right?

1206
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:12,411
Are we just paying to have something done?

1207
01:36:14,212 --> 01:36:25,918
Another part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars.

1208
01:36:26,258 --> 01:36:29,340
This is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks.

1209
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,101
The school committee should be here sitting with you.

1210
01:36:33,393 --> 01:36:40,277
And you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project.

1211
01:36:41,498 --> 01:36:43,339
You people got hit with this cold turkey tonight.

1212
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:46,841
You should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it.

1213
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:50,543
It's before the bodies, before the public here tonight.

1214
01:36:51,784 --> 01:36:57,027
And to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.

1215
01:36:57,487 --> 01:36:58,608
The debate was not shut off.

1216
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:01,610
Point of information, Councillor Knight.

1217
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:15,852
It's not relative to millions and millions of dollars, it's relative to whether or not we're going to authorize the school district to sit down and meet with the Massachusetts School Building Assistance Program to determine whether or not there are any grant funding opportunities that are competitive in nature for the city of Medford to pursue.

1218
01:37:16,695 --> 01:37:20,677
And if that be the case, that's a dollar, excuse me, Mr. President, that's a dollar amount attached to it.

1219
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:26,420
Because the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it.

1220
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:33,103
That dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it.

1221
01:37:33,503 --> 01:37:34,324
It's a dollar amount.

1222
01:37:35,044 --> 01:37:38,386
You should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium.

1223
01:37:38,406 --> 01:37:39,967
This is the only place you have an opportunity.

1224
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:40,627
Nobody was shut off.

1225
01:37:41,007 --> 01:37:43,168
I just said you should not shut off anyone.

1226
01:37:43,489 --> 01:37:45,249
There was an attempt to end debate.

1227
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:46,350
Nobody was shut off.

1228
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:48,871
I said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.

1229
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:49,212
Mr. President.

1230
01:37:49,272 --> 01:37:50,532
One information, Councilor Knight.

1231
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:56,796
Robert's Rules of Order have been adopted by the City Council as a standard to be used in the deliberation and discussion in the governing of our meetings.

1232
01:37:57,576 --> 01:37:59,237
Section 18 of Robert's Rules of Order was raised.

1233
01:37:59,457 --> 01:37:59,657
Thank you.

1234
01:37:59,677 --> 01:38:01,178
Section of 18 of Robert's Rules of Order failed.

1235
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:01,898
No big deal.

1236
01:38:02,058 --> 01:38:02,799
Thank you.

1237
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:04,800
Robert's Rules of Order also allows

1238
01:38:05,187 --> 01:38:06,667
Public participation, Mr. President.

1239
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:08,228
Public participation is allowed.

1240
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:09,628
I don't want to hear it again.

1241
01:38:10,909 --> 01:38:11,949
What is that, a threat?

1242
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:14,130
Is that a threat, Mr. President?

1243
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,930
I have a right to say what I want.

1244
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:17,571
This is a public forum.

1245
01:38:17,751 --> 01:38:19,952
This is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want.

1246
01:38:19,972 --> 01:38:21,152
Thank you very much.

1247
01:38:21,452 --> 01:38:22,413
Mr. President.

1248
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:26,974
Counselor De La Russo.

1249
01:38:27,114 --> 01:38:29,015
This is a meeting of the Medford City Council.

1250
01:38:29,495 --> 01:38:29,775
Thank you.

1251
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:36,665
Mr. President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state.

1252
01:38:37,185 --> 01:38:42,608
We need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward.

1253
01:38:43,048 --> 01:38:49,231
I can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year.

1254
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:51,572
That's the sad part, since January of this year.

1255
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,102
School committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly.

1256
01:38:55,483 --> 01:38:59,526
And if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know.

1257
01:38:59,946 --> 01:39:02,428
Maybe the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be.

1258
01:39:02,568 --> 01:39:02,969
I don't know.

1259
01:39:03,389 --> 01:39:05,271
None of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity.

1260
01:39:05,911 --> 01:39:11,235
That's why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you.

1261
01:39:11,836 --> 01:39:15,859
It hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how what's going on.

1262
01:39:16,079 --> 01:39:18,181
And you get a better idea what the cost is going to be.

1263
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:21,724
You can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be, as the gentleman just came up here.

1264
01:39:21,944 --> 01:39:26,726
Mr. McAuliffe as he relates to the fact that how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for.

1265
01:39:28,207 --> 01:39:35,590
No matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done.

1266
01:39:35,891 --> 01:39:42,894
You still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going.

1267
01:39:43,234 --> 01:39:46,578
Police, fire, retirement board that needs to be paid.

1268
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:51,123
The deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has.

1269
01:39:51,703 --> 01:39:54,547
Again, nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that.

1270
01:39:54,867 --> 01:39:56,589
And more importantly, a fire and police department.

1271
01:39:56,829 --> 01:39:58,871
Does that mean now fire and police are going to be separated?

1272
01:39:59,672 --> 01:40:00,953
Or is it not going to be separated?

1273
01:40:01,533 --> 01:40:05,334
You haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward.

1274
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:18,940
If they take down the station over there for the training tower, for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location.

1275
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,001
A public safety issue.

1276
01:40:22,901 --> 01:40:24,222
One information, Councilor Knight.

1277
01:40:25,385 --> 01:40:31,110
The training tower is being addressed by a working group that's headed up by the chief and made up of members of the fire department's training division.

1278
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:42,159
I do also believe that their wish, inclination, desire, and focus is to have a training tower that's located in the city of Medford that may be open to regional communities.

1279
01:40:42,199 --> 01:40:45,681
However, it would be maintained, dictated, and controlled by the city of Medford.

1280
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:50,345
That's based upon some meetings that I've had with the training team and the administration, Mr. President.

1281
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:51,967
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1282
01:40:52,227 --> 01:40:53,668
Mr. President, the Medford Public Schools

1283
01:40:54,566 --> 01:41:04,778
as in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions.

1284
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:10,766
All things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak.

1285
01:41:11,385 --> 01:41:26,619
After the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you.

1286
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,322
Then, if I understand this correctly,

1287
01:41:30,045 --> 01:41:34,846
And Mr. Belson's commentary, and I agree with you a hundred percent.

1288
01:41:34,986 --> 01:41:45,629
You said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level.

1289
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:57,833
Well, at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community.

1290
01:41:58,558 --> 01:42:01,721
This is a big issue, whether you wanna realize it or not.

1291
01:42:02,021 --> 01:42:03,662
The building is 50 years old.

1292
01:42:03,682 --> 01:42:06,525
You're talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now.

1293
01:42:06,865 --> 01:42:08,446
Maintenance didn't take place in the building.

1294
01:42:09,027 --> 01:42:15,712
Now a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos.

1295
01:42:16,033 --> 01:42:16,693
It's a big building.

1296
01:42:16,733 --> 01:42:19,415
I think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent.

1297
01:42:20,216 --> 01:42:22,118
550,000 square feet, whatever it might be.

1298
01:42:22,858 --> 01:42:26,061
It was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school.

1299
01:42:28,002 --> 01:42:28,843
But that's not the point.

1300
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,304
You're getting a lot of this all at once.

1301
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:47,334
Maybe, to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is, maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget.

1302
01:42:48,175 --> 01:42:50,276
Let me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought.

1303
01:42:51,076 --> 01:42:52,337
Just look at the city of Somerville.

1304
01:42:52,717 --> 01:42:55,059
Look at all the development that's taken place over there.

1305
01:42:56,139 --> 01:42:57,020
All the development.

1306
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:58,210
Okay.

1307
01:42:59,230 --> 01:43:03,312
Many, many more jobs and their taxes keep on going up.

1308
01:43:04,412 --> 01:43:16,276
You don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of some of them and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford.

1309
01:43:16,356 --> 01:43:20,637
And as council Marks and others alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a proposition two and a half override.

1310
01:43:21,277 --> 01:43:22,858
It'll lose everyone behind this council.

1311
01:43:22,878 --> 01:43:25,239
I guarantee you will lose if you'll be supportive of that.

1312
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:26,559
If you're serving at that point in time.

1313
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:28,348
You need to plan ahead.

1314
01:43:29,048 --> 01:43:31,509
And when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues.

1315
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:33,390
These have been long overdue.

1316
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:34,091
This is a shame.

1317
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:36,172
Prior school committees ought to hang their head.

1318
01:43:36,732 --> 01:43:38,993
An embarrassment for allowing this to go this long.

1319
01:43:39,433 --> 01:43:47,297
And so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out.

1320
01:43:47,678 --> 01:43:49,198
And now you're going to pay the price for it.

1321
01:43:49,619 --> 01:43:49,899
Thank you.

1322
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,200
Councilor DelaRusso.

1323
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,981
Mr. President, move the question.

1324
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:55,862
Second.

1325
01:43:57,083 --> 01:44:00,446
As amended, Mr. Belson, do you want to finish up with anything?

1326
01:44:00,466 --> 01:44:03,569
I just want to finish a couple of quick statements, if I may, with your permission.

1327
01:44:04,770 --> 01:44:11,475
First of all, some of the things that were quoted were quoted as the priorities of the state.

1328
01:44:11,916 --> 01:44:15,499
When they say the building structurally unsound, that's not what we're saying.

1329
01:44:15,519 --> 01:44:19,602
That's what the state is using as a category for things that you can put things under.

1330
01:44:20,223 --> 01:44:24,907
When the building says that the renovation of schools such as roofs, that's what they're saying you can ask for.

1331
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:27,556
That's not what we're saying is our need.

1332
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:28,737
That's the first thing.

1333
01:44:29,097 --> 01:44:32,259
As far as handicapped accessibility, we put in three elevators, ramps.

1334
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:36,742
We've made the Little Theater or the Caron Theater now handicapped accessible.

1335
01:44:37,082 --> 01:44:38,723
The building is handicapped accessible.

1336
01:44:39,263 --> 01:44:40,043
There are a lot of things.

1337
01:44:40,064 --> 01:44:43,606
And with all due respect to, I understand there's a give and take here.

1338
01:44:43,646 --> 01:44:49,469
But the reality is that a lot of improvements have been made to that high school and that technical school.

1339
01:44:49,859 --> 01:44:53,240
And you have helped to pay for it over the years as a city council and as a school committee.

1340
01:44:53,740 --> 01:45:01,702
The school committee had a right when this thing came out to deliberate and determine what it considered to be important and to talk about it.

1341
01:45:02,082 --> 01:45:03,202
And they had a committee of the whole.

1342
01:45:03,382 --> 01:45:06,763
And they then had a follow-up meeting where they voted it.

1343
01:45:07,403 --> 01:45:08,003
You're getting it.

1344
01:45:08,623 --> 01:45:15,205
And all we're asking is for you to allow us to submit it so we can then begin a process of finding out what's possible.

1345
01:45:15,765 --> 01:45:17,185
And then we can have a more robust

1346
01:45:17,658 --> 01:45:31,706
interactive process between council, school committee, mayor, administration, to determine what this city considers important, what this city wants to fund on its own, what this city wants to partner with, and what we're gonna do in what time frame.

1347
01:45:31,726 --> 01:45:33,067
And that's all we're looking for tonight.

1348
01:45:33,287 --> 01:45:33,467
Thank you.

1349
01:45:33,487 --> 01:45:34,207
Thank you, Mr. Belson.

Thank you very much.

1369
01:45:55,771 --> 01:45:56,132
Thank you.

1370
01:45:56,512 --> 01:45:58,854
While we're on the suspension by- I don't get to speak on this?

1371
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:00,395
I don't get to speak?

1372
01:46:01,155 --> 01:46:02,556
We're done with that issue, Mr. Bignone.

1373
01:46:02,717 --> 01:46:04,458
But you said that we could still speak.

1374
01:46:04,498 --> 01:46:06,680
You said you weren't going to shut the- We're done with that issue, Mr. Bignone.

1375
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:08,461
That's why you lost in criminal court.

1376
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:09,762
Motion's been disposed of.

1377
01:46:12,182 --> 01:46:12,842
Excuse me.

1378
01:46:12,862 --> 01:46:14,603
17307, the 306, excuse me, 311.

1379

1380
01:46:20,765 --> 01:46:26,868
Account 0101515762 to the President and members of the Honorable City Council for Mayor Stephanie M Burke.

1381
01:46:39,293 --> 01:46:41,715
Claimant name, Mary Bradley, City of Medford.

1382
01:46:41,735 --> 01:46:44,737
Date of accident, March 26, 2016.

1383
01:46:45,497 --> 01:46:46,578
Motion to waive the ratings.

1384
01:46:48,499 --> 01:46:49,660
Name and address for the record, please.

1385
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,001
Thank you, Mr. President.

1386
01:46:51,061 --> 01:46:54,644
Kimberly Scanlon, Assistant City Solicitor for the City of Medford.

1387
01:46:54,704 --> 01:46:57,886
I reside at 75 Ashcroft Road in Medford.

1388
01:46:58,647 --> 01:47:04,791
The brief synopsis is, in this case, the claimant, 62 years old, a Medford resident, slipped and fell.

1389
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:18,325
In March of last year, right around 392 Main Street, as a result, she broke several bones in her left foot, including twisting her left ankle.

1390
01:47:19,145 --> 01:47:19,865
She was treated.

1391
01:47:20,606 --> 01:47:24,447
The proper release has been obtained, and her medical bills were in excess of $5,616.

1392
01:47:24,487 --> 01:47:26,447
To clarify, this also includes an approximately $1,900 medical lien.

1393
01:47:26,467 --> 01:47:28,128
And if you have any questions, I'd

1394
01:47:34,941 --> 01:47:35,721
happy to answer them.

1395
01:47:35,902 --> 01:47:36,822
Mr. President, if I may.

1396
01:47:38,623 --> 01:47:40,444
Councillor Knight, has the street defect been repaired?

1397
01:47:41,385 --> 01:47:42,706
Across the street it has.

1398
01:47:43,606 --> 01:47:50,150
That particular location, though, in anticipation of your question, Councillor, I went out today to look at the property and took pictures.

1399
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:54,333
That area, that technically a lot of Main Street could use improvement.

1400
01:47:55,213 --> 01:48:03,858
So I submitted an inquiry to DPW again to make sure that that particular area, as well as across the street, which was previously fixed, is repaired as well.

1401
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:04,319
Excellent.

1402
01:48:05,077 --> 01:48:06,278
Mr. President, I'd also move for approval.

1403
01:48:06,298 --> 01:48:10,219
I'd request that the solicitor forward that information to the council when she receives it.

1404
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:10,740
Thank you.

1405
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,580
Councilor Longo-Kearns.

1406
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,142
I just want to go on record abstaining, a conflict of interest.

1407
01:48:15,582 --> 01:48:17,643
Councilor Longo-Kearns has a conflict of interest.

1408
01:48:18,423 --> 01:48:21,004
On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1409
01:48:21,865 --> 01:48:23,105
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1410
01:48:25,526 --> 01:48:26,367

1411
01:48:26,627 --> 01:48:26,867
Yes.

1412
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:28,147
Councilor Falco.

1413
01:48:28,188 --> 01:48:28,448
Yes.

1414
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:29,708
Councilor Knight.

1415
01:48:29,788 --> 01:48:30,108
Yes.

1416
01:48:30,809 --> 01:48:31,589
Councilor Longo-Kearns.

1417
01:48:32,650 --> 01:48:32,990
I abstain.

1418
01:48:39,015 --> 01:48:39,755
Vice president marks.

1419
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:40,356
Yes.

1420
01:48:43,418 --> 01:48:43,638
Yes.

1421
01:48:44,398 --> 01:48:46,320
Six in front of one abstention.

1422
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:47,400
Motion passes.

1423
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,081
Thank you very much.

1424
01:48:48,281 --> 01:48:48,621
Thank you.

1425
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:49,462
Mr. President.

1426
01:48:49,502 --> 01:48:50,322
Members of the council.

1427
01:48:51,803 --> 01:48:57,006
Motion by council to move back to regular business hearings.

1428
01:48:58,967 --> 01:49:01,029
One seven zero zero grants of location.

1429
01:49:01,049 --> 01:49:02,930
Memphis, Massachusetts city clerk's office.

1430
01:49:03,842 --> 01:49:14,464
You're here notified that by order of the Memphis City Council, public hearing will be given in Howard Alden-Murray Auditorium, 85 George B. Hester Drive, City Hall, Memphis, Massachusetts, seven o'clock p.m.

1431
01:49:14,504 --> 01:49:32,267

Governors, manholes, and other structures, fixtures, and... Motion by Council Light to waive the reading.

1433
01:49:42,086 --> 01:49:43,306
Is the applicant here this evening?

1434
01:49:45,928 --> 01:49:49,070
Those in favor, those opposed?

1435
01:49:50,931 --> 01:49:51,031
Yes.

1436
01:49:57,842 --> 01:49:58,823
Name and address of the record, please.

1437
01:49:59,423 --> 01:50:01,985
Matthew Carmody, National Grade 170, Medford Street, Malden.

1438
01:50:02,005 --> 01:50:03,166
Are you in favor of this project?

1439
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:03,386
Yes.

1440
01:50:03,807 --> 01:50:04,127
Thank you.

1441
01:50:06,929 --> 01:50:08,690
Do I hear anybody else in favor of this project?

1442
01:50:10,192 --> 01:50:12,373
Hearing and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

1443
01:50:13,754 --> 01:50:15,796
Is there anyone here in opposition of this project?

1444
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:20,900
Hearing and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

1445
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:23,102
Name and address of the record, please.

1446
01:50:23,882 --> 01:50:24,102
Again.

1447
01:50:24,603 --> 01:50:27,405
Matthew Carmody, National Grade 170, Medford Street, Malden.

1448
01:50:27,907 --> 01:50:29,708
You can give us a brief synopsis of the project, please.

1449
01:50:30,568 --> 01:50:36,812
Yes, we currently have a cast-iron main that goes up through a lot that's for a new waypoint building going up.

1450
01:50:37,212 --> 01:50:46,257
We need to relocate 52 feet of 4-inch down the street, about 100 feet to cross, so it goes into the easement for a new main to go up the side so they can do their construction safely.

1451
01:50:46,737 --> 01:50:49,959
And this is Winthrop Street up by Smith Lane, is that correct?

1452
01:50:50,419 --> 01:50:51,279
Correct.

1453
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:52,700
And how much of the street will you be digging up?

1454
01:50:53,721 --> 01:50:55,242
Well, part of the project is about 430 feet,

1455
01:50:56,553 --> 01:51:03,755
and that's worth remaining replacement on a leak prone pipe along with the association of 52 feet that would be crossing Winthrop street to the easement for the new main.

1456
01:51:06,395 --> 01:51:07,715
Counselor Della Russo.

1457
01:51:09,236 --> 01:51:17,838
Mr. President, first of all, I want to preface my remarks by saying I approved this project and support of it and I'm in support of it.

1458
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:23,359
However, I urge our friends from the utility company that they need to be

1459
01:51:24,438 --> 01:51:27,681
extra sensitive to the neighbors in that area.

1460
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:39,411
They've been under tremendous duress of recent times with construction, repaving, utility work in that vicinity, and it's created great stress and unease with them.

1461
01:51:39,951 --> 01:51:51,321
So it's essential that all efforts be made to prevent inconveniences to anybody who's there, whose houses may abut this digging.

1462
01:51:52,135 --> 01:52:06,105
We don't want to hold up construction at all, but at the same time, we want to preserve the tranquility of those who reside there and see to it that the street is returned to its pristine condition.

1463
01:52:07,326 --> 01:52:08,747
Thank you, Councilor Donovan.

1464
01:52:08,787 --> 01:52:09,647
Chairman Scarpelli.

1465
01:52:09,787 --> 01:52:14,090
If I can, the dates publicly for the project, when are you looking to start?

1466
01:52:15,171 --> 01:52:16,612
We're looking to start this upcoming Monday.

1467
01:52:17,232 --> 01:52:17,532
Monday.

1468
01:52:17,692 --> 01:52:17,872
Yes.

1469
01:52:18,373 --> 01:52:25,718
And the times of, uh, hours of work that would be under the direction of the engineering department from the city.

1470
01:52:26,138 --> 01:52:30,121
Uh, that has not been discussed yet, but we do a pre construction walk once it's be approved by yourself.

1471
01:52:30,141 --> 01:52:31,282
Okay.

1472
01:52:31,322 --> 01:52:37,626
Now, has anyone in the engineering department talked about the, uh, I believe that street's going to be,

1473
01:52:38,593 --> 01:52:41,014
dug up again in a few weeks, correct?

1474
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:42,295
Is it maybe a few months?

1475
01:52:42,615 --> 01:52:44,236
Yeah, coming down the line.

1476
01:52:44,416 --> 01:52:45,077
Is it three years?

1477
01:52:45,097 --> 01:52:45,997
Yeah, a year or two.

1478
01:52:46,017 --> 01:52:46,378
All right.

1479
01:52:46,398 --> 01:53:07,450
So again, I think just reiterating, just making sure that the sidewalk, you know, anything that's where people are walking, excuse me, the street, that it's put back where, and then revisited again in six months, making sure that there was no dippage or, you know, so any future holes later.

1480
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:09,030
Understood.

1481
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:09,490
Okay.

1482
01:53:10,111 --> 01:53:11,911
Um, everything else I see that's an order.

1483
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:13,192
So I move for approval.

1484
01:53:14,392 --> 01:53:14,953
Counselor Knight.

1485
01:53:15,553 --> 01:53:20,715
Um, Mr. President, uh, I am sure Mr. Carmody is familiar with the area in the neighborhood.

1486
01:53:21,515 --> 01:53:28,438
Um, and I'm sure he's also aware that we do have a public school in the vicinity of the location where they're going to be doing construction.

1487
01:53:28,978 --> 01:53:33,580
Um, it's my understanding as he just stated that the construction schedule will be up to the office of the city engineer.

1488
01:53:34,268 --> 01:53:41,675
Um, I'd ask the city engineering office by way of an amendment or a second paper, um, restrict the construction during the rush hour periods.

1489
01:53:41,976 --> 01:53:44,158
Um, when schools drop off in school, pickup is occurring.

1490
01:53:44,178 --> 01:53:44,618
Mr. President.

1491
01:53:45,179 --> 01:53:45,459
Thank you.

1492
01:53:45,499 --> 01:53:46,040
Counselor.

1493
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,201
Vice president marks.

1494
01:53:52,406 --> 01:53:53,207
Thank you, Mr. President.

1495
01:53:53,767 --> 01:53:56,450
Will there be any limitations for people using their driveways?

1496
01:53:57,658 --> 01:54:03,741
If there is anyone affected during the day for their driveways, our foreman on site will coordinate with them to let them know when they can go in and out.

1497
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:10,104
If not, we can also put a plate down for them to access their driveway, but only be for a day period, if anything, and they'd be notified prior.

1498
01:54:11,064 --> 01:54:12,725
So when will they receive notification?

1499
01:54:14,086 --> 01:54:14,826
48 hours in advance.

1500
01:54:15,506 --> 01:54:19,048
The new foreman will try to notify, leave a door hanger, knock on the door.

1501
01:54:19,788 --> 01:54:26,051
If they're going to be in front, we also post no parking signs in the location that we will be trenching for that day to let residents know.

1502
01:54:27,357 --> 01:54:30,760
And are there any expectations regarding the traffic flow?

1503
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:33,142
Are you going to have to close partial lane?

1504
01:54:33,242 --> 01:54:36,424
Or is there any consideration with that?

1505
01:54:37,205 --> 01:54:43,610
We should be able to keep two lanes of traffic flowing, since our new installation will be in the curb line closer to the side.

1506
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,451
So we won't have any issue keeping traffic flow.

1507
01:54:46,412 --> 01:54:49,794
As many details are needed will be directed by direction of the captain.

1508
01:54:49,915 --> 01:54:52,036
And whatever is needed for traffic flow, we certainly will do.

1509
01:54:52,557 --> 01:54:55,419
So you already have a detailed plan from the police department?

1510
01:54:56,172 --> 01:54:59,094
That is an onsite meeting that takes place of the start of the job.

1511
01:55:00,534 --> 01:55:00,975
Say that again.

1512
01:55:01,495 --> 01:55:11,160
The direction or the, how we traffic is set up is an onsite meeting that happens at the prior or at the start of the job because the beginning of the job is only verification holes, which is a very small portion of the roadway.

1513
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,662
They'll be taken up when trench before trenching begins.

1514
01:55:13,742 --> 01:55:14,562
It is under the direction.

1515
01:55:14,582 --> 01:55:17,384
So prior to Monday, cause you said Monday, the construction is going to start.

1516
01:55:18,044 --> 01:55:23,207
Once this is approved, then we can move forward with anything that needs to be done prior to construction, but we need an approval from the council first.

1517
01:55:23,735 --> 01:55:30,017
Right, but that traffic impact of mitigation will take place prior to the start date.

1518
01:55:30,597 --> 01:55:30,797
Yes.

1519
01:55:30,977 --> 01:55:31,297
Thank you.

1520
01:55:32,598 --> 01:55:32,918
Thank you.

1521
01:55:32,978 --> 01:55:37,439
Councilor Knight, when the streets resurfaced, who's responsible for the striping?

1522
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:43,901
We normally are responsible for the striping unless the city has future plans.

1523
01:55:44,301 --> 01:55:49,442
You are, whether there is a bike lane that's been along Winthrop Street in that vicinity?

1524
01:55:49,842 --> 01:55:50,023
Yes.

1525
01:55:50,183 --> 01:55:51,463
Okay, thank you very much.

1526
01:55:52,463 --> 01:55:52,783
Thank you.

1527
01:55:53,043 --> 01:55:57,185
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, as seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1528
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:58,046
All those in favor?

1529
01:55:58,066 --> 01:55:58,126
Aye.

1530
01:55:58,886 --> 01:55:59,686
All those opposed?

1531
01:56:01,067 --> 01:56:01,847
Motion passes.

1532
01:56:02,168 --> 01:56:02,848
Thank you very much.

1533
01:56:03,028 --> 01:56:03,368
Thank you.

1534
01:56:05,629 --> 01:56:08,731
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1535
01:56:08,751 --> 01:56:21,037
17303, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW Commissioner provide the Council with the schedule for crosswalk and roadway re-striping.

1536
01:56:21,137 --> 01:56:21,737
Councilor Knight.

1537
01:56:22,657 --> 01:56:25,338
Mr. President, I put this forward two weeks ago.

1538
01:56:25,358 --> 01:56:29,799
I guess it was wishful thinking, then the snow came, and here we are.

1539
01:56:29,839 --> 01:56:30,579
It's not spring yet.

1540
01:56:31,379 --> 01:56:38,621
However, I'm just wondering when the DPW is going to go out and begin restriping our crosswalks and our streets.

1541
01:56:38,701 --> 01:56:48,684
We have some faded paint out there that is annually in the need of repair and replacement, and I would like the DPW commissioner to provide us with a schedule as to when that is going to occur.

1542
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:50,464
I'd ask my council colleagues to

1543
01:56:50,874 --> 01:56:53,856
join me in supporting this resolution and move for approval.

1544
01:56:55,256 --> 01:56:55,516
Thank you.

1545
01:56:55,536 --> 01:56:55,877
Counselor.

1546
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:56,657
Counselor Scott Pelley.

1547
01:56:57,277 --> 01:57:06,902
If I can just add onto that, I know that it might be, I know that, uh, Mr. Karen's did respond to us about Evans street, but didn't respond back on Paris street.

1548
01:57:07,382 --> 01:57:14,306
So if you can just, uh, if you could just reach back, uh, come back to us with a response on the repaving of Paris street.

1549
01:57:14,326 --> 01:57:15,006
Thank you.

1550
01:57:15,867 --> 01:57:16,127
Thank you.

1551
01:57:16,147 --> 01:57:16,547
Counselor.

1552
01:57:17,067 --> 01:57:17,348
Counselor.

1553
01:57:17,368 --> 01:57:18,088
President Caviello.

1554
01:57:18,482 --> 01:57:19,203
Thank you, Mr. President.

1555
01:57:19,223 --> 01:57:25,090
Mr. President, I know this is a topic of yours with the thermoplastic painting.

1556
01:57:25,931 --> 01:57:29,274
During this year's MMA show, I went there.

1557
01:57:29,314 --> 01:57:34,140
I had an opportunity to meet with the company that does the thermoplastic painting.

1558
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:40,059
and I met with some other city officials who have done the thermoplastic painting.

1559
01:57:41,140 --> 01:57:59,167
Not on all the lines or anything, but they have at least done the crosswalks at different schools and different places, and they said that the thermoplastic lasts five to six years, and it's been a win for them, and I'd like to see us do that again this year.

1560
01:57:59,407 --> 01:58:01,488
I know you've championed this for many years,

1561
01:58:01,915 --> 01:58:04,176
But again, I think it's something that it should be done.

1562
01:58:04,516 --> 01:58:08,437
The company even said they would come down here and do one for free to show us how it would work.

1563
01:58:08,978 --> 01:58:10,298
And I think we should take them up on it.

1564
01:58:11,238 --> 01:58:14,740
And I say at least they do the crosswalks at the schools and different things like that.

1565
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,260
You don't have to do the whole city with them.

1566
01:58:17,681 --> 01:58:18,981
And I would like to amend that.

1567
01:58:22,483 --> 01:58:26,064
As amended on the motion, if I just could add, Councilor.

1568
01:58:26,606 --> 01:58:28,047
President Caviello is absolutely correct.

1569
01:58:28,067 --> 01:58:39,274
The thermoplastic crosswalks are highly reflective, they're slip resistant, they have a life expectancy of four to five years, and they're cost effective in the long run.

1570
01:58:39,374 --> 01:58:39,575
You know.

1571
01:58:39,595 --> 01:58:40,575
Bill O'Reilly said six years.

1572
01:58:40,615 --> 01:58:41,356
They've gotten out of this.

1573
01:58:41,376 --> 01:58:41,816
Six years.

1574
01:58:42,657 --> 01:58:45,999
The state uses them for the state highway and many of their projects.

1575
01:58:46,459 --> 01:58:52,183
So it's a very effective and efficient way of laying down a painted crosswalk.

1576
01:58:52,557 --> 01:58:54,559
without the upkeep year to year of repainting.

1577
01:58:55,199 --> 01:59:06,088
So on the motion by Councilor Del Rosso for approval as amended by Councilor Scott Pelley, as further amended by Council President Caviello.

1578
01:59:06,248 --> 01:59:06,788
All in favor?

1579
01:59:07,288 --> 01:59:07,409
Aye.

1580
01:59:07,669 --> 01:59:08,089
Opposed?

1581
01:59:08,589 --> 01:59:09,210
The ayes have it.

1582
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:10,711
The motion is adopted.

1583
01:59:10,731 --> 01:59:13,874
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1584
01:59:13,894 --> 01:59:13,914
17-304.

1585
01:59:21,082 --> 01:59:32,671
Offered by Councilor Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests an opinion as to if we can vote to change our zoning one section or even one street at a time.

1586
01:59:32,731 --> 01:59:33,792
Councilor Lungo Kern.

1587
01:59:34,493 --> 01:59:36,534
Thank you, President Carviello.

1588
01:59:37,155 --> 01:59:46,322
This is something that a number of residents and I have been discussing along with, I believe, a few other prior councilors and

1589
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:52,455
something that this council is beginning to discuss and have meetings on in subcommittee.

1590
01:59:54,056 --> 02:00:10,891
After doing some research with regards to how Somerville is handling their zoning changes, I read a few articles on it, and it sounds like they started their process about two years ago, and the last I read sometime this fall, they were still working on it.

1591
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:13,520
They're actively working on it.

1592
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,122
They've had community meetings.

1593
02:00:15,162 --> 02:00:16,863
They've had subcommittee meetings.

1594
02:00:16,883 --> 02:00:21,067
They've created a committee to review their zoning in its entirety.

1595
02:00:21,087 --> 02:00:23,989
It seems like they're doing it extensively.

1596
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:39,062
Obviously, it's been brought up before that we should reach out to, I forget the gentleman's name, but reach out to the person from Somerville who is overseeing this project and get some ideas on how we can do it.

1597
02:00:39,524 --> 02:01:01,142
But in the meantime, we have a situation where a number of huge developments have gone up, a number of highly dense residential dwellings have gone up, whether it be Luminaire, we have one coming up on Middlesex Ave, and obviously a couple of controversial properties that have come down the line and have created controversy, I should say.

1598
02:01:01,162 --> 02:01:08,808
And it seems like the public and the public that have been reaching out to me and that I've been reading

1599
02:01:09,385 --> 02:01:16,831
discussing these issues are interested in developing, they're interested in not seeing empty storefronts.

1600
02:01:17,392 --> 02:01:30,363
Our residents are interested in redeveloping to a point where it's beneficial for the city and beneficial, how I should say it, beneficial for the neighborhood in a way that complements the neighborhood.

1601
02:01:31,024 --> 02:01:37,089
And what we're seeing with regards to, especially in the past, the number of variances that have been allowed

1602
02:01:37,597 --> 02:01:50,043
We're seeing a need for zoning change in this community, and we're seeing it, we're in need of it far prior to how long it would take this city council to review it in its entirety.

1603
02:01:50,403 --> 02:02:07,071
So my question, and I haven't reviewed any acts, and I know Councilor Knight just mentioned an act, so he can bring that up, but I'm looking for an opinion, whether that be from our city solicitor or reaching out to Somerville, some way to find out if we, as a city council, can review

1604
02:02:07,733 --> 02:02:11,955
whether it be a section of the city at a time, a street at a time.

1605
02:02:12,395 --> 02:02:19,179
We know of developers who are very interested in developing in certain areas, and we want to make sure that we protect our neighborhoods.

1606
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:22,060
And you've seen that at the last few zoning meetings.

1607
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:37,068
The public have been forced to have to come to the table and bring their concerns and questions and downright just opposition to certain projects, which is unfortunate.

1608
02:02:37,737 --> 02:02:45,478
You know, it does, whether or not zoning is going to be the solve-all, I don't think so, because we do still have the process of variances.

1609
02:02:45,538 --> 02:02:53,240
But with the new board and with proper zoning changes, I think we can make this a better process, and I think we can protect our neighborhoods.

1610
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:56,880
So my question to our city solicitor would be, can we do this?

1611
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:03,721
Can we sit down as a committee of the whole and discuss, I think, the latest project, Salem Street, for example?

1612
02:03:03,801 --> 02:03:07,002
Somebody else has mentioned Fountain Street is zoned apartment one.

1613
02:03:08,227 --> 02:03:15,629
Can we take an individual section of our city and say, OK, what is zone where, and this is the problem?

1614
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:19,531
And then call that street or section in for a meeting.

1615
02:03:19,591 --> 02:03:29,413
I mean, ask the public to weigh in on what do you want to see in your residential neighborhood or your business districts that are right outside your residential neighborhood?

1616
02:03:29,453 --> 02:03:31,434
Because it seems like the administration is

1617
02:03:31,824 --> 02:03:41,810
pushing for housing, housing, housing everywhere, which is not great for our infrastructure, our schools, our traffic, our parking problems that we have on so many different levels.

1618
02:03:42,331 --> 02:03:48,694
And what I'm hearing from the people is we don't want to turn into Somerville, Cambridge, or Boston, these chairlifts we're talking about.

1619
02:03:48,734 --> 02:03:50,055
We don't want to turn into Boston.

1620
02:03:50,095 --> 02:03:59,301
We have more single-family districts or single-double-family districts in Medford than Cambridge and Somerville have, and people do not want

1621
02:03:59,718 --> 02:04:03,859
to see us turn into Boston, and nor do I. Our schools can't handle it.

1622
02:04:04,679 --> 02:04:08,860
Our streets, sidewalks, infrastructure, parking, traffic cannot handle it.

1623
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:11,880
And I think zoning is something that we need to discuss.

1624
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:15,681
Obviously, I have a long-term plan, but we need to discuss it.

1625
02:04:16,141 --> 02:04:21,822
If we can do it in a quicker fashion, I think we need to at least explore that option.

1626
02:04:21,882 --> 02:04:28,123
And this is one way that I think it could be possible, and I'm hoping that we get a positive result from it.

1627
02:04:28,467 --> 02:04:36,974
And we can take those sections of our city that are plugged hotspots for developers and really figure out what's best for our neighborhoods.

1628
02:04:37,554 --> 02:04:38,235
Thank you very much.

1629
02:04:38,415 --> 02:04:38,996
Councilor Knight.

1630
02:04:39,616 --> 02:04:41,818
Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the resolution.

1631
02:04:41,898 --> 02:04:45,581
I feel as though getting an opinion from the solicitor is a great start for this conversation.

1632
02:04:46,061 --> 02:04:52,747
I also think it's very important for the council as we move forward to consider the impact that zoning has on our tax rate.

1633
02:04:53,837 --> 02:05:06,460
Because we have a bifurcated tax rate, we have the ability to equitably shift the residential property tax burden from the residential properties to the industrial and commercially zoned properties.

1634
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:11,861
And now we're seeing a lot of use variances where they're going to try and eliminate these commercial and industrial properties.

1635
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:20,903
And it's very important that we maintain a good stock of commercial and industrial properties so that we do have the ability to provide residential property tax relief, Mr. President.

1636
02:05:20,924 --> 02:05:23,004
So moving forward, I think that's a very important aspect

1637
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:25,390
um, of zoning here in the community.

1638
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:27,611
Um, council Longo Kerm is absolutely right.

1639
02:05:27,811 --> 02:05:40,896
Um, you know, when we go back and we think five, six and seven years ago when, um, the website, the real estate website, Reddit found Medford, um, the first thing that they said was unbelievable tracks of open space and natural resources and a large stock of single family homes.

1640
02:05:41,296 --> 02:05:48,899
And as we begin to develop and grow here in Medford, we're moving away from our large stock of single family homes and we're moving into high density apartments, Mr. President.

1641
02:05:49,319 --> 02:05:50,900
And in some areas of the city, that's okay.

1642
02:05:51,588 --> 02:05:52,769
And in some places, that's good.

1643
02:05:52,789 --> 02:06:01,575
And the mixed-use growth, I think, is an excellent opportunity for us to pursue an equitable shift between the commercial, industrial, and residential tax properties and the burdens that are provided to the residents.

1644
02:06:01,895 --> 02:06:03,976
But going forward, there are a number of issues that we need to look at.

1645
02:06:03,996 --> 02:06:12,101
And I think that one of them would be maintaining a good balance of commercial and industrial zone properties, as well as increasing our stock of affordable housing.

1646
02:06:12,442 --> 02:06:19,006
Because as our real estate market begins to thrive, the people that have lived in this community for so long and made Medford such a great place to live are being displaced.

1647
02:06:19,302 --> 02:06:20,302
and they have no place to go.

1648
02:06:20,403 --> 02:06:23,604
So they're actually getting forced out of Medford because they can no longer afford to live here.

1649
02:06:24,004 --> 02:06:30,127
And our stock of affordable housing is so low at this point in time, Mr. President, there's really no other option for them but to leave the community that they helped make great.

1650
02:06:30,587 --> 02:06:33,930
So, um, I want to thank council Longo, uh, current for bringing this matter forward.

1651
02:06:33,950 --> 02:06:37,874
I support it wholeheartedly and I would, um, anxiously await the solicitor's opinion.

1652
02:06:38,014 --> 02:06:38,374
Thank you.

1653
02:06:38,915 --> 02:06:39,355
Good motion.

1654
02:06:39,375 --> 02:06:42,959
You both are 100% correct on the motion by council logo.

1655
02:06:42,999 --> 02:06:45,201
Current seconded by council night.

1656
02:06:45,902 --> 02:06:47,163
Name and address for the record, please.

1657
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:48,684
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1658
02:06:48,724 --> 02:06:51,367
I live at 281 park street and, um,

1659
02:06:52,805 --> 02:06:58,986
I'm pretty happy to see that this is coming up because I've spoken here countless times about that we need to follow zoning.

1660
02:06:59,426 --> 02:07:05,127
But the second part of that is that we also need to look at the zoning that we currently have and see if that zoning is working for us.

1661
02:07:06,148 --> 02:07:15,069
I pulled out a zoning map of Medford today and I looked around my neighborhood and I saw that all of Salem Street and pretty much every street from Fulton Street to 93 was zoned apartment 1.

1662
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:28,938
And as I drove here and took ten minutes to drive from park street to city hall, which is pretty crazy because it's four blocks, all the traffic, I thought, can we really handle that many apartment buildings?

1663
02:07:30,438 --> 02:07:39,203
on Salem Street, in that area, with traffic, with the school that's the largest elementary school in the city, and overcrowded?

1664
02:07:39,243 --> 02:07:39,903
No, we can't.

1665
02:07:39,983 --> 02:07:41,664
So we really need to move forward.

1666
02:07:41,704 --> 02:07:45,746
I know that there is calls for hiring consultants, but that can take a lot of time.

1667
02:07:46,266 --> 02:07:52,210
Anyone who attended the zoning meeting on the Salem Street project said, well, you know, one apartment building isn't going to do it.

1668
02:07:52,290 --> 02:07:57,833
But they did have a stack of support letters from people that owned property on Salem Street.

1669
02:07:58,873 --> 02:08:03,075
that would probably be the next buildings that come up and want to add apartment buildings.

1670
02:08:03,135 --> 02:08:06,996
So that could be six more buildings in the next year or two, 10 more buildings.

1671
02:08:07,056 --> 02:08:10,818
Then we'd swing around down Fountain Street and add another 10 or 15 or 20 buildings.

1672
02:08:11,238 --> 02:08:13,459
And we would cripple that entire side of the city.

1673
02:08:13,739 --> 02:08:15,060
We would change the dynamic.

1674
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:19,141
My parents have lived in that neighborhood for more than 15 years.

1675
02:08:19,221 --> 02:08:21,502
It's a heavy owner-occupied neighborhood.

1676
02:08:21,582 --> 02:08:25,424
I live on another side that's also heavily owner-occupied.

1677
02:08:25,824 --> 02:08:28,245
More than 80% of Medford is owner-occupied.

1678
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:35,825
Shifting to more buildings where people are not coming out and talking to their neighbours is really not what Medford is about.

1679
02:08:36,186 --> 02:08:42,412
And we really need to be cognizant of whether our quality of life is more important than just adding more buildings.

1680
02:08:42,732 --> 02:08:46,236
Because when you add more buildings, they don't just drop tax money off at the city.

1681
02:08:46,596 --> 02:08:48,178
They come with infrastructure needs.

1682
02:08:48,218 --> 02:08:49,279
They come with costs.

1683
02:08:49,769 --> 02:08:53,412
And do those costs exceed the tax money that we get?

1684
02:08:53,452 --> 02:08:56,855
Because I know it looks great when it said, look, we got this much more tax money this year.

1685
02:08:57,295 --> 02:09:03,360
But we really have to factor in our infrastructure costs as we see that we're short police and we're short fire.

1686
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:16,910
And I don't believe that these additional tax revenues that we're getting from the Lumiere's or the, I don't even want to say, but the Locust Street, that hopefully will never happen, will not exceed the costs that they will add to our city.

1687
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,712
They'll diminish our quality of life.

1688
02:09:19,334 --> 02:09:20,755
And we really need to think about that.

1689
02:09:21,255 --> 02:09:21,615
Thank you.

1690
02:09:21,775 --> 02:09:22,115
Thank you.

1691
02:09:22,135 --> 02:09:26,397
Name and address of the record, please.

1692
02:09:26,698 --> 02:09:28,458
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1693
02:09:29,219 --> 02:09:46,407
Um, uh, point to counselor, um, night, uh, the being able to balance zoning is an incredible, incredibly important, uh, thing for a city to do because of the actual tax base and having to be able to, or actually just being able to,

1694
02:09:46,914 --> 02:09:57,798
increase the commercial tax base so you can actually either balance or decrease the residential tax base is an amazing prospect for the residents of Medford.

1695
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:01,420
And I think any resident in Medford would be more than happy to accept

1696
02:10:01,977 --> 02:10:08,121
that kind of a balance or that shift in being able to kind of offset the burden.

1697
02:10:08,502 --> 02:10:26,154
Secondly, being an old retailer, there is a major, major shift for shoppers to get out of the malls and get into neighborhoods, back into neighborhoods, back into what they call fabricated cities, as you see in Somerville and in Wellington.

1698
02:10:27,152 --> 02:10:29,694
you know, up in, there's so many different places.

1699
02:10:30,175 --> 02:10:32,436
So you really have to look at what we have.

1700
02:10:33,177 --> 02:10:39,943
We have such great opportunity downtown and maybe reworking some of these zones to actually structure a future for that.

1701
02:10:40,523 --> 02:10:45,307
This would be an excellent downtown for something like that.

1702
02:10:46,092 --> 02:11:04,762
To be able to take advantage of the .75 tax, sales tax that you could take advantage of with additional restaurants and the hotel tax with the new hotel that's coming, you're really going to position yourself to be able to go back to what we said earlier, which is plan for much bigger projects and better ideas.

1703
02:11:05,502 --> 02:11:12,626
But you have to have the vision to understand that, and you have to kind of try to fight your way towards that, because I'll tell you, you've got a waterway.

1704
02:11:12,886 --> 02:11:13,587
Most cities don't.

1705
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:18,515
You've got such a proximity to Boston that most cities don't.

1706
02:11:18,855 --> 02:11:28,879
You've got so many things working for us and in our favor that if we don't look at this and don't look at the rezoning, it's a missed opportunity for everyone.

1707
02:11:29,419 --> 02:11:31,780
And I'm telling you right now, that's the opportunity to gain.

1708
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:38,642
That's the opportunity to look at, because that is where most people are gravitating towards when it comes to shopping.

1709
02:11:39,083 --> 02:11:40,403
And they want that lifestyle.

1710
02:11:40,443 --> 02:11:42,224
They want that hometown feel again.

1711
02:11:42,864 --> 02:11:47,527
And I'm lucky enough to do business in a city like that, and that city does get it.

1712
02:11:48,027 --> 02:11:58,653
And I can tell you, the residents of that city, their tax burden year after year after year is constantly offset by people like myself and some other friends that do business in that city as well.

1713
02:11:58,693 --> 02:11:59,994
And it's a great, great thing.

1714
02:12:00,074 --> 02:12:00,874
So thank you.

1715
02:12:01,134 --> 02:12:01,474
Thank you.

1716
02:12:01,755 --> 02:12:02,515
Councillor Falco.

1717
02:12:03,616 --> 02:12:03,976
I yield.

1718
02:12:04,916 --> 02:12:06,777
Councillor Falco yields to the podium.

1719
02:12:07,117 --> 02:12:08,158
Name and address of the record, please.

1720
02:12:08,338 --> 02:12:08,718
Thank you.

1721
02:12:08,798 --> 02:12:09,839
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Power Street.

1722
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:19,557
I think it's no secret that I am extremely passionate about both Medford and its development.

1723
02:12:20,839 --> 02:12:25,483
I am totally heartened to see this come before the council.

1724
02:12:26,224 --> 02:12:31,189
I think it is one of the most critical responsibilities that the city council holds.

1725
02:12:32,170 --> 02:12:35,733
Residents of this city make a social contract when we purchase here.

1726
02:12:36,991 --> 02:12:43,535
where we purchase will stay similar, not the same, but similar to where we buy.

1727
02:12:43,555 --> 02:12:53,322
And I think that we are in some ways under attack from developers around us that are starting to come in and cannibalize us.

1728
02:12:54,203 --> 02:12:59,146
I'm concerned for people who've made the decision to age in place here in Medford.

1729
02:13:01,481 --> 02:13:07,050
historically have people come and stay for generations, and that is with thought, not by accident.

1730
02:13:08,853 --> 02:13:15,464
And I feel that if we're not careful, those families are going to be pushed out, and Medford will be gentrified.

1731
02:13:15,885 --> 02:13:19,327
just as Somerville has been gentrified and Cambridge before it.

1732
02:13:20,267 --> 02:13:23,189
I think Medford is in an enviable position.

1733
02:13:23,389 --> 02:13:27,471
When you look at the surrounding cities, they don't have the green spaces that we have.

1734
02:13:27,611 --> 02:13:34,655
When you look at their green maps, their teeny dots across the city, little islands, Medford has whole

1735
02:13:35,188 --> 02:13:37,429
areas where we don't have development.

1736
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:42,752
And I think we have an opportunity to be very purposeful about what we do.

1737
02:13:43,233 --> 02:13:48,455
I always liken Medford to a diamond in the rough, because I do believe that.

1738
02:13:49,136 --> 02:13:53,958
If you know a jeweler, they won't cleave a diamond until they're sure of what they're doing.

1739
02:13:54,118 --> 02:14:01,523
And Medford has areas that are ripe for development, but it should be development that we deem necessary.

1740
02:14:02,003 --> 02:14:03,203
And so I would encourage

1741
02:14:04,224 --> 02:14:06,505
this council to continue to move forward.

1742
02:14:07,325 --> 02:14:15,089
And I would put forth for your consideration that we have a great deal of subject matter expertise within our city limits.

1743
02:14:15,189 --> 02:14:20,451
There are many people who are very passionate about this specific topic and have good visions.

1744
02:14:20,511 --> 02:14:21,732
I've talked with some of them.

1745
02:14:22,252 --> 02:14:23,573
I've heard of some of them.

1746
02:14:23,753 --> 02:14:33,617
And I think that we have committees for Walk Medford, Bike Medford, the arts, but we do not have a citizen representation.

1747
02:14:34,275 --> 02:14:38,277
for development, which is the critical thing for our city.

1748
02:14:38,737 --> 02:14:49,961
And I really think that that's one thing that's lacking because a good and meaningful committee or coalition of Medford residents with some subject matter expertise can help you in that.

1749
02:14:50,842 --> 02:14:55,143
You know, it's a big undertaking, but I'm glad to see it.

1750
02:14:55,643 --> 02:14:59,445
And again, I would stress that in my mind and in my opinion,

1751
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:20,154
It is one of the most crucial things, crucial contracts that you have between your constituents that you're going to look to protect the interest of the Medford residents, recognizing that developers coming in are buying and they're property owners, but they're not the same type of property owners that are going to be here and stay here.

1752
02:15:21,857 --> 02:15:25,078
turn the property around and make their profit and usually leave.

1753
02:15:25,138 --> 02:15:26,859
So I'm very encouraged to see it.

1754
02:15:26,899 --> 02:15:31,481
I appreciate the positive thoughts and I hope that we continue in this forward movement.

1755
02:15:31,801 --> 02:15:32,382
Thanks, guys.

1756
02:15:33,482 --> 02:15:34,022
Councilor Falco.

1757
02:15:34,843 --> 02:15:35,483
I yield as well.

1758
02:15:35,503 --> 02:15:38,664
Councilor Falco yields to gentleman from East Medford.

1759
02:15:41,546 --> 02:15:42,726
Thank you, Council President.

1760
02:15:43,446 --> 02:15:44,487
Name and address of the record, please.

1761
02:15:44,567 --> 02:15:46,748
Andrew Castanetti, Medford.

1762
02:15:48,549 --> 02:15:51,570
Good development, I believe, most of the time is very good.

1763
02:15:53,328 --> 02:15:56,550
It's just that, how was this now?

1764
02:15:56,650 --> 02:15:59,292
How was I gonna present this?

1765
02:16:00,493 --> 02:16:07,318
Especially if it's mixed use, a la station landing, because that's how the Roman Empire did business way back.

1766
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:15,063
If you lived here, if you worked here, you could eat downstairs, you didn't even need a bicycle, for God's sakes.

1767
02:16:15,844 --> 02:16:16,424
And the T's there.

1768
02:16:16,544 --> 02:16:20,067
It'd be nice to have one in Method Square someday also.

1769
02:16:20,747 --> 02:16:21,988
Might as well get that in there again.

1770
02:16:23,692 --> 02:16:42,968
Uh, council president, however, when the new growth, that's the new real estate taxes from these brand new developments that grow out of ground are not applied to offset the prop two and a half increases.

1771
02:16:44,349 --> 02:16:49,053
This new growth doesn't help the taxpayer at all.

1772
02:16:49,877 --> 02:16:50,998
that pays real estate taxes.

1773
02:16:51,418 --> 02:17:02,448
It hurts us because we have to get more schools, more teachers, more police, more fire, infrastructure.

1774
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:06,952
So I don't see how it helps us.

1775
02:17:07,452 --> 02:17:14,759
As a matter of fact, it hurts us because the following year to the $100 million tax levy, they add

1776
02:17:15,642 --> 02:17:23,664
The new growth, the 1.7 million, and then the prop 2.5, another 2.5 million on top, then they take 2.5% of that greater number.

1777
02:17:24,644 --> 02:17:35,986
Again, it's like the Russian lady used to say here 15, 20 years ago, it's like a annuity that keeps on giving, but at the cost of the real estate taxpayers here.

1778
02:17:39,887 --> 02:17:45,168
I'd like to see the city to be a hopping place, because the location is strategic, it's probably the best

1779
02:17:45,595 --> 02:17:48,416
and all of Massachusetts, proximity to Boston.

1780
02:17:48,876 --> 02:17:49,896
There's a lot of open space.

1781
02:17:49,956 --> 02:17:57,757
We're being jammed in in East Medford, and I'm not sure maybe we should secede from the city.

1782
02:18:00,358 --> 02:18:01,818
It's a capital idea, possibly.

1783
02:18:01,898 --> 02:18:03,418
Councilor Marks, you lived it yourself.

1784
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:08,159
West Method can stay with Winchester, with your own zip code, by the way.

1785
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:13,380
Well, that's okay, because who's gonna pay for their services, the squeaky wheels?

1786
02:18:14,147 --> 02:18:15,567
The salt won't be able to pay anymore.

1787
02:18:15,587 --> 02:18:16,968
That's what Memphis sees.

1788
02:18:17,268 --> 02:18:17,648
Good luck.

1789
02:18:18,308 --> 02:18:22,350
You got all the money, but we have the territory.

1790
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:29,892
From Route 93 all the way to Felsway, this is like Donald Trump land, very valuable.

1791
02:18:30,352 --> 02:18:34,173
If you ever have one of the two fires Chelsea ever had, hang on to your land.

1792
02:18:35,394 --> 02:18:36,294
I like new growth.

1793
02:18:37,454 --> 02:18:39,275
But if you don't use the real estate taxes,

1794
02:18:40,276 --> 02:18:52,547
And by the way, who says you have to raise real estate taxes $1 or actually $2.5 million at 2.5% of last year's $100 million levy?

1795
02:18:53,668 --> 02:18:55,190
Is there a law that says you have to?

1796
02:18:56,611 --> 02:18:57,772
Thank you, Councilor Briana.

1797
02:18:58,733 --> 02:18:59,534
I knew I liked you.

1798
02:19:00,154 --> 02:19:00,995
Thank you for listening.

1799
02:19:01,635 --> 02:19:01,976
Thank you.

1800
02:19:02,056 --> 02:19:02,596
Councilor Falco.

1801
02:19:03,117 --> 02:19:05,479
Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Councilor

1802
02:19:06,133 --> 02:19:08,054
Longo Kern for bringing this forward tonight.

1803
02:19:08,614 --> 02:19:10,274
I fully support the resolution.

1804
02:19:10,294 --> 02:19:18,557
I have been pretty vocal about zoning since I've been on this council, and I made a resolution a year ago.

1805
02:19:19,377 --> 02:19:30,781
The resolution's still in subcommittee, but I still firmly believe that we need to hire someone from the outside to come in and look at zoning in every neighborhood throughout this city.

1806
02:19:32,301 --> 02:19:33,802
I understand going street by street,

1807
02:19:34,307 --> 02:19:36,407
But every neighborhood needs to be looked at.

1808
02:19:38,068 --> 02:19:43,589
It probably is the most important responsibility that we have, zoning, as a board.

1809
02:19:43,629 --> 02:19:46,130
That is one of our most important responsibilities.

1810
02:19:46,150 --> 02:19:47,170
This needs to be looked at.

1811
02:19:47,190 --> 02:19:49,190
It needs to be looked at sooner than later.

1812
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:52,391
I firmly believe that we need to bring in someone from the outside.

1813
02:19:52,431 --> 02:19:52,971
I'll say it again.

1814
02:19:53,231 --> 02:19:57,212
There's no one behind this reel that is qualified to look at zoning.

1815
02:19:58,632 --> 02:20:00,113
I think we need an expert opinion on this.

1816
02:20:00,133 --> 02:20:01,473
You talk about balanced zoning.

1817
02:20:02,063 --> 02:20:06,505
I mean, you talk about, uh, you know, different neighborhoods, you know, residential versus commercial.

1818
02:20:07,085 --> 02:20:13,527
I mean, you know, the changes that are made or the lack of changes that are made really affect and impact the fabric of each neighborhood.

1819
02:20:14,287 --> 02:20:15,788
So, um, I want to just go on record.

1820
02:20:15,828 --> 02:20:23,110
I do support this, but I also do think that we need to meet, uh, to address this and to bring in someone from the outside to look at this even further.

1821
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:23,630
Thank you.

1822
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:24,651
Thank you.

1823
02:20:26,311 --> 02:20:27,392
Councilor Scott Pelli.

1824
02:20:27,892 --> 02:20:28,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

1825
02:20:29,152 --> 02:20:31,313
Um, I too, um, have,

1826
02:20:32,427 --> 02:20:36,770
have pushed for different avenues to oversee and review our zoning.

1827
02:20:37,331 --> 02:20:57,625
And I'll say it again, I think the mayor mentioned it at her State of the City and reaching out to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and getting their immediate sit down and set a plan with the city and the stakeholders to make sure that we could do what's right for our community and our vision.

1828
02:20:57,945 --> 02:21:01,528
As Mr. McKillop said, Medford is the jewel, it's our term.

1829
02:21:02,175 --> 02:21:10,501
You know, we have the Chevalier, we have the Mystic, we have the Fells, 93, Mystic Ave.

1830
02:21:10,661 --> 02:21:14,603
There's so much to plan in those areas.

1831
02:21:14,663 --> 02:21:21,128
So again, if we can put an amendment, I appreciate Councilwoman Kern for putting this in.

1832
02:21:22,188 --> 02:21:37,742
reaching out to the mayor and asking them, reaching out again to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to set a plan in reviewing what we need, how we need to even start our process in zoning because things are happening so fast, it's going too fast.

1833
02:21:37,822 --> 02:21:45,188
And we need to slow it down so we can all share our vision and what we think Medford should be and will be in years to come.

1834
02:21:45,248 --> 02:21:46,229
So thank you.

1835
02:21:48,131 --> 02:21:48,531
Thank you.

1836
02:21:48,871 --> 02:21:49,452
Councilor Naife.

1837
02:21:50,195 --> 02:21:51,576
Approval on the paper, Mr. President.

1838
02:21:52,216 --> 02:21:57,379
On the motion by Councilor Lungo Kern as amended and seconded by Councilor Knight.

1839
02:21:58,420 --> 02:21:59,201
All those in favor?

1840
02:21:59,221 --> 02:21:59,301
Aye.

1841
02:22:00,701 --> 02:22:01,582
Motion passes.

1842
02:22:03,023 --> 02:22:04,224
Motion to suspend the rules.

1843
02:22:10,347 --> 02:22:12,068
We just had a discussion about zoning.

1844
02:22:12,269 --> 02:22:16,591
As I look at the agenda, Mr. President, we have a petition on a similar matter, 17307.

1845
02:22:20,218 --> 02:22:28,443
petition by miss Rodriguez who was just up here speaking and why don't I think it might be in a best course to continue the discussion on zoning if we have two papers that are similar in nature.

1846
02:22:28,483 --> 02:22:36,688
Name and address of the record please.

1847
02:22:37,388 --> 02:22:39,869
If you don't want to do it now we can come, you can come back if you're not prepared.

1848
02:22:40,029 --> 02:22:41,050
No, that's totally fine.

1849
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:41,730
I can do it now.

1850
02:22:42,531 --> 02:22:44,572
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street.

1851
02:22:46,507 --> 02:22:51,091
And yes, I tried not to say exactly what I was going to say about the petition when I came up earlier.

1852
02:22:51,151 --> 02:22:53,733
But before I begin, a couple of things.

1853
02:22:53,793 --> 02:23:02,300
I noticed that Councilor Falco wants to slow down and wait for a consultant.

1854
02:23:03,902 --> 02:23:06,284
No, actually, Councilor Scarpelli slowed slow down.

1855
02:23:06,344 --> 02:23:08,626
You said to get a consultant.

1856
02:23:09,266 --> 02:23:12,269
And Councilor Scarpelli said to slow down and get the mayor's opinion.

1857
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:14,231
Unfortunately, that doesn't help me.

1858
02:23:15,527 --> 02:23:16,347
I thought I wrote it down.

1859
02:23:16,367 --> 02:23:17,187
It's an exact quote.

1860
02:23:17,547 --> 02:23:19,788
I did not say I get the mayor's opinion.

1861
02:23:20,128 --> 02:23:30,050
I said the mayor mentioned at a state of the city that we would reach out to the metropolitan area planning council to get them involved, to start dialogue, to get us moving for zoning in our community.

1862
02:23:30,090 --> 02:23:30,770
That's what I said.

1863
02:23:30,970 --> 02:23:32,971
You didn't say to get the administration's opinion.

1864
02:23:33,131 --> 02:23:33,831
Can we roll the tape?

1865
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:34,411
Absolutely not.

1866
02:23:34,571 --> 02:23:35,051
I wrote it down.

1867
02:23:35,131 --> 02:23:35,731
Absolutely not.

1868
02:23:38,912 --> 02:23:39,652
Councilor Rosa.

1869
02:23:39,872 --> 02:23:42,413
Perhaps it would be helpful that, uh,

1870
02:23:44,782 --> 02:23:49,654
When speaking in the chambers, one ought not to put words in another's mouth.

1871
02:23:50,396 --> 02:23:50,697
Thank you.

1872
02:23:52,112 --> 02:23:52,432
Thank you.

1873
02:23:52,452 --> 02:23:53,293
If you could proceed.

1874
02:23:53,753 --> 02:23:54,314
Thank you very much.

1875
02:23:54,374 --> 02:23:54,694
OK.

1876
02:23:55,174 --> 02:24:04,522
So either way, either of those courses is not going to help those of us living in the Salem Street area, because we are currently under siege.

1877
02:24:04,902 --> 02:24:14,830
The first apartment building is on the block, and the line behind them is stretching all the way from Haines Square to 93, and it's taking a turn down Fountain Street.

1878
02:24:15,490 --> 02:24:16,350
I can't wait a year.

1879
02:24:16,811 --> 02:24:20,112
I can't wait six months for a consultant to come in and go, wow, are you crazy?

1880
02:24:20,172 --> 02:24:31,918
You can't do that because there's already going to be 610 buildings already approved and ready to go because it's apartment zoned and all they have to do is say we'll do three stories and they're good to go because that's what the zoning says.

1881
02:24:32,298 --> 02:24:33,579
This is an emergency.

1882
02:24:33,859 --> 02:24:35,000
This needs to happen now.

1883
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,762
The Roberts Elementary School currently has 569 children.

1884
02:24:38,802 --> 02:24:44,564
And just to put that into perspective, more than 100 of those students are ELL students that require extra services.

1885
02:24:44,904 --> 02:24:56,229
So while the schools are built to hold 600 students, they are not built to hold 600 students where 100 of them need extra services in this and 50 of them need extra services in that, because those are extra spaces.

1886
02:24:56,670 --> 02:25:01,652
So this is extremely important to me as I have a third grader in that school.

1887
02:25:02,092 --> 02:25:11,347
and the largest third grade in the entire city at five classes and more than 100 students, just in the third grade, not including the ELL, not including the inclusion classes.

1888
02:25:11,808 --> 02:25:14,493
So this is very important to me.

1889
02:25:14,533 --> 02:25:15,655
This is very personal.

1890
02:25:17,504 --> 02:25:18,364
but just to get back.

1891
02:25:19,325 --> 02:25:23,447
So I think that we really need to consider this before we think about waiting for a consultant.

1892
02:25:23,487 --> 02:25:26,809
This is one of the most important things that the city council is in charge of is zoning.

1893
02:25:27,289 --> 02:25:29,910
And when zoning is going well, zoning is virtually invisible.

1894
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:32,752
For years, the zoning in Medford was virtually invisible.

1895
02:25:33,292 --> 02:25:37,374
A lot of people went in, and they got their decks, and they added their extra parking spaces.

1896
02:25:37,414 --> 02:25:42,836
But all of a sudden, some developers noticed a hole, and they came in, and they're trying to fill us in.

1897
02:25:43,577 --> 02:25:45,778
And so now we're paying attention.

1898
02:25:48,452 --> 02:25:51,793
So we need to look realistically at what these neighborhoods can handle.

1899
02:25:52,113 --> 02:25:59,536
When we saw the traffic loads at the meeting that I attended for Salem Street, they recorded more than 1,000 cars per hour going down Salem Street.

1900
02:25:59,956 --> 02:26:00,536
Think about that.

1901
02:26:00,596 --> 02:26:01,777
That's a lot of cars.

1902
02:26:03,057 --> 02:26:05,098
A lot of times that traffic is backed up.

1903
02:26:05,518 --> 02:26:11,960
I tried to get to Haines Square over the weekend and the traffic was backed up almost to the Rotary at 93 on just a random Saturday.

1904
02:26:14,562 --> 02:26:16,503
The zoning there calls for apartment buildings.

1905
02:26:16,543 --> 02:26:22,468
Those apartment buildings can be three stories high and probably between 12 to 15 units.

1906
02:26:22,648 --> 02:26:27,732
Imagine them on every plot on Salem Street and the street would just be closed.

1907
02:26:27,772 --> 02:26:29,313
The neighborhood would be decimated.

1908
02:26:30,214 --> 02:26:33,616
That is what the zoning intends for that area as a whole.

1909
02:26:34,037 --> 02:26:37,459
And that may have been true when they created that zoning.

1910
02:26:37,759 --> 02:26:38,840
It's no longer true.

1911
02:26:39,481 --> 02:26:43,824
It's emergent that this council act to change that zoning.

1912
02:26:44,251 --> 02:26:46,953
to a more appropriate scenario.

1913
02:26:47,253 --> 02:26:52,697
What that scenario is, I can't say, but I can say that it's not apartments up and down Salem Street.

1914
02:26:53,037 --> 02:26:58,001
We also need to consider the load of those additional residents on our infrastructure.

1915
02:26:58,461 --> 02:27:00,983
Our police and our fire are understaffed.

1916
02:27:01,363 --> 02:27:03,505
Our DPW is understaffed.

1917
02:27:07,035 --> 02:27:11,257
So we really need to consider the quality of life also of people that are living in those areas.

1918
02:27:11,597 --> 02:27:13,858
What are their expectations when they moved in?

1919
02:27:13,938 --> 02:27:17,319
Because if you look at Salem Street, most of those buildings are one story.

1920
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:21,241
There are some two family houses mixed in.

1921
02:27:21,721 --> 02:27:24,082
There's a couple of apartment buildings.

1922
02:27:24,322 --> 02:27:26,043
More of them are closer to 93.

1923
02:27:26,563 --> 02:27:31,005
These are not areas that we think of as high concentrated residences.

1924
02:27:32,328 --> 02:27:40,473
So we're basically trying to overcrowd this side of the city if we now target this street to suddenly enact the apartment one zoning.

1925
02:27:41,193 --> 02:27:50,899
We need to consider when we keep the zoning if our infrastructure needs can meet the expanding population that this zoning allows.

1926
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:52,360
I would say no.

1927
02:27:53,641 --> 02:27:54,922
We can't support it.

1928
02:27:55,342 --> 02:28:01,406
We're not gonna suddenly be able to add one, five, 10% to our population

1929
02:28:02,085 --> 02:28:05,826
and be able to have enough police and fire to support that.

1930
02:28:05,846 --> 02:28:11,208
We know that it takes several months to train police and fire, but it also takes tax dollars.

1931
02:28:12,288 --> 02:28:27,993
While we heard that these new buildings will bring 100,000, or I think Locust Street said they were gonna bring a million dollars in new tax revenue, 490 families would bring in an incredible amount of additional needs on the city.

1932
02:28:28,447 --> 02:28:33,989
Even if they just had a small 10% children, that's almost 50 children added to the school system.

1933
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:36,350
Can our school system handle that burden?

1934
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:39,731
Can our budget handle the additional costs of those students?

1935
02:28:40,552 --> 02:28:44,493
So I urge you to immediately look at all the streets that are zoned apartment one.

1936
02:28:44,933 --> 02:28:46,374
Salem Street's not the only street.

1937
02:28:46,514 --> 02:28:48,035
Fountain Street's not the only street.

1938
02:28:48,395 --> 02:28:50,676
I'm sure there are pockets in other parts of the city.

1939
02:28:51,436 --> 02:28:56,278
My map is pretty hard to read out the street names, so I could only pick out the ones that I recognize.

1940
02:28:58,873 --> 02:29:03,954
This is coming and this isn't just something that is going to maybe happen.

1941
02:29:03,974 --> 02:29:06,475
This is something that is actively happening.

1942
02:29:06,955 --> 02:29:11,716
People are watching to see if this project at the old break pro is going to be approved.

1943
02:29:12,176 --> 02:29:22,278
And while it's great to see something different there as opposed to an abandoned building, we have to consider if the street can handle the load of buildings up and down the street.

1944
02:29:22,758 --> 02:29:23,658
So I hope that

1945
02:29:25,576 --> 02:29:33,199
you will take this seriously and responsibly try to change this zoning as quickly as possible before it's too late.

1946
02:29:33,519 --> 02:29:41,662
Because once those buildings are constructed and sitting on those sites, once those children are going up to the high school to enroll in our schools, it's too late.

1947
02:29:43,423 --> 02:29:43,803
Thank you.

1948
02:29:44,184 --> 02:29:44,544
Thank you.

1949
02:29:46,244 --> 02:29:47,765
Point of information, Councilor Neistat.

1950
02:29:48,245 --> 02:29:52,187
Any zoning change is a process that takes about 180 days, about six months, Mr. President.

1951
02:29:52,207 --> 02:29:52,487
Thank you.

1952
02:29:54,426 --> 02:29:56,207
Name and address of the record, please.

1953
02:29:56,227 --> 02:29:59,668
Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, right around the corner from Salem Street.

1954
02:29:59,828 --> 02:30:03,289
This is my neighborhood, so I feel doubly strongly about this.

1955
02:30:04,669 --> 02:30:10,851
Again, as far as I can tell from all of the readings and all of my interactions,

1956
02:30:11,654 --> 02:30:13,996
in various cities that are structured similarly.

1957
02:30:14,776 --> 02:30:16,898
Zoning starts with the city council.

1958
02:30:17,238 --> 02:30:20,800
With all respect, I'm disinterested in what the mayor's opinion is.

1959
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:24,162
I'm disinterested in what the community development's opinion is.

1960
02:30:24,763 --> 02:30:27,985
And I'm disinterested at some level of what the ZBA's opinion is.

1961
02:30:28,625 --> 02:30:30,547
It's the neighborhood that we live in.

1962
02:30:30,907 --> 02:30:32,148
We are the residents.

1963
02:30:32,368 --> 02:30:34,169
We are the people who will drive by it.

1964
02:30:34,809 --> 02:30:36,650
We are the people who will sit in the traffic.

1965
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:40,831
We are the people that as these buildings go up will deal with power outages.

1966
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:47,033
We just had one not a week ago on Tuesday that was for hours for some people.

1967
02:30:47,733 --> 02:30:54,215
It's getting into the shower and not getting proper water supply because we're already getting developed more than we need to be.

1968
02:30:54,915 --> 02:30:56,596
It's sewer systems.

1969
02:30:56,696 --> 02:30:57,997
It's backing up the streets.

1970
02:30:58,197 --> 02:31:10,123
It's the fact that when you drive down the streets in our neighborhood, people are cutting through because they're trying to avoid 93 and with the fast 14, the entire state has learned how to cut through the city of Medford.

1971
02:31:10,723 --> 02:31:20,988
So, I mean, I think that we can't handle the additional volume that we're hearing someone somewhere is envisioning in this neighborhood.

1972
02:31:21,028 --> 02:31:22,289
I mean, it looks like Beirut.

1973
02:31:22,609 --> 02:31:24,491
It looks like they test missiles around there.

1974
02:31:24,911 --> 02:31:27,053
The potholes are so big it'll eat a Subaru.

1975
02:31:27,593 --> 02:31:40,002
So I get that it's considered somewhat blighted, although I take exception to that term because it's blighted because it hasn't been cared for properly in budgetary planning.

1976
02:31:40,483 --> 02:31:51,131
So I don't think that having a vision of putting 15, 20 of these down Stalem Street is really gonna do anybody any favor.

1977
02:31:51,831 --> 02:32:01,161
I think we're going to get into a situation where the people who live in the neighbourhood, their properties are going to be devalued because they're not going to be these new buildings.

1978
02:32:01,721 --> 02:32:07,527
We're going to be dwarfed by these big buildings coming down Salem Street and we're going to be gentrified out.

1979
02:32:07,867 --> 02:32:11,051
People who have been in those neighbourhoods for two and three generations.

1980
02:32:11,591 --> 02:32:17,096
families that are young and have bought in because they like the neighborhood and they like the small feel of it.

1981
02:32:17,616 --> 02:32:29,267
So respectfully, I understand that there are different groups that have political optical interests at play, but when it comes nine o'clock at night, they don't put their head on the pillow.

1982
02:32:30,363 --> 02:32:43,973
You know in the various City areas of the city It's just where they live and I don't see any big circles being drawn around where their houses are So I would ask that you make this a top priority because they are lining up

1983
02:32:44,973 --> 02:32:46,155
There is a scuttlebutt.

1984
02:32:46,755 --> 02:32:49,058
We're starting to see some construction happen.

1985
02:32:49,438 --> 02:32:51,400
We've started to see a few people apply.

1986
02:32:52,161 --> 02:32:53,723
Some, it looks like, are going to get it.

1987
02:32:53,923 --> 02:32:55,204
Some looks like they may not.

1988
02:32:55,325 --> 02:33:03,293
I'm not sure what the rhyme or reason will be, but it would be very unfortunate to see an area that has some beautiful buildings.

1989
02:33:03,554 --> 02:33:05,716
Some of the buildings in our neighborhood are quite lovely.

1990
02:33:06,112 --> 02:33:11,196
you know, be taken away and have it turn out to look like Main Street in Cambridge.

1991
02:33:11,497 --> 02:33:15,040
Not that there's anything wrong with Main Street in Cambridge, but that was Cambridge's decision.

1992
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:17,142
I don't want it to be a developer's decision.

1993
02:33:17,402 --> 02:33:27,991
So I know it's a little bit strong, my commentary, but I feel like our neighborhood is really on the chopping block very quickly.

1994
02:33:28,582 --> 02:33:31,805
and it will go like dominoes if we don't do something about it.

1995
02:33:31,845 --> 02:33:40,191
So I would urge you to please consider it, because for those of us who live there, it's heartbreaking for us to consider that it might not be there anymore.

1996
02:33:40,612 --> 02:33:40,912
Thanks.

1997
02:33:42,193 --> 02:33:42,573
Thank you.

1998
02:33:45,756 --> 02:33:48,978
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

1999
02:33:49,078 --> 02:33:52,761
Motion by Councilor Langel-Kern to revert back to regular business.

2000
02:33:52,781 --> 02:33:55,864
17-305 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern.

2001
02:33:57,862 --> 02:34:11,832
Be it resolved that the sewer connection fees that are charged by the City of Medford, per lateral, be updated and charged per fixture as our fees have not been updated since 2013 and are due for reassessments.

2002
02:34:12,553 --> 02:34:13,574
Councilor Longo-Kern.

2003
02:34:14,054 --> 02:34:16,016
Thank you, President Carviello.

2004
02:34:16,056 --> 02:34:25,703
This is a resolution I had on maybe two months ago with regards to connection fees, requesting an update from our city engineer, and she thankfully

2005
02:34:26,248 --> 02:34:27,949
I thank her for giving us an update.

2006
02:34:28,330 --> 02:34:30,792
She did mention that they are due for reassessment.

2007
02:34:30,832 --> 02:34:38,098
So I ask that we look into, rather than a per lateral fee, we look into a charging per fixture.

2008
02:34:38,138 --> 02:34:43,202
I believe our fee amounts are outdated by probably several years.

2009
02:34:43,322 --> 02:34:48,707
And if we look at other cities and towns, they're doing it much differently and capturing more revenue than the city of Medford is.

2010
02:34:49,007 --> 02:34:52,850
This is just one area that was brought to my attention that I've been looking into.

2011
02:34:53,071 --> 02:34:54,632
And I think it's a good resolve.

2012
02:34:55,412 --> 02:34:58,695
can definitely be a start to updating what we need to.

2013
02:34:59,656 --> 02:35:00,857
I ask for a roll call vote.

2014
02:35:01,577 --> 02:35:05,260
On the motion by Councilor Kern, seconded by Councilor Marks.

2015
02:35:06,401 --> 02:35:08,363
Roll call vote has been requested.

2016
02:35:11,145 --> 02:35:16,209
Vice President Marks, just so I understand, this is a connection fee for new construction you're talking to?

2017
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:17,110
Correct.

2018
02:35:17,310 --> 02:35:18,191
Only new construction.

2019
02:35:18,211 --> 02:35:19,352
Thank you.

2020
02:35:25,447 --> 02:35:27,548
I believe a sewer connection fee is for new construction.

2021
02:35:27,568 --> 02:35:27,788
Yes.

2022
02:35:29,029 --> 02:35:29,169
Right.

2023
02:35:29,189 --> 02:35:46,697
Cause as part of that paper you offered two months ago, we also asked if the, as a separate, uh, I think it was a paper A or B, uh, that if the water and sewer commissioners were looking at a sewer connection for existing homes and we never really got an answer on that.

2024
02:35:47,137 --> 02:35:52,099
We got an answer that, uh, uh, that, uh, there is a sewer connection for new construction.

2025
02:35:52,753 --> 02:36:14,038
Yeah, I mean, we can specify that for new, this can be for new construction and maybe get an update with regards to any other, um, what if a reassessment is looked at by our city and city engineer that we get an update with regards to any other updates or, you know, any other updates or different assessments that she thinks are necessary.

2026
02:36:14,158 --> 02:36:17,879
This is just one that I know I read the city of Cambridge is, um,

2027
02:36:18,598 --> 02:36:28,644
ordinance and it's very different than ours and they're capturing a new construction, much more that could go towards our infrastructure needs, especially in those areas that are being developed.

2028
02:36:30,865 --> 02:36:31,246
Thank you.

2029
02:36:31,946 --> 02:36:33,647
So we amend the paper to say new construction.

2030
02:36:33,687 --> 02:36:33,867
Sure.

2031
02:36:36,789 --> 02:36:37,329
As amended.

2032
02:36:38,270 --> 02:36:38,830
Counselor Knight.

2033
02:36:39,671 --> 02:36:40,691
Um, yes, Mr. President.

2034
02:36:40,711 --> 02:36:46,475
I was wondering if the sponsor of the resolution could explain, um, how more,

2035
02:36:47,161 --> 02:37:00,144
revenue was captured by changing the current situation and whether or not she spoke with anybody from the Water and Sewer Commission as to whether or not we would be able to actually capture more revenue or whether or not it would be a zero-sum game.

2036
02:37:00,924 --> 02:37:15,827
I know these are probably questions that you can't answer roughhand, but something that raises a concern because I don't want to see raising fees and costing additional funds to individuals trying to develop certain properties if, in fact, we're not going to see a return on the other end, Mr. President.

2037
02:37:16,976 --> 02:37:24,661
But for the purposes of the resolution, I don't feel comfortable dictating to the Water and Sewer Commission what approach they should take.

2038
02:37:24,701 --> 02:37:28,444
I'd feel better having them present to us what our options are and then us making a recommendation.

2039
02:37:31,267 --> 02:37:31,607
Thank you.

2040
02:37:32,808 --> 02:37:33,688
Councilor Langlois-Carran.

2041
02:37:34,229 --> 02:37:37,451
I think what we do as a city council is make recommendations anyway.

2042
02:37:37,491 --> 02:37:40,794
This is a recommendation that this type of fee be added.

2043
02:37:40,914 --> 02:37:44,757
I did speak to somebody in the City of Cambridge Engineering Department.

2044
02:37:45,528 --> 02:37:56,116
who did say by charging the per fixture, you do capture more, much more revenue because it's obviously per fixture versus whatever the per lateral is.

2045
02:37:56,136 --> 02:37:58,278
I believe it was just one set fee.

2046
02:37:59,058 --> 02:38:01,540
One, I think it's a hundred dollars, the city of Medford charges.

2047
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:04,002
And it's sounded to me like it was per project.

2048
02:38:04,082 --> 02:38:10,087
So per fixture fee, obviously, if you have a larger project, you have many more fixtures, um, which you could capture.

2049
02:38:10,187 --> 02:38:13,870
And obviously we have so much need and to update our

2050
02:38:14,391 --> 02:38:20,234
infrastructure, water and sewer, especially, that I believe this money could go to, obviously, to help with that.

2051
02:38:20,274 --> 02:38:21,555
Thank you.

2052
02:38:21,575 --> 02:38:21,895
Thank you.

2053
02:38:21,915 --> 02:38:23,957
Name and address of the record, please.

2054
02:38:24,237 --> 02:38:27,819
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of this board.

2055
02:38:28,579 --> 02:38:38,585
I understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that, why would you want to charge somebody a connection fee?

2056
02:38:38,625 --> 02:38:41,767
Because right now, you pay from your house to the middle of the street.

2057
02:38:42,427 --> 02:38:43,968
So now you're saying that you connect

2058
02:38:44,298 --> 02:38:50,342
to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through.

2059
02:38:50,362 --> 02:38:59,708
We have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water sewer lines.

2060
02:39:00,609 --> 02:39:08,754
Now, if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it.

2061
02:39:09,194 --> 02:39:10,375
But on single-family homes,

2062
02:39:10,967 --> 02:39:18,569
two family homes or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house.

2063
02:39:19,309 --> 02:39:25,210
So I think what you need is probably a further clarification as it relates to where it's going on that.

2064
02:39:25,230 --> 02:39:29,731
And I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account?

2065
02:39:30,231 --> 02:39:31,152
Where's the infrastructure?

2066
02:39:31,172 --> 02:39:33,832
Where's the LNI that's taking place in the city?

2067
02:39:34,112 --> 02:39:36,613
Where are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed?

2068
02:39:37,592 --> 02:39:48,195
Before you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax that the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you.

2069
02:39:48,856 --> 02:39:54,657
So you're technically putting another tax on the Meffitt resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it.

2070
02:39:55,318 --> 02:40:00,119
But you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for.

2071
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:02,720
You've got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer.

2072
02:40:02,740 --> 02:40:05,381
You've got close to $9 million in your free cash account.

2073
02:40:06,482 --> 02:40:14,924
And then they're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022, going into 2023 to free up the bonds.

2074
02:40:15,085 --> 02:40:17,205
So what are you going to do?

2075
02:40:17,225 --> 02:40:18,506
Start taking from your free cash?

2076
02:40:19,286 --> 02:40:21,907
Or are you going to do an override of $2.5 for the taxpayers?

2077
02:40:22,487 --> 02:40:24,007
Or are you going to start laying off people?

2078
02:40:24,847 --> 02:40:29,049
You just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building.

2079
02:40:29,369 --> 02:40:33,510
You don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis.

2080
02:40:36,055 --> 02:40:42,179
The problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor.

2081
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:47,283
You absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this.

2082
02:40:47,463 --> 02:40:50,646
She just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants.

2083
02:40:52,067 --> 02:40:56,650
Listen, if this is going to be cohesive in a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down.

2084
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:57,630
It only takes four of you.

2085
02:40:58,351 --> 02:41:03,755
Four of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough.

2086
02:41:05,005 --> 02:41:12,690
Because I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail.

2087
02:41:12,730 --> 02:41:24,077
Because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building.

2088
02:41:24,717 --> 02:41:25,078
Thank you.

2089
02:41:25,238 --> 02:41:25,598
Thank you.

2090
02:41:25,618 --> 02:41:28,700
Name and address of the record, please.

2091
02:41:29,993 --> 02:41:31,694
I'm sorry.

2092
02:41:31,734 --> 02:41:32,934
I have a little trouble hearing.

2093
02:41:32,994 --> 02:41:41,517
I wondered if I can inquire Clarification I heard that there's a linkage fee, but is there a purpose identified for that fee?

2094
02:41:41,577 --> 02:41:56,961
Is it going to go into a City Council account where you guys would be responsible to disperse the funds or is it just general I didn't The speakers went out so I did City Council does not have any of their own private accounts that I know of So it's just an additional fee

2095
02:41:57,660 --> 02:42:07,727
To me, it would seem like it would make more sense if you had the purview then you could at least use it for like, you know, sidewalks or crosswalks or whatever.

2096
02:42:07,747 --> 02:42:08,327
All right.

2097
02:42:08,447 --> 02:42:08,747
Thanks.

2098
02:42:08,807 --> 02:42:09,448
I just didn't hear.

2099
02:42:09,668 --> 02:42:09,888
Thanks.

2100
02:42:11,569 --> 02:42:18,954
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kern as amended and seconded by Councilor Mox, roll call vote has been requested.

2101
02:42:18,974 --> 02:42:25,458
Councilor DelaRusso is absent.

2102
02:42:26,187 --> 02:42:27,167
Councilor Falco?

2103
02:42:27,207 --> 02:42:27,387
Yes.

2104
02:42:28,568 --> 02:42:29,048
Councilor Nye?

2105
02:42:29,068 --> 02:42:29,148
No.

2106
02:42:30,789 --> 02:42:31,569
Councilor Kerr?

2107
02:42:31,629 --> 02:42:31,729
Yes.

2108
02:42:32,629 --> 02:42:33,490
Vice President Marks?

2109
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:33,930
Yes.

2110
02:42:35,190 --> 02:42:36,731
Councilor Scott Kelly?

2111
02:42:36,911 --> 02:42:37,151
Yes.

2112
02:42:38,071 --> 02:42:38,772
President Caviello?

2113
02:42:39,152 --> 02:42:39,412
Yes.

2114
02:42:40,852 --> 02:42:43,853
Five in the affirmative, one in the negative, and one absent.

2115
02:42:44,454 --> 02:42:48,335
Motion passes.

2116
02:42:48,355 --> 02:42:50,316
17.309 offered by Councilor Nye.

2117
02:42:50,816 --> 02:42:53,877
Be it resolved that the administration update the council on the status

2118
02:42:54,445 --> 02:42:58,027
of the Community Preservation Act Commission appointments.

2119
02:42:58,287 --> 02:42:58,887
Counselor Knight.

2120
02:42:59,648 --> 02:43:02,149
Mr. President, a rather self-explanatory resolution.

2121
02:43:02,890 --> 02:43:17,457
In short time, we've been able to pass the Community Preservation Act Ordinance, which establishes the Community Preservation Commission, which is required by law in order to execute the goals and objectives of the Community Preservation Act.

2122
02:43:18,678 --> 02:43:21,680
The administration opened up a period of

2123
02:43:22,782 --> 02:43:25,724
applications, and that has since closed.

2124
02:43:25,744 --> 02:43:37,491
And I'm wondering if she can give us an update as to what the status is of appointing that board so that we can get to work on some good projects in recreation and affordable housing and open space and in historic revitalization, Mr. President.

2125
02:43:37,852 --> 02:43:38,212
Thank you.

2126
02:43:38,712 --> 02:43:40,994
Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2127
02:43:41,614 --> 02:43:42,334
All those in favor?

2128
02:43:43,055 --> 02:43:43,835
Motion passes.

2129
02:43:44,936 --> 02:43:47,037
Motion to take hands in the hands of the clerk.

2130
02:43:47,057 --> 02:43:49,279
I'll do those after.

2131
02:43:49,319 --> 02:43:49,919
We have a lot of them.

2132
02:43:52,330 --> 02:44:02,053
Offered by council at night, be it resolved that the DPW commissioner update the council regarding the spring street sweeping schedule.

2133
02:44:03,334 --> 02:44:04,094
That was hard to get out.

2134
02:44:04,634 --> 02:44:05,615
It always is.

2135
02:44:05,755 --> 02:44:08,396
It always is sweet streeping, right?

2136
02:44:08,416 --> 02:44:16,559
Mr. President, again, in line with the paper that I offered earlier in the evening, um, relative to when the striping of sidewalks and roadways, I'm sorry, crosswalks and roadways is going to be performed.

2137
02:44:16,599 --> 02:44:20,320
I know that every spring we also have our, uh, what's termed the big sweep.

2138
02:44:21,565 --> 02:44:24,987
And I believe it's supposed to start relatively soon, weather permitting.

2139
02:44:25,047 --> 02:44:39,032
So I'm hoping that the DPW commissioner can provide us with a schedule as to when it's going to happen so that we can help get the word out to the residents in the neighbourhood so that they're not inconvenienced by any type of notification problems that may occur relative to the street sweeping program.

2140
02:44:39,913 --> 02:44:40,233
Thank you.

2141
02:44:40,253 --> 02:44:43,314
On the motion by Councillor Light, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

2142
02:44:44,619 --> 02:44:45,299
All those in favor?

2143
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:47,940
Councilor, Vice President Marks.

2144
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:49,461
Thank you, Mr. President.

2145
02:44:49,741 --> 02:44:58,544
I must say, even though the weather is getting warmer, that the last snowstorm that we had on Tuesday, the plow trucks had gotten many complaints.

2146
02:44:59,004 --> 02:45:00,384
They weren't plowing to the curb.

2147
02:45:01,405 --> 02:45:06,486
And the next day, the city of Method removed the restriction of parking on both sides.

2148
02:45:07,107 --> 02:45:10,588
And cars were literally parking two or three feet

2149
02:45:11,268 --> 02:45:13,749
from the curb itself because it was all snow there.

2150
02:45:14,409 --> 02:45:18,350
And trash trucks, emergency vehicles couldn't get down many of the roads.

2151
02:45:19,051 --> 02:45:26,993
And it maintains consistently a problem in this community about plowing to the curb.

2152
02:45:27,554 --> 02:45:40,338
And I would just ask as part of this paper that we once again ask the administration and the DPW commissioner to make sure that if we're gonna have cars be removed from one side or the other, that the trucks plow to the curb.

2153
02:45:40,937 --> 02:45:44,601
So the cars have a place to park after the snow emergencies removed.

2154
02:45:46,243 --> 02:45:47,504
As amended by Councilor Mox.

2155
02:45:48,866 --> 02:45:49,506
All those in favor?

2156
02:45:50,387 --> 02:45:51,208
Motion passes.

2157
02:45:52,129 --> 02:46:01,800
Offered by Councilor Mox being resolved that the Memphis City Council receive an update on the status of the property located at Maple Park Avenue known as

2158
02:46:02,578 --> 02:46:03,899
the Heckner Center.

2159
02:46:04,059 --> 02:46:04,839
Councilor Marks.

2160
02:46:05,559 --> 02:46:06,600
Thank you, Mr. President.

2161
02:46:06,900 --> 02:46:24,448
Uh, if people, uh, are not aware, uh, the Heckner Center was, uh, uh, taken over sometime back several years back and bought over by Bridgewell, uh, which is, um, uh, self, uh, nonprofit company that provides services to

2162
02:46:25,548 --> 02:46:52,237
the disability community, and this council requested that that property was given to the Hegman Center for $1 back some many years ago, and when it changed hands to Bridgewell, and Bridgewell was looking to sell the property, we asked that the city solicitor meet with Bridgewell and state that because it was no longer being utilized for the purpose of the deed, which said it had to be used for disabilities,

2163
02:46:54,288 --> 02:46:56,311
that revert back to the City of Meffitt.

2164
02:46:56,991 --> 02:47:08,103
And I'm proud to say that has happened and there are dumpsters out in front there that are being filled up with items and residents are concerned with what's taking place in the area.

2165
02:47:08,143 --> 02:47:17,232
So if we can get an update, I don't know if it's Bridgewell that's cleaning out the building or if the City of Meffitt is doing something with the building, but if we can get an update, Mr. President,

2166
02:47:17,852 --> 02:47:27,275
for next council meeting regarding what is the status of the pharma-hygienists at the site and what's taking place.

2167
02:47:27,615 --> 02:47:28,015
Thank you.

2168
02:47:28,075 --> 02:47:34,097
I myself have received several phone calls on what was going on in the building because there seemed to be some meetings going on there also.

2169
02:47:35,037 --> 02:47:35,717
Councilor Falco.

2170
02:47:36,197 --> 02:47:37,058
Thank you, Mr. President.

2171
02:47:37,298 --> 02:47:39,538
I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

2172
02:47:40,039 --> 02:47:42,699
And if you wouldn't mind an amendment to the resolution.

2173
02:47:43,139 --> 02:47:44,960
I think it'd be ideal if we could actually have

2174
02:47:46,653 --> 02:47:48,214
a tour of the building as a committee.

2175
02:47:48,475 --> 02:47:57,002
I mean, if that building's coming back onto the city rolls, then we should actually go down, take a look at the facility, see what condition it's in.

2176
02:47:57,022 --> 02:48:00,365
And we haven't had it, it hasn't been part of the city amendment for many years.

2177
02:48:01,085 --> 02:48:05,409
And I think we should really get a firsthand look at the condition of the facility.

2178
02:48:05,429 --> 02:48:11,354
So if Council Member Marks wouldn't mind, I'd like to add that as an amendment to the resolution.

2179
02:48:15,343 --> 02:48:22,327
On the motion by Council, on the motion by Council Marks as amended by Councilor Falco and seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

2180
02:48:22,367 --> 02:48:22,947
All those in favor.

2181
02:48:22,967 --> 02:48:23,027
Aye.

2182
02:48:23,907 --> 02:48:24,668
Motion passes.

2183
02:48:26,509 --> 02:48:28,330
Petition presentation and similar matters.

2184
02:48:32,412 --> 02:48:33,692
Uh, yes.

2185
02:48:35,413 --> 02:48:35,974
Councilor Knight.

2186
02:48:36,314 --> 02:48:44,738
Um, Mr. President, earlier this evening at 6 PM, uh, the committee of the whole met to discuss two papers in committee.

2187
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:49,341
Um, one paper was, uh, regulating replica firearms in the city of Medford.

2188
02:48:49,381 --> 02:49:02,724
That paper was, um, referred to remaining committee with, uh, some opinion from the city solicitor, uh, to take a look at some additional aspects of potentially, uh, regulating the sale of replica firearms in the community as well as recommended by council marks.

2189
02:49:03,184 --> 02:49:10,926
Um, there was also a paper that was on the table, Mr. President, that has gone through the legislative process and that paper was related to, uh, the wage theft,

2190
02:49:11,352 --> 02:49:14,753
Ordinance Prevention of Wage Theft in the City of Medford, Mr. President.

2191
02:49:14,793 --> 02:49:16,853
That paper was reported out of committee favorably.

2192
02:49:17,873 --> 02:49:21,574
And I'd move for adoption of the committee report this evening, Mr. President.

2193
02:49:22,174 --> 02:49:25,815
And after the adoption of the committee report, I would move to put the paper through first reading.

2194
02:49:26,855 --> 02:49:30,616
On the motion by Councillor Knight to adopt the paper and let it take its first reading.

2195
02:49:31,936 --> 02:49:32,656
All those in favor?

2196
02:49:33,216 --> 02:49:33,316
Aye.

2197
02:49:33,716 --> 02:49:34,457
Motion passes.

2198
02:49:35,517 --> 02:49:39,118
On the motion by Councillor Knight to let the paper take its first reading.

2199
02:49:39,478 --> 02:49:41,058
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2200
02:49:48,130 --> 02:49:50,152
Councilor Dela Ruzzo, Councilor Falcone.

2201
02:49:50,452 --> 02:49:50,672
Yes.

2202
02:49:51,593 --> 02:49:52,093
Councilor Night.

2203
02:49:52,374 --> 02:49:52,814
Yes.

2204
02:49:53,795 --> 02:49:54,595
Councilor Kern.

2205
02:49:54,635 --> 02:49:54,796
Yes.

2206
02:49:55,436 --> 02:49:56,257
Vice President Marks.

2207
02:49:56,577 --> 02:49:56,837
Yes.

2208
02:49:57,077 --> 02:49:57,898
Councilor Spapelli.

2209
02:49:58,018 --> 02:49:58,379
Yes.

2210
02:49:59,039 --> 02:49:59,880
President Caviello.

2211
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:00,200
Yes.

2212
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:02,562
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

2213
02:50:02,722 --> 02:50:05,044
Motion passes and takes its first reading.

2214
02:50:05,705 --> 02:50:08,047
Petitions, presentations and similar matters.

2215
02:50:08,067 --> 02:50:16,654
17 306 petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Bedford to address the council on banners on the city hall.

2216
02:50:17,391 --> 02:50:18,691
Name and address for the record, please.

2217
02:50:18,971 --> 02:50:19,291
Thank you.

2218
02:50:19,371 --> 02:50:20,572
Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

2219
02:50:21,432 --> 02:50:22,932
Um, okay.

2220
02:50:23,933 --> 02:50:25,733
The mayor listens to me on this.

2221
02:50:25,953 --> 02:50:28,774
She's going to get a lot of hard phone calls and some emails.

2222
02:50:29,554 --> 02:50:32,795
Um, unfortunately she has started a bad precedent for the city.

2223
02:50:33,295 --> 02:50:43,617
While I appreciate the intent of public awareness of certain city sponsored events, posting them on city halls outside wall is an inappropriate place to display such information.

2224
02:50:44,798 --> 02:50:46,558
City Hall is the seat of our government.

2225
02:50:47,047 --> 02:50:49,268
not a billboard for citywide information.

2226
02:50:50,169 --> 02:50:52,350
I find it cheapens the city in a few ways.

2227
02:50:53,250 --> 02:50:57,492
One, it unknowingly sets up favorite versus non-favorite groups.

2228
02:50:58,353 --> 02:51:09,719
While some are vocal, there may be other groups that feel intimidated to speak in opposition of the quote favorite group, which has already attained preference in City Hall.

2229
02:51:10,839 --> 02:51:13,861
This unseen bias can create unnecessary resentment.

2230
02:51:14,501 --> 02:51:16,182
It can pit one group against the other.

2231
02:51:17,263 --> 02:51:25,748
Eventually, we may have two groups who will oppose each other in concept, wanting to be represented on City Hall, i.e., pro-life versus pro-choice.

2232
02:51:26,689 --> 02:51:27,950
This is a dangerous practice.

2233
02:51:28,910 --> 02:51:32,393
Two, it detracts from the visual image of the building itself.

2234
02:51:33,233 --> 02:51:36,315
Our City Hall was built in a time of magnificent architecture.

2235
02:51:37,036 --> 02:51:38,637
The banners detract from the U.S.

2236
02:51:38,697 --> 02:51:43,039
flag, which should be the only thing on a person's mind as they pass City Hall.

2237
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:45,581
Yes, the MIA flag is there as well.

2238
02:51:46,733 --> 02:51:50,236
for a reason that you should already also be thinking about.

2239
02:51:51,196 --> 02:51:53,778
Three, the banners are distracting to drivers.

2240
02:51:54,979 --> 02:52:08,510
Four, and most importantly, it detracts from the true purpose of City Hall, to be the people's house, the building which holds the right of everyone to enter and express their views in the way that they would like to be governed.

2241
02:52:09,330 --> 02:52:15,055
We should revere this building as peoples all around the world would die to have a building such as this.

2242
02:52:15,563 --> 02:52:19,305
where their voices could be heard, not to be an advertisement space.

2243
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:30,433
I understand why the gay community wanted to see the rainbow flag up on City Hall.

2244
02:52:30,993 --> 02:52:34,595
It was simply for affirmation, which is an understandable goal.

2245
02:52:35,396 --> 02:52:43,381
So since I am asking the mayor not to put up the flag in June, I feel obligated to make at least three other suggestions

2246
02:52:43,802 --> 02:52:45,742
to affirm the gay population in Medford.

2247
02:52:46,603 --> 02:52:47,443
They are as follows.

2248
02:52:48,063 --> 02:52:53,484
We can interview people who are gay on a TV show through the new access station.

2249
02:52:54,225 --> 02:52:59,226
We can write a book on gays who live in Medford, and I would recommend Carl Seberg to top the list.

2250
02:53:00,606 --> 02:53:04,627
We can rent the Chevalier Theater and hold a celebration of gay life through a musical.

2251
02:53:05,427 --> 02:53:11,849
We can organize a pizza night for gays at a certain restaurant and invite straights who want to support them, et cetera.

2252
02:53:12,779 --> 02:53:16,402
I hope that these other avenues will be received in the spirit that I offer them.

2253
02:53:17,122 --> 02:53:26,730
If the city would like to sponsor something, they could hold a night at the library in June where they have readings on gay material or have gay speakers.

2254
02:53:30,893 --> 02:53:35,537
These are actually more grassroots methods and require the gay community to advocate for themselves.

2255
02:53:35,977 --> 02:53:41,822
And seeing this, it will commit more people to participate in the rest of the community.

2256
02:53:42,223 --> 02:53:44,664
And by example, they will lead and be better received.

2257
02:53:45,524 --> 02:53:53,707
In conclusion, I am therefore respectfully asking you to take down any and all ads for future events or community communications.

2258
02:53:54,227 --> 02:53:59,849
For this disrespect, for they disrespect the purpose and solemnity in which this building deserves.

2259
02:54:00,430 --> 02:54:04,351
This is not to say that any of the causes are unworthy of respect.

2260
02:54:04,791 --> 02:54:06,172
This is just not the place for it.

2261
02:54:06,572 --> 02:54:08,072
Thank you for considering my request.

2262
02:54:09,053 --> 02:54:09,473
Thank you, Ms.

2263
02:54:09,493 --> 02:54:09,713
Martin.

2264
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,220
Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

2265
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:15,802
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

2266
02:54:16,522 --> 02:54:17,142
All those in favor?

2267
02:54:18,103 --> 02:54:18,743
Motion passes.

2268
02:54:20,303 --> 02:54:20,523
Okay.

2269
02:54:20,603 --> 02:54:27,025
We have several condolences, so if we can wait to the end to do one moment of silence, it'd be appreciated.

2270
02:54:27,045 --> 02:54:38,729
17-308 offered by Councilor Falco and President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Elaine Boyd-Narrow,

2271
02:54:39,179 --> 02:54:40,320
on her recent passing.

2272
02:54:40,821 --> 02:54:41,561
Counselor Falco.

2273
02:54:41,701 --> 02:54:42,722
Thank you, Mr. President.

2274
02:54:42,863 --> 02:54:48,848
Uh, Elaine Boudinara-Pavace was a good friend of mine as she passed away a few weeks ago.

2275
02:54:48,868 --> 02:54:51,310
Um, she lived in Medford most of her life.

2276
02:54:51,651 --> 02:54:58,217
Um, she was a teacher for more than 30 years at the Lincoln junior high school and at, uh, the McGlynn school as well.

2277
02:54:59,038 --> 02:55:02,741
Um, she was just very friendly, outgoing person.

2278
02:55:02,921 --> 02:55:03,542
Everyone loved her.

2279
02:55:04,583 --> 02:55:11,869
She actually won the Teacher of the Year award from the state of Massachusetts in world history and I believe ancient history.

2280
02:55:12,549 --> 02:55:16,192
And she'll be missed.

2281
02:55:16,272 --> 02:55:19,755
My thoughts and prayers go out to her husband, Eric, and their family.

2282
02:55:20,235 --> 02:55:21,176
Thank you, Councilor Favreau.

2283
02:55:21,236 --> 02:55:24,278
And I, too, have known Elaine and her family.

2284
02:55:24,338 --> 02:55:26,660
Our kids grew up together and did many things together.

2285
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:29,042
And it was sad to see her pass.

2286
02:55:32,424 --> 02:55:33,085
Name and address of the record.

2287
02:55:33,672 --> 02:55:35,773
Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street.

2288
02:55:36,414 --> 02:55:37,654
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

2289
02:55:38,695 --> 02:55:39,875
I knew Elaine Bordinaro.

2290
02:55:39,955 --> 02:55:42,957
I think her name was Elaine Carrier back in high school when I knew her.

2291
02:55:44,318 --> 02:55:45,539
And great person.

2292
02:55:46,699 --> 02:55:55,804
And she ended up marrying one of the top five friends I ever had in my life, truest gentleman of all time, Michael Bordinaro, back in the 70s.

2293
02:55:55,884 --> 02:56:02,908
And I remember going down to Michael's house when we were engaged, and he would be playing Emerson, Lake, and Padua on the organ,

2294
02:56:03,419 --> 02:56:06,842
and although he was educated at Berklee School of Music.

2295
02:56:07,863 --> 02:56:11,726
And unfortunately he passed away more than 25 years ago.

2296
02:56:12,846 --> 02:56:20,813
And she was fortunate and also her present husband was fortunate to meet each other, Eric.

2297
02:56:21,833 --> 02:56:23,094
He's also a great person.

2298
02:56:23,735 --> 02:56:32,642
And as I said at the wake to Elaine's daughter Christine and her brother, the children were very lucky

2299
02:56:33,116 --> 02:56:35,938
to have three of the greatest parents that ever parented.

2300
02:56:36,799 --> 02:56:37,239
Thank you.

2301
02:56:37,740 --> 02:56:38,701
I wish him all the best.

2302
02:56:38,861 --> 02:56:39,181
Thank you.

2303
02:56:39,321 --> 02:56:41,863
He was very fortunate to have two very good husbands, you are correct.

2304
02:56:42,163 --> 02:56:43,044
Oh, incredible.

2305
02:56:43,925 --> 02:56:45,806
Thank you.

2306
02:56:45,826 --> 02:56:53,853
17310, offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Captain Joseph Conway and his recent passing.

2307
02:56:54,373 --> 02:56:58,277
Captain Conway was a member of the Medford Police Department for 35 years.

2308
02:56:58,837 --> 02:57:02,260
He was a Navy veteran who served his country in World War II.

2309
02:57:03,224 --> 02:57:15,134
Again, another World War II veteran that's passed on, and again, I say I knew him, and again, community will be sadly missed.

2310
02:57:16,516 --> 02:57:28,866
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence for longtime Memphis resident Steve Honeycutt on his recent passing.

2311
02:57:29,987 --> 02:57:30,668
Vice President Mox.

2312
02:57:31,971 --> 02:57:33,412
Thank you, Mr. President.

2313
02:57:33,752 --> 02:57:40,396
I'm sad to say that a good friend of mine, Steve Honeycutt, passed away just recently.

2314
02:57:41,297 --> 02:57:53,044
For any of us that know Steve, he was always around the community, served on the Disability Commission for a number of years, and was Meffitt's disability monitor for a number of years.

2315
02:57:53,944 --> 02:58:00,528
And Steve was just an all-around good guy, someone you could talk sports, politics, electrical,

2316
02:58:01,254 --> 02:58:05,896
because he was an electrician and just a great guy, great family man.

2317
02:58:06,536 --> 02:58:08,237
And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

2318
02:58:08,257 --> 02:58:08,937
The President Thank you.

2319
02:58:08,957 --> 02:58:10,918
Another colleague in the community.

2320
02:58:10,938 --> 02:58:11,158
Go ahead.

2321
02:58:11,178 --> 02:58:13,559
Council Member O'Connor.

2322
02:58:13,579 --> 02:58:14,819
Council Member O'Connor Thank you.

2323
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:17,901
I wasn't aware that Steve passed away.

2324
02:58:17,941 --> 02:58:29,105
I just want to say I served with him on the Disability Commission for a number of years, and he was such a great man and a great advocate for people with disabilities, and he will be sorely missed.

2325
02:58:29,125 --> 02:58:30,886
The President Thank you.

2326
02:58:33,238 --> 02:58:41,362
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Method resident, Jane Cangiano, on her recent passing.

2327
02:58:42,162 --> 02:58:42,842
Councilor Mox.

2328
02:58:44,143 --> 02:58:45,023
Thank you, Mr. President.

2329
02:58:45,043 --> 02:58:47,424
I believe it's lifelong Method resident.

2330
02:58:47,444 --> 02:58:54,768
I might have wrote it down wrong, but Jane lived in the city, born and brought up here, went to school here, and was a nurse for many years.

2331
02:58:55,508 --> 02:58:57,789
She was a very active member of her parish.

2332
02:58:58,449 --> 02:59:02,111
She was a loving wife, mother, grandmother,

2333
02:59:03,031 --> 02:59:06,393
And again, she will be sorely missed by her family, Mr. President.

2334
02:59:07,594 --> 02:59:07,974
Thank you.

2335
02:59:09,616 --> 02:59:10,256
Be it resolved.

2336
02:59:10,976 --> 02:59:21,243
Offered by Council March, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence for a long, lifelong Method resident, Norma Andre, on her recent passing.

2337
02:59:21,804 --> 02:59:22,644
Vice President Mox.

2338
02:59:23,185 --> 02:59:24,265
Thank you, Mr. President.

2339
02:59:24,545 --> 02:59:26,367
This was a real tough week for Method.

2340
02:59:26,867 --> 02:59:29,709
Norma was a staple in this community for many years.

2341
02:59:30,256 --> 02:59:36,600
If anyone know the Andres, they used to own the movie theater in the square back some many, many years ago.

2342
02:59:37,361 --> 02:59:44,545
And Norma and her late husband, Frank, shared life for 70 years together, 70 years married.

2343
02:59:45,366 --> 02:59:48,147
And her focus was always on her family.

2344
02:59:48,868 --> 02:59:52,210
Anytime you saw her, she'd talk about the grandkids or her son.

2345
02:59:52,230 --> 02:59:57,073
And, you know, everything was family oriented and, again,

2346
02:59:57,938 --> 03:00:01,000
Truly a remarkable woman and she'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.

2347
03:00:01,401 --> 03:00:01,861
Yeah, I agree.

2348
03:00:01,901 --> 03:00:04,142
The Andre family, a good family in the city of Medford.

2349
03:00:04,443 --> 03:00:06,944
We all rise for a moment of silence, please.

2350
03:00:07,164 --> 03:00:08,125
These great Medford people.

2351
03:00:15,070 --> 03:00:15,430
Thank you.

2352
03:00:18,492 --> 03:00:25,377
The records of the meeting of March 7th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Longo Kern.

2353
03:00:25,457 --> 03:00:25,717
Have you

2354
03:00:26,605 --> 03:00:33,468
investigated those records and how have you fined them?

2355
03:00:33,488 --> 03:00:36,929
I have two amendments to the records and I have written them down.

2356
03:00:36,949 --> 03:00:37,829
I'll give them to the clerk.

2357
03:00:38,029 --> 03:00:41,211
Otherwise I move approval with these two changes.

2358
03:00:41,231 --> 03:00:44,092
On a motion by Councilor Knight to adjourn.

2359
03:00:44,612 --> 03:00:46,072
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2360
03:00:46,673 --> 03:00:47,313
All those in favor?
