72
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,020

73
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:34,285
[SPEAKER_09]: As we count down the remaining days to summer vacation in single digits, yes, indeed, it is still hard to believe.

[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to provide the committee with a very brief update.

75
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,112

00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:09,336

78
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:26,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will find out hopefully before next school year ends, maybe somewhere at the midway point, whether or not the Medford Public Schools has been approved to adopt a trained therapy dog that will be part of our Mustang Nation.

79
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:34,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will keep you posted on that, but I just wanted to provide an update that the interview process is taking place.

[SPEAKER_09]: This week in news around the district as a school community, we are looking forward to Wednesday's eighth grade moving on ceremonies, when both of our middle school communities will gather to chair on the class of 2028, as they finish middle school and head to high school.

94

151
00:53:54,473 --> 00:53:58,955
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been very heartfelt and I just appreciate everything you do from a personal perspective.

152
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:01,596
[SPEAKER_01]: You started getting choked up and I said, I will never cry here.

153
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:04,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't start that, cut it out, but great job.

00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:31,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. K has been a vibrant and enthusiastic leader of Medford's Missittuck Elementary School.

175
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:41,283
[SPEAKER_09]: As an educational leader, organizational manager, and advocate for her school community, she never wavered in cheerful service to her students and families.

176
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:49,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your 12 years of dedication and service to the students, staff, and families of the Medford Public Schools.

[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to say thank you, Madam Mayor Lungo-Koehn, and Superintendent Dr. Edward Vincent, and esteemed members of the school committee.

178
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:06,539
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a bittersweet time for me.

179
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:13,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm walking away from my Missittuck family that I have come to deeply care about and for over the past 12 years.

180
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:18,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I sincerely thank you for putting your faith in me all that time.

181
00:57:19,184 --> 00:57:25,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It has been my honor to serve the students, their families, and the staff at the best school in Medford, the Missittuck.

182
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:29,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it said that teaching is a work of heart.

183
00:57:29,675 --> 00:57:32,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then the Mississippi is filled with hardest.

184
00:57:34,138 --> 00:57:43,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried to be an involved, fair, open and honest leader, even serving some of your own children and working with some of your siblings.

185
00:57:44,566 --> 00:57:48,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Together, we have faced many challenges and I think came out stronger for it.

186
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I also wish to thank you with all of my heart for appointing Nancy Sherman Hudson as the next Mississippi principal.

188
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:07,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Her dedicated colors have shown for the past 11 years, and my job was made easier because she was by my side.

189
00:58:08,644 --> 00:58:19,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Her light shined even more brightly during my long-term absences, and I rested easier then, and I do again now, because I know that my school, our school,

190
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,192
[SPEAKER_07]: will be in such capable, amazing hands for the future.

191
00:58:24,093 --> 00:58:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: She has truly earned this opportunity, and I only hope that Nancy can find and hire her own Nancy.

192
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:36,441
[SPEAKER_07]: In closing, and to quote the Winnie the Pooh author A.A.

193
00:58:36,481 --> 00:58:41,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Milne, how lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard?

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your time tonight and for the years of support, and I wish you continued success here in Medford, as well as a relaxing summer.

195
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm finally ready to try to have one of those.

196
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:55,861

205
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:29,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids Corner has been a special place for so many of our Medford public schools and city of Medford staff

206
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:38,277
[SPEAKER_09]: as they entrusted their infants, toddlers and young children to the care and expertise of Linda and her team.

207
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:44,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for helping our youngest charges grow for over two decades.

208
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations on your retirement.

209
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:15,875
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first came to Kids Corner 24 years ago, in August of 2000, I was greeted and interviewed by two parent members.

210
01:01:15,975 --> 01:01:17,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a parent board back then.

211
01:01:18,276 --> 01:01:20,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And the parents, the teachers ran the program.

212
01:01:23,294 --> 01:01:27,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't realize at that time what an amazing journey professionally that I would go into.

213
01:01:28,198 --> 01:01:29,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been here for 24 years.

214
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought my daughter.

215
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:32,582
[SPEAKER_11]: She was 2.9.

216
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:34,543
[SPEAKER_11]: She's now 26 years old.

217
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:38,446
[SPEAKER_11]: My grandson now comes to the program with me a few days a week.

218
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:46,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a full cycle for me to have my family here, to have the honor to have worked with great people and

219
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:52,900
[SPEAKER_11]: families that have entrusted their kids to our care.

220
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,961
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been amazing.

221
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:56,784
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been an amazing journey that I'll never forget.

222
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am thrilled to have worked and mentored Ms.

223
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:03,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Christina Luongo Dudley for the last three years.

224
01:02:04,531 --> 01:02:12,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I am so thrilled that she will be continuing to run Kids Corner, and I know that she'll do a beautiful job.

225
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:23,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for everything for the faith of giving me in me and I'm just thrilled to be moving on but sad, sad to be leaving all the kids and the families.

226
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:24,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

227
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:46,638

[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you also for years of service, kindness, and dedication to the city of Medford and our students.

229
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,620

230
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

231
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

232
01:02:54,460 --> 01:03:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a picture with the whole school?

233
01:03:05,456 --> 01:03:05,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing?

234
01:03:06,437 --> 01:03:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing.

235
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cushing, we'll just do one quick one with the committee.

236
01:03:10,362 --> 01:03:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on up, quick.

237
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:11,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

238
01:03:11,763 --> 01:03:11,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Kay?

239
01:03:11,863 --> 01:03:12,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie?

240
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,643
[SPEAKER_04]: On special education tiered focus monitoring results, Ms.

241
01:04:17,683 --> 01:04:19,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services.

242
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:26,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

243
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:45,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in your packets tonight you'll find the slide deck that I'm presenting tonight, as well as the official report from Ted focus monitoring and a little cheat sheet that I gave everyone regarding the special education and civil rights criteria that I will be referencing in my report tonight.

244
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:49,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So to focus monitoring.

245
01:04:51,300 --> 01:05:09,832
[SPEAKER_12]: This is conducted by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Office of public school monitoring, and the purpose is that they want to monitor compliance within a school district in regards to regulatory requirements focusing on special education and civil rights.

246
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:15,878
[SPEAKER_12]: This is part of every three years we do a self-assessment and then there's an on-site visit.

247
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,423
[SPEAKER_12]: And this on-site visit was this past January 29th and 30th of 2024.

248
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:34,156
[SPEAKER_12]: In group A, districts and schools are monitored on an alternate set of universal standards and targeted standards every three years.

249
01:05:34,717 --> 01:05:40,621
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, Medford was in group A, which looks at the following universal standards and targeted standards.

250
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:47,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So we looked at, so we had focus monitoring, looked at student identification, IEP development,

251
01:05:49,073 --> 01:06:04,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Programming and support services equal opportunity and then the targeted standards were specific set of criteria that is will be mentioned later in this presentation, as well as compliance with all the special education legal standards.

252
01:06:07,165 --> 01:06:09,366
[SPEAKER_12]: So like I said, this occurs every three years.

253
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:16,530
[SPEAKER_12]: In the self-assessment phase, the district reviews special education and civil rights documentation.

254
01:06:17,691 --> 01:06:19,392
[SPEAKER_12]: They tell us what they're looking for.

255
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:31,399
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to identify the specific documents and what the processes that Medford follows, and then we have to upload them to a security portal where they review them prior to coming out to the visit.

256
01:06:32,545 --> 01:06:36,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So on completion of the self assessment we submitted this to the department for review.

257
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:41,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the onset on site phase occurred.

258
01:06:42,745 --> 01:06:46,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is when Desi came out, there were two representatives.

259
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:49,687
[SPEAKER_12]: They interviewed administrative, instructional, and support staff.

260
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:53,128
[SPEAKER_12]: They interviewed our co-chairs of CPAC.

261
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:59,110
[SPEAKER_12]: They also requested additional documents for special education and civil rights prior to their visit.

262
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:07,573
[SPEAKER_12]: One was the early literacy program that we needed to demonstrate that we're following that regulation and what our process was.

263
01:07:08,433 --> 01:07:24,399
[SPEAKER_12]: They also surveyed parents of students in special education and then they came and they did a review of student records, so they actually pulled 18 to 20 special education binders of students and they go through and they're looking through all of these elements.

264
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:40,218
[SPEAKER_12]: And once they complete that on-site visit, they provided us with the final report with the findings, and that includes ratings of commendable, partially implemented, implemented, not implemented, and implementation in progress.

265
01:07:42,076 --> 01:07:47,479
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the next slide, you'll see the summary for Medford of compliance in the criteria ratings.

266
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:53,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So all of the universal standards in special education, they're listed there.

267
01:07:53,582 --> 01:07:55,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the ones that were fully implemented.

268
01:07:57,164 --> 01:08:02,727
[SPEAKER_12]: The three or four civil rights, we were also found to be fully implemented in those as well.

269
01:08:02,747 --> 01:08:08,551
[SPEAKER_12]: And the partially implemented were special education criteria eight, 14, 18A and 20.

270
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:13,988
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'll explain those a little bit later.

271
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:17,871
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also ask for indicators.

272
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:22,974
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is information that we need to provide on a yearly basis to DESE.

273
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:27,597
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one is indicator 11, and that's initial evaluation timelines.

274
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:35,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to demonstrate that once a parent requests an evaluation, we're following the timeline that's been put forth to us.

275
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:38,364
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to evaluate within 30 days.

276
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:39,324
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to,

277
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:50,379
[SPEAKER_12]: complete all the paperwork within if the parent requests it reach out to them within five days so there's all these components of compliance that we were found fully compliant in this area.

278
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,663
[SPEAKER_12]: The next indicator can you go back one slide please.

279
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Indicator 12 is the early childhood transition.

280
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:10,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's looking at testing our students who are ages 2.9 prior to entering school to see if they require services, if they're found to have a disability.

281
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:20,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Students at this age are placed in our MEEP program, which is the Medford Early Education Program that we have at our elementary schools.

282
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:22,055
[SPEAKER_12]: So they look at this,

283
01:09:23,675 --> 01:09:34,811
[SPEAKER_12]: indicator and all the documentation that goes along with that to make sure that we have evaluated the student within the timelines and we were found to be compliant in that area as well.

284
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:40,452
[SPEAKER_12]: The last indicator is indicator 13, and that's about secondary transitions.

285
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:52,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is talking about, or looking at our students who have graduated from Medford High School, and we have to survey them every single year to see where they're at for the next three years.

286
01:09:52,537 --> 01:09:56,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to document that and then send that into DESE as well.

287
01:09:56,698 --> 01:10:00,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were found to be in full compliance in the secondary transitions as well.

288
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:13,383
[SPEAKER_12]: So the areas that we were found partially to be partially implemented are listed here and the first one is the team composition and attendance.

289
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:23,306
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the messages that we heard loud and clear was that the district was not consistent in what we were doing so it varied from school to school.

290
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:42,595
[SPEAKER_12]: We always didn't invite a special, I mean, a general education teacher, or if we did and they were absent, or a team member was absent, we weren't consistent in having the evaluation team leader fill out the excusal form and putting it into the student's binder.

291
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:47,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Special Education 14 review and revisions of IEPs.

292
01:10:48,824 --> 01:10:57,068
[SPEAKER_12]: This is making sure that we hold the annual meetings and three year re-evaluations prior to their anniversary.

293
01:10:57,908 --> 01:11:01,309
[SPEAKER_12]: What they found again, we were not consistent with this.

294
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:07,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And what it was, we weren't consistent in the documentation of why the meeting didn't happen on time.

295
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:08,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we,

296
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:38,022
[SPEAKER_12]: we're looking at with the meeting invitation is if it was rescheduled we didn't indicate the reason why it was rescheduled or if we missed a timeline we should have told them ahead of time like we've identified this as an area of need and we need to do a little more professional development and training with our staff but it was in the 18 records it was inconsistent in a few records so that's why there was the finding of partially partially implementing

297
01:11:39,468 --> 01:11:45,813
[SPEAKER_12]: The next slide is 18 a, and that is in regards to our students with autism.

298
01:11:46,213 --> 01:11:58,642
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a specific specific autism checklist that has to be checked off about students with autism and how their disability impacts them and socially emotionally academically.

299
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:04,199
[SPEAKER_12]: We have different forms that we're using in different buildings.

300
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:11,162
[SPEAKER_12]: The TED Focus Monitoring person was letting us know that that form should be consistent across the board.

301
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:20,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also have to be consistent in where we document it in the IEP to let us know that this is an area of need and how it's going to be addressed.

302
01:12:22,113 --> 01:12:29,557
[SPEAKER_12]: On a positive note with the new IEP format that's coming out in the fall, this is all embedded into the new IEP format.

303
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:40,262
[SPEAKER_12]: So it won't be separate forms, it will all be in there and we'll be able to see the identified need and then where we are going to address that in the IEP.

304
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:41,663
[SPEAKER_12]: So the formats will be

305
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:48,660
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about that a lot in the fall, but it's really putting all that information into the one document.

306
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:54,864
[SPEAKER_12]: But we still have to make sure that we're making improvements to make sure it's documented correctly in the IEP.

307
01:12:56,519 --> 01:13:06,541
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the last part is SE20, which in the IEP is the section called non-participation justification.

308
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:18,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that component of the IEP, we have to address why a student is removed from the general education setting and why this is the least restrictive setting for that student.

309
01:13:18,683 --> 01:13:20,884
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to vary student by student.

310
01:13:21,804 --> 01:13:29,828
[SPEAKER_12]: What DESE reported was we weren't always include all aspects of why the student needed to be removed.

311
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:33,569
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to be a little more clear about the disability related needs.

312
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:37,151
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to be more specific about the why.

313
01:13:37,511 --> 01:13:44,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we also need to be more specific about how we are going to have that student return to the least restrictive program.

314
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:49,155
[SPEAKER_12]: So those were the information that they provided to us.

315
01:13:50,016 --> 01:13:55,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I did meet with our representative from DESE on Friday afternoon.

316
01:13:56,078 --> 01:14:03,780
[SPEAKER_12]: She has told us what we have to do for the next steps, which is a corrective action plan for those four areas that were partially implemented.

317
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:05,701
[SPEAKER_12]: She sent me the forms.

318
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:06,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on them.

319
01:14:06,701 --> 01:14:10,583
[SPEAKER_12]: They will be submitted to DESE by Friday.

320
01:14:11,423 --> 01:14:31,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And then internally we have to do the work with our evaluation team leaders, our special education coordinators, making sure that we are following the compliance that Jesse has set out, and we have to do a self monitoring process throughout the next year in which we have to upload that evidence to the security portal to let them know that we

321
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:34,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Got your information, we've made changes.

322
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:37,134
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the trainings that we've provided to staff.

323
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the process that we're following going forward.

324
01:14:41,078 --> 01:14:45,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So I met with the evaluation team leaders last Wednesday and we went through the document.

325
01:14:45,924 --> 01:14:50,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I went through the document today with the special education coordinators and my weekly slate meeting.

326
01:14:51,610 --> 01:15:04,540
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the phone call on Friday with Jesse, and I'm hoping to have the corrective action plan submitted Friday, she will review it, they will tell us if it's accepted, and then we do the work going forward.

327
01:15:05,361 --> 01:15:08,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the Ted focus monitoring I think, for the most part.

328
01:15:08,643 --> 01:15:13,226
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a really good job of documenting all the different special ed criteria.

329
01:15:13,706 --> 01:15:22,491
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have some work to do, and that's what we're starting to do now before the end of the school year, and we will have things put into place for when we return in August.

330
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:25,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any specific questions regarding TAID focus monitoring?

331
01:15:27,114 --> 01:15:28,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the presentation, Ms.

332
01:15:28,234 --> 01:15:28,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen.

333
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:28,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

334
01:15:31,456 --> 01:15:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

335
01:15:33,077 --> 01:15:34,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one question.

336
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:37,900
[SPEAKER_14]: When we look at

337
01:15:38,732 --> 01:15:57,289
[SPEAKER_14]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, moderator, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her, she-her

338
01:16:01,713 --> 01:16:09,722
[SPEAKER_14]: a normal part of the practice that like we're monitoring ourselves and there are no surprises when we get to somebody else monitoring us.

339
01:16:09,822 --> 01:16:21,474
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's, that's part of the corrective action plan so I have built in timelines so like every month we're going to take a look at the non part we're going to start a working group with the non participation justification statements.

340
01:16:21,854 --> 01:16:23,176
[SPEAKER_12]: So each individual.

341
01:16:24,557 --> 01:16:29,018
[SPEAKER_12]: criteria that was found partially implemented, I have to come up with a plan just like that.

342
01:16:29,138 --> 01:16:37,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have to say, this is how the training is going, but this is how we're monitoring ourselves throughout the school year to make sure that that is happening.

343
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:53,964
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will definitely, I'll be able to bring you information probably in the fall, like where we're at, what we've done so far and what I have found by doing like spot checks or things like that, having the ETLs bring information to the meeting and taking a look at that information there.

344
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:54,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

345
01:16:54,931 --> 01:17:06,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it would be great for us to be able to have some sort of report from you say in like January before we crush into all things budget and end of school year.

346
01:17:07,783 --> 01:17:18,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be, I think if we think about like December, January timeframe would be a good time to hear back from you about what kind of independent auditing you're doing and whether you're finding that we are solving

347
01:17:19,451 --> 01:17:21,312
[SPEAKER_14]: the problem for these and the other measures as well.

348
01:17:21,392 --> 01:17:22,792
[SPEAKER_12]: So okay, absolutely.

349
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:23,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

350
01:17:24,793 --> 01:17:27,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Branley, do we have a special department head at every school?

351
01:17:28,514 --> 01:17:36,537
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have Yes, we have special, we have special educators, sorry, specially coordinators who oversee two schools.

352
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:39,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Oversee two schools.

353
01:17:39,638 --> 01:17:39,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

354
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:48,521
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have, and then we have a coordinator of related services, and then Stacey Shulman, who oversees counseling behavioral health.

355
01:17:49,133 --> 01:17:59,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just curious, like who checks those packets at the end, like some of these are just, you know, pages in the IP in this that like we have a checklist and some of all that we go through every single thing, which is my job.

356
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:10,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go through that checklist every single day, you know, so I'm just curious, like when I don't see that autism checklist, I reach back out to the team lead or to the department and said, hey, you know, there's just a page missing.

357
01:18:11,038 --> 01:18:11,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hold this aside.

358
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:13,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So who's doing that double check?

359
01:18:13,059 --> 01:18:16,340
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the the ETLs, that's their responsibility.

360
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:24,262
[SPEAKER_12]: But we do I think that's part of the compliance process is who's going to double check what they're doing, who's going to ensure that those documents are there.

361
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's part of the plan that we're putting forward.

362
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:27,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

363
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

364
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:29,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Topper.

365
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:35,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you miss Bowen for this report I just had a quick question just because it's my first time sitting on this committee or these.

366
01:18:36,694 --> 01:18:50,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So the ones that are partially implemented in terms of trends in the past years, is this something that is abnormal normal that were partially implemented in these areas, or just curious to see if there's a trend going on of us.

367
01:18:51,334 --> 01:18:56,942
[SPEAKER_08]: missing the same things or are we or is this all new, so it's all new information that Jesse was looking at.

368
01:18:57,582 --> 01:19:04,091
[SPEAKER_12]: So I could go back to maybe six years ago prior to me to see what was found and compare.

369
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:26,399
[SPEAKER_12]: we just need to do a better job of training and making sure it's a very difficult job that the ETLs have and you know mistakes happen but I want consistency and then I want the coordinators to make sure that this is happening and then I would be the last eyes to make sure that because it's ultimately ultimately my responsibility to make sure that we're in compliance.

370
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:32,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah I just want to make sure yeah because these things you know like I understand there's a lot but these are sort of things that we need to make sure that we are

371
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,706
[SPEAKER_08]: fully implemented all the time.

372
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:38,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted, I was just curious to see if this is something historically the district has lacked on.

373
01:19:39,736 --> 01:19:45,018
[SPEAKER_12]: or if it's- Last time they looked at very few special education criteria and civil rights.

374
01:19:45,138 --> 01:19:46,179
[SPEAKER_12]: This was the big year.

375
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:51,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I tend to think in three years from now, they'll be looking at more civil rights criteria.

376
01:19:52,141 --> 01:19:53,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So it changes every three years.

377
01:19:53,982 --> 01:19:56,163
[SPEAKER_12]: But I could see if I could find the report.

378
01:19:56,223 --> 01:19:57,964
[SPEAKER_12]: All the reports are public by the way.

379
01:19:57,984 --> 01:20:02,326
[SPEAKER_12]: So even the corrective action plan will be posted on the website.

380
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So I could take a look at the previous

381
01:20:06,246 --> 01:20:11,080
[SPEAKER_12]: similar and to see if it was same sort of findings from the last time.

382
01:20:11,381 --> 01:20:11,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

383
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:12,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

384
01:20:12,945 --> 01:20:14,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr Edwin Vincent.

385
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:30,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say thank you to miss Bowen into all the special educators and administrators who really worked on this tip focus monitoring visit that took a lot of time, a lot of meetings CPAC was involved.

386
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers staff.

387
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:38,642
[SPEAKER_09]: As a district I feel like this is a very strong report that we should be proud of.

388
01:20:39,402 --> 01:21:00,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that there are four indicators that are definitely partially implemented, if you look back at slide six, if it was a reverse, it would have been like everything needs to be done over so the fact that it's a specific area, we have to keep doing what we're doing that as well and then addressing all of the areas that are

389
01:21:01,045 --> 01:21:02,085
[SPEAKER_09]: partially implemented.

390
01:21:02,185 --> 01:21:05,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to say thank you for all of this work.

391
01:21:05,786 --> 01:21:12,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to put all of the documentation together took close to a year of, you know, gathering documents.

392
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:14,548
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a very, very lengthy process.

393
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:16,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to say thank you for your hard work.

394
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:17,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

395
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:23,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

396
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:24,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Miss Bowen.

397
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:28,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have a report on tobacco free generation.

398
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

399
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

400
01:21:40,322 --> 01:21:42,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

401
01:21:42,504 --> 01:21:49,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to present tonight on the tobacco-free generation and almost expand it to the nicotine-free generation.

402
01:21:50,889 --> 01:22:08,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is is a proposal that's moving through boards of health across Massachusetts, really focused on the fact that while years ago we beat back cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, and other smoking devices that students, that children use,

403
01:22:09,402 --> 01:22:12,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We then opened the door for vaping e-cigarettes.

404
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:22,127
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, if you're not aware of it, a product known as Zin, tobacco pouches that, I'm sorry, nicotine pouches, they give you a direct hit of nicotine.

405
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proposal is that,

406
01:22:28,018 --> 01:22:41,363
[SPEAKER_00]: The date would be anyone born after January 1st, I just want to make sure I get it right, 2004, I believe, would be unable to purchase tobacco or nicotine products.

407
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:48,826
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I think this is really important, and normally I'm someone who believes that adults should be able to make their own decisions, the problem is is that

408
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:59,994
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of students, according to CDC numbers, 90% of lifelong tobacco users are addicted by the time they're 18.

409
01:23:00,034 --> 01:23:03,877
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our children don't have a fighting chance.

410
01:23:04,738 --> 01:23:14,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who represents the Metro Public Schools and other students, in all honesty, we're facing a vaping epidemic in our schools.

411
01:23:15,946 --> 01:23:16,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And

412
01:23:19,226 --> 01:23:30,911
[SPEAKER_00]: requesting your support on this initiative as the Medford Public Schools, myself included, will go before the Board of Health requesting that this pass in Medford.

413
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:37,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's passed in Winchester and in other cities and towns across the Commonwealth, and we're moving forward.

414
01:23:43,036 --> 01:23:44,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

415
01:23:44,056 --> 01:23:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham, and then Member Ruseau.

416
01:23:48,251 --> 01:24:12,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I see here that you're also requesting that we support an administrative action review to strengthen school district tobacco policies to ensure that e-cigarettes, vaping, nicotine pouches are fully addressed in a preventative and restorative approaches that focus on health outcomes consistent with our mission to support students in the schoolhouse and provide opportunities for community dialogue on health risks of all tobacco and nicotine use.

417
01:24:13,223 --> 01:24:18,064
[SPEAKER_14]: and encourage campuses to promote health messaging to educators, students, and staff.

418
01:24:18,624 --> 01:24:35,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I am fully on board with that, but I want to remind everybody that we have a suspension policy that limits our use of out-of-school suspension as a disciplinary measure to a series of criteria that were laid out in the memo by the administration.

419
01:24:35,967 --> 01:24:38,887
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is not on the list.

420
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:42,388
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to call that out because I have heard

421
01:24:43,064 --> 01:24:45,986
[SPEAKER_14]: situations where students are being suspended for that reason.

422
01:24:46,006 --> 01:24:55,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to say that suspending a kid so they can go home and vape is not the answer to tightening up our policies.

423
01:24:56,553 --> 01:25:07,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm in support of this and happy to otherwise make a motion to recommend that we support the tobacco and nicotine free generation.

424
01:25:10,526 --> 01:25:12,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ruseau.

425
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:13,487
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

426
01:25:14,468 --> 01:25:14,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

427
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:15,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

428
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:17,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

429
01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:19,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

430
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:19,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

431
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:29,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We have summer literacy offerings for grade 1 through 5, and 6 through 9 report is going to be given to us by Dr. Suzanne Galussi, assistant superintendent.

432
01:25:31,056 --> 01:25:31,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

433
01:25:33,557 --> 01:25:34,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

434
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:37,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just here to update you.

435
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:50,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Chiesa had applied a couple months ago for the Vacation Acceleration Academy Grant through Governor Healey's office and the Department of Education.

436
01:25:51,152 --> 01:25:55,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And on May 2nd, Medford Public Schools was awarded with that grant.

437
01:25:56,655 --> 01:25:57,936
[SPEAKER_02]: The sum will be $42,000.

438
01:25:58,836 --> 01:26:05,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just here to let you know and update you on how we are going to fulfill that grant.

439
01:26:07,654 --> 01:26:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So the grant is used for acceleration during vacation periods that can be summer, or that could be one of the vacation weeks we are electing for this summer.

440
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:23,905
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure that we are minimizing some of that literacy growth that we've seen in our students.

441
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:31,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are really focusing on the elementary levels, as well as the transitional grades of six and nine.

442
01:26:32,628 --> 01:26:39,350
[SPEAKER_02]: With that $42,000, we will hire licensed educators, Medford Public School educators.

443
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have several that have already

444
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: given interest.

445
01:26:43,752 --> 01:27:06,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Of that list will just include elementary classroom teachers, licensed reading teachers, at the secondary level English teachers, and then part of this program, I will get into the structure of it in a little bit, but part of the grant highly suggests that we have some specialist activities for students.

446
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:11,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will also be art-based activities and that will include the

447
01:27:12,802 --> 01:27:21,704
[SPEAKER_02]: inclusion of physical education teacher and an elementary nexus teacher, and also coverage by school nurse.

448
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, paraprofessional or behaviorist support may be included in the staffing needs.

449
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:33,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be a one-week program.

450
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:37,836
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will be housed at the McGlynn School Complex.

451
01:27:38,797 --> 01:27:49,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And last week on Friday, caregivers received the invitations from me to register their students if they are interested.

452
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It will run the week of July 29th to August 1st, and it's a full day program.

453
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So instruction will run from nine to two with drop off at 8.45.

454
01:28:03,593 --> 01:28:18,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick up a 215 a lunch in a recess period and a specialist period will be included and students will receive if they would like free breakfast and free lunch will be offered to the students.

455
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, just to speak about the format.

456
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:30,012
[SPEAKER_02]: At the elementary level, there are two lanes for this grant opportunity.

457
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:34,633
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the early literacy program, and the other is the ELA program.

458
01:28:35,113 --> 01:28:45,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So per the grant requirements, the early literacy program is targeting rising students in grade one to three, that's currently students in grades K through two.

459
01:28:47,376 --> 01:28:49,297
[SPEAKER_02]: The invitations that,

460
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:53,151
[SPEAKER_02]: some families received for their children to participate in this program.

461
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The primary focus of data was DIBLS.

462
01:28:57,092 --> 01:29:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at the DIBLS scores throughout the school year with a particular focus on the middle of the year and the end of the year results.

463
01:29:05,295 --> 01:29:16,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And then therefore the, excuse me, the curriculum that will be used for working with the students this summer will be our existing curriculum of the inter-reading, ECRI,

464
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:19,471
[SPEAKER_02]: with some supplemental Lexia Core 5.

465
01:29:20,832 --> 01:29:30,198
[SPEAKER_02]: The ELA program at the elementary level is for students rising grades four and five, so that's your current third graders and fourth graders.

466
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:44,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the primary form of data that we used for invitations was DIBLS, but we also looked at MAP growth scores as well as MCAS data because we have that for the students.

467
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:55,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the primary focus is on developing, continuing to develop those grade-level literacy skills that are gonna help ease their transition to the next year.

468
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:58,759
[SPEAKER_02]: The curricular is the same.

469
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:11,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the inter-reading program, as well as supplemental materials that we use, Lexia Core 5, NewZella, and some MPS-created materials.

470
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:27,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for students in those transitional grades of rising grade six and rising grade nine, again, if DIBELS was a component, we did review DIBELS data.

471
01:30:28,509 --> 01:30:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: We have them for those current fifth grade students that are moving on to sixth grade.

472
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And DIBELS is also used, as previously mentioned, for students receiving intervention at the middle school level.

473
01:30:40,552 --> 01:30:49,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So when applicable, we used DIBL scores as well as MAP growth data and MCAS data to determine invitations.

474
01:30:50,414 --> 01:31:03,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the focus is the same on looking at the grade level skills that students need with looking at those anchor standards that are going to assist the students moving forward.

475
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:20,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So the curriculum materials are the existing MPS materials that we utilize, as well as looking at some of the summer reading components to assist students with that, as well as the supplemental materials of the Alexia Power Up and New Zella.

476
01:31:21,948 --> 01:31:24,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

477
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

478
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:26,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Question from the chair, if you don't mind.

479
01:31:26,852 --> 01:31:27,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

480
01:31:27,693 --> 01:31:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would be invited to partake in this?

481
01:31:31,883 --> 01:31:33,944
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as who will be invited, I guess.

482
01:31:34,764 --> 01:31:41,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used the student data in order to determine the invitations for students.

483
01:31:41,566 --> 01:31:52,389
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the grant per the Department of Education, is to make sure that your invitations are using benchmark data as well as statewide data.

484
01:31:52,469 --> 01:32:00,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used, DIBLS was primary at the elementary level, and then we also used our MAP growth data, MCAS data,

485
01:32:02,233 --> 01:32:03,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all of our benchmark data.

486
01:32:03,535 --> 01:32:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they haven't gone out already, when will parents or guardians get the invitation?

487
01:32:08,744 --> 01:32:10,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went out on Friday.

488
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The emails went out.

489
01:32:13,412 --> 01:32:14,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally sent them all.

490
01:32:15,962 --> 01:32:20,786
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out on Friday, so it would be from my email for anybody at home listening.

491
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:24,268
[SPEAKER_02]: They could search my email, or they could reach out to me directly.

492
01:32:24,328 --> 01:32:32,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already been corresponding with a few parent questions here or there, and there's an attached embedded survey link to register students.

493
01:32:34,135 --> 01:32:35,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many students total?

494
01:32:36,696 --> 01:32:45,122
[SPEAKER_02]: So the grant regulations, where we are looking to see, we know that the invites range per grade level.

495
01:32:45,771 --> 01:32:49,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I can provide that data to you if you would like.

496
01:32:49,913 --> 01:32:51,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're waiting to see what the participation will be.

497
01:32:52,255 --> 01:32:59,199
[SPEAKER_02]: The requirement for the grant is that each classroom needs to have no more than a group of 10 to 12 students.

498
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:05,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So our staffing will fluctuate depending on the response for participation that we get.

499
01:33:07,084 --> 01:33:10,406
[SPEAKER_02]: We have healthy staffing interest right now, which is wonderful.

500
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:11,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

501
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:12,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

502
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:13,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

503
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:28,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Around the invitations to parents, caregivers, I suppose there's no way to confirm receipt, of course, and spam filters and all the other things that get in the way of our actually getting to an email.

504
01:33:31,087 --> 01:33:38,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Assuming that we're not inviting 1,000 people, can we include in the process to investigate

505
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:44,821
[SPEAKER_10]: any affirmative declines to understand why.

506
01:33:44,841 --> 01:34:06,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that's something that, you know, understanding why we've offered a service, you acknowledge that we've offered the service, and then you say, no, I think it would be helpful to understand why so that we can perhaps in a future year, it'll always just be useful information in general, because we don't have a lot of opportunities for that kind of information.

507
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:09,076
[SPEAKER_10]: but really understanding why people would decline it.

508
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:10,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I'm sure that's going to happen.

509
01:34:10,918 --> 01:34:13,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, maybe they're away on vacation that week or.

510
01:34:14,244 --> 01:34:18,487
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are plenty of reasons for which we can do nothing about and that's fine.

511
01:34:18,928 --> 01:34:26,994
[SPEAKER_10]: But are there reasons like transportation or they have to watch a sibling during the day?

512
01:34:27,474 --> 01:34:30,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the kinds of things I think that could be useful information.

513
01:34:30,156 --> 01:34:38,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we think about students that have been identified as needing services, making sure they can get them is super important.

514
01:34:38,342 --> 01:34:39,203
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

515
01:34:39,471 --> 01:34:41,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Much agreed, I can work on that, absolutely.

516
01:34:41,452 --> 01:34:52,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the partnership with school leaders, as well as the reading teachers at the elementary level and through with Dr. Nicole Chiesa, I think we can easily get that done.

517
01:34:54,295 --> 01:35:03,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think often, I don't typically, I think the bigger piece is that some just don't participate.

518
01:35:03,883 --> 01:35:17,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we'll have to have that outreach to make sure we're understanding why I can do that, as well as make sure that I use that same group of people to further make further follow up on the invitations.

519
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:18,761
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

520
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

521
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:21,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

522
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:29,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask about targeted follow-up, because we know that response rates tend to be low among some of your invited populations.

523
01:35:29,943 --> 01:35:34,566
[SPEAKER_05]: My other question is, how are you going to be measuring the success of the institute?

524
01:35:34,806 --> 01:35:37,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it comparing the people who did it and didn't, who were all issued invitations?

525
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:40,670
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we know that this program worked?

526
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:41,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

527
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,071
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a great question.

528
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We've definitely been talking about that.

529
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:48,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be pre-assessments as well as post-assessments.

530
01:35:48,135 --> 01:35:51,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a one-week program.

531
01:35:52,175 --> 01:35:55,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are going to be utilizing a pre-assessment and a post-assessment.

532
01:35:57,768 --> 01:36:04,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think we've seen the data that we have at the elementary level around dibbles.

533
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:14,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going classroom by classroom and really looking at the growth that we've seen, which has been tremendous, especially at the lower levels.

534
01:36:15,523 --> 01:36:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we'll be able to kind of see a little bit of that.

535
01:36:19,066 --> 01:36:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're hoping to see is a little bit of that bump

536
01:36:22,128 --> 01:36:42,203
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why we're targeting the week that we're doing this kind of right in the middle of the summer, which that last week of July into that first, we noticed that we're kind of hoping to like catch that right in the middle and not wait through the whole entire summer to offer this this opportunity.

537
01:36:42,283 --> 01:36:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

538
01:36:42,623 --> 01:36:49,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingers crossed, because we also have the end of year dibbles data and and then the beginning of the year dibbles data.

539
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:58,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping that we're going to see that progress maintained with that check in the middle of the summer.

540
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

541
01:37:00,422 --> 01:37:01,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

542
01:37:01,783 --> 01:37:03,704

[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_04]: We have our seventh and final report of the superintendent recommendation to approve the school year 24-25 school committee meeting calendar.

576
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:14,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

577
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:23,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, I have shared with you the proposed dates for next school year.

578
01:38:24,274 --> 01:38:28,377
[SPEAKER_09]: All meetings at this point in time scheduled to start at 6pm.

579
01:38:29,518 --> 01:38:38,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm looking for the approval of the committee if these dates seem like they will work for the committee.

580
01:38:39,105 --> 01:38:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

581
01:38:42,648 --> 01:38:46,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, I just had a couple of questions or potential amendments.

582
01:38:47,895 --> 01:39:03,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Sarah Silver, PB): Um, so I would like to maybe amend the motion to approve with the addition of a meeting on Monday, June 9 Sarah Silver, PB): We inevitably cannot get out of June with two meetings.

583
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:05,170
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not possible.

584
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,051
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would rather

585
01:39:06,914 --> 01:39:15,538
[SPEAKER_14]: see us have the time scheduled and decide we don't need it, then be left scrambling for a date, which we're actively doing right now to do the budget.

586
01:39:16,258 --> 01:39:18,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're like running out of days in June.

587
01:39:18,699 --> 01:39:21,721
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of people like waiting with bated breath to hear what we have to say.

588
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:26,023
[SPEAKER_14]: So one amendment would be the addition of June 9th.

589
01:39:26,763 --> 01:39:31,025
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would also like to propose that we put the two budget hearings on this calendar.

590
01:39:32,225 --> 01:39:33,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And my proposal would be

591
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:38,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Wednesday, February 26 and Wednesday, April 30.

592
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:46,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And I picked those Wednesdays because those are the weeks immediately following February and April vacation.

593
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:48,730
[SPEAKER_14]: So I feel like a Monday budget meeting would

594
01:39:49,429 --> 01:39:58,435
[SPEAKER_14]: A, be really hard for the administration to get ready for, but B, would be really hard for people to motivate to get to from a public perspective.

595
01:39:58,535 --> 01:40:13,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So in keeping with the resolution that we just passed, those would work within the timeline that we established, but I would like to see them just be added right to the calendar so that we can all put them in our calendars.

596
01:40:13,826 --> 01:40:16,147
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's something that we decide that we don't need,

597
01:40:17,108 --> 01:40:18,109
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be amazing.

598
01:40:18,189 --> 01:40:23,393
[SPEAKER_14]: But also we sort of crush into the end of the year and there's not enough time to do all the things that we need to do.

599
01:40:23,493 --> 01:40:32,199
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was hoping we could maybe add those few things so that we can chart a slightly better, less chaotic course next year.

600
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,562
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be 226 for the budget hearing.

601
01:40:36,582 --> 01:40:41,045
[SPEAKER_14]: A second budget hearing sort of if required on 430.

602
01:40:45,273 --> 01:40:51,936
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would say if required, because there's some language about when we would do a second budget hearing.

603
01:40:53,617 --> 01:41:02,401
[SPEAKER_13]: And whoever is typing, could you just put if required right next to that?

604
01:41:03,162 --> 01:41:04,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it you, Dr. Eby?

605
01:41:07,804 --> 01:41:08,144
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Lisa.

606
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Lisa.

607
01:41:11,852 --> 01:41:13,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was like, who's typing?

608
01:41:14,874 --> 01:41:15,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

609
01:41:16,496 --> 01:41:20,819
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other budget meeting to add to the calendar would be June 9th.

610
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll amend my motion to include those dates.

611
01:41:28,365 --> 01:41:28,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

612
01:41:28,685 --> 01:41:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I accept the amendment, whatever it is.

613
01:41:30,427 --> 01:41:34,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval as amended by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Graham.

614
01:41:35,671 --> 01:41:37,392
[SPEAKER_14]: That June 9th wouldn't be a budget meeting.

615
01:41:37,452 --> 01:41:39,414
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a regular meeting.

616
01:41:41,598 --> 01:41:45,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you put it as either or regular slash budget?

617
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:46,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we could do that.

618
01:41:59,406 --> 01:42:00,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Intoppa?

619
01:42:00,867 --> 01:42:00,967
Oh.

620
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:14,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

621
01:42:14,979 --> 01:42:16,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval as amended.

622
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:17,300
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

623
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

624
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

625
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:22,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Calendar has been approved as amended.

626
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no presentations of the public.

627
01:42:31,803 --> 01:42:33,624
[SPEAKER_04]: No new business, no reports are requested.

628
01:42:33,684 --> 01:42:34,924
[SPEAKER_04]: We have condolences.

629
01:42:35,004 --> 01:42:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Livio

630
01:42:42,213 --> 01:42:47,255
[SPEAKER_04]: the dice father of Alyssa pillion paraprofessional at the Brooks Elementary School.

631
01:42:48,596 --> 01:42:59,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And the members of the medical school committee expressed their sincere condolences the family of Julie O'Neill Julie served as an elementary school teacher for over 40 years at the Medford public schools feel may rise for a moment of silence please.

632
01:43:11,052 --> 01:43:11,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

633
01:43:11,432 --> 01:43:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are, as Member Graham mentioned, working on a final budget approval date to be determined.

634
01:43:17,959 --> 01:43:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there a motion to adjourn?

635
01:43:19,881 --> 01:43:22,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeld, seconded by...
