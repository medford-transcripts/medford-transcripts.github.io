00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,336
Member Kratz.

39
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:04,036
Yes.

40
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:05,837
Member McLaughlin, yes.

41
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:06,617
Member McStone.

42
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:08,598
Yes.

43
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,489
Member Rousseau?

44
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:11,670
Yes.

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,230
Member Van de Kloot?

46
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:13,771
Yes.

47
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:15,471
Mayor Longo-Curran?

48
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:17,212
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

49
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:17,932
Zero in the negative.

50
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:21,694
We are going to go into executive session and revert out as soon as possible.

51
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:36,047
We are exiting our executive session meeting.

52
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:38,149
We are a couple minutes late, but pretty good for time, 637.

53
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,011
We are recording.

54
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,254
We already took the roll and saluted the flag.

55
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:53,283
And if I may just take a moment, I just want to recognize that there are often topics that are controversial in nature.

56
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:57,731
that many have opinions, strong opinions, one way or another.

57
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:59,392
I respect that.

58
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:03,074
I respect respectful dialogue and debate.

59
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:21,946
But what happened last Wednesday, which was obviously a topic of contention, the insults and the name calling, even after I had asked for people to be respectful, will not be tolerated.

60
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:41,229
If somebody uses or calls another person on the Zoom or a member of the admin or a member of the school committee or vice versa, a name or is insulting, you will be muted and you will not be allowed to speak for the rest of the meeting.

61
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:45,772
If any of my colleagues object, please let me know at the time.

62
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:52,977
And I'll ask Dr. Cushing if he can also monitor that because insults and disrespect

63
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:56,512
name calling will not be tolerated.

64
00:31:58,373 --> 00:31:59,113
Member McLaughlin.

65
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:01,034
Thank you, Mayor.

66
00:32:01,174 --> 00:32:08,316
And can I also ask that in following Robert's rules of orders that anyone that is addressing any member of the committee speaks through the chair.

67
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,297
So again, that's Robert's rules.

68
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,138
The requirement is that you speak to the chair.

69
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:16,059
We do not speak directly to members.

70
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,279
Thank you.

71
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:18,560
Less personal.

72
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,020
Thank you.

73
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,601
Yes, through the chair and name and address will be taken for the record.

74
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,896
name and address before you speak, please.

75
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:31,219
And that will be for this school committee meeting, and we will follow those rules for every school committee moving forward.

76
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,781
Next up, we have approval of minutes.

77
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:41,404
That was the March 8th, 2021 school committee meeting, our regular meeting.

78
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:42,985
If there is a motion for approval.

79
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:45,546

Next up, we have number six, report of committees.

First up, member Kretz, you're the chair of the building and ground subcommittee meeting, which took place on March 3rd, 2021.

119
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:25,941
Yes, I read the minutes, I read the abbreviated minutes at the last meeting, and for some reason, I forgot to motion to approve the minutes.

120
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:31,044
We did take a vote on what we voted on during the meeting, and it just flipped my mind.

121
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:34,066
So I'm making a motion to approve the minutes.

122
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:34,767
Second.

123
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,469

141
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:05,234
If you could give a brief synopsis.

142
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:11,658
Mayor, I'm gonna ask if you could just skip to the next item of business and take this up last.

143
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:17,381
I'm switching back and forth, because I also have community participation letters, and so I'm not quite ready.

144
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:22,284
So if you could just do some of the other subcommittees first, I'd appreciate it.

145
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,605
Yes, number three, committee of the whole meeting, March 10th, 2021.

That was myself.

147
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,770
That was our meeting.

148
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:31,631
Mayor?

149
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,853
Yes, Member Russo.

150
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:36,214
I'd like to motion to table this.

151
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:44,159
It was a very, very, very long set of minutes for a long meeting, and I need more time to digest the minutes.

152
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,681
Motion to table by Member Russo, seconded by... Second.

153
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,902

Member Van de Kloet.

165
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:06,182

173
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:22,493
Good evening, everyone.

174
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:35,484
Our personnel and budget committee, we had member Van de Kloet and member Kretz present, and our assistant superintendent, Mr. Murray, shared our dates for the upcoming budget.

175
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:40,746
So I don't know if we can screen share the dates so people can see.

176
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:46,209
And Mr. Murphy, I'm sorry, Collins teachers, Mr. David Murray, and you have Mr. David Murphy.

177
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:47,570
I always confuse the two of you.

178
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,490
No problem at all.

179
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,252
It's an honor to be associated with a teacher in the public schools.

180
00:36:52,873 --> 00:37:01,055
So we went through the dates in the process for budget season, which will be upon us sooner than later.

181
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:06,777
And this is just for people to make notes of when they would like to tune in.

182
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:16,260
We have not set an exact time yet, just waiting for everyone's schedules to be consolidated so we can see what time is best.

183
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,242
Mr. Murphy, I don't know if you have anything to add about under each topic.

184
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,292
they encompass more than everything that's listed.

185
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,013
Right, so these are the umbrella topics.

186
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:46,022
And so particularly for some of those in the later part of this, the special education and central office and whatnot, those will incorporate a number of departments in which that will be highlighted as part of the budget process.

187
00:37:46,923 --> 00:37:50,565
With regard to the start times where there are other

188
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,963
forums and community meetings that are being held within this time frame.

189
00:37:55,003 --> 00:38:00,507
And so we're just holding off a little bit on the scheduling, but they'll generally be evening meetings.

190
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:09,333
So for members of the community that intend to participate, they can expect that the start times will be sometime between 5.30 p.m.

191
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:13,516
and 7.30 p.m., depending on what else is scheduled for that night.

192
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:18,800
It'll also probably depend on, some of them may be two hours, some of them may be an hour.

193
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:29,072
And so we'll try to, we'll provide as much specificity in advance as possible, so folks can be sure to attend and or participate as they see fit.

194
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:31,073
Thank you.

195
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:39,036
Member McLaughlin, I'm not sure if I call on you because it's the building subcommittee, or Maya, do you call on Member McLaughlin?

196
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:40,737
Member McLaughlin, sorry, Member McLaughlin.

197
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:42,482
Thank you.

198
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:43,723
Thank you for sharing this.

199
00:38:43,783 --> 00:39:00,075
I just wanted to say to members of the community that it's really worth and worthwhile and interesting to come to these budget hearings if you really want to understand the sort of behind the scenes machinations of how things are decided and in what way things are funded.

200
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:08,762
So I really encourage participation for folks who want a clear understanding of what is being funded in our schools and how.

201
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:10,503
Thank you, Member McStone.

202
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:12,468
Thank you.

203
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,750
Thank you.

204
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,051
Motion for approval of the minutes.

205
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,355
Motion for approval.

206
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:21,336
Member Graham.

207
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:23,942
Before we color.

208
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:24,483
Thank you.

209
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:25,924
Yeah, I just had a quick question.

210
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:39,658
When, when I was reading the minutes, I did not see reference to the question that we posed last year around What items that are not part of the budget would improve student outcomes.

211
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:45,163
And I want to make sure that the departments provide that information to us again this year so that we can

212
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:54,257
start to compare that list year over year and make sure that we can issue a similar memo to the community about sort of where that funding landed.

213
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,158
Was that part of the discussion or can it be included in the budget?

214
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:02,600
Certainly can be included in the presentation.

215
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:14,303
You mean essentially the priorities that are not necessarily part of the superintendent's recommendation to the school committee, but would in the view of various administrators

216
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,154
be impactful with regard to student outcomes?

217
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:22,377
Yes, I can send you the working documents that we used last year if that's helpful.

218
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:27,960
Sure, I assume that the June 29 memo was the culmination of that discussion, correct?

219
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,942
Yeah, I have a spreadsheet that I can send your way, though, that's able to be manipulated.

220
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:33,943
Sure.

221
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:38,525
Member McLaughlin, Member Russo?

222
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,370
Yes, thank you.

223
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:47,374
And Mr. Murphy, I just wanted to say thank you for the flow chart that I know that you're revising.

224
00:40:47,434 --> 00:40:51,036
So if we could maybe have that for the next meeting, that would be really helpful.

225
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:51,796
Would that be okay?

226
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:53,277
Sure.

227
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:54,638
Thank you.

228
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:55,999
Member Russo.

229
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,780
Thank you.

230
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,942
Last year, we did have a motion to require this as part of the budget, but it was new.

231
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:05,464
Do we feel we need a motion or will it just be coming?

232
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:09,466
I don't wanna get to one of these presentations that a department has worked hard on,

233
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:15,871
And then there isn't this list, because I just don't want us to be in that situation.

234
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:22,095
So I just want to hear somebody in central administration say you will get the list like you did last year or better.

235
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,821
if that's something.

236
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:24,481
Yes, we will.

237
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:28,403
We will use a very similar format to what happened last year.

238
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:32,765
So, um, I would say you should expect it from every department.

239
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:40,669
The department heads have already been told that we're going to be following a similar format to what we did last year.

240
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:41,950
Thank you so much.

241
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:50,955
Motion to approve the minutes by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Miss Stone.

242
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:52,920
I second.

243
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,041
Committee roll call.

244
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:56,944
Excuse me, Member Graham?

245
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,606
Yes.

246
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:00,647
Yes.

247
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:03,129
Member McLaughlin, yes.

248
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:03,969
Member McStone?

249
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:04,730
Yes.

250
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:06,371
Member Rousseau?

251
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:07,352
Yes.

252
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:09,113
Member Van de Kloet?

253
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:09,674
Yes.

254
00:42:10,715 --> 00:42:11,435
Mayor Long-Klein?

255
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:12,937
Yes.

256
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:14,558
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

257
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:15,379
Minutes are approved.

258
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:21,904
Number five, special education behavioral health subcommittee meeting, March 18th, 2021, offered by Member McLaughlin.

259
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:24,379
Yes.

260
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:25,099
Thank you, Mayor.

261
00:42:28,022 --> 00:42:29,223
We met on March 18th.

262
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:34,528
As people may know, we divide the meetings 45 minutes each.

263
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:40,074
One topic is behavioral health and specifically trauma-informed schools.

264
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:43,437
And then the latter half of the meeting is special education specifically.

265
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:48,681
building friendships in school and community among individuals with and without disabilities.

266
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:53,204
And then we swap the order each month.

267
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:54,886
So this month behavioral health was first.

268
00:42:55,106 --> 00:43:09,677
And the question that we really were asking our director of guidance Stacey Shulman in this meeting was, how are we addressing the social emotional needs of our students and families as we are having a return to school to full, you know, full

269
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:14,644
in-person school and remote for those who choose to have remote.

270
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:27,188
And so Stacey shared with us that there's increased group counseling, there's pushing counseling in some classes, supportive groups in middle school, more individual in sixth grade.

271
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:36,930
We did talk with some parents that were in the meeting that were really concerned about the social emotional needs of our children, especially as compared to academic recruitment.

272
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,071
And people are feeling like,

273
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,606
social emotional needs to be addressed in order for academic recruitment to even begin to happen.

274
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:50,388
And so Ms.

275
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:58,054
Schulman shared that the Sandy Hook Promise campaign is starting up again and Medford has signed on to that.

276
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:02,098
And that's a program that we've had in the past and their slogan is start with hello.

277
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:04,660
It begins in the first week of April, I believe in the middle schools.

278
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:11,538
We asked that families or school committee members be invited to see what that actually looks like, the Sandy Hook Promise Campaign.

279
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:20,300
And there were some more comments about like just what is it gonna look like for our kids being overwhelmed?

280
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,600
What about kids who have anxiety in the six feet to three feet?

281
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,560
How are we addressing this?

282
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,061
Stacey talked about group for anxiety.

283
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:33,882
There were families, specifically a parent who is a licensed social worker as well.

284
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:53,254
has been really committed to these meetings and she was just really sharing as the parent of two students currently in the Medford public schools and you know sort of as a message that she's been hearing from a lot of students and families is the real need for for our children to have some social interaction, our students have some social interaction with each other.

285
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,263
And how can we do that?

286
00:44:55,343 --> 00:45:10,276
Like, you know, what are the opportunities, whether it's, you know, being able to go for a hike in the fells as a group or, you know, teaching on the field or, you know, and we had one day, I guess, last week of not having homework and, you know, just sort of thinking about what their social and emotional needs are.

287
00:45:10,436 --> 00:45:18,103
And next month we will be doing, we'll be reviewing what policy recommendations the subcommittee wants to make for our May presentation.

288
00:45:19,255 --> 00:45:34,022
So there was also, you know, rethinking homework was another question around sort of, again, this these these academic requirements when people are still trying to catch up to the social emotional so that was the crux of the behavioral health and then building friendships and community in schools.

289
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:58,396
We talked with Susanna Campbell, who is the Director of Speech and Language and who has built a really great reserve with our colleagues of resources on Google Doc around social stories for families and teachers and others to use in returning to school, social stories for a number of different situations and books and what have you.

290
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:01,937
So anyone interested in the link to that Google Doc can reach out to

291
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:19,038
That Google folder I'm sure can reach out to Susanna Campbell and she's also partnering at our request or collaborating, I should say, with Paul Teixeira from our Director of English Language to work on identifying social stories that can be translated into other languages for students that

292
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:20,458
need those.

293
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:21,499
So that was really exciting.

294
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:22,859
I was happy about that opportunity.

295
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,361
We talked about the Universal Safety Committee website.

296
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:29,822
This is the website we're talking about on the social stories.

297
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,522
Update on Common Ground.

298
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:35,724
We're hoping to expand the Common Ground program that's at the high school to build friendships.

299
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:38,068
Among students with and without disabilities.

300
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:49,162
It's a proven program that's existed at the high school would like to see it expand or they would like you know the committee wants is interested in seeing expand to an elective, and we're exploring options on what that might look like.

301
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:58,054
CCSR is having a disability awareness focus on the 27th, April 27th.

302
00:46:58,996 --> 00:47:05,885
Historically, the diversity week for Medford public schools has not included disability, interestingly.

303
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:08,990
So this is the first year that disability will be included

304
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:21,600
in diversity week and we think that that's a really important note not to point out what hasn't been done but to remind people that disability is diversity and that obviously they should be included in any conversation around diversity.

305
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:33,710
And then an update on Medford Recreation, there was conversation around adaptive versus inclusive programming and right now we're really happy that we're starting to see some adaptive programming at the recreation level

306
00:47:34,415 --> 00:47:39,819
And again, there was discussion about what peer-to-peer relationships look like and that they're horizontal, not vertical.

307
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:48,705
And adaptive programs, it's often the individual with disability being served by the peer as opposed to having a unique and authentic relationship with them.

308
00:47:48,765 --> 00:48:03,555
So we're eager and looking forward to helping Medford Recreation with the support of community members and stakeholders that attend these meetings and others to move into adaptive and inclusive programming.

309
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,389
And then we did an update on the inclusive playground.

310
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:23,739
So for folks who are not aware, there's a playground restructure that will be happening at the McGlynn Elementary School Playground, which is a central location in the city and accessible to many members of our community outside of just our school community at the McGlynn.

311
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:31,223
So that playground is being restructured with a real eye towards inclusive

312
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,284
play space and expertise in that.

313
00:48:34,384 --> 00:48:41,488
And so we're lucky we have some community members that offer unique expertise in that area, and we're excited to move that project forward.

314
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:52,954
So our next meeting is Thursday, April 15th, where we'll be talking about policy recommendations, and the following meeting is May 20th.

315
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:59,358
So April 15th, we hope you'll join us, 5 to 6.30, and obviously these will be posted online.

316
00:48:59,618 --> 00:48:59,938
Thank you.

317
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:03,746
Thank you very much, Member McLaughlin.

318
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:05,728
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the minutes?

319
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,009
Motion to accept the minutes.

320
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,533
Member Van de Kloet, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

321
00:49:12,793 --> 00:49:13,093
Second.

322
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,255
Roll call, please.

323
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:17,216
Member Graham.

324
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:17,997
Yes.

325
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:21,359
Member Kretz.

326
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,200
Yes.

327
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:24,361
Member McLaughlin, yes.

328
00:49:25,122 --> 00:49:26,223
Member McStone.

329
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:26,783
Yes.

330
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:28,985
Member Rousseau.

331
00:49:29,946 --> 00:49:30,146
Yes.

332
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:31,807
Member Van de Kloet.

333
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:32,428
Yes.

334
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:34,669
May I long go, Karin?

335
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:36,829
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

336
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:37,809
The minutes are approved.

337
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:42,390
Member Van de Kloet, would you like to table yours until the end of the meeting or till next meeting?

338
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,751
I would actually like to table them to the next meeting.

339
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:49,692
I see that Dr. Quilles' report, a link wasn't provided.

340
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:52,352
And the discussion will make much more sense with that link.

341
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:56,313
So I'm going to talk to, we'll figure it out by the next meeting.

342
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:57,261
Sounds great.

343
00:49:57,502 --> 00:50:05,968
Motion to table number two till the meeting on April 12th by member of Van de Kloet seconded by second member Graham roll call, please.

344
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:07,489
Member Graham?

345
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:08,130
Yes.

346
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,851
Member Kretz?

347
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:10,571
Yes.

348
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:12,193
Member McLaughlin?

349
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:12,433
Yes.

350
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:13,213
Member McStone?

351
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:13,894
Yes.

352
00:50:14,775 --> 00:50:15,575
Member Russo?

353
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:17,016
Yes.

354
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:18,858
Member Van de Kloet?

355
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:19,658
Yes.

356
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:21,320
Mayor Longo Kern?

357
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:21,840
Yes.

358
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,421
Seven the affirmative, zero in the negative.

359
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:25,683
Meeting minutes are tabled.

360
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,652
Number seven, we have community participation, public participation emails, yes.

361
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:32,774
I have several emails on that.

362
00:50:33,694 --> 00:50:36,095
Okay, let me just read this and then you can... Yeah, sorry.

363
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:45,340
Public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

364
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:51,064
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

365
00:50:51,484 --> 00:50:52,164
Member Van de Kloot.

366
00:50:54,763 --> 00:51:09,392
Before member bandicoot reads the participation, can I ask that you read our policy on public participation so that the folks who are planning to participate know how to do so in a manner that's consistent with our own rules?

367
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:11,853
Yes.

368
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,975
Do you want to screen share that?

369
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:16,096
I'm happy to read it.

370
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:18,437
Maybe we should just start posting it right on the agenda.

371
00:51:20,423 --> 00:51:33,914
Our policy states that any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at a school committee meeting regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item, a community participation portion of the agenda.

372
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:42,899
will be established which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee or be heard on any item.

373
00:51:43,479 --> 00:51:53,084
Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools by Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.

374
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:00,468
Thank you, Member Graham.

375
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:02,249
Member Van de Kloot?

376
00:52:02,985 --> 00:52:03,285
sure.

377
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:05,427
So offline before you sorry.

378
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:07,669
Remember, we had a group member will often do have something to say.

379
00:52:07,789 --> 00:52:17,879
Yeah, just as a just a clarification on that, having attended previous meetings again before I was elected and also looking into the policy.

380
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:28,588
I just want to clarify for folks that five minutes that is presented as a request and public participation in our minutes the Wednesday before the meeting, but you can

381
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:46,134
If you have not submitted a request for public participation, you can speak on any topic for up to three minutes one time, just for clarification, because I don't want people to think that if you didn't submit a request for public participation the Wednesday before the meeting that you cannot participate.

382
00:52:46,234 --> 00:52:53,317
It's just if you want more minutes to speak about something in particular, you would submit that the Wednesday before.

383
00:52:53,657 --> 00:52:54,037
Thank you.

384
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:56,798
Thank you.

385
00:52:57,338 --> 00:52:57,858
Member Van de Gloot.

386
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:00,828
Yes, Mayor, we received six communications.

387
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:05,854
The first one is entitled Info Request for Advisory Committee Columbus School.

388
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:10,760
It was submitted by Luchita Hiller, 58 Metcalf Street, Medford.

389
00:53:12,299 --> 00:53:23,908
She says, hi, I am trying to find information on how to apply for the advisory committee in charge of picking the new names to replace existing Columbus school name and how to submit new name nominations.

390
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:27,571
I have been looking through the MPS website and could not find anything.

391
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:30,693
Can you direct me to the right place where this information lives?

392
00:53:31,034 --> 00:53:31,434
Thank you.

393
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:35,117
Would someone like to address that?

394
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:41,704
My understanding is it was on one of the front tabs, but it certainly will be by the end of the night if it's not now.

395
00:53:42,365 --> 00:53:55,933
And we'll also recirculate it to both all families and all staff on the same announcement that has the links in the document as well.

396
00:53:56,013 --> 00:54:00,876
So we'll make sure that it's, I think it's already out, but we'll make sure that it is.

397
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:03,901
Thank you.

398
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:08,207
So the next letters, there's five letters and they're all on the same topic.

399
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:19,122
I'll read one from the first one that was submitted on this topic was from Sharon Hayes of 69 Ripley Road and then I'll tell you who submitted the other ones.

400
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:31,565
It says, dear superintendent and school committee members, I am writing to you as a parent of two elementary school children who are currently enrolled in the full remote learning at the Roberts and who will remain in remote learning for the rest of the school year.

401
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:43,428
I am very concerned that the students who plan to remain in the remote classes not be subjected to additional changes due to the April 5th shift to full-time in-person learning for the current hybrid students.

402
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:51,233
The remote teachers have spent the last six plus months working hard to create a classroom community and new daily routines in virtual learning.

403
00:54:51,514 --> 00:55:00,860
While both of my boys are struggling with the virtual aspect of virtual learning, they love being a part of the classroom community and seeing the same classmates and teacher every day.

404
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:05,104
And as a parent, I know that the classroom routines keep them feeling grounded and secure.

405
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:22,018
If any of these things are changed now with less than a third of the year remaining, if students are regrouped and put with different classmates and or a new teacher, it will cause yet another major disruption in the lives of young children who are still living through an intensely difficult and traumatizing event.

406
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:27,783
Please do not make changes to the remote learning classrooms between now and the end of the school year."

407
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:32,067
That sentiment was shared and we received a

408
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:57,785
email from Arshia Amina of 37 Ashland Street, from Shanine Pelequin, she did not give an address, of Michelle Ciccolo of 28 Douglas Road, of Wynette Vo,

409
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:05,256
Um, also no address and of Claire Flaherty of Marshall Street.

410
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:14,079
Um, all of those, these centers, uh, echoed the same concerns of the first letter, um, about remote learning.

411
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:15,900
Thank you.

412
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,760
Member Van de Kloot.

413
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,561
Member McLaughlin?

414
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:21,762
Um, yes.

415
00:56:21,802 --> 00:56:28,044
I also just sort of wanted to mention that hearing from folks in the community as well, I know that we've heard in the past that, um,

416
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:33,136
our remote families sometimes feel left out or excluded.

417
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:38,059
And I'm sure that's a byproduct of also, you know, being at home.

418
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:43,783
And so that I think we need to make that extra effort to make sure that they feel involved and included.

419
00:56:43,863 --> 00:56:55,611
And so I guess the other question is that, you know, are the students, again, around consistency, are the students' teachers gonna stay the same, which is, you know, I think important for our students.

420
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:58,113
And, you know,

421
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:15,411
whether there's going to be what the homework situation is going to be with more kids going into school so for the remote learners a lot of stuff has been able to be done during the day in the classroom and you know if they're getting more computer time at night it can be really problematic so wondering about that consistency as well, thank you.

422
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:20,676
Mayor.

423
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:22,996
Yes, Member van de Kloot.

424
00:57:23,457 --> 00:57:26,860
May I ask, Superintendent, are you going to address this this evening?

425
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,602
I am going to be speaking to it in my remarks.

426
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:30,883
Okay.

427
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:31,484
Thank you.

428
00:57:32,044 --> 00:57:32,545
Okay, great.

429
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:33,365
Thank you very much.

430
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:36,928
Which is next up, actually.

431
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:39,771
So, number eight, report of Superintendent.

432
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,614
Number one, Superintendent's updates and comments.

433
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:43,554
Dr. Edward-Vincent.

434
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:47,458
Good evening.

435
00:57:51,987 --> 00:58:03,111
As I mentioned in my Friday message, I have mentioned many times before that we all have a duty to stand up against all forms of racism.

436
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:14,276
Tonight, I wanna make it clear that the Medford Public Schools stands with our Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.

437
00:58:15,976 --> 00:58:19,778
Last Tuesday, in three separate shootings in Atlanta,

438
00:58:20,779 --> 00:58:22,241
eight Asian women were killed.

439
00:58:23,822 --> 00:58:29,167
We are keeping all those affected by this senseless tragedy in our prayers.

440
00:58:30,429 --> 00:58:40,178
Additionally, we have heard stories of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders being both harassed and abused throughout our country.

441
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:44,562
This is both frightening and disgraceful.

442
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:54,661
Our district is committed to doing the work to create equity, inclusivity, and belonging for all in our community.

443
00:58:55,782 --> 00:59:12,914
It is my hope that we can all come together and join Mayor Lungo Kern, the Board of Health, Medford's Human Rights Commission, the Medford Police Department, and the schools as we participate in a community conversation entitled

444
00:59:13,902 --> 00:59:16,203
racism is a public health crisis.

445
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:18,304
What does this mean?

446
00:59:19,045 --> 00:59:21,506
And how can the city address this crisis?

447
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:27,669
It will be held on Wednesday, April 7th, from six to 8 p.m.

448
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:28,710
via Zoom.

449
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:40,436
I applaud the mayor, Chief Buckley, Mary Ann O'Connor, and our diversity director, Mr. Neil Osborne, for organizing this crucial conversation.

450
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:52,670
we support hashtag stop Asian hate, hashtag support AAPI, Asian American and Pacific Islanders.

451
00:59:54,491 --> 01:00:08,922
On March 10th, the school committee held a committee of the whole with the goal of launching the Columbus Elementary School Renaming Advisory Committee, which will review all suggestions for a new name for the school.

452
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:17,388
While the task of creating the committee was accomplished, the means by which this was achieved was painful at times.

453
01:00:18,989 --> 01:00:24,373
Some conversations in the meeting involved angry and derogatory language.

454
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:35,720
I know that the decision to change the name of the Columbus School is a controversial one, and especially upsetting to many long-term residents of Medford.

455
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:37,541
However,

456
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:46,716
Unprofessional and unkind statements were not the positive displays of civic discourse.

457
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:49,759
We should be modeling for our children.

458
01:00:50,879 --> 01:01:01,967
I am hopeful that we can work together as one Medford to be better to each other and to overcome our disagreements constructively and considerably.

459
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:05,170
The renaming committee

460
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:17,153
will select three finalists for consideration by the school committee who will vote on the new name sometime in the late spring of 2021.

461
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:31,562
Interested parties who may want to apply to serve on the renaming committee can access an application on our website, the city's website, our blog, Facebook, and Twitter.

462
01:01:32,787 --> 01:01:39,670
For those who just want to suggest a new name, you may do so by completing that form on the website.

463
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:51,976
All applications to serve on the renaming committee and any submissions for suggested new names must be forwarded to my office by 5 p.m.

464
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:54,237
on Friday, April 16th, 2021.

465
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,277
Changing topics.

466
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:19,166
I am pleased to announce that Ed Week, a school-based national publication, contacted our public relations office seeking input for their article entitled, Should Schools Test Students and Staff for COVID-19?

467
01:02:20,647 --> 01:02:23,749
Medford has truly been a leader in this arena.

468
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:30,720
allowing us to bring students back into our schools sooner than most of our surrounding districts.

469
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:40,265
We could not have done this without the help and support of the City of Medford, Tufts University, and the Broad Institute.

470
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:56,000
Both our assistant superintendent, David Murphy, and our director of health services, nurse Tony Ray, were quoted in the article and photos were taken of elementary students being tested at the McGlynn Middle School.

471
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:07,963
The Mustangs are certainly leading the charge to protect our students and staff in order to bring our students back safely to in-school learning.

472
01:03:10,664 --> 01:03:28,717
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to our students, staff, and parents and guardians and our school committee members for actively taking part in our listening sessions regarding school during COVID-19.

473
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:47,700
When we planned these sessions, we did not yet know that the Massachusetts Education Commissioner would soon issue a statement mandating that districts abandoned the hybrid learning model, therefore increasing in-person learning for all students.

474
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,241
This declaration has created some confusion for families.

475
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:59,742
Remote students are able to remain remote students

476
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:13,767
but we know that there will be a small number of families who wish to switch models and have their students transfer from remote to in-person instruction.

477
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:19,891
The deadline for making that switch is this Friday, March 26th.

478
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:29,877
We currently have approximately 575 students who are fully remote at the elementary levels.

479
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:40,951
As of this morning, we have received 61 requests from families that would like to participate in in-person instruction.

480
01:04:42,372 --> 01:04:50,238
Please do not miss this deadline of this Friday to notify us of your decision at the elementary levels.

481
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:55,671
I would like to provide some greater clarification.

482
01:04:56,492 --> 01:05:05,423
I reached out personally to the Commissioner of Education to ensure that Medford is properly following the guidance from DESE.

483
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:08,847
This week,

484
01:05:10,622 --> 01:05:18,668
March 22nd, we have invited our younger elementary students, both kindergarten and grade one hybrid students.

485
01:05:19,268 --> 01:05:23,251
They have increased their in-school time to four days a week.

486
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:32,718
Next week, our second and third grade students will increase their in-school learning time to four days a week.

487
01:05:34,356 --> 01:05:44,678
Please note that all elementary students switching from remote to in-person will return on Monday, April 5th.

488
01:05:45,719 --> 01:06:00,402
Again, all fully remote families that have selected to return to in-person instruction will return to school for five days of full instruction starting on Monday, April 5th.

489
01:06:02,742 --> 01:06:12,547
Next week, principals will be reaching out to families to notify them about their child's assignment for the week of April 5th.

490
01:06:14,568 --> 01:06:24,133
The principals will be reaching out specifically to students that were formerly in the fully remote model to set up that scheduling.

491
01:06:26,118 --> 01:06:38,444
So in order to mitigate the impact of additional students from our remote cohorts, we do require extra planning time to make this happen as seamlessly as possible.

492
01:06:39,314 --> 01:06:58,689
And in speaking with the Commissioner and explaining to him what Medford is doing to meet the deadline of April 5th, we are following the guidance that was provided by the Department of, by DESE, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

493
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:11,187
Transitioning, I would like to let the community know about some important events that are happening soon.

494
01:07:12,268 --> 01:07:19,815
The emergency preparedness Zoom presentation will be held this Wednesday, March 24th, from 6 to 8 p.m.

495
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:47,254
This presentation is being hosted by the Massachusetts Office on Disability and the Department of Homeland Security, and supported by the Medford Public Schools Universal Safety Committee, the Medford Special Education PAC, the Medford Family Network, the Medford Fire and Police Departments, and the City of Medford's Disability Commission.

496
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:58,813
This presentation will better inform our most vulnerable citizens to be best prepared to respond to an evacuation or shelter in place.

497
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:00,895
We hope you can join us.

498
01:08:02,596 --> 01:08:04,478
CCSR has planned

499
01:08:06,331 --> 01:08:11,253
An April Fool's run between April 1st and April 3rd.

500
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:18,335
CCSR is encouraging students to dress in costume and tag them on social media.

501
01:08:19,255 --> 01:08:23,077
Donations are encouraged, but 100% optional.

502
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:26,198
Please plan to wear a mask while running.

503
01:08:27,738 --> 01:08:33,400
Stay six feet apart from others and do not run in large groups.

504
01:08:34,807 --> 01:08:40,272
Additional information can be found on CCSR's website and the school blog.

505
01:08:42,254 --> 01:08:54,185
Next week, we will be posting an agenda for the Medford Public Schools strategic planning roundtables, which will be held on Monday, April 5th and Tuesday, April 6th.

506
01:08:55,475 --> 01:09:08,298
This will provide an opportunity for the public to comment on the school's draft strategic plan and the draft strategic plan that the administration and staff have been working on for the past year.

507
01:09:09,098 --> 01:09:15,260
We hope you can join in with us on either April 5th or 6th via Zoom.

508
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:27,535
This Saturday, March 27th, the Citywide Elementary Alliance is hosting an electronics recycling drive from 10 a.m.

509
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,376
to 1 p.m.

510
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:31,056
behind the McGlynn School.

511
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:43,720
For a small fee, they will be collecting TVs, computer monitors, fax machines, cell phones, and other battery-operated or electric equipment.

512
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,523
please support the Citywide Elementary Alliance.

513
01:09:53,107 --> 01:10:05,096
I would also like to invite any college students or others in our community who might be interested in part-time work to join our after-school program team.

514
01:10:05,977 --> 01:10:08,478
We are hiring counselors right now.

515
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,143
You can find the application on our human resources page on the website.

516
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:20,567
These positions will help us as we are transitioning to five days a week.

517
01:10:23,468 --> 01:10:35,731
So lastly, I would like to say, before our next school committee meeting on April 12th, we have many people in the community who will be celebrating Passover and Easter.

518
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:41,633
For our Jewish friends, Passover begins on Saturday, March 27th.

519
01:10:42,913 --> 01:10:44,834
Holy week is next week for Christians.

520
01:10:45,912 --> 01:10:49,234
and Easter or Resurrection Sunday is on April 4th.

521
01:10:50,795 --> 01:10:57,359
For those of you who celebrate these holy days, I wish you peace and happiness with your families.

522
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,341
Happy spring to everyone.

523
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:04,704
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

524
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:07,465
We have Member McLaughlin, Member Rousseau, then Member Van de Kloot.

525
01:11:09,526 --> 01:11:10,067
Thank you.

526
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:13,369
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent, for that thorough update.

527
01:11:14,888 --> 01:11:23,814
I also wanna just thank you for the example that you set around testing and for being part of Ed Week, which is such a great magazine.

528
01:11:23,874 --> 01:11:33,301
And it's exciting to see Medford highlighted in that way for positive exposure and no pun intended for positive exposure in the media.

529
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:42,607
And then I also just wanted to add for the emergency preparedness event that is Wednesday at six o'clock that is being hosted by the Universal Safety Committee

530
01:11:43,817 --> 01:11:50,381
Although it is being presented by the Mass Office on Disability, to be clear, it is open and available for everyone.

531
01:11:51,241 --> 01:12:01,067
It's emergency preparedness in all situations for anyone, for example, with young children, elderly parents or grandparents, individuals with disabilities, any of those needs.

532
01:12:01,647 --> 01:12:11,072
We found it exceptional in the past, and everyone that has gone to it has been really impressed and moved by it in terms of their own preparation in terms of emergencies.

533
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:12,853
And if the pandemic has taught us anything,

534
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:15,085
the importance of being prepared.

535
01:12:15,105 --> 01:12:16,606
So thank you for sharing that information.

536
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,447
Member Rousseau.

537
01:12:22,028 --> 01:12:22,428
Thank you.

538
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:24,008
That was a good update.

539
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:24,909
Excellent update.

540
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:28,010
It was a lot of topics in that particular update.

541
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,810
I thought you were done several times.

542
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:42,014
I actually just have one question, and I feel like it's a question you may not actually be able to answer with certainty at this point.

543
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:51,950
But we had a, you know, when we first went into the school year, we had a few classes that were frankly oversubscribed.

544
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:55,472
And you know, that that was worked out.

545
01:12:56,733 --> 01:12:58,234
However, it needed to be worked out.

546
01:12:58,274 --> 01:13:07,259
But there was also a class that had some rather extensive turnover of teachers at one of the schools.

547
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,100
And

548
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:19,362
I just, I'm looking for a commitment that no remote students will be looking at a different teacher in the elementary level.

549
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:27,066
Cause I don't think it's really an issue for the middle and high school level because the hybrid and the remote students have already been mixed together.

550
01:13:27,146 --> 01:13:37,071
But I just want to hear, and I think some families that are staying full remote want to know there is a 0% chance or you're committed to

551
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:42,522
not changing their teachers, that they've finally figured out how to have a relationship with.

552
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:53,685
And even if that means they have a really small class, the logistics, as you mentioned, are pretty mind boggling.

553
01:13:54,266 --> 01:14:01,628
But I feel like, as another member mentioned earlier, there's a general feeling that the remote kids,

554
01:14:03,383 --> 01:14:05,787
not by you, but just because they're remote.

555
01:14:06,348 --> 01:14:14,281
There's a lot of people who felt like they were an afterthought and to have any kind of turmoil or change in their schedules should just be an absolute no go.

556
01:14:15,162 --> 01:14:16,585
And I just want to hear you say that.

557
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:21,497
I cannot definitively say that there will be a no go.

558
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:33,908
I think, especially in getting guidance directly from the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner over the weekend and up until this morning.

559
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:51,365
In some situations where a classroom could potentially, and again, not having all the numbers, which was the reason why I wanted to present the elementary numbers, approximately 575 students at the elementary level that are fully remote.

560
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:54,328
And as of this morning, 61 students

561
01:14:55,749 --> 01:15:02,436
or 61 families have opted to transition from fully remote to in-person.

562
01:15:02,876 --> 01:15:07,261
But we're not sure of what the numbers are going to be by Friday.

563
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:12,526
So if in the event that we were to end up with 250, 300 parents that

564
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:21,453
are fully remote that end up stating they want to become fully in person.

565
01:15:21,593 --> 01:15:31,299
I don't think the numbers would be that high, but if something like that were to happen, we would then be in a position to not be able to operationalize it.

566
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:40,605
We have a lot of constraints with how many students can fit in a classroom, what's the total amount of students.

567
01:15:41,165 --> 01:15:45,008
Even with merging right now, looking at the numbers, our current

568
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:47,472
hybrid classrooms.

569
01:15:47,992 --> 01:15:52,754
So I don't want to say that it would never happen.

570
01:15:53,074 --> 01:15:57,156
In some schools, there's significantly higher enrollment.

571
01:15:57,796 --> 01:16:07,440
So you could have a school that may have 14 or 15 students and another class in another building may have 23 students or 24 students.

572
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:33,941
And so when you collapse and put the two hybrid classes together, you come up with a class size and looking at the square footage, respecting the three feet of distance right now and making sure that the students fit and that we're following all of the guidelines that need to be followed.

573
01:16:34,501 --> 01:16:36,223
I would not wanna say that it would

574
01:16:36,903 --> 01:16:37,704
never happen.

575
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:49,299
And also, we have another situation where you could have at a particular grade level that may have 16 or 17 students and 14 or 15 of them are requesting to come back

576
01:16:55,207 --> 01:17:01,048
to participate in full in-person instruction.

577
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:08,450
Those are the kinds of pieces of data and looking at the numbers that we have to be able to figure out.

578
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:17,012
Total number of students, capacity within the given classrooms, and who the instructors are going to actually be.

579
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:28,099
In the case of the example that you quoted, Mr. Russo, about one of our schools that was oversubscribed and we ended up adding two teachers.

580
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:33,143
So we don't have a classroom space that would be able to accommodate

581
01:17:34,218 --> 01:17:38,704
30 students at the elementary levels per se.

582
01:17:39,545 --> 01:17:50,679
And so for something like that, we would have to uncouple and figure out if we had 15 of the 30 students request in-person instruction,

583
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:55,969
And there were two teachers who were working cooperatively with a group of students.

584
01:17:56,089 --> 01:18:14,197
If 15 of the 30 wanted to return, then we would need to ask for one of the two teachers, one would remain remote and one would physically come on campus because to be able to accommodate 15 potentially remote students all at the same exact grade level,

585
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:22,166
and the hybrid classrooms that have already been merged are near capacity, there wouldn't be any room.

586
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:28,683
we would then be out of compliance because we would have too many students in one particular space.

587
01:18:29,244 --> 01:18:35,209
So that is not operationally, it's a lot of work that it's gonna require.

588
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:40,534
And we are working on that and looking carefully at the numbers that are coming in.

589
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:48,161
And our priority is always the students, but we also are now working with

590
01:18:50,123 --> 01:19:05,456
The guidance from DESE, and again, as I said, I reached directly out to the commissioner to receive clarification and greater understanding so that I am conveying accurate information that I received up until today.

591
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:22,612
In all circumstances, yes, we are going to try to not disrupt, but to guarantee you know 100% that that isn't that that would not happen in a possibility of a few cases where we have.

592
01:19:23,473 --> 01:19:32,419
larger numbers of students that would not be able to fit into a given classroom, then I would be not honest.

593
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:40,764
And then we would be having a conversation where you would say, on March 22, you said to us, this would never happen.

594
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:45,127
And it happened in three situations.

595
01:19:46,307 --> 01:19:47,108
In the spirit of

596
01:19:47,995 --> 01:19:49,877
full disclosure and transparency.

597
01:19:50,377 --> 01:19:57,824
We are closely monitoring kindergarten and third grade in two elementary school buildings right now.

598
01:19:58,004 --> 01:20:06,131
Closely monitoring those rooms because we are perilously close to maximum capacity.

599
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:12,677
And all the principals met this morning with assistant superintendent Galluzzi

600
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:26,304
And we are closely monitoring those numbers, but we did give families the opportunity until March this Friday, March 26, to give us their final response.

601
01:20:26,824 --> 01:20:34,292
And so wanting to communicate frequently, being fair, and letting families know if we're going to make this work,

602
01:20:34,953 --> 01:20:46,455
keeping safety, equity, and consistency as our priorities, then depending on the numbers, we may have to, in some situations, make an adjustment.

603
01:20:47,195 --> 01:20:57,437
So I want you to know that we're not trying to disrupt or pull someone away, but we're watching kindergarten.

604
01:20:57,878 --> 01:20:59,698
We're closely watching third grade.

605
01:21:01,078 --> 01:21:22,012
Unfortunately, those are the two grade levels where it seems like thus far we've had the most movement and we do not want to deny families the opportunity to come back for in-person instruction as that was a mandate given to all districts by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

606
01:21:22,652 --> 01:21:29,277
So I want you to know we will do our best to not disrupt

607
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:37,021
but we're closely monitoring the numbers and we are not sure what the final count will be on this Friday.

608
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:38,781
Thank you.

609
01:21:38,882 --> 01:21:51,028
I just, you know, Senator Jalen, our state senator from Medford emailed, I think all of the school committee and asked us, you know, to respond really to the DESE guidance.

610
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:55,330
Cause I think the legislature was considering whether or not they needed to

611
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,342
sort of take emergency action.

612
01:21:57,362 --> 01:22:00,384
And my sense is that that is not going to happen.

613
01:22:01,264 --> 01:22:12,508
But I said something that I think is really important to just say, and that is that we are taking a moderately bad situation for everybody, and we're gonna make it better for some kids at the expense of other kids.

614
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:18,130
And that's exactly what will happen to any kid whose teacher is changed at the elementary level.

615
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:25,453
And I just think it's an unconscionable, frankly, if we can take fully remote kids

616
01:22:25,931 --> 01:22:27,932
and fit them in, we should.

617
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:34,053
And I think the principals and teachers should prioritize them based on the individual children and the situations.

618
01:22:34,594 --> 01:22:41,176
But to take away a teacher from another student who's fully remote, it's unconscionable to me.

619
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,316
And I recognize that we didn't vote on it.

620
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:44,677
We don't get to vote on it.

621
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:51,959
The commissioner is apparently literally with godlike powers at this point.

622
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:55,420
But I just needed to say that it's really, it's disturbing

623
01:22:55,948 --> 01:23:04,473
is an understatement that we will take away something from kids to give them to other kids in the middle of a pandemic like this.

624
01:23:04,593 --> 01:23:07,715
It's just, I just can't, it's awful.

625
01:23:07,895 --> 01:23:08,215
Thank you.

626
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:11,097
Member Van de Kloet.

627
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:28,656
Yes, I would raise my hand also to express my concerns that it seems like we've made a commitment to our remote kids and it doesn't seem fair to all of a sudden put them in a predicament, though I hear what you're telling us, Superintendent.

628
01:23:29,517 --> 01:23:37,820
I think probably right now it makes most sense to turn to the community members who've had their hands raised for quite a long time.

629
01:23:38,507 --> 01:23:40,793
Yes, Member Graham, then Ms.

630
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:42,577
Galussi, then we're gonna go to the community members.

631
01:23:44,703 --> 01:23:45,184
Thank you.

632
01:23:45,505 --> 01:23:46,528
I just wanna...

633
01:23:47,224 --> 01:24:08,897
make sure that you are aware, Superintendent, that over the last couple of days, I know I have received reports, other members of the school committee may have as well, that this individualized choice is sort of turning into a peer pressure situation of its own amongst parents, particularly in the remote classrooms.

634
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:09,798
There are

635
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:17,803
families out there that are really concerned that want to stay remote and do feel that they are being pressured by other members of the community.

636
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:30,551
So I don't know how you deal with that, but I guess I would just ask that you take special care to ask the families who indicate that they're

637
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:49,647
willing or that they want to or that they need to just exactly what is driving their decision so that we can be sure we're doing right by those children and not that their parents feel that they are being pressured

638
01:24:50,307 --> 01:24:56,072
by anybody, and I don't at all think that the administration is doing this, but it is happening in our community.

639
01:24:56,112 --> 01:24:58,513
I've heard about it on multiple occasions at this point.

640
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:09,062
And I just wanna be unequivocally clear that it's my position that there's really no circumstance where this is best for kids who choose to stay remote.

641
01:25:09,402 --> 01:25:15,747
Consistency for them in April is that they get to keep their teacher because they're not making a change.

642
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:28,013
if there are children out there who are making a change because that is what they want to do, we've clearly laid out, thank you very much for that, the stipulations of what that change could mean.

643
01:25:28,033 --> 01:25:39,520
And I would ask that you exhaust every and all options before you would consider changing the teacher in April of even one remote student at the elementary school level.

644
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,281
I just, I can't, I can't,

645
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:52,178
I can't fathom how we can talk about consistency and then involuntarily change a student's teacher.

646
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:59,141
Having said that, I appreciate the operational conundrum and dilemma that this causes.

647
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:06,384
And if you need to call an emergency meeting because you need funding allocations or something to make something different work,

648
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:11,338
so that we can preserve consistency and equity for the remote students.

649
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,167
I will make myself available any time of the day or night to do so.

650
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:17,452
Thank you, member Graham.

651
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:31,403
I do want to say that I did mean to mention that the Medford Public Schools also does not support bullying of other parents in any way, shape or form.

652
01:26:31,683 --> 01:26:36,307
I was made aware that people were feeling pressured.

653
01:26:36,387 --> 01:26:45,034
So I wanna say to the community, I have spoken with the commissioner over the weekend and again today and the assistant commissioner.

654
01:26:45,714 --> 01:26:53,958
And I can say that the two options that DESE is offering is full in-person and remote instruction.

655
01:26:54,739 --> 01:27:10,987
If there are families that want to remain in the remote option for their personal reasons, medical reasons, that they have selected the remote option, the remote option is still intact.

656
01:27:11,547 --> 01:27:14,829
So if any family received misinformation

657
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:21,653
from people bullying them or coercing them to switch models.

658
01:27:22,073 --> 01:27:25,515
We, in fact, are not coercing anyone.

659
01:27:25,595 --> 01:27:32,920
And that was why, again, I wanted to share the actual data that we have approximately 575 fully remote students.

660
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,482
And as of today, 61 families requested a change.

661
01:27:44,067 --> 01:28:02,921
Again, we can definitely work with the principals and also have the principals confirm and follow up with those families to make sure that they didn't feel like they were coerced into making a decision that they weren't prepared to make.

662
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:06,244
Ms.

663
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:06,624
Galluzzi?

664
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:17,964
I just wanted to follow up on the superintendent's comments just to kind of mentioned at the beginning, you know, Jesse's guidance was for districts to give another survey.

665
01:28:17,984 --> 01:28:24,871
We are always guided by what is best for students, even though sometimes some people may feel that.

666
01:28:25,772 --> 01:28:31,675
Maybe that's not at the core, but that really is at the core of what we're doing, which is why we're making this a very personal decision.

667
01:28:31,876 --> 01:28:38,439
So we want the conversation to be held at the principal level, not in a simple black and white survey.

668
01:28:38,799 --> 01:28:44,323
This way conversations can happen so that the principals can assure that parents are not feeling

669
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:47,504
bullied or pressured into making the decision.

670
01:28:47,844 --> 01:28:50,805
There is not a petition that's being given to the principal.

671
01:28:50,886 --> 01:28:52,566
It is a one-on-one conversation.

672
01:28:53,146 --> 01:29:02,451
We also know that two-thirds or even a little bit more than two-thirds of the year have already passed where students have built positive rapports with their teacher.

673
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,092
We do not want to disrupt that rapport.

674
01:29:05,992 --> 01:29:11,236
In my meeting today with the principals, as of right now, we're able to absorb it.

675
01:29:11,356 --> 01:29:16,820
It is really in just an extreme situation that the superintendent just has to put that.

676
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:22,384
But at this point, we're hopefully able to absorb that.

677
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:28,188
But I just wanted to say that this is part of why we're making sure that principals are having the conversations.

678
01:29:28,848 --> 01:29:36,294
In my meeting today with them, they're already starting to plan for the 61 that have put requests in, and those meetings will be set up for next week.

679
01:29:36,855 --> 01:29:39,697
But I just really wanted to reiterate that.

680
01:29:41,038 --> 01:29:46,042
I'm not quite sure if Mr. Murphy wants to add, since Ms.

681
01:29:46,082 --> 01:29:49,005
Graham mentioned the financial piece to that.

682
01:29:50,806 --> 01:29:57,291
Mayor, if I could just say very quickly, I'm going to be providing a budget update to the committee later in the meeting.

683
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:28,298
One point that I guess I would put out before that is that while I am not at this point anticipating a disproportionate surplus with regard to the close of a fiscal year, I do think we are in a position where if the conundrum that we were faced with was a disproportionate number of students attempting to transition from the remote cohort into in-person learning,

684
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:43,366
we would have the financial capacity to explore adding personnel in a way that should frankly be able to avoid disrupting teachers who are teaching in a fully remote cohort at the elementary level.

685
01:30:44,067 --> 01:30:57,674
And so as the superintendent said, it would only be a matter of last resort where the fully remote students would lose their teacher that they've been with

686
01:30:58,672 --> 01:30:59,953
throughout the course of this year.

687
01:30:59,973 --> 01:31:10,982
And I'll make clear tonight in the budget report, but I'm pretty confident that that would only be in a very, very extreme circumstance.

688
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:26,154
And so I know we don't wanna make any promises or assurances, but given that, and there's a few variables that prevent me from going any further and saying with certainty that it wouldn't be a problem,

689
01:31:27,547 --> 01:31:43,236
it's very unlikely that we wouldn't be able to, maybe put it this way, we'd have a bigger challenge just finding prospective educators that we could bring on at this point in the year than we would being able to fund additional positions.

690
01:31:44,017 --> 01:31:47,479
And so given that, I think it's unlikely that this is gonna be a problem.

691
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,461
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

692
01:31:53,082 --> 01:31:55,003
Vanessa, name and address for the record, please.

693
01:32:01,304 --> 01:32:07,007
Hi, my name is Vanessa Farsner, previously of cottage street and recently to Barbara lane.

694
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:19,333
I wanted to say first, thank you all and I appreciated the mayor sharing that email address or we can email people I am curious if somebody could put it in the chat because

695
01:32:19,853 --> 01:32:23,415
both times it was a little bit too quick and I didn't quite get it.

696
01:32:23,435 --> 01:32:37,821
I also appreciated you going over the typical format because now I know that I can email my concern, which I will do later today and ask for more time and hopefully an agenda item at a later meeting.

697
01:32:38,181 --> 01:32:43,444
But since I have the floor for this next minute, I just wanted to say that I joined the call today

698
01:32:44,984 --> 01:32:50,348
because of an overwhelming frustration with the after-school situation.

699
01:32:50,408 --> 01:32:56,111
And I'm sorry if I get emotional, but I am feeling very, very challenged as a working mother.

700
01:32:56,351 --> 01:33:07,678
And I know of four families at the Brooks School who are in after-school spots that have able-bodied full-time home

701
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:09,859
parents that do not work.

702
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:33,434
I feel as though the way the system changed to accept students with a simple click of a button on a phone made it so that a different group of people are trying to get into this after school and for school programs that may not have been a challenge in the past because before when you needed it to keep your job, you could get up at five in the morning and go wait in line.

703
01:33:33,534 --> 01:33:35,035
And I'm sure that that posed

704
01:33:35,655 --> 01:33:40,041
different challenges to different groups of people that probably needed to be solved.

705
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:50,614
But now we're in a situation where families are using this as a play date for their children because they have the means to pay for it to be such and

706
01:33:52,072 --> 01:34:03,036
families in situations like my own are left not knowing how we're going to do our jobs and make sure that our children at six years old don't become latchkey kids.

707
01:34:03,836 --> 01:34:07,817
And so I pleaded the committee to make this an agenda item at some point.

708
01:34:08,338 --> 01:34:09,018
I don't know

709
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:14,339
that it needs more financial resources, maybe just different communication and management.

710
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:22,160
My personal opinion would be to start with a mission statement on why we have a city before and after school program.

711
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,221
And that is a child care resource for those who need it.

712
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:38,923
If someone told me that it was full because families of higher need than me were already in, and that it was need-based, and that that's why it was full, then my conversation with you would be, how do we get more spots?

713
01:34:39,403 --> 01:34:44,044
But right now we have people using spots that do not need spots.

714
01:34:44,244 --> 01:34:46,624
And I find this very, very challenging.

715
01:34:47,304 --> 01:34:48,585
Thank you so much for your time.

716
01:34:49,205 --> 01:34:51,645
Thank you, Vanessa.

717
01:34:51,665 --> 01:35:02,147
I reached out to the afterschool director and I know we are actively trying to hire additional personnel to provide additional spots for our students.

718
01:35:02,407 --> 01:35:06,288
I don't know if anybody on the call has any other update than that, but that was last week.

719
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,631
That's the most recent I received.

720
01:35:08,671 --> 01:35:17,379
We are actively trying to hire additional personnel so we can make more room and allow more families to be involved in afterschool program.

721
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,781
You have anything else?

722
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:26,526
I know member Russo also has a resolution regarding afterschool program.

723
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:30,470
So we can expect an update on this in the near future as well.

724
01:35:31,411 --> 01:35:33,973
And next up is Sharon Hayes.

725
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:37,393
just address for the record, please.

726
01:35:43,017 --> 01:35:44,598
One second, Sharon, let me get you unmuted.

727
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:46,999
You're good to go?

728
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:47,760
Yes.

729
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,361
Okay, thank you.

730
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:57,526
Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road, and thank you, you did read my email earlier, so I won't talk a lot, I just,

731
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:17,756
would just like to express and I don't know for how many I can't know how many other parents I speak for but as a person who chose a family who chose full remote out of a lot of concerns for the health of our children no no specific medical needs but and we continue to feel that way so we will stay full remote.

732
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:18,917
I am

733
01:36:22,183 --> 01:36:26,566
My kids are struggling and I will be clear and honest about that.

734
01:36:27,107 --> 01:36:29,388
They are really, really, really struggling.

735
01:36:29,769 --> 01:36:37,014
And when we talk about equity, know that not everyone you look at may look like they're struggling.

736
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:40,438
But there are lots of people who are struggling.

737
01:36:40,759 --> 01:36:47,960
And when you talk about, well, the numbers may play out that we need to pull a teacher, we can't guarantee that.

738
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:53,241
I totally understand the competing needs that you have to deal with.

739
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:59,743
But the number of things that have changed over the course of the year for my kids in their classroom,

740
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:08,777
I'm at a point where I've really lost trust and faith in the leaders of the school and whether they really apply their equity lens to everybody.

741
01:37:08,797 --> 01:37:20,322
Because to change their teachers potentially, change their classrooms, I understand you're saying it would only be in a crisis situation or an emergency or whatever.

742
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:26,765
I feel like we've had a number of those where that's been said and oops, that's what happened.

743
01:37:27,125 --> 01:37:30,347
Two months out of the school year, I don't know what we'll do at that point.

744
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:40,623
And my, you know, again, my faith and trust right now is not very strong in how you guys are making the decisions for our kids.

745
01:37:40,703 --> 01:37:42,303
So I get it.

746
01:37:42,383 --> 01:37:52,246
I get there's multiple things you're doing and it's a hard, I can't even imagine trying to do it, but we're struggling and this just makes it harder.

747
01:37:53,866 --> 01:37:54,226
Thank you.

748
01:37:56,327 --> 01:37:56,807
Thank you.

749
01:37:56,827 --> 01:37:56,867
Ms.

750
01:37:56,887 --> 01:37:59,068
Rocha?

751
01:38:00,938 --> 01:38:02,879
Three minutes, name and address for the record, please.

752
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:05,961
Hello, can you hear me?

753
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:07,481
Yes, we can.

754
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:11,683
Yes, my name is Leticia Rocha at 3600 Mystic Valley Parkway.

755
01:38:11,703 --> 01:38:13,724
So I just have one question.

756
01:38:14,045 --> 01:38:26,411
What was the district's rationale in not asking for a waiver from the new DESE guidelines, especially if according to the superintendent, there are buildings or classrooms that are perilously close to capacity?

757
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:39,531
So the waivers are being distributed in a sparingly being distributed.

758
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:55,015
But the fact that Medford is one of the communities that is providing testing multiple times a week, and we are able to, we're one of the communities that we were able to have students in person.

759
01:38:56,115 --> 01:39:01,536
We are really essentially not requiring

760
01:39:02,457 --> 01:39:04,219
a waiver at this point in time.

761
01:39:04,259 --> 01:39:11,369
When I said perilously close, meaning that we may have classrooms that would have 21 or 22 students.

762
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:17,723
once you collapse the two hybrid sections together.

763
01:39:18,303 --> 01:39:28,468
So some classrooms, because of the amount of students that are participating in the remote academy would have lower numbers.

764
01:39:28,508 --> 01:39:36,192
So we could have some classrooms that have 15 students and you could have other classrooms that could have 22 or 23 students in person.

765
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:38,634
It just depends on the grade level.

766
01:39:39,294 --> 01:39:41,015
So that's what I was referring to.

767
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,240
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

768
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:55,342
Okay, next up we have number two COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update.

769
01:39:55,822 --> 01:39:57,043
Nurse supervisor, Ms.

770
01:39:57,063 --> 01:39:59,423
Toni Ray and Mr. David Murphy.

771
01:40:01,503 --> 01:40:02,504
Good evening, everyone.

772
01:40:02,584 --> 01:40:06,184
Thank you for letting us present our information.

773
01:40:06,684 --> 01:40:09,405
I'll start first with the city of Medford COVID data.

774
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:16,675
The average daily incidence for rate for positive COVID tests in Medford is on the rise.

775
01:40:17,612 --> 01:40:23,156
This is also in congruence with the data that we're seeing across the state of Massachusetts.

776
01:40:24,017 --> 01:40:30,241
Data published on March 18th showed the average daily incidence rate increased from 16.7 to 19.5 cases per 100,000.

777
01:40:30,281 --> 01:40:33,863
And the percent positivity rate increased from 0.78% to 1.10%, maintaining the city in the yellow zone.

778
01:40:47,821 --> 01:40:56,485
In the schools, we administered 28, 48 COVID tests last week, resulting in four positive pools.

779
01:40:57,425 --> 01:41:05,248
All members of the positive pools received a follow-up rapid antigen test and an individual PCR test.

780
01:41:06,049 --> 01:41:15,613
Contact tracing was completed by the school nurses in conjunction with the board of health and close contacts were placed in quarantine as per our DPH guidelines.

781
01:41:17,687 --> 01:41:29,458
Today, Massachusetts entered phase four, step one of the reopening plan, and I'll just highlight a couple measures of that plan.

782
01:41:30,218 --> 01:41:38,966
For the schools, this morning we returned kindergarten and first grade elementary students to in-person learning for four days per week.

783
01:41:40,082 --> 01:41:44,828
and we will phase in over the next couple weeks for the elementary schools.

784
01:41:45,749 --> 01:41:53,419
I want to reassure the community that we are continuing strict mitigation strategies, including mandatory masks,

785
01:41:54,238 --> 01:42:00,840
hand sanitation and hygiene, classroom sanitation, classroom ventilation.

786
01:42:01,581 --> 01:42:13,225
And now according to the new CDC guidance, we will be maintaining three foot physical distancing as supported by a research study that was done in the state of Massachusetts.

787
01:42:15,767 --> 01:42:27,660
There are also changes in the gathering orders and outdoor gatherings will continue to be limited to 25 people and indoor gatherings limited to 10 people.

788
01:42:30,463 --> 01:42:35,669
Effective today, the Massachusetts travel order was replaced with a travel advisory.

789
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:50,834
And because there are many situations that constitute an exclusion to these travel advisories, I just ask that if you as a family are traveling, please open a conversation with your school nurse.

790
01:42:51,354 --> 01:43:04,299
She will be able to provide you with recommendations that apply to your family situation so that we can give you proper guidance on safe travel and reentering into Massachusetts and the schools.

791
01:43:06,358 --> 01:43:31,610
For the vaccines, we are currently in phase two, people that are 60 and older, people with two or more medical conditions, people who live or work in low income and affordable senior housing, K through 12 educators, school staff, and childcare workers, and other certain essential workers such as grocery personnel may register for a vaccine.

792
01:43:33,402 --> 01:43:42,747
Eligible on April 5th, we are increasing to people who are 55 year old and older and people with one medical condition.

793
01:43:43,728 --> 01:43:50,411
And then on April 19th, phase three opens and that includes anyone who is 16 years or older.

794
01:43:51,812 --> 01:43:57,535
You can pre-register at vaccinesignup.mass.gov

795
01:43:59,283 --> 01:44:09,071
Or if you'd like to search for an appointment at a local pharmacy or a smaller vaccination clinic, you can go to vaxfinder.mass.gov.

796
01:44:10,792 --> 01:44:11,232
Thank you.

797
01:44:14,675 --> 01:44:15,275
Thank you, Ms.

798
01:44:15,315 --> 01:44:15,476
Ray.

799
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:26,344
I'm going to move on to Mr. David Murphy, number three, budget update presentation.

800
01:44:27,878 --> 01:44:29,079
Thank you, Mayor.

801
01:44:30,219 --> 01:44:39,004
I'm going to share a document momentarily that I'll be happy to share with the committee after this presentation.

802
01:44:39,204 --> 01:44:47,909
It is a collection of slides, the vast majority of which you've seen in one version or another in previous presentations.

803
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:54,793
They're being shared with you this evening as part of what we said

804
01:44:56,410 --> 01:45:00,433
in previous meetings would be regular updates on our budgetary process.

805
01:45:01,113 --> 01:45:22,166
Tonight, in particular, and in response to questions that were raised by the committee on February 22nd, we're focusing on closing fiscal year 2021 and giving you a sense as to what work is being done within the operating budget from FY21.

806
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:53,413
I included the slides that you've seen in one version or another in previous presentations, because I think this conversation, and particularly these conversations at this time of year in the budget cycle, it's particularly important to provide as much context as possible when we're discussing these fiscal matters, because any stray piece of information coming out of this conversation

807
01:45:54,150 --> 01:46:05,639
I think could very easily be misunderstood or misinterpreted to suggest either that we are in a better or worse financial position than we are in.

808
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:19,549
So I'm gonna present this information, the slides that you've seen multiple times, I'll probably go through in an expedited fashion, but in just a few minutes, I'm happy to take any questions that you might have.

809
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:23,052
And again, these are regular updates that leading into the budget,

810
01:46:24,447 --> 01:46:30,431
approval process we'll be putting on the agenda going forward between now and the close of the fiscal year.

811
01:46:30,492 --> 01:46:50,967
So you remember this slide from our February 8th presentation discussing the three routes toward the school budget and the funding sources, including the external funds, which are not a big part of the conversation tonight, frankly, because we're focused instead just on the operating budget made up of the local contribution and the Chapter 78 that comes in.

812
01:46:54,070 --> 01:47:09,317
What is unique to FY21 and FY22 is there is a significantly higher number of external funds as a result of COVID related funding.

813
01:47:09,977 --> 01:47:18,261
There are also funding sources that the eligibility of which in terms of certain expenses have changed at various points throughout the last calendar year.

814
01:47:19,001 --> 01:47:23,003
And that as we'll discuss in a moment is why

815
01:47:24,485 --> 01:47:47,072
The closing out FY 21 and preparing for FY 22 is particularly challenging because there are a lot of moving targets as we make a determination about what can be charged to certain accounts that frees up other funding and then gives us the opportunity to essentially backfill.

816
01:47:47,672 --> 01:47:52,254
And that's one of the things that we've been working on and will continue to work on.

817
01:47:52,872 --> 01:47:55,412
as we get closer to the close of the fiscal year.

818
01:47:55,913 --> 01:47:57,353
So I make sure I didn't miss a slide there.

819
01:47:58,513 --> 01:48:08,815
So on February 8th, you may recall that we identified seven or eight significant challenges that we were anticipating coming into FY22.

820
01:48:09,435 --> 01:48:21,057
And they ranged from diminishing revenues to unfortunate timing with regard to the state's charter school reimbursement formula, stagnating chapter 70 projections that were

821
01:48:23,085 --> 01:48:36,531
being seen in the initial proposals coming out of the state house, escalating costs related to special education and transportation, which aren't particularly unusual, but become particularly challenging in this type of environment.

822
01:48:37,752 --> 01:48:41,474
And I apologize, I fast forwarded too quickly there.

823
01:48:42,614 --> 01:48:43,835
That's all still true.

824
01:48:44,075 --> 01:48:47,717
However, some significant variables have changed since February 8th.

825
01:48:48,838 --> 01:49:11,147
And generally speaking, I would say those variables have changed in a positive direction in the sense that the federal legislation that was passed two weeks ago is providing federal funding that is flowing toward ultimately toward the school district in a way that we're going to be need to be really thoughtful and really strategic over an extended period of time.

826
01:49:12,328 --> 01:49:17,210
But some of those potential fiscal cliff edges

827
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:24,631
maybe a little further off than we had initially anticipated when we last did a budget update on February 8th.

828
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:32,878
So again, tonight we're focusing on the close of FY21, but although this slide just details some of the other work that's taking place.

829
01:49:33,598 --> 01:49:43,387
If you look at that second bullet with the ESSER II funding, that deadline of March 31st, that's a strategic decision that needs to be made in the coming days

830
01:49:44,118 --> 01:49:47,760
And it's a fairly complicated one, and one that we're still working through.

831
01:49:48,281 --> 01:50:08,132
But essentially what the state has said is that if the district wants to access the ESSER II funding, that's the $2.3 million that was highlighted in a previous slide and that we've discussed with you before, we need to map out what we would use all of the $2.3 million for

832
01:50:09,933 --> 01:50:26,657
If we plan to use it during FY21, not to say that we'd have to use all $2.3 million, but if we want to access any of that $2.3 million, we would be required by the state to detail by March 31 how that funding would be used.

833
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:28,798
And that's over an extended period of time.

834
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:36,100
It would be neither the Medford Public Schools nor any school district is going to be able to articulate with specificity

835
01:50:36,734 --> 01:50:41,857
exactly what the funding priorities will be over the next two fiscal years by March 31st.

836
01:50:41,877 --> 01:50:44,038
There are just too many variables and too many uncertainties.

837
01:50:44,718 --> 01:51:04,569
We could present a plan knowing that we'll have to make amendments to that plan in order to access the funding for FY21, but it would be, I think, to a certain extent, a disingenuous exercise because if we were to map all of that out, the vast majority of the 2.3 million would be put in reserve for use

838
01:51:05,196 --> 01:51:13,061
in subsequent fiscal years, and the uses of that, the true uses of that would be identified later.

839
01:51:13,522 --> 01:51:26,871
The state has been very clear that we can amend that, but it's still, it's a difficult position to be in to map out a plan that you have every intention of amending sooner rather than later.

840
01:51:28,132 --> 01:51:34,016
However, when we refer to the previous conversation about having some urgent priorities

841
01:51:35,345 --> 01:52:00,687
that relate to our current fiscal year, such as maintaining consistency in the classroom amongst cohort D students, it may be the case that we want to make sure we have access to that funding so that we can be sure to retain whatever staff is necessary to not disrupt student-teacher relationships in cohort D. I don't think that alone is going to be a reason to

842
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:08,892
access the ESSER II funding right now, and I'll explain why as we go here.

843
01:52:11,653 --> 01:52:21,476
So these are some of the variables that have changed, and I've alluded to them already in the previous slide about additional funding sources have been identified, external funding sources.

844
01:52:21,936 --> 01:52:31,939
The eligibility criteria has evolved in some cases by statutory amendment, in other cases by changes in the regulatory guidance that we've been provided

845
01:52:33,963 --> 01:52:44,029
So I think the key here to understanding how the work within the FY21 budget is that there's always reclassifications that are occurring in a normal school year.

846
01:52:44,749 --> 01:52:57,137
And you're always, generally speaking, trying to use the operating funds last, because the external funding sources generally have narrower definitions as to what those funds can be used for.

847
01:52:57,677 --> 01:53:02,500
And so you're leaving yourself more flexibility, provided that you're tapping the operating budget last.

848
01:53:02,963 --> 01:53:16,126
In this case, the number of external funding sources multiplied as a result of the assistance provided by the state and federal government, such that there's that much more reclassification that is occurring at all times.

849
01:53:16,186 --> 01:53:30,349
And at the same time, so many new expenses are coming up as a result of pandemic-related challenges, whether it be air quality or personnel or PPE or whatever the case may be.

850
01:53:30,389 --> 01:53:31,549
There are more things to pay for.

851
01:53:33,855 --> 01:53:39,776
So this slide is sort of a continuation of our conversation on February 22nd.

852
01:53:40,496 --> 01:53:50,659
The operating budget for the school department that was approved in June of 2020 was $61.25 million.

853
01:53:52,099 --> 01:54:01,981
In late August and as brought to the school committee on September 9th, there was about $1.1 million used to supplement that operating budget

854
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:05,071
and which brought us to 62.3.

855
01:54:05,552 --> 01:54:11,315
Again, that's not including the $2.98 million of our traditional external funds.

856
01:54:11,816 --> 01:54:19,060
That's chapter one, excuse me, title one, title four, various special education grants and things like that.

857
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:21,282
That amounts to about $3 million.

858
01:54:21,642 --> 01:54:26,325
But if we were talking about an all in funding analysis, we would include that.

859
01:54:26,385 --> 01:54:31,088
But in terms of the operating budget approved by the committee, it was the 61.25 and then supplemented

860
01:54:33,194 --> 01:54:36,695
later in the year when the additional Chapter 70 funding became available.

861
01:54:37,155 --> 01:54:48,599
And in September, we discussed the various personnel needs that the district had identified, some of which had been identified even prior to those funding supplement coming through.

862
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:58,902
And others we anticipated would arise as a result of the pandemic related personnel challenges that the district was

863
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:03,371
uh, in early September anticipating and then later in the year experiencing.

864
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:22,036
And so if you, if we were to, it's a little difficult to, some of these are, um, instances in which there were expenses that were then reclassified because there was a determination that some of those external fundings, funding would, um, be available for use.

865
01:55:22,636 --> 01:55:27,117
But generally speaking, the 1.1 million went toward various personnel needs,

866
01:55:27,737 --> 01:55:29,438
and COVID-related expenses.

867
01:55:29,498 --> 01:55:32,239
So there were three classroom teachers added.

868
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:34,960
There was a restoration of instructional specialists.

869
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:41,483
There was some central office support added through the business office and the parent information center.

870
01:55:41,503 --> 01:55:54,510
And then the CPT stipend positions were an effort to coordinate instructional alignment amongst at the elementary level where

871
01:55:56,450 --> 01:56:03,474
The schools were obviously operating in a very different model than they had before and with large section of the students being fully remote.

872
01:56:03,534 --> 01:56:12,879
And so in order to maintain sequencing and ensure that there was that horizontal alignment, there were stipends offered to the teaching personnel.

873
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:25,366
A few other various related items, but this does not add up to 1.1 million necessarily, but then this is also taking into account unanticipated savings that may occur

874
01:56:26,125 --> 01:56:32,948
in other areas within personnel line items that is just part of the normal flow of any budget cycle.

875
01:56:35,129 --> 01:56:47,274
So this is where we currently stand and I can go into greater detail and I'm anticipating presenting it with more specificity, the state of each individual revolving account.

876
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:53,977
One of the bullet points earlier that I probably, I should have emphasized when we went by it

877
01:56:54,516 --> 01:57:17,487
was in addition to the unique challenges around all of the reclassification efforts that are necessary in this fiscal year due to the significant number of external funding sources, we have also attempted throughout the course of this year to remedy instances in which reoccurring expenses

878
01:57:18,262 --> 01:57:26,287
were being charged to revolving accounts in a way that wouldn't necessarily constitute a best practice from a financial perspective.

879
01:57:27,048 --> 01:57:41,638
The revolving accounts generally should be used for targeted funding purposes related to fees that may in fact fluctuate, but the understanding being that the services would then fluctuate along with the demand.

880
01:57:41,818 --> 01:57:46,781
So if you have a department of staff and the number of staff is dependent upon the

881
01:57:48,818 --> 01:58:01,702
number of people paying into the revolving account and receiving the services, it would be appropriate to fund those personnel through the revolving account and through the fees that are collected.

882
01:58:01,802 --> 01:58:16,246
However, if there's an administrator overseeing that department that will be there regardless of the scale of the program or the level of funding in the revolving account, that administrator should be considered

883
01:58:16,936 --> 01:58:19,657
a reoccurring expense in charge to the operating budget.

884
01:58:19,697 --> 01:58:31,059
And so that's part of an accounting effort to remedy our accounting that's been going on throughout the fiscal year, irrespective of the COVID related challenges.

885
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:43,362
And so what you see here is that, and hopefully the disclaimer is explicit enough at the bottom of the slide, but this is not to suggest we are

886
01:58:44,502 --> 01:58:49,884
have a million dollar surplus on our operating budget because that's not true.

887
01:58:49,924 --> 01:58:59,709
Although on the ordinary expense line, that number is probably inflated in part due to the non-essential spending freeze that we imposed in January.

888
01:59:00,349 --> 01:59:12,034
Part of the reasoning behind the non-essential spending freeze that we imposed in January was due to concerns over some of the revolving accounts that were likely to be running deficits.

889
01:59:13,485 --> 01:59:23,309
later in the fiscal year, those deficits being attributable to the fluctuation in incoming funds that have to do with the pandemic.

890
01:59:23,369 --> 01:59:30,351
So there are fewer people using some of the venues, there are fewer people participating in some of the programs, that's producing deficits.

891
01:59:30,871 --> 01:59:35,273
The largest portion of the current revolving account

892
01:59:35,918 --> 01:59:43,863
deficit is attributable to the revolving account known as the lunch program, but is slightly more encompassing in food services.

893
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:51,587
That number we expect to decline significantly when additional reimbursements come in.

894
01:59:52,708 --> 02:00:04,294
The other variable that's clear from this slide you can see is not determined yet is how much of the external funding will be put toward some of these challenges that we have.

895
02:00:06,261 --> 02:00:15,827
as an example and an illustration of sort of the machinations that happen within a budget that's made up of so many different funding sources.

896
02:00:17,368 --> 02:00:31,817
The guidance from the federal government is that the funding's part of the funding that they are allocating is meant to bridge the gaps in the lunch, again, what's called the lunch program and the revolving account,

897
02:00:32,426 --> 02:00:38,827
because it's something that's happening in virtually every school district across the commonwealth because there are not as many students in school.

898
02:00:39,207 --> 02:00:41,848
There are not as many students participating in lunch program.

899
02:00:42,288 --> 02:00:51,090
And so almost every district is experiencing some type of deficit in that revolving account because the participation is just not there.

900
02:00:51,150 --> 02:01:01,352
So it's the intent of some of this funding to go toward bridging that gap where the expenses have outpaced the revenue on the food services side.

901
02:01:02,028 --> 02:01:14,895
So with that being said, right now, we are at about even if you factor in the totality of the revolving account deficits.

902
02:01:16,075 --> 02:01:18,476
Again, we know that that number is going to shrink.

903
02:01:19,417 --> 02:01:23,699
And so as a result, we are confident we'll be in a good position.

904
02:01:24,139 --> 02:01:29,382
And when you factor in the external funds that will be available, that's why I said earlier that I'm

905
02:01:30,087 --> 02:01:54,878
I'm confident that it would only be in an extreme circumstance where we'd be in a position where we'd have to disrupt the student teacher relationships in cohort D. It doesn't mean it couldn't happen, but it's more likely that if it were to happen, it would be due to a thin applicant pool of additional staff that we'd like to bring on as opposed to insufficient funding at this point.

906
02:01:56,218 --> 02:01:58,699
And this is our timeline of the budget process that

907
02:02:01,323 --> 02:02:03,725
you've seen before and it's still intact.

908
02:02:03,745 --> 02:02:12,532
So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen because I anticipate there'll be questions and I'll be able to respond more easily, but I'm happy to circle back to any slides that folks might have questions about.

909
02:02:15,694 --> 02:02:16,635
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

910
02:02:16,655 --> 02:02:18,096
Member Russo.

911
02:02:20,378 --> 02:02:20,698
Thank you.

912
02:02:20,759 --> 02:02:21,799
I appreciate it.

913
02:02:21,879 --> 02:02:27,924
And I'm glad you're doing it all again because I think it's one of those things you have to hear multiple times.

914
02:02:30,535 --> 02:02:42,004
In that last slide, is there a date yet for when, and I realize the mayor may not be ready for this yet, but is there a date when the number will be handed over on a napkin?

915
02:02:46,767 --> 02:02:47,848
What's the budget number?

916
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:54,393
Yeah, we were on with Tony Roselli, our outside auditors who is following ANF and DLS.

917
02:02:55,465 --> 02:02:56,545
very closely.

918
02:02:56,585 --> 02:03:00,366
And as of Friday, there was no guidance to the federal stimulus.

919
02:03:01,027 --> 02:03:07,148
So I'm hoping to get guidance as soon as possible with regards to the restrictions and how that can be spent.

920
02:03:07,728 --> 02:03:11,890
And then we will figure it out and give the schools a number as soon as we can.

921
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:23,633
I would just say, Mayor, if I could add that the lack of guidance with regard to federal restrictions is why that number in the column on the far right is TBD because

922
02:03:24,197 --> 02:03:25,978
we're confident that there's gonna be funding.

923
02:03:25,998 --> 02:03:38,601
The numbers they're talking about, frankly, are such that it's gonna have to be pretty tight restrictions for us to not be able to use the funding to bridge some of these gaps just based on the totality of potential funding.

924
02:03:39,401 --> 02:03:45,323
But we can't say with specificity what it will be because we don't know how those restrictions will work.

925
02:03:45,783 --> 02:03:51,665
And as has been the case with the external funding sources that have come in in FY21, there could be restrictions

926
02:03:52,206 --> 02:03:57,791
That essentially means we can't use the funding for purpose one, two, and three as we would prefer.

927
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:15,126
But if we're able to back out of the operating budget purposes four, five, and six, then provided there aren't restrictions around supplanting, that's the type of strategy that we would use to make the budget whole.

928
02:04:15,826 --> 02:04:20,190
But sometimes that does take some time to work through and to fully articulate that rationale.

929
02:04:22,190 --> 02:04:22,510
Thank you.

930
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:35,519
And my other question is, you know, is sort of a, you know, considering the unknowns, and, you know, we had this problem last year, obviously, we were really getting into the pandemic.

931
02:04:35,619 --> 02:04:38,160
So in fact, it was not the same as this year.

932
02:04:39,001 --> 02:04:45,285
But, you know, there are communities in Massachusetts that develop a school budget,

933
02:04:45,959 --> 02:04:51,141
they don't know what the mayor's number is gonna, well, usually they're not committees where the mayor is on the committee.

934
02:04:51,661 --> 02:05:09,407
So it's a little more politically and operationally easier for a school committee to just come up with a budget, here's the number, send it off to the council and the mayor's like, we can't do this or whatever.

935
02:05:10,447 --> 02:05:13,108
But this happens in multiple communities around the state

936
02:05:13,662 --> 02:05:16,404
they send up an $80 million budget and they get 70 million.

937
02:05:17,404 --> 02:05:19,986
The world doesn't fall apart, they get 70 million.

938
02:05:20,906 --> 02:05:28,511
And then the superintendent and the school committee have to figure out, well, what are we gonna do with that $10 million difference afterwards, which is probably no fun.

939
02:05:29,672 --> 02:05:35,935
But we've always taken the approach where we all send up to the nickel, the amount we're gonna get.

940
02:05:37,436 --> 02:05:41,379
And if we're doing that in February, that's different than doing it in June.

941
02:05:44,155 --> 02:05:47,596
You know, I guess my question is why do we not just try this other approach?

942
02:05:47,916 --> 02:05:49,836
We develop the budget we think we need.

943
02:05:50,277 --> 02:05:54,438
We send it to city council and the mayor has a number on her budget.

944
02:05:54,458 --> 02:05:55,578
She sends the city council.

945
02:05:55,678 --> 02:05:56,718
They won't be the same.

946
02:05:57,558 --> 02:05:58,939
The world won't fall apart.

947
02:05:59,059 --> 02:06:00,439
The school system won't close.

948
02:06:01,539 --> 02:06:04,340
And then we deal with the amount we get.

949
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:10,602
To me, it seems actually like the more rational approach.

950
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:15,593
And I'm just wondering why we aren't taking that or even considering that approach.

951
02:06:15,653 --> 02:06:25,460
Cause it sounds to me like you all in your departments are gonna do a boatload of work, all work you will have finished before the number arrives.

952
02:06:28,443 --> 02:06:35,608
It's to me, if the mayor comes back and says, here's a number, it's bigger than you would even imagined.

953
02:06:37,249 --> 02:06:39,851
All the departments have finished doing all their work and figuring out what they need.

954
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:48,235
I mean, you certainly are not gonna say no to the mayor who says, here's $5 million more than we thought we could imagine getting.

955
02:06:49,937 --> 02:06:58,804
But if we start from the approach of we aren't gonna get anything or we're gonna get level funded or whatever, we're sort of, we're behind the eight ball.

956
02:06:59,225 --> 02:07:08,873
If we end up with millions of surprise dollars that we definitely know based on last year's budget, we could easily spend

957
02:07:09,782 --> 02:07:16,664
to improve the educational outcomes of the students, which is supposed to be what the school committee's principal job is.

958
02:07:17,325 --> 02:07:33,811
So I guess my question is, why do we not actually just build a budget, not be worried about what the number is that we're gonna get, and then deal with the difference afterwards, which is happening in other communities and it's happened traditionally in other communities year after year?

959
02:07:36,172 --> 02:07:36,332
Well,

960
02:07:38,461 --> 02:07:50,844
One thing I would say, Mr. Rousseau, is that this is going to be a unique fiscal cycle this year and next year, frankly, for a few different reasons.

961
02:07:51,864 --> 02:08:00,426
One is the amount of potential funding is going to be of a magnitude that I think we have to be really thoughtful and really strategic.

962
02:08:01,706 --> 02:08:07,047
The other reason is that that funding is intended to stretch over a period of time.

963
02:08:07,818 --> 02:08:28,934
And so the type of, I would say, more organic process, I'm not sure if that's the right description or not, but hopefully you'll allow me to use it for the time being, may well play out over an extended period of time, but not in the sort of typical two to three month window of time that we are used to diving in and dealing with budget issues.

964
02:08:29,455 --> 02:08:35,459
It may be the case that we end up with millions of dollars more than we were anticipating, but

965
02:08:36,607 --> 02:08:44,749
that funding may be intended to be expended over the next two to three fiscal years.

966
02:08:45,250 --> 02:09:04,115
And so I would suggest that it would be better to have a more prolonged prioritization process, maybe one that moves well into fiscal year 22 with the understanding that we can develop those priorities and ultimately execute on them over an extended period of time

967
02:09:04,673 --> 02:09:10,838
as opposed to just lining everything up and being ready to expend everything on July 1st, 2022.

968
02:09:12,219 --> 02:09:31,095
So I agree it would be rare for a school district to say, no, we don't want those $4 million, but under these circumstances, and again, I don't know what the restrictions are gonna be so that this money may not materialize, but I do think this is sort of a rare instance in which it's conceivable to me that the school district might say, we don't want that money right now.

969
02:09:31,635 --> 02:09:33,677
We might say, we appreciate that money,

970
02:09:34,093 --> 02:09:41,096
We're going to put together a thoughtful strategic plan and we're going to expend it throughout FY 22 and maybe FY 23 into FY 24.

971
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:46,738
But it might be the case that it takes an extended period of time in order to develop that.

972
02:09:47,138 --> 02:10:01,443
The last thing I would say is I think that the work that you did in the last budget cycle of identifying the priorities that were not able to be funded have helped, I think, across the school department to serve

973
02:10:02,243 --> 02:10:27,409
to allow the sort of narrative to be a continuation, that places where we wanted more support or we wanted more intervention-oriented personnel or some of the technology priorities that we wanted to be able to pursue, while there's been a number of boxes checked as a result of all the COVID-related funding, a lot of it is still there and is work that has to be done.

974
02:10:27,889 --> 02:10:29,270
And so I don't think that

975
02:10:30,965 --> 02:10:33,607
we're starting from scratch right now.

976
02:10:34,087 --> 02:10:46,596
And I think that relieves a little bit of the type of pressure that you correctly identify occurs when you are waiting to just make sure that everybody's numbers are aligned with one another.

977
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:52,320
I think you're on.

978
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:56,622
Sorry, thank you.

979
02:10:58,284 --> 02:11:00,185
When I first got onto the school committee,

980
02:11:00,787 --> 02:11:14,389
a little under four years ago, I was kind of surprised by the maintenance budget, which is sort of the easy low hanging fruit of a conversation because it's just technically not complicated like education and curriculum and these other things.

981
02:11:15,209 --> 02:11:27,252
And since I've been on the school committee, we've actually cut the maintenance budget each year from a shockingly low number to a number that frankly, regular little businesses probably have in their budgets.

982
02:11:30,278 --> 02:11:43,809
You know, if you told me we had $4 million extra this year to spend on maintenance, I would be shocked if you didn't have $4 million worth of maintenance that we haven't done for the last 35 or 40 years that could be done this year.

983
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:54,678
When a teacher who teaches in our school can't open windows, when he last opened a window was when he was a student at the school.

984
02:11:55,879 --> 02:11:57,200
Those windows don't open now either.

985
02:11:59,501 --> 02:12:05,385
we could blow $4 million or $10 million in maintenance in this district without even breaking a sweat.

986
02:12:05,986 --> 02:12:08,307
And we don't have a sex education teacher.

987
02:12:09,048 --> 02:12:14,632
We don't have reading teachers at the high school if you're not on an IEP and you can't read great, too bad.

988
02:12:16,713 --> 02:12:24,779
So the notion that, as far as I'm concerned, if you gave us an $80 million budget, I would call it a zero fluff budget.

989
02:12:26,022 --> 02:12:38,108
So when we get our $61.25 million budget this year and it does nothing for the kids, it gives them what they had last year minus inflation and contractual requirements.

990
02:12:38,569 --> 02:12:44,792
And Maurice and you all figure out who else are we gonna cut from the last three people that we haven't cut out of administration?

991
02:12:47,654 --> 02:12:53,997
We are the people, all of us on this meeting are the people that need to make sure that the public knows

992
02:12:54,541 --> 02:12:57,782
We are not underfunded by a few million dollars a year.

993
02:12:58,642 --> 02:13:03,504
We are 30 years since that, well, however many years is it?

994
02:13:03,724 --> 02:13:05,845
25 years since the 1993 ed reform act.

995
02:13:07,205 --> 02:13:10,427
Actually, it's been 30 years or more since prop two and a half.

996
02:13:11,087 --> 02:13:15,088
We've been cutting budgets since 1986, every single year.

997
02:13:15,288 --> 02:13:17,149
Don't look at the number, it goes up.

998
02:13:17,209 --> 02:13:17,549
Guess what?

999
02:13:17,569 --> 02:13:19,970
A candy bar doesn't cost five cents anymore either.

1000
02:13:23,065 --> 02:13:30,370
We should be talking about that at every meeting and not talking about how we're going to make it work because we haven't been making it work.

1001
02:13:31,491 --> 02:13:37,315
All the kids graduating from our high school that don't get reading services, for them it's not working.

1002
02:13:38,596 --> 02:13:44,760
And I just, I get tired of the conversation about how we're going to manage.

1003
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:46,621
We are going to manage.

1004
02:13:46,641 --> 02:13:47,341
We're the adults.

1005
02:13:47,381 --> 02:13:50,924
We're already, we have careers and jobs and families and houses if we're lucky.

1006
02:13:51,704 --> 02:13:52,965
you know, we're gonna manage.

1007
02:13:53,385 --> 02:13:54,726
It's the kids that aren't gonna manage.

1008
02:13:55,546 --> 02:14:01,589
And, you know, I just feel like I'm a broken record and I'll just let somebody else talk.

1009
02:14:08,732 --> 02:14:09,353
Member Graham.

1010
02:14:11,354 --> 02:14:16,036
How much money is the city of Medford slated to get through the Federal Stimulus Act?

1011
02:14:16,056 --> 02:14:17,657
39.26 million.

1012
02:14:22,564 --> 02:14:29,025
And what is the term that it has to be spent over?

1013
02:14:29,266 --> 02:14:30,706
It's several years, is that right?

1014
02:14:31,406 --> 02:14:35,087
It's for revenue loss from last year until 2025.

1015
02:14:41,708 --> 02:14:48,870
And then the ESSER money that will come directly to the schools, what is that amount?

1016
02:14:50,152 --> 02:14:58,235
ESSER 2 is approximately 2.3 million, and we anticipate ESSER 3, we don't have an exact number yet, but it's estimated to be between four and five million.

1017
02:14:59,776 --> 02:15:03,877
And are they 2025 end date as well, or do we not know?

1018
02:15:03,897 --> 02:15:16,382
ESSER 2 is through FY 24, I believe, and I am assuming ESSER 3 is through FY 25, but that's an inference I'm drawing based on the municipal numbers.

1019
02:15:18,808 --> 02:15:19,789
And I'm sorry, Mayor.

1020
02:15:19,829 --> 02:15:22,732
Did you say when you expected to have that information?

1021
02:15:22,752 --> 02:15:25,814
I would expect it soon.

1022
02:15:25,855 --> 02:15:33,281
I was set up the meeting for last Friday, expecting the outside auditors would have that information and just wasn't available yet from DLS.

1023
02:15:33,321 --> 02:15:37,745
But Mr Heath was from A and F was working on it.

1024
02:15:37,825 --> 02:15:41,809
So I would expect it this week or next next the latest.

1025
02:15:44,071 --> 02:15:44,872
Okay, thank you.

1026
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:59,863
For whatever it's worth, I was talking with a counterpart of mine in a different district today, and he had just walked out of a meeting at City Hall in that community at the exact same timeline that was provided by their auditors and state representatives.

1027
02:16:00,723 --> 02:16:00,903
Yes.

1028
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:03,443
Great, thank you.

1029
02:16:05,144 --> 02:16:05,944
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1030
02:16:06,904 --> 02:16:13,205
Up next, we have update on summer programming, summer fund programming, Medford Vocational Technical High School summer

1031
02:16:13,562 --> 02:16:19,265
Discovery Program, Dr. Peter Cushing, Mr. Bob, Bobby Maloney and Principal Chad Fallon.

1032
02:16:24,148 --> 02:16:24,908
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1033
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:29,731
Really appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight.

1034
02:16:30,171 --> 02:16:34,493
We've begun working on make Mr. Fallon.

1035
02:16:37,575 --> 02:16:40,176
So we've begun working several weeks ago on

1036
02:16:41,948 --> 02:16:45,589
planning for our summer events.

1037
02:16:46,289 --> 02:16:48,750
There are numerous things that we have to take into consideration.

1038
02:16:48,930 --> 02:16:58,672
First is our nursing needs and the ability to continue to address safety concerns through ongoing testing.

1039
02:16:59,552 --> 02:17:01,673
So those are some of the issues that we're starting to look at.

1040
02:17:02,473 --> 02:17:09,755
We are also currently examining multiple options to support students

1041
02:17:10,437 --> 02:17:15,742
not only for the learning loss, but also for the social emotional welfare.

1042
02:17:17,223 --> 02:17:24,109
We're looking at the traditional summer fun, summer school and the MVTHS summer discovery program.

1043
02:17:24,869 --> 02:17:29,874
I'd like to offer Mr. Fallon a chance to speak on the summer discovery program at this time.

1044
02:17:31,395 --> 02:17:33,377
Mr. Fallon, welcome.

1045
02:17:36,059 --> 02:17:36,519
Thanks guys.

1046
02:17:36,539 --> 02:17:37,180
Good evening, everyone.

1047
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:49,761
So each year we traditionally do a program for 6th, 7th and 8th graders over at the vocational school and they come up for a couple weeks and they rotate through a few of our programs and it's always been something the communities loved.

1048
02:17:49,801 --> 02:17:53,364
We didn't do it last year for obvious reasons but this year we're going to try to go for it again.

1049
02:17:53,384 --> 02:17:57,608
I have a survey out to my teachers now to see which weeks works best for them because

1050
02:17:59,365 --> 02:18:05,629
you know, when I've done summer programming for a long time and I've learned that you plan around the teachers because we have to be realistic.

1051
02:18:05,649 --> 02:18:07,970
They're working all year, especially this year was a tough one.

1052
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:12,233
So I'm just trying to gauge and see if I can get enough interest of teachers, which I think we will.

1053
02:18:12,273 --> 02:18:13,394
We already have a few so far.

1054
02:18:13,854 --> 02:18:18,817
So that will run either the first two weeks directly after school ends or two weeks later.

1055
02:18:18,997 --> 02:18:22,099
So basically into the month of July, but that's what we're planning.

1056
02:18:22,119 --> 02:18:26,481
And so we're hoping that, you know, the numbers keep trending in the right direction where we can have kids in, but,

1057
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:33,775
I was a little disappointed to hear Tony Ray's report tonight, because it seems like they're on the rise a little bit, but we'll ride the wave.

1058
02:18:34,576 --> 02:18:35,557
Questions about that program?

1059
02:18:38,999 --> 02:18:39,179
Okay.

1060
02:18:39,759 --> 02:18:40,499
Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

1061
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:41,560
Member McLaughlin?

1062
02:18:43,361 --> 02:18:46,183
Yes, actually, I do have a question, if you don't mind, Mr. Fallon.

1063
02:18:47,023 --> 02:18:49,945
Can you tell, I know that you said they rotate through the program.

1064
02:18:49,965 --> 02:18:54,367
How many children do you generally have that have been participating in that?

1065
02:18:55,976 --> 02:19:06,078
on that programming and I'm assuming children with and without, or children on IEPs and not on IEPs for that program as well.

1066
02:19:06,918 --> 02:19:13,019
Yeah, I mean, I'd say in any given year, it's anywhere between 30 and 45 students, 45 being probably a high year.

1067
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,880
They usually pick three programs that they wanna go through.

1068
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:21,341
So three of our 15, and of course it's open to all students.

1069
02:19:22,861 --> 02:19:25,322
You just really just have to be in grade six, seven or eight.

1070
02:19:28,228 --> 02:19:28,588
Thank you.

1071
02:19:28,648 --> 02:19:30,429
And is it all day like a regular school day?

1072
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:32,771
No, we usually do it 830 to 1130.

1073
02:19:33,952 --> 02:19:34,212
Great.

1074
02:19:34,312 --> 02:19:34,732
Thank you.

1075
02:19:35,313 --> 02:19:35,633
Welcome.

1076
02:19:39,555 --> 02:19:51,563
And so just just want to mention to, you know, in looking at our regular summer school, the traditional summer school for students, we're also looking at ways that they can be outdoors ways that we can

1077
02:19:52,143 --> 02:20:01,707
that as well as addressing the learning loss, find opportunities for them to re-engage with their peers, re-engage with their surroundings that they may have been isolated from.

1078
02:20:02,848 --> 02:20:17,334
We're working with Stacey Shulman on this and also we'll be having pretty regular conversations with nurse Tony Ray as the fact is we are still in a global pandemic.

1079
02:20:19,776 --> 02:20:20,596
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1080
02:20:22,687 --> 02:20:28,891
We have report on activities planned for senior class 2021, Dr. Peter Cushing, principal.

1081
02:20:28,931 --> 02:20:30,413
I'm sorry, Mayor, excuse me.

1082
02:20:30,453 --> 02:20:31,193
Mayor McLaughlin.

1083
02:20:32,274 --> 02:20:36,937
Thank you for the, did we miss the summer fun program or was that not?

1084
02:20:38,178 --> 02:20:39,159
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

1085
02:20:39,959 --> 02:20:46,324
I think they were all inclusive and just said they were working on all three programs, but is there anything else you wanna clarify Dr. Cushing?

1086
02:20:48,047 --> 02:21:13,139
Mr. Maloney had a previous commitment, so he wasn't able to make it tonight, but we are working on the summer fund program as well and looking at the ways that we can, you know, infuse learning into that more traditionally summer camp style program to be able to support students coming off of, you know, this really disruptive last 15 months, despite the best efforts of our educators.

1087
02:21:14,679 --> 02:21:15,140
Thank you.

1088
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:15,860
Mayor, may I?

1089
02:21:19,016 --> 02:21:19,917
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

1090
02:21:20,218 --> 02:21:20,558
Thank you.

1091
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:28,249
I respectfully would ask that we move that agenda item to the next April 12th meeting then please.

1092
02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:33,757
What's happened historically on the summer fund program is we're not finding out until very, very late.

1093
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:38,241
families aren't finding out until very, very late in the year when they're needing to make these decisions.

1094
02:21:38,341 --> 02:21:46,044
And I know that a lot has been up in the air, but we're starting to put in motion other programs and really, we're getting our kids back to in full time.

1095
02:21:46,084 --> 02:21:51,766
I think we should be really giving some serious consideration to our summer fund program.

1096
02:21:51,786 --> 02:21:56,548
It offers a lot of social emotional opportunities for our students, for our students with and without disabilities.

1097
02:21:57,309 --> 02:21:59,350
It's been a really successful program in the past.

1098
02:22:00,548 --> 02:22:05,570
And it's something that I think is really an important community building aspect of our schools.

1099
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:09,072
So I would ask that we include the summer fund program on the April 12th agenda.

1100
02:22:09,512 --> 02:22:11,753
And hopefully Mr. Maloney can make that, thank you.

1101
02:22:12,814 --> 02:22:17,736
So in Dr. Cushing, the athletic department runs the summer fund program?

1102
02:22:20,297 --> 02:22:22,438
I believe it's through the community schools.

1103
02:22:22,458 --> 02:22:23,359
Community schools.

1104
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,220
Which is the athletic department.

1105
02:22:27,021 --> 02:22:29,402
Correct.

1106
02:22:29,462 --> 02:22:29,642
Okay.

1107
02:22:30,262 --> 02:22:37,067
If we could have a second on the motion to get a further update and have... Second.

1108
02:22:37,368 --> 02:22:38,168
Member Van de Kloet.

1109
02:22:40,130 --> 02:22:40,510
Sorry.

1110
02:22:43,112 --> 02:22:43,732
Member Van de Kloet.

1111
02:22:44,353 --> 02:22:46,034
I wanted to ask another question.

1112
02:22:46,294 --> 02:22:47,615
Why don't we vote on this one first?

1113
02:22:48,016 --> 02:22:48,276
Okay.

1114
02:22:49,257 --> 02:22:58,604
Motion that the summer fund program further update be placed on the April 12, 2021 agenda by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van de Kloet, roll call.

1115
02:23:00,209 --> 02:23:00,869
Member Graham?

1116
02:23:01,409 --> 02:23:01,629
Yes.

1117
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:03,810
Member Kretz?

1118
02:23:04,350 --> 02:23:04,610
Yes.

1119
02:23:06,071 --> 02:23:07,131
Member McLaughlin, yes.

1120
02:23:07,231 --> 02:23:08,011
Member McStone?

1121
02:23:08,191 --> 02:23:08,451
Yes.

1122
02:23:09,952 --> 02:23:10,692
Member Rousseau?

1123
02:23:11,852 --> 02:23:12,172
Yes.

1124
02:23:13,373 --> 02:23:14,253
Member Van de Kloot?

1125
02:23:14,733 --> 02:23:14,953
Yes.

1126
02:23:16,013 --> 02:23:16,794
Mayor Long-Kern?

1127
02:23:17,314 --> 02:23:19,054
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1128
02:23:19,094 --> 02:23:21,755
This will be placed on our summer fund program update.

1129
02:23:22,135 --> 02:23:25,156
Further update will be placed in the April 12th agenda.

1130
02:23:26,607 --> 02:23:27,427
Thank you.

1131
02:23:27,988 --> 02:23:29,048
Yes, I just want to ask.

1132
02:23:29,088 --> 02:23:36,930
I mean, the programs that we spoke about this evening are also the programs that have taken place before, so it's great to have an update about them.

1133
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:43,112
But are we anticipating any further remedial type programs for students during the summer?

1134
02:23:43,132 --> 02:23:49,093
I was kind of curious about where we're going to go with that.

1135
02:23:55,015 --> 02:23:55,295
Mayor?

1136
02:23:56,497 --> 02:23:58,519
Oh yes, Dr. Edward.

1137
02:23:59,259 --> 02:24:00,460
Thank you.

1138
02:24:00,781 --> 02:24:08,467
Yes, we are in the beginning stages of thinking about whether we could try to call it

1139
02:24:11,515 --> 02:24:15,177
I don't know if I should say summer, maybe summer intervention.

1140
02:24:15,197 --> 02:24:31,187
We're trying to think creatively about using the summertime to not only try to provide students with an opportunity to do some academics, but also have it coupled with

1141
02:24:32,528 --> 02:24:34,729
movement, exercise, activities.

1142
02:24:34,809 --> 02:24:39,293
So trying to just think about a way to address the whole child.

1143
02:24:40,373 --> 02:24:43,496
Students have gone through a lot, social, emotionally.

1144
02:24:44,997 --> 02:24:51,662
And so we're trying to figure out how that would be able to work out.

1145
02:24:52,262 --> 02:24:59,287
And we know that this has been a very, very stressful year and we're trying to think of creative ways

1146
02:25:00,048 --> 02:25:15,502
possibly using more than one location to do some type of academics and summer fun combining it somehow or offering more than one program.

1147
02:25:15,542 --> 02:25:20,587
So that's still in the works member Vander Kloot, but we are trying to

1148
02:25:22,568 --> 02:25:28,009
see what we can come up with and see how many students we would be able to service and at what levels.

1149
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:29,790
So it is on our radar.

1150
02:25:30,150 --> 02:25:30,570
Thank you.

1151
02:25:38,332 --> 02:25:38,752
Thank you.

1152
02:25:40,373 --> 02:25:49,095
Number five, we have, again, report on activities planned for our senior class 2021, Dr. Peter Cushing, Principal Paul DeLeva, and Principal Chad Fallon.

1153
02:25:50,723 --> 02:26:00,290
Once again, Madam Mayor, thank you very much for the opportunity to speak and have those two gentlemen with me here tonight to also support the report that was given to you.

1154
02:26:01,310 --> 02:26:04,993
The guidance from the Commonwealth concerning graduations

1155
02:26:06,373 --> 02:26:13,036
at high schools, college and universities was issued late on Friday as this report was being written.

1156
02:26:13,196 --> 02:26:18,859
So we were able to put a lot of those requirements in here.

1157
02:26:19,659 --> 02:26:27,523
Right now, our dates for these events, the last day academically for the class of 21 will be Friday, May 28th.

1158
02:26:28,523 --> 02:26:33,886
We have tentatively scheduled a prom for the class of 2021 to be held on Thursday, May 27th.

1159
02:26:35,108 --> 02:26:46,275
Right now we're really trying to conceptualize this the right now the maximum number of participants at an outdoor event venue, which is a ballroom.

1160
02:26:48,936 --> 02:26:55,320
Any space that can be rented outdoors was the guidance that I saw today for safety standards and checklists.

1161
02:26:56,279 --> 02:27:02,200
is 150 people, so hopefully those numbers will expand by that date.

1162
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:16,703
Otherwise, we'll figure a workaround working with Tony Ray and Marion O'Connor if it's somehow two proms or split event or something along those lines to make sure that our seniors have an event.

1163
02:27:17,844 --> 02:27:23,805
The Medford Vocational High School will be holding their annual banquet

1164
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:27,492
I believe that Mr. Fallon might have a definitive date on that.

1165
02:27:27,652 --> 02:27:35,777
It was listed as May 6th or May 13th, depending on further information, but I'll defer to Mr. Fallon momentarily.

1166
02:27:37,418 --> 02:27:42,682
We'll are also currently working on the traditional annual leadership, academic and scholarship ceremonies.

1167
02:27:43,703 --> 02:27:50,307
And then graduation right now is tentatively planned to be held outdoors at Hormel Stadium.

1168
02:27:51,684 --> 02:27:55,446
on Wednesday, June 2nd for the class of 2021.

1169
02:27:56,927 --> 02:27:59,748
The guidance was issued on Friday, as I mentioned.

1170
02:28:01,849 --> 02:28:11,113
There's no capacity limit right now, but they are listing that the groups must be spaced at six feet.

1171
02:28:12,154 --> 02:28:14,455
Ceremonies must be kept as brief as possible.

1172
02:28:16,035 --> 02:28:21,296
The attendance is limited only to faculty, administrators, speakers, graduates, and guests.

1173
02:28:22,216 --> 02:28:28,337
Guests have to pre-register and attest to certain things that were included in the report.

1174
02:28:29,898 --> 02:28:32,858
So there's an attestation process that goes with that.

1175
02:28:33,398 --> 02:28:43,000
Following the event, any participant who tests positive for COVID-19 must notify the Medford Public Schools so contact tracing can begin

1176
02:28:43,821 --> 02:28:48,285
Face masks will be required for all attendees at all times with the following exceptions.

1177
02:28:48,965 --> 02:28:56,672
Graduates can remove their masks at designated photography locations and speakers may remove their masks during their remarks.

1178
02:28:58,754 --> 02:29:11,465
And we anticipate limited, very limited number of tickets for students depending on how we map out the seating and all of those various aspects.

1179
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:22,713
So I would like to also offer time for Mr. DeLeva and Mr. Fallon at the chair's behest.

1180
02:29:25,334 --> 02:29:26,274
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1181
02:29:26,894 --> 02:29:29,435
Thank you, members of the school committee and mayor.

1182
02:29:30,295 --> 02:29:37,377
First of all, I want to thank Mrs. McLaughlin because I think it was her that put this initiative to come out to the school committee to discuss this.

1183
02:29:38,257 --> 02:29:48,467
A little bit further, due to her ed talk video that was produced and listening to some of our students that were dealing with, you know how they were feeling as seniors.

1184
02:29:49,788 --> 02:29:53,552
One thing I do want to give credit to is our two staff advisors.

1185
02:29:54,458 --> 02:29:54,598
Ms.

1186
02:29:54,658 --> 02:29:56,120
Riley Jones and Ms.

1187
02:29:56,140 --> 02:30:01,864
Cheryl Giordano, they worked tirelessly with the officers to try to figure a lot of things out.

1188
02:30:03,105 --> 02:30:10,572
One thing I will say, which is better this year than last year, obviously, is we were always trying to figure out things as we were moving forward.

1189
02:30:11,653 --> 02:30:17,958
Being this year, we're kind of always, we're still adapting, but we have a better sense and a handle on things.

1190
02:30:18,018 --> 02:30:22,102
So for example, when you're talking about the last day of school, we were,

1191
02:30:22,622 --> 02:30:35,395
In debates, whether should we have a last day of school, but or was there enough academic, you know, was there enough academic time for our seniors to stay and get out of their normal time but we also understand that's a tradition.

1192
02:30:36,356 --> 02:30:41,661
In most cases, and we want the seniors to feel as happy as they possibly can.

1193
02:30:43,933 --> 02:30:59,954
I will say that obviously all our events, we would like to try to do, like I said, our senior leadership awards night, and our senior academic night, if possible, I mean we're trying to think outside the box but obviously everything will go through the approval of

1194
02:31:00,515 --> 02:31:01,156
The Board of Health.

1195
02:31:01,677 --> 02:31:04,721
If you guys remember last year for graduation we were almost there.

1196
02:31:05,863 --> 02:31:14,896
We were very close with that same vision that Dr. Cushion just kind of announced and my hope is that the, the earlier date will help us get there.

1197
02:31:15,597 --> 02:31:19,078
And personally, I have a little soft spot of going back to Hormel.

1198
02:31:19,099 --> 02:31:23,640
I think sometimes old traditions are good to come out.

1199
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:34,705
So with the pandemic, I think that that is something that will be unique, but also give an old school feel of it being our graduation.

1200
02:31:34,805 --> 02:31:41,448
If some people don't realize, I think there's a misconception sometimes, and I always thank Tufts for what they do for us, but there is a cost.

1201
02:31:42,908 --> 02:31:47,609
a significant cost of renting out the space in the Cousins Gym.

1202
02:31:48,270 --> 02:32:03,113
So going to Hormel and figuring this all out and even making it more of a personal experience of having even parents next to their graduates is sort of the same kind of plan that we had last year, but again needs approval by the Board of Health and Ms.

1203
02:32:03,133 --> 02:32:04,834
Tony Ray who is very close with that.

1204
02:32:06,134 --> 02:32:14,798
I'm excited because, you know, nothing warms me more than knowing that our students are trying to get the best that they possibly can.

1205
02:32:14,878 --> 02:32:25,723
So hopefully we can do this, but I do, again, I thank everybody, Dr. Cushing, especially, he's been really a really go-getter of making sure that we're getting these things through and presented.

1206
02:32:25,803 --> 02:32:33,447
So thank you for listening, and I hope, on my fingers crossed, we are able to get these events through for our seniors.

1207
02:32:34,483 --> 02:32:37,527
Mr. Fallon, I'll turn the mic over to you.

1208
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:41,131
Peter, did you want to speak?

1209
02:32:42,393 --> 02:32:42,653
I'll go.

1210
02:32:42,833 --> 02:32:44,395
I'll finish after you, Mr. Fallon.

1211
02:32:44,896 --> 02:32:45,156
OK.

1212
02:32:46,237 --> 02:32:46,458
So

1213
02:32:47,718 --> 02:32:51,321
For the senior banquet, something we did, it's been a tradition for years.

1214
02:32:51,661 --> 02:32:57,646
Instead of having it off site at a lodge or places we usually would have it, we're gonna do something more intimate on the campus.

1215
02:32:57,726 --> 02:33:01,269
It'll be much more abbreviated, but we'll do something special for our graduating seniors.

1216
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:13,840
And speaking of the seniors, the 107 of them, this is the first year that the diploma, when a student that was on a CTE pathway opens their diploma, they'll have a certificate on both sides, a high school diploma and a certificate of technical occupancy.

1217
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:15,661
So I'm really excited about that.

1218
02:33:16,041 --> 02:33:17,903
From what I mean, that's the way it was when I was in high school.

1219
02:33:17,943 --> 02:33:23,747
And from what I hear years ago, that used to be what happened at the high school, but I don't know, we got away from it.

1220
02:33:23,787 --> 02:33:25,589
So I'm happy it's coming back this year.

1221
02:33:27,070 --> 02:33:31,974
Really what Mr. DeLava said, I echo these advisors, their energy is infectious.

1222
02:33:32,594 --> 02:33:38,279
And Alice Beth Fitzpatrick and Dave Blouk, they're just the dream team making this all happen for the seniors.

1223
02:33:38,299 --> 02:33:41,841
So they're really, it's everyone's making it feel special.

1224
02:33:41,981 --> 02:33:43,703
I just wanted to say that, but thank you guys.

1225
02:33:45,965 --> 02:33:46,565
Thank you all.

1226
02:33:47,346 --> 02:33:48,067
Member Van de Kloop?

1227
02:33:48,847 --> 02:33:49,067
Yes.

1228
02:33:49,228 --> 02:33:51,329
Do we have a rain date for graduation?

1229
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:56,293
We haven't moved that far down the planning line yet, but we will.

1230
02:33:58,335 --> 02:33:58,635
Thank you.

1231
02:33:58,715 --> 02:33:59,576
Member McLaughlin?

1232
02:34:01,337 --> 02:34:01,838
Thank you.

1233
02:34:02,678 --> 02:34:06,681
Thank you, Mrs. Weber, Mr. Fallon, and Dr. Cushion.

1234
02:34:08,103 --> 02:34:11,425
And also to the advisors, Ms.

1235
02:34:11,445 --> 02:34:11,866
Jones and Ms.

1236
02:34:11,906 --> 02:34:13,026
Giordano and Ms.

1237
02:34:14,115 --> 02:34:18,199
Fitzpatrick and Mr. Glauck for your work with our seniors.

1238
02:34:18,219 --> 02:34:28,628
I know that this has been a really tough year and I appreciate Mr. DeLave, are you sharing the senior conversation for the ed talk?

1239
02:34:30,736 --> 02:34:47,025
And students produced that show, I executive produced it, but I walked away from that show feeling really concerned and upset and really actually also moved that our students were willing to be so forthcoming and sharing their feelings with us, right?

1240
02:34:47,045 --> 02:34:48,186
And what they've been going through.

1241
02:34:48,226 --> 02:34:51,688
And this senior class is unique from any other senior class.

1242
02:34:51,748 --> 02:34:58,132
The previous senior class had, not that we're diminishing what was taken from them, of course, but they had from,

1243
02:34:58,716 --> 02:34:59,937
you know, September through March.

1244
02:34:59,997 --> 02:35:03,218
This class didn't have their junior prom and did not have this year at all.

1245
02:35:04,039 --> 02:35:16,325
They've been extremely isolated as I know that you all know, and really feeling forgotten as they shared in their conversation in the ed talk and lonely and a number of other things.

1246
02:35:16,365 --> 02:35:18,526
And I think we're all to some degree feeling that.

1247
02:35:19,306 --> 02:35:26,710
And I think it's easy to forget when we see really children in, you know, 17 and 18 year old bodies that they're not,

1248
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,561
adults yet, right?

1249
02:35:28,601 --> 02:35:34,025
They're still children and they're still developmentally, you know, figuring things out.

1250
02:35:34,045 --> 02:35:35,987
And it's been a really, really tough year for them.

1251
02:35:36,227 --> 02:35:42,552
And I want to know how we're addressing the social emotional needs of our kids, of our seniors specifically.

1252
02:35:42,953 --> 02:35:49,298
We have nine weeks left with these kids until they're gone for good from our district.

1253
02:35:49,578 --> 02:35:54,422
And, you know, we, many of them have been here since, you know, preschool or kindergarten.

1254
02:35:54,482 --> 02:35:54,803
It's been

1255
02:35:55,403 --> 02:36:07,673
You know 12 years that we've you know that you've taken care of them nurture them brought them this far and then we were all gobsmacked by this pandemic right but we literally have nine weeks left and.

1256
02:36:08,868 --> 02:36:11,089
I know that there are community members that are willing to help.

1257
02:36:11,149 --> 02:36:12,970
I know that there are students that are willing to help.

1258
02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:23,716
I know that community members have come to the BH, the behavioral health and the special education subcommittee meeting to speak specifically about how they'd like to help and what else can be done for our seniors.

1259
02:36:23,756 --> 02:36:25,077
So I think it's great.

1260
02:36:25,197 --> 02:36:30,800
I mean, it's so important that they have a prom and that we have a date for graduation and we can get excited about that.

1261
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:35,462
And I know that Dr. Christian and I had talked about some of the things that have happened in the past around even just

1262
02:36:36,043 --> 02:36:39,324
signage congratulating our class of 2021 and those sorts of things.

1263
02:36:39,384 --> 02:36:45,446
But, you know, and I know that there are also our student advisors and the class officers that are working on things.

1264
02:36:45,506 --> 02:37:01,252
And I was really glad to see Mr. Blauck and others posting both on Facebook and Instagram and, you know, every means possible as suggested by the students, because initially it was, you know, the students needed to check their email and, you know, this generation of students are not email students, right?

1265
02:37:01,272 --> 02:37:03,493
This generation is not an email generation.

1266
02:37:04,013 --> 02:37:06,522
I think they're really feeling overwhelmed, frankly, by their emails.

1267
02:37:06,803 --> 02:37:09,372
I think that they've got thousands of emails in their inbox.

1268
02:37:09,432 --> 02:37:10,235
I know my son does.

1269
02:37:11,315 --> 02:37:17,199
I don't know that they know that they can delete them, but I think it's overwhelming, right?

1270
02:37:17,319 --> 02:37:18,881
And I think that we need some guidance.

1271
02:37:18,901 --> 02:37:33,571
So I wanna know, and if we don't have an answer tonight, that's okay, but I would like to know when we can have a meeting to brainstorm some ideas about what we can do as a community to uplift and celebrate these children in the next nine weeks.

1272
02:37:34,371 --> 02:37:36,473
Graduation and prom and the leadership

1273
02:37:38,394 --> 02:37:52,822
event, aside because those are the things that we normally do and they're wonderful and I'm happy about them and I don't want anybody to think that I'm not, you know, genuinely pleased that those things are moving forward, you know, again with the, with the, with the

1274
02:37:53,851 --> 02:37:56,472
hope of a pandemic, and I know what happened last year.

1275
02:37:56,492 --> 02:38:01,593
We were headed that way, and it, you know, things turned suddenly, and that just was so sad for so many, I know.

1276
02:38:02,174 --> 02:38:06,435
But I just, I want to know how we can, what else can we do?

1277
02:38:06,915 --> 02:38:12,777
So can we do- I don't know, I just want to make sure you're coordinating with Ms.

1278
02:38:12,817 --> 02:38:22,340
Catalo's efforts, because she had somewhat of a community parent meeting that my office was involved in a week or two ago, and so the ball is rolling for

1279
02:38:23,256 --> 02:38:23,937
different ideas.

1280
02:38:24,237 --> 02:38:27,999
So I just want to make sure you know, so I haven't heard about that.

1281
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,901
And and I don't know that it's on that.

1282
02:38:30,921 --> 02:38:32,302
Well, we'll circle back.

1283
02:38:32,823 --> 02:38:35,825
But I'm not sure how these this is part of the issue that we're experiencing.

1284
02:38:35,905 --> 02:38:40,728
And I appreciate that's great that you guys had a meeting and talked about that.

1285
02:38:40,808 --> 02:38:43,170
But I think that that's part of the difficulties we're hearing from

1286
02:38:43,810 --> 02:38:47,674
families that they're not getting information or from students that they feel like they're not getting information.

1287
02:38:47,694 --> 02:38:51,817
So we have to think about how we're coordinating the communication about what that was.

1288
02:38:51,857 --> 02:38:57,783
My meeting, it was we learned about it the day of and I just had sent somebody to my office to learn, learn more.

1289
02:38:57,843 --> 02:39:00,746
It was a parent group that had the discussion.

1290
02:39:00,966 --> 02:39:03,008
So I'd say that's great.

1291
02:39:03,368 --> 02:39:04,729
The administration share.

1292
02:39:04,769 --> 02:39:05,950
Do you guys know what that's about?

1293
02:39:07,612 --> 02:39:07,712
No.

1294
02:39:12,684 --> 02:39:29,577
I haven't heard anything, but I do know again the PTO has been working on on certain things as well, but there hasn't been a nail down so I think, Miss McLaughlin what you're what you're what you're stating here which is true is that there's just a lot of factions that want to help.

1295
02:39:30,365 --> 02:39:31,846
Yeah, definitely.

1296
02:39:31,946 --> 02:39:40,649
And if I could make a suggestion, I know it's there's tons of committees, but maybe it's a committee of the whole, where we get these groups together presenting what they need to do.

1297
02:39:40,729 --> 02:39:45,511
But that's my only suggestion of keeping everybody sort of intact.

1298
02:39:46,351 --> 02:39:47,912
Or it doesn't even have to be a committee of the whole.

1299
02:39:47,932 --> 02:39:49,553
I mean, it could be a high school meeting.

1300
02:39:50,193 --> 02:39:53,074
That's just high school, and we can get the groups together.

1301
02:39:53,094 --> 02:39:58,196
Yeah, I appreciate the solution oriented, you know, approach.

1302
02:39:58,706 --> 02:40:00,058
I'm sorry, Mary, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1303
02:40:00,118 --> 02:40:01,107
Mr. Bowen, raise his hand.

1304
02:40:01,814 --> 02:40:04,835
No, I just wanted to say, I think we did know about Ms.

1305
02:40:04,875 --> 02:40:05,675
Catalo's efforts.

1306
02:40:06,255 --> 02:40:07,916
I'm pretty sure we all knew about that in the PTO.

1307
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:11,396
So I just want to give credit because I know she's been from the very beginning.

1308
02:40:11,717 --> 02:40:12,377
I just wanted to say that.

1309
02:40:12,397 --> 02:40:13,457
Yeah, no, that's great.

1310
02:40:13,497 --> 02:40:14,897
And I would love to hear more.

1311
02:40:14,957 --> 02:40:19,819
And I did see that she has a, I think there is a Facebook page that's specific to her event.

1312
02:40:19,859 --> 02:40:22,159
I don't know that it's that we need to merge.

1313
02:40:22,179 --> 02:40:24,180
There's a couple of different Facebook pages going on.

1314
02:40:24,220 --> 02:40:28,701
So I guess I'm looking for somebody in the administration and perhaps PTO

1315
02:40:31,170 --> 02:40:32,971
in school committee that we can collaborate.

1316
02:40:33,051 --> 02:40:53,478
I think it should be more on a high school level and getting the PTO involved and whoever wants to come, because I think you guys also have plenty of other meetings there, but I think if we isolate it just to the high school, I'm down to schedule whatever, I'll work with PTO and we'll get it out for everybody.

1317
02:40:54,279 --> 02:40:55,779
Yeah, I'd be happy to work with you on that, Paul.

1318
02:40:56,279 --> 02:40:58,820
I think you can rest assured, we'll pull everyone together at this point.

1319
02:40:58,920 --> 02:40:59,881
Yeah, we'll pull them together.

1320
02:41:02,265 --> 02:41:17,108
I just wanted to add that I think with all of the dates and getting the information that's out there right now, the intention really was to let the students know, start looking for prom dresses, start looking at tuxedos.

1321
02:41:18,768 --> 02:41:21,749
We're gonna work with the guidance and the guidelines that we have.

1322
02:41:21,809 --> 02:41:28,910
We have to work in collaboration with the board of health to make sure you heard Dr. Cushing mentioned that there

1323
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:37,115
you know, if, if there is a limit of 150 students by the time we get to May, then we're talking about two proms.

1324
02:41:37,755 --> 02:41:46,721
And are we going to have to split the class by alphabet, A through L and N through Z, or figure out what the numbers are, that would be a nightmare.

1325
02:41:47,041 --> 02:41:49,183
I see member Vanderkloot shaking her head.

1326
02:41:49,703 --> 02:42:00,125
But I'm just saying, if it's only 150 students, then how do you do a prom with 150 students when you have twice that in terms of the entire class?

1327
02:42:00,665 --> 02:42:16,928
But we wanted to at least get those dates out there and let the seniors know that we're going to be working together, working proactively to try to give our seniors some sense of a true senior experience.

1328
02:42:17,868 --> 02:42:19,349
But we just need to do it safely.

1329
02:42:21,189 --> 02:42:25,311
And so we have to keep that as a top priority as well.

1330
02:42:25,671 --> 02:42:26,011
Thank you.

1331
02:42:26,991 --> 02:42:27,371
Thank you.

1332
02:42:27,391 --> 02:42:28,192
Okay.

1333
02:42:29,132 --> 02:42:29,912
Member McLaughlin.

1334
02:42:30,793 --> 02:42:31,833
Yes, I see.

1335
02:42:31,873 --> 02:42:33,774
We have a community member also that has their hand up.

1336
02:42:33,814 --> 02:42:34,494
So thank you.

1337
02:42:34,574 --> 02:42:35,334
And thank you all.

1338
02:42:35,354 --> 02:42:37,015
I appreciate the dates.

1339
02:42:37,095 --> 02:42:41,976
And you know, I know that we have a lot of, you know, smart people in the community and in the room here.

1340
02:42:41,996 --> 02:42:43,617
And I'm sure we can come up with some great and

1341
02:42:44,138 --> 02:42:51,083
interesting ideas about what we can do for prom and I'm excited to have the students start shopping for their outfits and things as well.

1342
02:42:51,183 --> 02:43:01,050
So, and I'm sure, you know, Kelly Catalo would welcome help from the community and others so it would be great to know how people can get involved and I know that the meeting will, I'm sure,

1343
02:43:02,291 --> 02:43:03,012
share that info.

1344
02:43:03,052 --> 02:43:04,513
So I look forward to that.

1345
02:43:04,593 --> 02:43:10,558
And if we need to discuss it at the next April 12 meeting to update people, we can put that on as an update as well.

1346
02:43:10,598 --> 02:43:15,522
I'm sure maybe in the either in the superintendent's update or another agenda item.

1347
02:43:15,562 --> 02:43:16,543
Is that okay, Mayor?

1348
02:43:19,147 --> 02:43:22,609
that it's up to the superintendent.

1349
02:43:22,729 --> 02:43:27,492
I mean, between now and the next meeting, we should be able to have additional information.

1350
02:43:27,532 --> 02:43:36,697
And I can definitely, if it's enough to do a separate report, depending on the total number of reports, if not, I'll do it in my report.

1351
02:43:37,137 --> 02:43:41,599
So we definitely will be able to have additional information between now and April 12th.

1352
02:43:41,999 --> 02:43:42,420
Thank you.

1353
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:45,541
Okay, Heather, name and address the record.

1354
02:43:45,601 --> 02:43:46,442
You have three minutes.

1355
02:43:48,665 --> 02:43:51,346
Hi, Heather Rumina, 57 Harvard Lab.

1356
02:43:52,346 --> 02:43:53,906
I just wanted to thank all of you.

1357
02:43:54,506 --> 02:43:56,527
Thank Melanie for speaking up about seniors.

1358
02:43:56,647 --> 02:44:03,609
Thank all of you have been trying to help out the seniors and planning things.

1359
02:44:06,289 --> 02:44:18,032
One thing that I was wondering is, is it possible to move the event for the prom to have everybody together, like having it at Hormel or having it at a place where these kids have not been together for over a year?

1360
02:44:19,012 --> 02:44:23,915
And the prom kind of loses its point when they can't all be in one place.

1361
02:44:24,355 --> 02:44:26,917
So that's one of my main points.

1362
02:44:26,977 --> 02:44:33,321
The other one is, I'm just, it's very confusing, like thinking all these different things.

1363
02:44:33,361 --> 02:44:45,608
I mean, I'm on the PTO and we've been trying to plan events for the seniors, but from what I understand, we can't plan anything until the class officers come forward asking us for money for the events that they're running.

1364
02:44:46,268 --> 02:44:54,736
So it's not like we can just come up with these events, like, hey, why don't we do this for the seniors, except for sponsor a senior, which we're working on.

1365
02:44:54,836 --> 02:44:56,597
Other than that, our hands are kind of tied.

1366
02:44:57,378 --> 02:45:01,001
So that's where things kind of fall apart.

1367
02:45:01,221 --> 02:45:03,283
And hearing how people are trying to help.

1368
02:45:03,824 --> 02:45:05,765
Kelly Catalo, like I would encourage her.

1369
02:45:06,566 --> 02:45:18,916
I don't know if there's a, I can maybe find her email or if somebody knows her to get in touch with the PTO because I haven't heard of anything that she's doing and I think it would be great to all coordinate together.

1370
02:45:18,956 --> 02:45:20,738
I'm happy to hear she wants to be involved.

1371
02:45:22,239 --> 02:45:23,941
And you know, we're ready.

1372
02:45:24,221 --> 02:45:26,142
There's parents waiting.

1373
02:45:26,323 --> 02:45:30,186
We have, there's quite a few senior parents on the PTO who wanna help.

1374
02:45:30,906 --> 02:45:33,328
So again, like we're running out of time.

1375
02:45:34,089 --> 02:45:39,594
And I feel like there hasn't been one thing that I've really seen that's involved seniors.

1376
02:45:40,255 --> 02:45:46,260
I think they just need some signs or something that people are interested in and know that they are there.

1377
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:48,682
So I just appreciate all of you talking about this.

1378
02:45:49,242 --> 02:45:49,623
Thank you.

1379
02:45:49,903 --> 02:45:50,463
Thank you, Heather.

1380
02:45:51,424 --> 02:45:53,106
We have been talking about it for a while.

1381
02:45:53,126 --> 02:45:54,547
I know the admin's working hard on it.

1382
02:45:54,587 --> 02:45:56,789
We have some surprises that are coming.

1383
02:45:56,909 --> 02:45:58,731
So they're getting there.

1384
02:45:58,751 --> 02:46:01,173
Dr. Cushing, anything you want to elaborate on as well?

1385
02:46:01,687 --> 02:46:15,358
Yeah, so I'm happy to work with Mr. Fallon, Mr. Loeber so that we can pull everybody together to try to make sure that we're all firing and all cylinders and all the oars on the mystic are pulling all in the right direction.

1386
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:24,185
And so I'm happy to work with our two leaders of our high school to make sure that happens and as well to bring the students together.

1387
02:46:25,666 --> 02:46:27,087
I also just wanna really,

1388
02:46:27,735 --> 02:46:44,878
like send a message out to those seniors and senior parents who are on this call right now to please make sure that you're following protocols with masking and social distancing and everything that you need to do.

1389
02:46:45,438 --> 02:46:53,740
That high school graduation is very much about the seniors, but it is the penultimate experience of a school district

1390
02:46:54,799 --> 02:47:02,164
for all of those years from kindergarten all the way up through when a student finally walks across that stage.

1391
02:47:03,005 --> 02:47:15,773
It is very much about the seniors, but it is literally the biggest opportunity for a community to say, this is the Medford Mustang.

1392
02:47:15,954 --> 02:47:20,236
This is a student of Medford to walk across that stage.

1393
02:47:20,256 --> 02:47:22,358
It is quite possibly

1394
02:47:22,907 --> 02:47:28,832
the single most important experience just in the importance of itself.

1395
02:47:28,852 --> 02:47:35,037
You know, class presidents have the opportunity to give great speeches that will be memorialized now on YouTube forever.

1396
02:47:35,337 --> 02:47:41,843
And, you know, everyone gets an opportunity to celebrate those members of the senior class.

1397
02:47:42,243 --> 02:47:50,270
And I just really beg and implore students that, you know, as these events come close and fast together,

1398
02:47:51,142 --> 02:47:54,806
That we are very careful that we are very focused.

1399
02:47:55,607 --> 02:48:06,718
And I think it was a community on the North Shore that I recently saw some students had a big party, all those things that you might want to do, please remember that your actions.

1400
02:48:07,257 --> 02:48:12,560
could have seriously detrimental effects for us to be able to carry out these plans.

1401
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:26,948
And we beg you, as a leadership team, trust me, one of the reasons why I got into being an educator is because it's just a really awesome time to work with kids and to be a part of these types of things.

1402
02:48:27,008 --> 02:48:34,533
And as a former high school principal, there's no greater events than the ones that come in these culminating moments.

1403
02:48:36,454 --> 02:48:36,614
And

1404
02:48:38,105 --> 02:48:58,621
I'm just begging seniors to please and their families to please do everything possible to make sure that we can have all 300 plus seniors walk across that stage on June 2nd and that we don't have COVID protocols placed upon us because of a few careless decisions.

1405
02:49:00,002 --> 02:49:00,963
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1406
02:49:02,084 --> 02:49:02,364
Mayor.

1407
02:49:02,644 --> 02:49:03,144
Number six.

1408
02:49:03,325 --> 02:49:03,965
No, Mayor.

1409
02:49:06,155 --> 02:49:07,196
member van de Kloot.

1410
02:49:07,516 --> 02:49:22,924
Yes I just I want to it's I've received another email and I did note that the speaker was was here I see him but it's from Matthew Page Lieberman of 15 Canal Street.

1411
02:49:23,424 --> 02:49:30,808
His question is I'd like to know what options are available to a MHS senior

1412
02:49:31,281 --> 02:49:41,065
I recently met who told me of her struggles to get the assistance she requires for her mental health from the school system after attempts have failed with her guidance counselor.

1413
02:49:42,425 --> 02:49:47,507
I can answer a couple of things.

1414
02:49:48,828 --> 02:49:51,129
Because I do know that we've had groups

1415
02:49:52,250 --> 02:49:56,014
So we've had advisory periods once a week.

1416
02:49:56,895 --> 02:50:02,982
We've allowed students to go and meet with adjustment counselors during those times.

1417
02:50:04,703 --> 02:50:11,911
I know that Stacey Shulman has given me resources to blast out to the community in a lot of ways.

1418
02:50:12,752 --> 02:50:21,980
So, but on the other hand, I mean, we're trying to communicate but we're not seeing a great number of participation and that could be feelings too.

1419
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:27,005
I don't want to say that it's not, but we are trying a lot of different scenarios.

1420
02:50:27,065 --> 02:50:33,470
As a matter of fact, I have to blast out with the group some of the strategies that a group during that advisory comes out with.

1421
02:50:34,211 --> 02:50:39,254
to our seniors, but as Mrs. McLaughlin has said, they might not be an email kind of group.

1422
02:50:40,615 --> 02:50:47,119
So I try to send it out to families, and I try to send it out to students on top of that, so someone will catch it.

1423
02:50:47,239 --> 02:50:49,400
But these are things that we have offered.

1424
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:50,200
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1425
02:50:50,541 --> 02:50:52,802
Go ahead.

1426
02:50:52,942 --> 02:51:01,907
So can I direct the sender to tell the student to contact you directly?

1427
02:51:01,927 --> 02:51:02,728
Absolutely.

1428
02:51:03,672 --> 02:51:07,193
Okay, and that you will make sure, or superintendent, go ahead.

1429
02:51:07,873 --> 02:51:17,114
I was gonna say you can have this, send that email directly to Stacey Shulman, who's our director of behavioral health and counseling services.

1430
02:51:17,735 --> 02:51:31,117
And so she will be able to, if we need to reassign or just get additional social emotional supports to that particular student, that we will do that.

1431
02:51:31,985 --> 02:51:33,406
That was gonna be my recommendation.

1432
02:51:33,706 --> 02:51:34,007
Thank you.

1433
02:51:34,107 --> 02:51:34,227
Okay.

1434
02:51:34,827 --> 02:51:35,568
I'll send it forward.

1435
02:51:36,709 --> 02:51:37,149
Thank you.

1436
02:51:37,169 --> 02:51:37,530
Thank you.

1437
02:51:37,730 --> 02:51:38,010
Thanks.

1438
02:51:38,651 --> 02:51:39,271
Great question.

1439
02:51:40,132 --> 02:51:43,675
Number six, report on the solar panel project at the Andrews Middle School.

1440
02:51:45,356 --> 02:51:45,536
Ms.

1441
02:51:45,556 --> 02:51:47,518
Alicia Hunt, director of energy environment.

1442
02:51:47,878 --> 02:51:50,160
And I did tell Alicia that I could handle this.

1443
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:54,724
I know we were all given the documentation from Dr. Cushing today.

1444
02:51:54,744 --> 02:51:59,808
And the main gist of the request

1445
02:52:00,793 --> 02:52:19,423
is for us to approve that the city may lease rooftop space on Madeline Duggar Andrews Public School to a third party for the purpose of installing solar panels to generate electricity for use by the school building and to lease a portion of the parking area to install carport solar panels.

1446
02:52:19,924 --> 02:52:26,627
No parking spaces will be removed to accommodate the carport solar panels, which will be supported above the parking spaces.

1447
02:52:27,408 --> 02:52:29,629
This request is a step in the project

1448
02:52:29,995 --> 02:52:34,156
that was previously before this body to install solar and storage at the Andrew School.

1449
02:52:34,336 --> 02:52:44,658
The solar and storage is intended to offset the energy use at the building, reducing the cost of electricity with the school and allowing the building to operate off grid in the event of a major electricity outage.

1450
02:52:45,278 --> 02:52:57,080
The approval of the school committee will allow the city to enter into an agreement with a third party to allow it to install, operate and maintain the solar panels on the roof and in the parking lot and to sell the electricity generated

1451
02:52:57,501 --> 02:53:03,546
to the city at a price which would not exceed the price the city would presently pay to its existing energy providers.

1452
02:53:03,706 --> 02:53:06,388
The panels will be financed and owned by the third party.

1453
02:53:06,409 --> 02:53:09,271
Motion to approve.

1454
02:53:09,711 --> 02:53:14,796
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

1455
02:53:16,677 --> 02:53:17,098
Roll call.

1456
02:53:19,059 --> 02:53:19,820
Member Graham.

1457
02:53:20,901 --> 02:53:21,061

Yes.

1471
02:53:28,384 --> 02:53:28,484
Yes.

1472
02:53:28,544 --> 02:53:28,644
Yes.

1473
02:53:28,804 --> 02:53:29,085
Yes.

1474
02:53:31,185 --> 02:53:31,285
Yes.

1475
02:53:31,305 --> 02:53:31,425
Yes.

1476
02:53:31,465 --> 02:53:31,645
Yes.

1477
02:53:31,785 --> 02:53:31,985
Yes.

1478
02:53:32,906 --> 02:53:33,126
Yes.

1479
02:53:34,046 --> 02:53:34,226
Yes.

1480
02:53:34,266 --> 02:53:34,426
Yes.

1481
02:53:34,446 --> 02:53:34,566
Yes.

1482
02:53:34,746 --> 02:53:34,926
Yes.

1483
02:53:35,346 --> 02:53:35,526
Yes.

1484

1485
02:54:04,114 --> 02:54:19,865

1498
02:54:41,075 --> 02:54:41,775

Member Van de Kloot.

1502
02:54:47,339 --> 02:54:48,120
Mayor Longo Kern.

1503
02:54:48,620 --> 02:54:48,780
Yes.

1504
02:54:50,145 --> 02:54:52,787
Zero the negative paper is approved.

1505
02:54:53,728 --> 02:54:55,369
Offered by member Rousseau.

1506
02:54:56,010 --> 02:55:14,125
As Memphis public schools continue to work towards implementing our value of equity and taking action to root out systems that work against equity, the after school and before school application processes will require demographic data on the students and families that apply for our limited enrollment in these programs.

1507
02:55:14,726 --> 02:55:17,308
This deep data will not be used to select applicants

1508
02:55:17,695 --> 02:55:23,058
but will be used in the future to guide new policy decisions and in our efforts to create a more equitable system.

1509
02:55:23,558 --> 02:55:29,901
Data will be connected to applicants so that we can understand how changes in policy affects enrollment and wait lists.

1510
02:55:30,682 --> 02:55:31,983
Motion for approval.

1511
02:55:33,623 --> 02:55:36,125
Unless member Russo, do you want to say anything or motion for approval?

1512
02:55:36,925 --> 02:55:44,029
I just wanted to quickly, just briefly point out the main gist of this is we don't know what the starting point is.

1513
02:55:44,129 --> 02:55:45,770
So any plans or goals

1514
02:55:46,426 --> 02:55:48,727
and it's hard to get somewhere if you don't know where you are.

1515
02:55:48,747 --> 02:55:51,889
And so that's the whole point of this, so thank you.

1516
02:55:52,630 --> 02:55:53,950
Thank you, Member Russo.

1517
02:55:54,110 --> 02:55:54,931

1525

Yes, I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1533
02:56:24,649 --> 02:56:28,652
It says that might've been offered by Member Russo and Member Graham on my next page, page four.

1534
02:56:29,112 --> 02:56:29,772
So thank you both.

1535
02:56:31,213 --> 02:56:32,814
We have school committee condolences.

1536
02:56:33,614 --> 02:56:38,357
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Helen Alpers.

1537
02:56:38,907 --> 02:56:54,050
mother of former superintendent of schools, administrative assistant, Denise Chiesa Mahoney, aunt of administrative assistant for early childhood program, Cheryl Alpers, and grandmother-in-law of director of humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Robert Olson, a former custodian for the Medford Public Schools, husband of Lee Olson.

1539
02:57:07,234 --> 02:57:16,239
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Susan Bratton, known to many as Sue, was a graduate of Summerville High School and proud of it.

1540
02:57:16,599 --> 02:57:22,362
She received her bachelor and master's degree from Boston College in the field of language, Latin, which was her love.

1541
02:57:23,323 --> 02:57:27,665
She began her career over 20 years in the Medford Public Schools as a paraprofessional.

1542
02:57:28,226 --> 02:57:34,169
She started her employee at the Franklin School as a one-to-one with a student who had mobility problems.

1543
02:57:34,707 --> 02:57:40,148
Later, she spent time at the McGlynn Complex doing what she loved to do, work with children who needed special care.

1544
02:57:40,949 --> 02:57:45,730
Susan touched the lives of many students, parents, and faculty alike in the Medford Public Schools.

1545
02:57:46,330 --> 02:57:48,291
If we all may take a moment of silence.

1546
02:57:58,193 --> 02:57:58,553
Thank you.

1547
02:58:02,654 --> 02:58:04,415
Mayor, we have somebody with their hand in the air.

1548
02:58:08,354 --> 02:58:08,674
Yes.

1549
02:58:12,097 --> 02:58:13,257
I don't want to mispronounce the name.

1550
02:58:13,277 --> 02:58:13,778
Does anybody?

1551
02:58:13,798 --> 02:58:16,279
I don't want to mispronounce your name.

1552
02:58:16,380 --> 02:58:16,860
Miss Scott.

1553
02:58:19,382 --> 02:58:22,524
Hi, can you hear me?

1554
02:58:23,124 --> 02:58:23,344
Yes.

1555
02:58:23,384 --> 02:58:24,365
Name and address for the record.

1556
02:58:25,759 --> 02:58:27,880
Dallas Scott, 29 Blaisdell.

1557
02:58:29,721 --> 02:58:35,904
I just wanted to say this is my first time joining one of these sessions today.

1558
02:58:35,984 --> 02:58:39,225
I have a daughter who will be in kindergarten next year.

1559
02:58:39,325 --> 02:58:53,471
And I just wanted to take a moment to echo the concerns of Vanessa who spoke earlier about afterschool care and to give a voice for all the other parents that I've been speaking to who also are

1560
02:58:55,913 --> 02:58:59,374
at a loss for what to do next year with after school programs.

1561
02:59:01,154 --> 02:59:12,857
We recognize this is going to be, we have to zoom out pretty far to figure out how we create a shift.

1562
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:18,681
But there's a lot of us that are engaged.

1563
02:59:18,721 --> 02:59:32,250
And I just want to say thank you to Paul and Jenny, who've been really fantastic in even letting us know that this is going on tonight and that there's going to be a topic on it.

1564
02:59:32,270 --> 02:59:42,737
So I just want to voice my support for as much as we can do to figure out not only the afterschool care program, but all the other initiatives for our public school system.

1565
02:59:43,618 --> 02:59:43,998
So thank you.

1566
02:59:46,433 --> 02:59:46,853
Thank you.

1567
02:59:46,913 --> 02:59:50,534
