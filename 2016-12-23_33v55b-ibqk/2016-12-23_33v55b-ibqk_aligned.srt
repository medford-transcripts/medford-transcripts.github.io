1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,370
We wish you a merry Christmas.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,430
We wish you a merry Christmas.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,272
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

4
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,553
Good timings we bring to you and your kin.

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,534
Good timings for Christmas and a happy Mustang report.

6
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:29,538
It's a stacking like brain game type challenge where they have to move weights in an order and then reassemble the platform at a different spot in the gym.

7
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,511
Let's see how it can do.

8
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,805
Alright, so this is called the Rice Relay.

9
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:52,489
Each team has a little plastic spoon, and they need to sprint down, get as much rice on the spoon as they can, bring it, put it into their cup.

10
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,830
They're not allowed to touch the cup, like Lovicka just cheated.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:04,052
They can only use one hand, and then when we're all done, we'll see the winning team gets to pick what the three losing teams are gonna do.

12
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:15,597
Hey, you're dropping rice everywhere, Mikey.

13
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:16,977
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:19,779
Bruh, I saw you.

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,040
I fell you apart here.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,680
Look, look, look.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,541
Kids will take every advantage they can.

18
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:23,941
Look, bro.

19
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,082
This Jerry's got a handful of rice somewhere.

20
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,303
Where'd he go?

21
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:29,324
No, it's not this one either.

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,604
Cheater.

23
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,164
Look at all of them.

24
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:30,324
Really?

25
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:30,765
Excellent.

26
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:31,385
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,623
I have this bonus rice in my hand.

28
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:54,485
Once I finish the question, the first group that yells out the correct answer goes in your cup.

29
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:58,926
What is my favorite color?

30
00:01:59,047 --> 00:01:59,607
Clear!

31
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,827
That's my favorite color.

32
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:01,207
First place.

33
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:08,395
Hello?

34
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:08,655
No.

35
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:09,115
You don't say.

36
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:10,035
You don't say.

37
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:10,575
You don't say.

38
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:11,076
Okay.

39
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:11,236
Bye.

40
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:11,996
Who was that?

41
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:12,616
You didn't say.

42
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:55,632
You don't say.

43
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:43,303

00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:32,978
What's up guys, this is Dick Henniston with the Mustang Report and I'm here with Amber Harris, the captain of the track team.

45
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:35,039
Amber, how's this season going so far?

46
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,792
You know, it's been pretty good.

47
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:39,995
We have a lot of upcoming freshmen that are pretty fast.

48
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,616
You know, they're doing great for their meets.

49
00:04:42,117 --> 00:04:45,360
You know, we ran against Malden and Everett and we held up pretty well.

50
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:13,805
I'm here at the track meet for Medford vs. Arlington Catholic.

51
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:15,706
Tia, you just won your race.

52
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:16,167
How do you feel?

53
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:17,948
I feel pretty great.

54
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,430
I love track so it's a great feeling every time.

55
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:23,093
And how do you go out there and prepare every day for the season?

56
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:29,288
Every day I really try to stretch out my muscles so I don't get injured, so that's a really big key for me.

57
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:37,054
And Ben, first you went from football record-breaking 33 touchdowns and now you're in track.

58
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:38,556
How do you feel?

59
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,318
I feel good about it.

60
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:45,981
After the football season I was very tired, but just had to keep grinding.

61
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:50,565
And Sean, small in stature but large in speed.

62
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,606
How do you feel after your race?

63
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,442
tired and amazing.

64
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:54,043
Come on Max!

65
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:56,945
Wait.

66
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,170
Is that Max?

67
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:28,989
Come on Maxi!

68
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,992
Let's go Maxi!

69
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:35,334
Let's go Monica!

70
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:19,815
Let's go Kelsey, catch it.

71
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:24,716
Come on Amber.

72
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,618
First question is for Mr. Milne.

73
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:47,219
What do you do over the holiday break?

74
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,221
What do I do over the holiday break?

75
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:54,804
Well, I celebrate a very Italian Christmas on Christmas Eve, you know, the seven fishes.

76
00:07:55,545 --> 00:08:03,150
And then Christmas, and then I pack up and I coach a ski team in Quebec City for the week.

77
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:09,214
And by the way, the cold that we had the other day is our warm day up there.

78
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,151
And Igor, same question is for you.

79
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:15,012
What do you do over the holiday break?

80
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,512
Well, I'm usually just with my family a lot.

81
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,673
I also watch a lot of soccer games on Boxing Day.

82
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,233
And it's usually just a lot to be with.

83
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,094
I just like to be a lot with my family.

84
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,034
And Kaitlyn, same question is for you.

85
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,395
What do you do over the holiday break?

86
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:36,755
I usually hang out with my family because we don't really see each other during the year, just around the holidays.

87
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:37,656
And my friends.

88
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,496
It's a nice, relaxing week.

89
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,572
Lucy DeMarco, first question is for you.

90
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:44,535
What do you do over the holiday break?

91
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:50,946
Over the holiday break I spend time with my family and my friends and for Christmas I go over my grandmother's house.

92
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:52,108
And Ms.

93
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,370
Donlan, same question is for you.

94
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,013
What do you do over the holiday break?

95
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:02,013
Well, I'm having 28 people for dinner, Christmas dinner and 53 for dessert.

96
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:07,696
So that's, we'll start the break a little, little craziness on the Donlan family side.

97
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,457
And then it'll be a lot of relaxation.

98
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,797
I hope to get to the movies.

99
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:17,780
I'm going to Celtics Tuesday night, dinner with friends and, uh, sleep in late every day.

100
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,821
Joe, what do you do over the holidays?

101
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,643
I like to spend time with my family, just relax, eat some good food, stay warm.

102
00:09:26,704 --> 00:09:29,166
Speaking of food, what is your favorite holiday meal?

103
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,811
It has to be crab legs when we eat at Christmas Eve.

104
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:37,554
Do you do the entire seven fishes?

105
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:40,497
I'll be used to not anymore.

106
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,038
Happy holiday Mustangs!

107
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,519
I'm here with Mr. Skorker.

108
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,922
So Mr. Skorker, what is your favorite holiday meal?

109
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:52,724
My favorite holiday meal would have to be pernil, which is pork shoulder.

110
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:54,785
That sounds really good.

111
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,666
And how about your favorite holiday movie?

112
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,748
The Family Stone would have to be my number one favorite.

113
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:02,849
And your favorite holiday song?

114
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:06,851
Well, that has to be Jingle Bells because it was written in Medford.

115
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,052
Mr. Ambrose, first question is for you.

116
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,993
What do you do over the holidays?

117
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,774
Over the holidays, I like to get together with my family.

118
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:19,256
We're going to visit my sister this year for Christmas Eve, and we're going to visit my wife's parents for Christmas Day.

119
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:20,537
That sounds great.

120
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,777
And Thomas, same question to you.

121
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,118
What do you do over the holiday break?

122
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,199
Go on a vacation with my family, ski trip usually.

123
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:39,268

124
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:43,694
Well, I get to see a lot of my family, which is really cool.

125
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:47,196
And it's about it, hang out with my friends.

126
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:50,698
I have basketball practice every day, so that'll keep me busy.

127
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:51,458
That's about it.

128
00:10:51,598 --> 00:11:02,983
Yes, my grandmother makes, it's not really a meal, but my grandmother makes really good sugar cookies, and she spends hours decorating them, and they have little beading on them, and they're really intricately designed.

129
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,223
They're so cute, I love them.

130
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:09,846
And last question, what is your favorite holiday movie to sit back and watch?

131
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:12,402
Oh jeez.

132
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:15,509
Oh, The Grinch.

133
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:19,477
Not the creepy Jim Carrey one, but the cartoon is like my favorite movie ever.

134
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,780
Merry Christmas!

135
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,140
Happy Holidays!

136
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,702
Happy Holidays!

137
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:58,524
The Empty Sweater Contest winner is Raquel Quiroz.

138
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,856
Falls with boughs of holly.

00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:32,878
Fa la la la la la la la la.
