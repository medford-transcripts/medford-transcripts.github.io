We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas. We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Good timings we bring to you and your kin. Good timings for Christmas and a happy Mustang report. It's a stacking like brain game type challenge where they have to move weights in an order and then reassemble the platform at a different spot in the gym.

00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:38,370
Let's see how it can do.

3
00:00:40,265 --> 00:01:04,292
Alright, so this is called the Rice Relay. Each team has a little plastic spoon, and they need to sprint down, get as much rice on the spoon as they can, bring it, put it into their cup. They're not allowed to touch the cup, like Lovicka just cheated. They can only use one hand, and then when we're all done, we'll see the winning team gets to pick what the three losing teams are gonna do.

4
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:38,729
Hey, you're dropping rice everywhere, Mikey. It doesn't matter. Bruh, I saw you. I fell you apart here. Look, look, look. Kids will take every advantage they can. Look, bro. This Jerry's got a handful of rice somewhere. Where'd he go? No, it's not this one either. Cheater. Look at all of them. Really? Excellent. Thank you.

5
00:01:44,002 --> 00:02:07,329
I have this bonus rice in my hand. Once I finish the question, the first group that yells out the correct answer goes in your cup. What is my favorite color? Clear! That's my favorite color. First place.

Every day I really try to stretch out my muscles so I don't get injured, so that's a really big key for me. And Ben, first you went from football record-breaking 33 touchdowns and now you're in track. How do you feel? I feel good about it. After the football season I was very tired, but just had to keep grinding. And Sean, small in stature but large in speed. How do you feel after your race?

Well, I get to see a lot of my family, which is really cool. And it's about it, hang out with my friends. I have basketball practice every day, so that'll keep me busy. That's about it. Yes, my grandmother makes, it's not really a meal, but my grandmother makes really good sugar cookies, and she spends hours decorating them, and they have little beading on them, and they're really intricately designed. They're so cute, I love them. And last question, what is your favorite holiday movie to sit back and watch?
