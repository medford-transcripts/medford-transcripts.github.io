1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,370
[SPEAKER_12]: We wish you a merry Christmas.

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,430
[SPEAKER_14]: We wish you a merry Christmas.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.

4
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Good timings we bring to you and your kin.

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Good timings for Christmas and a happy Mustang report.

6
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:29,538
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a stacking like brain game type challenge where they have to move weights in an order and then reassemble the platform at a different spot in the gym.

7
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:33,511
Let's see how it can do.

8
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so this is called the Rice Relay.

9
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:52,489
[SPEAKER_16]: Each team has a little plastic spoon, and they need to sprint down, get as much rice on the spoon as they can, bring it, put it into their cup.

10
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,830
[SPEAKER_16]: They're not allowed to touch the cup, like Lovicka just cheated.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:04,052
[SPEAKER_16]: They can only use one hand, and then when we're all done, we'll see the winning team gets to pick what the three losing teams are gonna do.

12
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:15,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, you're dropping rice everywhere, Mikey.

13
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:16,977
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:19,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Bruh, I saw you.

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I fell you apart here.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, look, look.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Kids will take every advantage they can.

18
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:23,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, bro.

19
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,082
[SPEAKER_16]: This Jerry's got a handful of rice somewhere.

20
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:28,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Where'd he go?

21
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:29,324
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's not this one either.

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Cheater.

23
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at all of them.

24
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:30,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

25
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:30,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

26
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:31,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

27
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:47,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I have this bonus rice in my hand.

28
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:54,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Once I finish the question, the first group that yells out the correct answer goes in your cup.

29
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:58,926
[SPEAKER_16]: What is my favorite color?

30
00:01:59,047 --> 00:01:59,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Clear!

31
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,827
