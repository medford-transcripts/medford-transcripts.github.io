Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=42.32s">To</a>  submit written comments, please email ahertovice at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=46.403s">The</a>  purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper <a href="../resolutions/24-045.pdf"><font color="green">24-045</font></a>, the annual budget process for fiscal 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=52.608s">And</a>  this is our fourth preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 25 budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=59.454s">We</a>  have the following departments present. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=61.195s">We</a>  have our human resources, also health insurance and workers comp, assessor, building, diversity, equity, inclusion, and treasury. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=71.2s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to jump to the front of the line if they need to? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=75.522s">Or</a>  are we comfortable going in order? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=84.059s">Seems</a>  like everyone's okay with going in order, so we'll go in order, and I will start with human resources, health insurance, and workers comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=90.802s">I'm</a>  not sure, I think you might just, Lisa, might just be doing the human resources part, and then maybe Bob and Courtney, are you doing health insurance and workers comp? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=98.845s">Oh,</a>  you're doing that too, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=101.106s">Ah,</a>  they're your muscle, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=102.626s">I</a>  was like trying to suss out why you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=108.109s">Great,</a>  so I will go over, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=112.151s">We'll</a>  do HR department, then we can do health insurance, then we can do workers comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=117.073s">I'll</a>  just go over the top line really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=118.934s">The</a>  fiscal 25 proposed budget for human resources, $267,537.23 is up from $202,357 in fiscal 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=123.516s">And</a>  according to the change sheet, there are two increases here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=138.102s">One</a>  is, and again, this is in the fixed cost growth area, moving an ARPA-funded position onto the general fund budget, it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=146.728s">And</a>  the second is the, and it's the only item that's a new expense, is implementing safety compliance management leadership disciplinary trainings and a department head training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=157.274s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=158.295s">So</a>  I like to just ask for kind of four-ish questions or three questions and a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=165.959s">and</a>  you can take it from there director just let us know anything else you'd like us to know about the budget I did a very very short summary so feel free to share anything more that you'd like to share and then we'd love to hear about any programs that you did not request this year that you may <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=184.153s">like</a>  to request in the future, any staffing really, any expense that you envision your department needing but that we weren't able to request this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=191.981s">And</a>  then we'd love to hear about what you have done over this current fiscal year 24, what your plans are for the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=200.57s">And</a>  then just describing the process, which I've been doing every meeting since this is a newer <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=205.899s">This</a>  is a brand new process for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=209.443s">We</a>  started with, this is following our new budget ordinance, which was just ordained last night by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=216.791s">And</a>  we had been following it though in advance, and we appreciate the administration for working with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=224.019s">In</a>  March, the city council developed budget recommendations and submitted them to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=228.536s">And</a>  now we are holding preliminary budget meetings with our department heads, which is a departure from past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=233.598s">We're</a>  holding them before the final submission of the budget by the mayor at the end of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=239.179s">And</a>  then we will consider the budget at that time and how that is directly relevant to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=245.161s">If</a>  there's anything that changes significantly from what we've talked about tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=249.113s">by</a>  the in the actual budget presentation, either we might invite you back or the administration can say we want to come back with the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=256.879s">And</a>  then we can hear more from you in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=259.881s">But</a>  if not, then this may be the one time that you're here with us for the budget session. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=264.165s">So</a>  that's really it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=267.167s">As</a>  I said, all you just what anything more about your budget, anything you see that in the future that wasn't in this budget, and then we'd love to hear about the <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=277.819s">the</a>  past and future of your department's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=291.649s">Are</a>  we on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=293.07s">All</a>  right, so we're gonna be bringing on a personnel coordinator for July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=298.274s">That</a>  again is taking the place of part-time funded upper position that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=304.618s">We</a>  were also able to <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=308.735s">have</a>  some funds in our budget for our training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=312.277s">We</a>  are bringing on JJ Keller for DPW safety training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=316.9s">We</a>  are partnering with Trilliant, who is going to be providing our compliance training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=322.923s">There</a>  is gonna be online training and classroom training programs that they'll be able to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=328.587s">Basically,</a>  the budget is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=330.628s">There's</a>  not a lot of surprises here in HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=333.77s">What</a>  we may have asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=336.491s">didn't</a>  because of the budget, may have been another part-time position that hopefully maybe next fiscal year we'll be able to add to that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=345.138s">And</a>  really, as the years go on, training increases, so it would just be more funding for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=352.504s">But</a>  other than that, our budget is pretty supportive right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=355.487s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=360.991s">Yeah,</a>  so we're looking forward to next year, and we're excited for next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=365.697s">All</a>  right, so the HR office has been very busy collaborating, especially with the DEI office and our finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=374.504s">We</a>  were able to work with finance and I appreciate all the help they gave us to put together what we're calling the ENSO project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=382.451s">And</a>  that is currently the life cycle of every city employee that we have currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=387.535s">from</a>  their demographics, to their salaries, to what step they're on, to what union they might be in, what department, just everything about that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=396.542s">We</a>  usually have to look through different systems to get one complete picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=401.125s">And</a>  right now we have an entire spreadsheet, which is multiple pages and colorful, that gives us everything we need to know about every employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=410.225s">So</a>  if somebody comes up and says, I need to know about John Jones, we have a full history of him without having to go into his personnel file every single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=419.148s">So</a>  that's being updated in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=423.069s">So</a>  as status changes for an employee, we automatically go into that ENSO project and update the status of that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=429.671s">So</a>  it's fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=431.711s">It</a>  will be updated as, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=434.952s">time</a>  goes on for every single employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=436.693s">So</a>  it's pretty exciting to be able to go to one place and find all the information we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=443.535s">We</a>  also have been very busy with hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=447.437s">We</a>  had about 10 emergency responders this year, about 28 city staff personnel, including recently over the last week or two, a new deputy DPW director and an elections manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=460.182s">They'll</a>  both be starting over the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=463.224s">So</a>  we're very excited to have them on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=465.765s">And</a>  we've also been able to have several promotions within the fire department over the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=471.008s">So</a>  we're very excited about that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=473.609s">We</a>  are also currently working with the Collins Center on a comp and class study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=479.096s">and</a>  that is going to be implemented over the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=483.497s">Hopefully</a>  they're gonna be working on our FLSA classifications, compensation, updating the job descriptions to really reflect what the jobs are these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=494.64s">Our</a>  job descriptions are very old. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=496.221s">Some</a>  are from the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=497.861s">So</a>  they're not very reflective of what the actual position is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=501.742s">So</a>  we're setting up individual meetings with employees and the call-in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=505.723s">They're</a>  gonna go through what their job description actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=509.185s">to</a>  what it looks like on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=511.107s">Then</a>  we're going to go through the department heads to make sure that they, um, agree with what we're working with with the employees and come up with comprehensive job descriptions for every employee in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=522.786s">We</a>  have been working on a new hire process with our DEI director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=526.687s">So</a>  between Frances and myself in our offices, we've come up with a comprehensive system on a new hire process, which is pretty detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=535.09s">It</a>  outlines every step of the process from posting <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=540.251s">to</a>  hiring and at what levels each individual department head would be responsible to make sure things are in place at the right time, who will be on the hiring process, who will be taking care of setting up interviews, coming up with interview questions, and making sure that we're complying with state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=563.319s">We've</a>  also developed streamlined processes on our postings and our recruiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=568.221s">We're</a>  working with better teams and jobs along with MMA to make sure that we get the most qualified personnel for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=576.064s">We</a>  are working on internal processes and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=579.566s">We</a>  just put together an internship policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=583.277s">so</a>  that all departments that are working with interns will have a streamlined policy to get those staff on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=591.023s">We</a>  came in and completed an I-9 audit of the city, making sure that all our I-9s were compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=597.268s">We</a>  found that many were not, so we were able to go back and rectify those and have notice with each for the state, just in case we ever got audited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=607.976s">And</a>  we're also working on the CORI process every three years, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=613.464s">Individuals</a>  must be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=615.107s">Any</a>  employee must be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=616.57s">It</a>  hadn't been done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=617.893s">So</a>  we've put together a system so that every three years, everybody gets quarried just to be in compliance with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=626.806s">we</a>  have established a new employee announcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=631.348s">So</a>  when new employees would come on, nobody would know who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=634.41s">They'd</a>  be walking through the halls and it was like, who is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=637.051s">So</a>  now we do a spotlight for all new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=639.252s">So</a>  everybody kind of knows there's a new director coming in or there's a new clerk coming in depending at all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=645.936s">So</a>  hopefully that'll help the employee get acclimated with their surroundings and people can go up and introduce themselves and make sure that they feel welcomed with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=657.476s">We</a>  are working with JJ Keller on a comprehensive safety program with the DPW staff that I have mentioned during the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=665.483s">We're</a>  also expanding transparency with the HR office where we are now posting all newly ratified CBAs on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=674.39s">That</a>  was not done in the past that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=677.253s">And</a>  then also any city policies that we're starting to implement will be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=682.457s">And</a>  having the CBAs online really helps with the FOIA requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=686.567s">So</a>  now we can just direct people to the website if they're looking for anything on any of our contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=692.549s">We</a>  talked about partnering with Trilliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=695.49s">We're</a>  working with our DEI office as well on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=698.971s">This</a>  is a background process where we have compliance training, preventing harassment, sexual harassment, creating positive work environments, being an ally, civility in the workplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=710.414s">It</a>  really has a DEI and HR lens to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=713.752s">everybody</a>  will have an individual login, and then our DEI office will also conduct classroom trainings, just in case somebody's not really comfortable with using computers or being online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=726.139s">There'll</a>  be a classroom component for that, so everybody in the city can get trained at the level that they're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=733.647s">And</a>  we're also working on streamlining a lot of our processes and programs, working really closely with the DEI office because our office is kind of intertwined on a lot of our programs and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=745.476s">So</a>  it's been very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=747.057s">And</a>  Francis has been wonderful working with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=749.879s">And</a>  lastly, we have implemented <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=753.424s">partnering</a>  with Armstrong, our CPR training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=756.305s">You</a>  may have already saw the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=758.346s">If</a>  not, please register. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=760.187s">We're</a>  having a training on May 15th and June 5th, and I think that's a positive step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=765.969s">So</a>  I don't know if you have any questions on any of that, or I'll just kind of get into our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=775.452s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=776.232s">So</a>  we want to continue working with DEI office and finance to make sure that we're giving our employees a comprehensive start and process through their employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=788.797s">We</a>  want to continue creating an inviting environment so our employees feel supported, they feel heard, and they feel valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=796.48s">Usually,</a>  when people come into my office, they feel like they come into the principal's office, and we really want to make them feel welcomed, so that they don't feel like it's always, what did I do wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=805.865s">We</a>  want them to be able to come in and talk to us if they have problems or issues, or even if they have ideas of how to better support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=811.889s">So</a>  our office is always open, and we hope that they start using it for those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=824.389s">So</a>  we also want to build lasting and respectful relationships with our union representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=829.471s">I</a>  think the more collaborative we can be and the more respectful we can be at the table, the more we can get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=835.033s">And</a>  I think we're really moving in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=838.175s">We</a>  have been building really good relationships with our union representatives and I appreciate their participation in all the processes that we've been going forward with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=848.739s">We</a>  want to continue to grow and cultivate our awareness of how to better support our employees and our staff and how to better communicate with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=856.886s">Everybody</a>  communicates at a different level, and we want to make sure that we're being respectful of how to come to them and how for them to come to us to communicate what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=867.605s">We</a>  are also working on an HIRS system that is going to help automate our HR processes and procedures and get everybody to be on boarded through automation instead of all this paper that we've been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=883.211s">So</a>  we're hoping to get that implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=886.778s">So</a>  many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=887.438s">We're</a>  working on a handbook with our DEI office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=892.28s">Our</a>  handbook, we have one, but it's old and it's antiquated and some of it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=896.921s">So</a>  we're working on a new comprehensive handbook and a policy tracking system so that we can make sure that our policies are up to date and we're complying with state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=910.749s">So</a>  and aside from applying for grants that we can get through the HR office to help us support some of these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=918.156s">That's</a>  pretty much what we're going to be working towards come this fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=924.402s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=924.722s">Thank</a>  you, Director Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=926.123s">Any,</a>  um, comments or questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.967s">Thank</a>  you so much, Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=939.168s">I</a>  think that this is so exciting, hearing so many positive moves from our HR department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=949.515s">Maybe</a>  this might have been for the Executive Council President, but I just might have forgotten, but any movement or any thoughts of <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=962.822s">I</a>  know one of our strong initiatives is the City Solicitor and the Assistant City Solicitor's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=968.827s">Have</a>  we talked about maybe increasing that CAF to bring in candidates who will actually look at that as an appealing position? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=976.733s">I</a>  know it's really low and from the people that I've talked to they won't even consider even applying in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=983.759s">So</a>  this might not be for <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=987.162s">this</a>  conversation, but I did want to put it on our to-do list if we can, whether it's a form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=995.23s">But</a>  again, I didn't want to leave this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=998.013s">I</a>  know it's an important agenda piece that we focus on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1003.919s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1004.58s">Yeah,</a>  um, comment on that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1006.561s">So</a>  I'd be happy to, um, speak with the mayor and the chief of staff on any initiative we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1011.746s">But</a>  we are working on that class study, and we're hoping that that might identify some of the outliers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1017.991s">And</a>  it would include the solicitor and city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1020.413s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1021.634s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1034.477s">our</a>  city council budget recommendations, which we submitted March 20th to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1041.741s">And</a>  we did receive a response from the mayor that we're looking at putting a paper before the council around the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1051.086s">So,</a>  you know, I think that is probably going to be around the budget time and the personnel ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1056.269s">But</a>  I did want to say that that was <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1059.134s">that</a>  we received our budget recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1060.655s">So</a>  we did get the administration's response on that, um, and agree with Councilors Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1065.997s">That's</a>  a priority, and we're open for more details, but also just wanted to highlight that that was, um, a benefit of our new budget process that we did submit that recommendation, and I will go to Councilor Leming, and then I do have a question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1080.344s">Councilor</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1081.977s">So</a>  not to open this can of worms again, but I just like to kind of, well, I just like to, to understand, um, some, uh, some parts of the HR and, uh, back pay process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1096.542s">So</a>  when, so there, there are complaints about, um, employees receiving retroactive pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1102.924s">Could</a>  you just, um, just talk about like the reasoning behind some of those delays, like, you know, I've heard outdated systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1110.167s">And</a>  so sort of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1111.887s">from</a>  your perspective there?</p>
