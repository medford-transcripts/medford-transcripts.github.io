Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=42.32s">To</a>  submit written comments, please email ahertovice at medford-ma.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=46.403s">The</a>  purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper <a href="../resolutions/24-045.pdf"><font color="green">24-045</font></a>, the annual budget process for fiscal 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=52.608s">And</a>  this is our fourth preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 25 budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=59.454s">We</a>  have the following departments present. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=61.195s">We</a>  have our human resources, also health insurance and workers comp, assessor, building, diversity, equity, inclusion, and treasury. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=71.2s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to jump to the front of the line if they need to? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=75.522s">Or</a>  are we comfortable going in order? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=84.059s">Seems</a>  like everyone's okay with going in order, so we'll go in order, and I will start with human resources, health insurance, and workers comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=90.802s">I'm</a>  not sure, I think you might just, Lisa, might just be doing the human resources part, and then maybe Bob and Courtney, are you doing health insurance and workers comp? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=98.845s">Oh,</a>  you're doing that too, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=101.106s">Ah,</a>  they're your muscle, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=102.626s">I</a>  was like trying to suss out why you were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=108.109s">Great,</a>  so I will go over, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=112.151s">We'll</a>  do HR department, then we can do health insurance, then we can do workers comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=117.073s">I'll</a>  just go over the top line really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=118.934s">The</a>  fiscal 25 proposed budget for human resources, $267,537.23 is up from $202,357 in fiscal 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=123.516s">And</a>  according to the change sheet, there are two increases here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=138.102s">One</a>  is, and again, this is in the fixed cost growth area, moving an ARPA-funded position onto the general fund budget, it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=146.728s">And</a>  the second is the, and it's the only item that's a new expense, is implementing safety compliance management leadership disciplinary trainings and a department head training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=157.274s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=158.295s">So</a>  I like to just ask for kind of four-ish questions or three questions and a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=165.959s">and</a>  you can take it from there director just let us know anything else you'd like us to know about the budget I did a very very short summary so feel free to share anything more that you'd like to share and then we'd love to hear about any programs that you did not request this year that you may <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=184.153s">like</a>  to request in the future, any staffing really, any expense that you envision your department needing but that we weren't able to request this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=191.981s">And</a>  then we'd love to hear about what you have done over this current fiscal year 24, what your plans are for the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=200.57s">And</a>  then just describing the process, which I've been doing every meeting since this is a newer <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=205.899s">This</a>  is a brand new process for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=209.443s">We</a>  started with, this is following our new budget ordinance, which was just ordained last night by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=216.791s">And</a>  we had been following it though in advance, and we appreciate the administration for working with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=224.019s">In</a>  March, the city council developed budget recommendations and submitted them to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=228.536s">And</a>  now we are holding preliminary budget meetings with our department heads, which is a departure from past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=233.598s">We're</a>  holding them before the final submission of the budget by the mayor at the end of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=239.179s">And</a>  then we will consider the budget at that time and how that is directly relevant to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=245.161s">If</a>  there's anything that changes significantly from what we've talked about tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=249.113s">by</a>  the in the actual budget presentation, either we might invite you back or the administration can say we want to come back with the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=256.879s">And</a>  then we can hear more from you in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=259.881s">But</a>  if not, then this may be the one time that you're here with us for the budget session. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=264.165s">So</a>  that's really it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=267.167s">As</a>  I said, all you just what anything more about your budget, anything you see that in the future that wasn't in this budget, and then we'd love to hear about the <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=277.819s">the</a>  past and future of your department's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=291.649s">Are</a>  we on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=293.07s">All</a>  right, so we're gonna be bringing on a personnel coordinator for July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=298.274s">That</a>  again is taking the place of part-time funded upper position that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=304.618s">We</a>  were also able to <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=308.735s">have</a>  some funds in our budget for our training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=312.277s">We</a>  are bringing on JJ Keller for DPW safety training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=316.9s">We</a>  are partnering with Trilliant, who is going to be providing our compliance training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=322.923s">There</a>  is gonna be online training and classroom training programs that they'll be able to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=328.587s">Basically,</a>  the budget is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=330.628s">There's</a>  not a lot of surprises here in HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=333.77s">What</a>  we may have asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=336.491s">didn't</a>  because of the budget, may have been another part-time position that hopefully maybe next fiscal year we'll be able to add to that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=345.138s">And</a>  really, as the years go on, training increases, so it would just be more funding for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=352.504s">But</a>  other than that, our budget is pretty supportive right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=355.487s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=360.991s">Yeah,</a>  so we're looking forward to next year, and we're excited for next year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=365.697s">All</a>  right, so the HR office has been very busy collaborating, especially with the DEI office and our finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=374.504s">We</a>  were able to work with finance and I appreciate all the help they gave us to put together what we're calling the ENSO project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=382.451s">And</a>  that is currently the life cycle of every city employee that we have currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=387.535s">from</a>  their demographics, to their salaries, to what step they're on, to what union they might be in, what department, just everything about that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=396.542s">We</a>  usually have to look through different systems to get one complete picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=401.125s">And</a>  right now we have an entire spreadsheet, which is multiple pages and colorful, that gives us everything we need to know about every employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=410.225s">So</a>  if somebody comes up and says, I need to know about John Jones, we have a full history of him without having to go into his personnel file every single time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=419.148s">So</a>  that's being updated in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=423.069s">So</a>  as status changes for an employee, we automatically go into that ENSO project and update the status of that employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=429.671s">So</a>  it's fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=431.711s">It</a>  will be updated as, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=434.952s">time</a>  goes on for every single employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=436.693s">So</a>  it's pretty exciting to be able to go to one place and find all the information we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=443.535s">We</a>  also have been very busy with hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=447.437s">We</a>  had about 10 emergency responders this year, about 28 city staff personnel, including recently over the last week or two, a new deputy DPW director and an elections manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=460.182s">They'll</a>  both be starting over the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=463.224s">So</a>  we're very excited to have them on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=465.765s">And</a>  we've also been able to have several promotions within the fire department over the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=471.008s">So</a>  we're very excited about that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=473.609s">We</a>  are also currently working with the Collins Center on a comp and class study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=479.096s">and</a>  that is going to be implemented over the next couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=483.497s">Hopefully</a>  they're gonna be working on our FLSA classifications, compensation, updating the job descriptions to really reflect what the jobs are these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=494.64s">Our</a>  job descriptions are very old. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=496.221s">Some</a>  are from the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=497.861s">So</a>  they're not very reflective of what the actual position is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=501.742s">So</a>  we're setting up individual meetings with employees and the call-in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=505.723s">They're</a>  gonna go through what their job description actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=509.185s">to</a>  what it looks like on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=511.107s">Then</a>  we're going to go through the department heads to make sure that they, um, agree with what we're working with with the employees and come up with comprehensive job descriptions for every employee in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=522.786s">We</a>  have been working on a new hire process with our DEI director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=526.687s">So</a>  between Frances and myself in our offices, we've come up with a comprehensive system on a new hire process, which is pretty detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=535.09s">It</a>  outlines every step of the process from posting <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=540.251s">to</a>  hiring and at what levels each individual department head would be responsible to make sure things are in place at the right time, who will be on the hiring process, who will be taking care of setting up interviews, coming up with interview questions, and making sure that we're complying with state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=563.319s">We've</a>  also developed streamlined processes on our postings and our recruiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=568.221s">We're</a>  working with better teams and jobs along with MMA to make sure that we get the most qualified personnel for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=576.064s">We</a>  are working on internal processes and procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=579.566s">We</a>  just put together an internship policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=583.277s">so</a>  that all departments that are working with interns will have a streamlined policy to get those staff on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=591.023s">We</a>  came in and completed an I-9 audit of the city, making sure that all our I-9s were compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=597.268s">We</a>  found that many were not, so we were able to go back and rectify those and have notice with each for the state, just in case we ever got audited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=607.976s">And</a>  we're also working on the CORI process every three years, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=613.464s">Individuals</a>  must be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=615.107s">Any</a>  employee must be recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=616.57s">It</a>  hadn't been done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=617.893s">So</a>  we've put together a system so that every three years, everybody gets quarried just to be in compliance with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=626.806s">we</a>  have established a new employee announcement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=631.348s">So</a>  when new employees would come on, nobody would know who they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=634.41s">They'd</a>  be walking through the halls and it was like, who is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=637.051s">So</a>  now we do a spotlight for all new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=639.252s">So</a>  everybody kind of knows there's a new director coming in or there's a new clerk coming in depending at all levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=645.936s">So</a>  hopefully that'll help the employee get acclimated with their surroundings and people can go up and introduce themselves and make sure that they feel welcomed with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=657.476s">We</a>  are working with JJ Keller on a comprehensive safety program with the DPW staff that I have mentioned during the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=665.483s">We're</a>  also expanding transparency with the HR office where we are now posting all newly ratified CBAs on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=674.39s">That</a>  was not done in the past that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=677.253s">And</a>  then also any city policies that we're starting to implement will be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=682.457s">And</a>  having the CBAs online really helps with the FOIA requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=686.567s">So</a>  now we can just direct people to the website if they're looking for anything on any of our contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=692.549s">We</a>  talked about partnering with Trilliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=695.49s">We're</a>  working with our DEI office as well on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=698.971s">This</a>  is a background process where we have compliance training, preventing harassment, sexual harassment, creating positive work environments, being an ally, civility in the workplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=710.414s">It</a>  really has a DEI and HR lens to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=713.752s">everybody</a>  will have an individual login, and then our DEI office will also conduct classroom trainings, just in case somebody's not really comfortable with using computers or being online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=726.139s">There'll</a>  be a classroom component for that, so everybody in the city can get trained at the level that they're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=733.647s">And</a>  we're also working on streamlining a lot of our processes and programs, working really closely with the DEI office because our office is kind of intertwined on a lot of our programs and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=745.476s">So</a>  it's been very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=747.057s">And</a>  Francis has been wonderful working with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=749.879s">And</a>  lastly, we have implemented <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=753.424s">partnering</a>  with Armstrong, our CPR training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=756.305s">You</a>  may have already saw the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=758.346s">If</a>  not, please register. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=760.187s">We're</a>  having a training on May 15th and June 5th, and I think that's a positive step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=765.969s">So</a>  I don't know if you have any questions on any of that, or I'll just kind of get into our goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=775.452s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=776.232s">So</a>  we want to continue working with DEI office and finance to make sure that we're giving our employees a comprehensive start and process through their employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=788.797s">We</a>  want to continue creating an inviting environment so our employees feel supported, they feel heard, and they feel valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=796.48s">Usually,</a>  when people come into my office, they feel like they come into the principal's office, and we really want to make them feel welcomed, so that they don't feel like it's always, what did I do wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=805.865s">We</a>  want them to be able to come in and talk to us if they have problems or issues, or even if they have ideas of how to better support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=811.889s">So</a>  our office is always open, and we hope that they start using it for those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=824.389s">So</a>  we also want to build lasting and respectful relationships with our union representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=829.471s">I</a>  think the more collaborative we can be and the more respectful we can be at the table, the more we can get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=835.033s">And</a>  I think we're really moving in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=838.175s">We</a>  have been building really good relationships with our union representatives and I appreciate their participation in all the processes that we've been going forward with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=848.739s">We</a>  want to continue to grow and cultivate our awareness of how to better support our employees and our staff and how to better communicate with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=856.886s">Everybody</a>  communicates at a different level, and we want to make sure that we're being respectful of how to come to them and how for them to come to us to communicate what their needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=867.605s">We</a>  are also working on an HIRS system that is going to help automate our HR processes and procedures and get everybody to be on boarded through automation instead of all this paper that we've been using. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=883.211s">So</a>  we're hoping to get that implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=886.778s">So</a>  many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=887.438s">We're</a>  working on a handbook with our DEI office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=892.28s">Our</a>  handbook, we have one, but it's old and it's antiquated and some of it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=896.921s">So</a>  we're working on a new comprehensive handbook and a policy tracking system so that we can make sure that our policies are up to date and we're complying with state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=910.749s">So</a>  and aside from applying for grants that we can get through the HR office to help us support some of these initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=918.156s">That's</a>  pretty much what we're going to be working towards come this fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=924.402s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=924.722s">Thank</a>  you, Director Crowley. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=926.123s">Any,</a>  um, comments or questions from the council?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=937.967s">Thank</a>  you so much, Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=939.168s">I</a>  think that this is so exciting, hearing so many positive moves from our HR department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=949.515s">Maybe</a>  this might have been for the Executive Council President, but I just might have forgotten, but any movement or any thoughts of <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=962.822s">I</a>  know one of our strong initiatives is the City Solicitor and the Assistant City Solicitor's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=968.827s">Have</a>  we talked about maybe increasing that CAF to bring in candidates who will actually look at that as an appealing position? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=976.733s">I</a>  know it's really low and from the people that I've talked to they won't even consider even applying in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=983.759s">So</a>  this might not be for <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=987.162s">this</a>  conversation, but I did want to put it on our to-do list if we can, whether it's a form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=995.23s">But</a>  again, I didn't want to leave this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=998.013s">I</a>  know it's an important agenda piece that we focus on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1003.919s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1004.58s">Yeah,</a>  um, comment on that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1006.561s">So</a>  I'd be happy to, um, speak with the mayor and the chief of staff on any initiative we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1011.746s">But</a>  we are working on that class study, and we're hoping that that might identify some of the outliers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1017.991s">And</a>  it would include the solicitor and city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1020.413s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1021.634s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1034.477s">our</a>  city council budget recommendations, which we submitted March 20th to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1041.741s">And</a>  we did receive a response from the mayor that we're looking at putting a paper before the council around the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1051.086s">So,</a>  you know, I think that is probably going to be around the budget time and the personnel ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1056.269s">But</a>  I did want to say that that was <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1059.134s">that</a>  we received our budget recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1060.655s">So</a>  we did get the administration's response on that, um, and agree with Councilors Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1065.997s">That's</a>  a priority, and we're open for more details, but also just wanted to highlight that that was, um, a benefit of our new budget process that we did submit that recommendation, and I will go to Councilor Leming, and then I do have a question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1080.344s">Councilor</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1081.977s">So</a>  not to open this can of worms again, but I just like to kind of, well, I just like to, to understand, um, some, uh, some parts of the HR and, uh, back pay process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1096.542s">So</a>  when, so there, there are complaints about, um, employees receiving retroactive pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1102.924s">Could</a>  you just, um, just talk about like the reasoning behind some of those delays, like, you know, I've heard outdated systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1110.167s">And</a>  so sort of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1111.887s">from</a>  your perspective there?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1113.748s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1114.028s">So,</a>  yes, we do have integrated systems, so it did make it very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1118.95s">What</a>  we tried to do is we ratified a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1121.611s">Those</a>  are the retros we worked on first, just to keep everybody in the same system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1127.234s">We</a>  didn't want to jump one group before another if we'd ratified their contract first. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1132.736s">It</a>  was painstaking, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1136.718s">Bob</a>  was a big component of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1138.698s">He</a>  actually had to go through <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1140.481s">every</a>  single employee's payroll for every single year, we had an increase, line by line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1147.724s">And</a>  then see where they had a step increase or where they had a change or where they had a promotion, if they had overtime, because overtime was affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1157.508s">So</a>  it seems like it's a simple thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1160.77s">It's</a>  not as easy as taking everybody's salary, adding 2%, 3%, 5%, whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1166.587s">you</a>  really had to do individual employee by employee by employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1170.511s">So</a>  once Bob was able to get that information, then we sent it to our payroll office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1174.995s">And</a>  then our treasure collector actually went through every line by line by line to make sure that it was <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1183.399s">exactly</a>  the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1185.58s">And</a>  then it came to me for a spot check, and then it went to our chief of staff for a spot check. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1190.221s">And</a>  I believe Horton may have looked at some of them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1193.441s">So</a>  it was very painstaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1195.402s">I</a>  mean, just for the fire department, I think it was over several hundred pages, because one employee might have four pages, and that's four pages of spreadsheets, because some of them have been here.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1208.61s">And</a>  would a more updated software system be able to help with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1214.679s">Because</a>  it sounds like you were doing everything by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1216.642s">Everything</a>  was by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1219.285s">Wow.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1220.587s">And</a>  I don't mean by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1222.461s">It</a>  was spreadsheets, but we had to look at everything individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1226.223s">And</a>  it was from two systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1228.405s">It's</a>  not like we just have one system where everything was held. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1231.287s">So</a>  it did take long, and I will admit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1235.669s">But</a>  it wasn't by design. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1237.17s">It</a>  was by necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1238.271s">Because</a>  I was afraid if we didn't pay somebody what they were supposed to get paid, then we would have to stop that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1243.935s">So</a>  we wanted to be as accurate as we could.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1247.657s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1248.257s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1248.738s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1249.5s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1250.941s">And</a>  my question is, jumping back to the classification and compensation study, I heard basically that a bunch of the classification piece of that is being implemented administratively over the next few months, so I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1267.927s">Always</a>  glad to hear something from the 80s or the 90s is being brought to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1272.789s">I</a>  think that's really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1274.269s">And</a>  the more we do that, the less we'll have to do it in the future, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1278.771s">In</a>  that groove. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1280.386s">On</a>  the compensation side of the study, the council has had a lot of questions around compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1288.671s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli raised one about the solicitor's office, the law office, and whether the pay and the compensation is sufficient to bring on staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1296.975s">And</a>  our experience with that over the last couple of years seems to be that it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1303.51s">you</a>  know, but I think in general, the council is very interested in updating the personnel ordinance, something that we have talked about as getting the personnel ordinance back on Muni code. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1314.114s">And</a>  we didn't want to do that until we had worked through the process of, um, you know, making sure it was accurate and getting all the figures correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1321.697s">And</a>  I know that's part of the compensation element of the study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1324.738s">So</a>  I was just interested to know, um, what the timeline is on that part of the project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1330.802s">Okay,</a>  so right now we're in the interview stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1333.623s">So</a>  we did have all our employees and department heads actually go through the actual job descriptions and then fill out a questionnaire about what they actually do compared to what's on that job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1343.965s">I</a>  mean, some of them are so old, it talks about typewriters and mimeograph machines, which we don't have anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1349.226s">And</a>  so right now we are setting up individual interviews with the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1355.29s">with</a>  the call-in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1356.35s">So</a>  we're hoping by June that we have something presented to us from the call-in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1362.733s">It's</a>  gonna take about six more weeks or so, I would think.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1366.214s">And</a>  that would include the compensation? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1368.195s">It's</a>  all one package. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1369.055s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1370.295s">And</a>  then I assume that we would be able to see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1373.937s">Yeah,</a>  of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1375.757s">And</a>  then guessing that we'll talk about updating the personnel ordinance</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1380.638s">I</a>  would be happy to help you with that too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1383.024s">I</a>  will say that we have done some mini</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1389.588s">Like</a>  when we're hiring new people, we always kind of look at that when we're bringing on new people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1394.31s">We're</a>  not that far off, which is a good thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1397.511s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1397.831s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1398.332s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1398.932s">And</a>  I think for us, you know, for me, I mean, there's some obvious positions where it seems to be off scope.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1403.794s">Somewhere</a>  right where we should be right in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1405.735s">We</a>  never want to be at the top because, you know, we're not the biggest community, but we never want to be at the bottom either.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1411.397s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1411.677s">And</a>  so that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1412.397s">I</a>  think for us, the other is just the logistical piece of people always ask us, so how much do these people get paid or what's the salary rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1419.167s">I'd</a>  love to be able to start pointing them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1420.728s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1421.509s">It</a>  seems- You can point them to my direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1423.13s">I</a>  can let them know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1424.05s">Yeah,</a>  and I do do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1425.531s">I'm</a>  happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1426.932s">But</a>  it seems at some point prior to this council being on the council and prior to the clerk and prior to having HR and prior to this mayor's administration, the personal ordinance was pulled off of the ordinances website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1441.542s">I</a>  don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1442.743s">So</a>  I'm guessing probably because it was updated so frequently, we now have <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1447.824s">Let's</a>  say the most favorable explanation would be that it was being updated so frequently that we didn't want to pay the current page cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1453.585s">We</a>  have a better contract with MuniCode now, so it's much easier to update the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1457.967s">So</a>  if that was the reason, we'd solve that.</p>

    <p>[Announcer]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1461.247s">We'll</a>  go with that one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1462.428s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1462.908s">Any</a>  further questions on the HR side of things before we jump into health insurance and workers' compensation? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1470.59s">Councilor</a>  Scrively, do you have your hand raised? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1476.854s">I</a>  think not.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1477.955s">I</a>  think that may be- Yeah, sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1480.297s">It</a>  was up before, I apologize.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1482.819s">I</a>  thought so, but Adam was doing his due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1489.624s">Great,</a>  so that's the human resources piece of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1492.166s">Thank</a>  you for that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1492.807s">Okay,</a>  you're welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1494.528s">Next</a>  is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1498.191s">And</a>  this is budgeted fiscal 2024, 25, oh wow, 25,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1507.979s">And</a>  it's going up to $28,255,000 for fiscal 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1515.724s">And</a>  it looks like the main driver of this is a $2.725 million increase in the health, dental, and life insurance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1528.151s">And</a>  I mean, that is the vast majority of this budget already. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1532.557s">but</a>  also $120,000 in insurance premiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1537.103s">So</a>  obviously, especially in any budget, this would be a significant increase, especially seeing it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1547.395s">It</a>  is a large chunk already of the $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1552.759s">dollars</a>  that is available above last year's general fund budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1556.862s">So</a>  if you wanna talk about why that's happening, I understand we did talk about it a little bit with Bob, Director Dickinson last week, but I understand it's because the GIC rates are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1568.67s">But</a>  if you wanna get into that more.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1569.45s">Yeah,</a>  so I mean, I can talk about the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1571.552s">I</a>  can't talk about what was forecasted last year, because I wasn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1576.095s">So</a>  we do have an average of 10% increase over the GIC rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1580.911s">So</a>  that's 10% for every single employee that's on that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1585.814s">That</a>  is a big... I don't think we've had increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1589.301s">over</a>  the past couple of years, and that's why usually you get small increases or you don't get any, and then one year you get hit with a bomb, and then it settles down a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1598.925s">So</a>  we did have an average of 10% increase on the GIC side, as well as a 6 1⁄2 or 6.25% on the dental. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1608.37s">So</a>  I mean, really, it's hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1610.891s">Health</a>  insurance is fluid, so we don't know from day to day if we're gonna have 10 people that might come to us and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1618.018s">my</a>  husband or my spouse or whatever just lost their job, we need your insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1621.802s">That</a>  sends us right over the top right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1624.465s">We</a>  could in another month have 10 come in and say, my spouse just got a job, so now I don't need the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1630.492s">So</a>  it's really hard to pinpoint an actual number because it's so fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1635.658s">So</a>  what we did is we took what we spent, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1639.281s">currently,</a>  and I believe these are from March 27 of 24 numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1644.025s">So</a>  we took what we spent till then, divided it by the eight and a half months to project what it's gonna cost for the next couple of months, and then increased every single line. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1656.034s">We</a>  went through every single employee and added the 10% and the 6.25% wherever that fell. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1661.318s">And</a>  that's just the actual number we came up with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1666.382s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1667.97s">And</a>  it is obvious, you know, rates are going up 10%, that'll go up 12%, so that's pretty much in line with this estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1678.092s">Is</a>  there anything other than the health insurance, the other insurance premiums, or any other thing you want to touch on? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1683.793s">Did</a>  you use the same process to kind of arrive at those figures?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1686.414s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1687.394s">We</a>  used the same process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1688.874s">And</a>  it's the same work as just with the workers' comp when we get there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1694.555s">It's</a>  fluid, so we have to do our best with estimating and projecting what we have in front of us and what we think might be coming in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1702.597s">We</a>  know we had 28 new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1704.538s">We</a>  know we're going to have another 10 or 15 or 20 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1708.02s">So</a>  we have to almost plan that they're all going to want the insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1711.502s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1711.903s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1712.603s">Better</a>  that they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1713.584s">And</a>  we have the money than they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1715.545s">And</a>  we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1716.465s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1716.646s">So,</a>  yeah, I know the organization that I work for in my full time job, we we plan for everybody to take family insurance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1724.55s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1725.171s">And</a>  then we are grateful if they don't look high and hope it goes low.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1729.473s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1731.545s">And</a>  so you're, when you talk about budgeting for you're talking about like just the vacant positions, you're expecting that they would all be filled and everyone would take the biggest health insurance they could take.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1739.249s">That's</a>  the safest way to plan it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1740.83s">I</a>  mean, you could say it's an 80 20 split and we hope for that, but I'd rather have, you know, the number is really the number, the way we forecast insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1750.154s">It's</a>  the best pinpointing we can do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1753.756s">Any</a>  questions on the insurance budget or fiscal 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1764.429s">seeing</a>  none, I'm just going to make one comment, which is that I want to note again, you know, hopefully we have that averaging out over years, but, you know, 10, 12%, 11% is more than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1778.881s">And</a>  when we have the growth of costs like this, it eats up whatever the city is able to raise in the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1787.168s">We're</a>  spending, you know, we're so far through this budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1791.124s">I</a>  think there's been one department that has had a new expense and it may have been HR for $21,000 for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1797.188s">Everything</a>  else has been a fixed cost growth, a union contract or health insurance costs or increased cost of office supplies, paper and ink, you know, and it's more than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1810.576s">So</a>  when we talk about what the city is able to do every year, we are doing more with less. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1817.22s">Our</a>  costs are going up faster than our revenues are increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1820.746s">And</a>  it means that we are at best maintaining what we have and not really adding very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1828.728s">So</a>  I just want to make that point, because as we go through this process and we see budget after budget after budget, all we can do is keep what we have, even though we hear from departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1839.291s">And</a>  it's no slight against anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1841.211s">It's</a>  systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1842.031s">We</a>  have a systemic revenue shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1845.771s">every</a>  department needs one more person to take on a function, or a halftime person, or new programming, or wants to launch something that could help benefit our residents, and we can't implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1857.159s">And</a>  so this seems to be the big driver this year with the insurance, with $3 million of our $9 million going towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1865.505s">But</a>  I just wanted to raise that point.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1870.512s">And</a>  I definitely understand that I just not that this department is any more valuable than others, but we're so compliance driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1878.324s">Yeah,</a>  that the training that we need is compliance driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1881.288s">It's</a>  not <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1882.401s">the</a>  HR director saying, oh, I'd like to have, this is really all compliance and that we're just trying to make sure the city is complying with state and federal law.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1889.205s">Right,</a>  and that point wasn't the point I was, you know, I wasn't trying to spite you at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1893.008s">But</a>  I just want anybody out there listening that, you know, HR is getting what they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1897.05s">We're</a>  actually the minimum to get the compliance training that we're actually needing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1902.054s">And</a>  that's the thing, you know, we're scraping for essentials. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1905.316s">Yeah,</a>  I get it.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1909.969s">Is</a>  it, this is just a question coming from a councilor going through his first budget process, but is it typical in other cities to have between 10 to 15% of the city's budget going towards health and or life insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1925.039s">Like,</a>  is that it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1925.819s">That's</a>  the biggest ticket items. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1927.24s">That's</a>  typical, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1928.961s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1931.723s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1932.704s">Any</a>  further questions on health insurance or I guess the insurance department, which is all of our different insurances? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1940.06s">All</a>  right, to workers comp, bottom line, if I can flip the page, we budgeted fiscal 24, 675,000, budget for fiscal 25, 788,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1953.822s">That's</a>  an increase of 17%. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1957.143s">And</a>  that is driven, looking again, like by the actuals process that you just talked about that we did for health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1966.425s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1966.645s">I'm</a>  coming with all the good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1970.447s">So</a>  again, I can only talk about this year and what we're doing, but again, workers' comp is another piece that you can't pinpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1980.369s">It's</a>  fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1981.83s">This</a>  year, we may have had more incidences than they had in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1985.55s">So</a>  when they were forecasting for last year, they were working on different numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1991.332s">Us</a>  forecasting for this coming fiscal year, we're working on actual numbers that we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1996.553s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1998.308s">That's</a>  something where we could have all our workers' comp folks come back and say, we're healthy, we can come back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2005.211s">And</a>  the number goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2006.672s">And</a>  in the same instance, you could have some kind of, I don't even want to say the word, tragedy, where you have multiple employees now having to come back on workers' comp. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2015.436s">So</a>  it's just fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2016.756s">It's</a>  really hard to pinpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2018.057s">We</a>  had some settlements that we had on the books for a very long time, which I'm happy to say we were able to settle and stop that bleeding right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2028.021s">But</a>  again, it's ever fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2030.623s">There's</a>  no way to actually pinpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2033.206s">We</a>  know what we pay now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2034.767s">We</a>  know what we're paying, as you'll see in the actuals as of March 27th, those actual numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2042.013s">We</a>  then have to take what's left for the upcoming months, because we have to assume that those people are still gonna be on, most of them will still be on for the next couple of weeks of workers' comp, and factor out what we're gonna come into for fiscal year 25.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2057.708s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2058.268s">Any</a>  questions on workers comp? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2064.531s">Councilor</a>  Scarpellilli?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2066.092s">No,</a>  I'm sorry, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2067.913s">I</a>  put my hand up and direct your answer to the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2070.634s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2072.095s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2072.455s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2076.777s">Just</a>  one clarifying question, and maybe it might be, you may have kind of already answered it, but I just want to fully understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2082.28s">So</a>  when you're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2086.027s">a</a>  workers' comp claim, we're paying out of the workers' comp, and then you're saying when there's a settlement, it comes off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2091.071s">Are</a>  those settlements, you know, does that affect our insurance side of things at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2097.336s">Like,</a>  are those settlements paying insurance?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2098.617s">Our</a>  health insurance side of things?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2099.778s">Not</a>  necessarily health insurance, but like other insurance, like liability insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2103.881s">Like,</a>  are we paying out any of those settlements? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2106.003s">Is</a>  there a cash payment, and is that coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2107.865s">Yeah,</a>  so what happens is</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2111.294s">you</a>  obviously have a settlement and it would come out of those funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2114.975s">And</a>  it would be whatever, we try to see what we're gonna pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2120.216s">You</a>  have some people that we own for life, because that's just how workers' comp works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2124.057s">So</a>  those are the folks you try to see, forecast how long they're gonna still be on our workers' comp, what we can come to a settlement to get them off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2131.578s">Because</a>  in workers' comp, you do own some people until they pass actually, depending on the injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2138.56s">So</a>  we try to settle, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2141.038s">those</a>  claims so that we're not continuing on that process over the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2144.88s">We</a>  can kind of cut it here and then know that they're not going to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2149.223s">And</a>  that's how we can help with the forecasting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2152.165s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2154.366s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2158.348s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2159.549s">I</a>  didn't even need your backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2169.696s">I</a>  think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2170.957s">Let</a>  me double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2172.057s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2172.517s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2172.877s">Next</a>  department is assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2174.338s">We</a>  have our assessor, chief assessor, Ted Costian here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2179.78s">As</a>  I noted, and I'll just read again, basically, I will quickly read the budget, and then we'd love to hear you expound on that, anything that I didn't cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2190.385s">Then</a>  we'd love to hear what you've been up to this year, what you're up to over the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2195.746s">If</a>  there's a big change in your budget, once the budget's submitted at the end of the month, we may invite you back in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2201.769s">So</a>  I'll give it a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2203.41s">We</a>  have the assessor's department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2206.291s">Fiscal</a>  24 budget, $559,637. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2206.832s">Fiscal</a>  25 proposed, $586,609.84. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2207.312s">That's</a>  an increase of $26,972.84. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2219.804s">And</a>  all of those increases are in the fixed cost growth field where we have step increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2228.088s">We</a>  also have half of a position being funded through ARPA and half is gonna be coming on the general fund since ARPA ends December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2237.212s">And</a>  there was also a decrease in the legal services line item from, I believe, 50,000 to 9,600, if I'm remembering correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2247.425s">Um,</a>  so that is what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2249.826s">I</a>  will go to our assessor if you want to expand on that, and then tell us what you've been up to as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2256.487s">Good</a>  evening, Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2257.487s">Thanks</a>  for having me here just to touch on those two topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2261.188s">Our</a>  part time employees were funded through the opera revenue replacement that ends, um, statutorily at the end of this calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2269.47s">So</a>  just to backfill the rest of the fiscal year, we are proposing <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2274.191s">the</a>  city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2274.591s">We're</a>  on a $23,000 line. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2276.012s">I</a>  am for a part time field assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2278.573s">That</a>  field assessor has helped us do, you know, bulk of about 3000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2283.495s">Property</a>  reviews in about 800 800 building permit reviews, which are the basis of our new growth, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2299.864s">the</a>  line item you mentioned was the legal going down from 50,000 to 9,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2303.706s">We</a>  did a really good job this year at the Appellate Tax Board getting our caseload way down, both valuation-wise and just number of cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2312.589s">So</a>  I anticipate in the next fiscal year, given the number of abatements we got this fiscal year, not needing a specialized attorney or appraisal in front of the court system so that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2327.856s">the</a>  city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2328.036s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2328.096s">Work</a>  went to saving the city money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2330.357s">It</a>  may need to be addressed in a year if I feel that you know our abatement load is such that our appeals load is such that I'll need specialized attorneys at the appellate tax board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2340.343s">Just</a>  shifting <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2347.026s">We</a>  had building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2348.688s">We</a>  had a strong year in field reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2350.931s">We</a>  appreciate the council, you know, funding that, and we're using our staff, you know, wisely to really target areas of growth in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2358.12s">It's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2358.72s">We</a>  know that growth goes into funding teachers and government and police and fire, so we're <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2365.128s">that</a>  we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2366.008s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2366.068s">Cognizant</a>  of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2366.469s">We</a>  did a exempt to taxable review where I looked at every exempt property in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2370.371s">Uh</a>  and you know, we have four parcels that are going to be coming on his new growth in addition to about 2.2 million in new growth for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2382.456s">We</a>  obviously have to track all ownership changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2384.978s">So</a>  in that 900 arm's length sales, we record the new owners, but we also do an in-depth market analysis looking at different areas of the city on the residential side, but also a commercial and industrial review, looking at income and expense to derive income approach values, which we believe are more stable values when it comes to fair market value of property in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2410.128s">As</a>  I mentioned, we did see a significant decrease in abatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2413.25s">We</a>  feel like we've done a good job talking with taxpayers before values come out, particularly in our commercial class, which, going into the next evaluation year, may be a little up and down, just given the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2426.237s">We</a>  are seeing a strong sales market continue, even though interest rates in the last 18 months have gone up, you know, 300 to 400 basis points. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2434.342s">You</a>  know, it seems like 18 months ago we were at <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2437.904s">In</a>  the threes, 30-year mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2440.205s">Right</a>  now we're in the sevens. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2441.966s">So</a>  you would typically see a valuation decrease because people are going to buy homes for less. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2447.708s">Well,</a>  the supply is not there, so we're seeing pretty consistent valuations across our residential sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2454.171s">We're</a>  definitely keeping an eye on our retail, our office, our industrial to make sure we're aligned with the valuations in the fair market sales we're seeing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2464.431s">In</a>  addition to that, just administratively, we're processing over 1,000 motor vehicle excise abatements for our taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2470.993s">They</a>  get their money back when they sell a vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2473.194s">Maria</a>  downstairs does a great job with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2476.255s">We</a>  are, Rita downstairs, processing over 400 statutory exemptions for our low-income residents that own properties, our wounded veterans that own properties that are legally blind that own properties in the city, making sure we serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2491.579s">doing</a>  all of our condo conversions, which also are new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2494.081s">And</a>  Jared really did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2495.463s">He's</a>  in here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2496.223s">He's</a>  doing a lot of great work capturing that and capturing new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2502.769s">But</a>  I'll take any other questions now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2507.153s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2507.694s">One</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2508.434s">Is</a>  there anything not requested in this budget that you might see a need for in future budgets, either staffing, systems, programming?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2517.827s">Yeah,</a>  as I mentioned, we are going to be going through a revaluation in fiscal year 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2522.148s">The</a>  state mandates that we visit every property every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2526.569s">So</a>  we did a really good job with our 3,500 property visits this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2530.89s">We're</a>  kind of checking them off the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2532.491s">We</a>  have about 3,000 more to go going into the fiscal year 26 valuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2536.312s">That's</a>  why that line item for the field assessor is extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2540.553s">And</a>  we just hope that council going forward in the next year would consider funding that sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2546.474s">for</a>  a full year because, you know, this year's a half year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2549.295s">That's</a>  pretty crucial just with our new growth for the city in revenue wise and then just meeting that state mandate for the inspection cycle.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2557.377s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2557.677s">And</a>  that led right into my next question, which was, you know, how do we plan to keep the field assessor position on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2562.759s">It</a>  sounds like that would be a request that we'd make in the next fiscal year budget.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2567.041s">I</a>  mean, I think that that position alone, I can comfortably say is responsible for over half a million dollars in revenue for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2573.165s">So</a>  I think it would be very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2575.126s">We</a>  keep that on worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2576.927s">Yeah,</a>  totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2578.088s">If</a>  anything you do, that's worth it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2579.749s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2580.069s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2580.589s">Um,</a>  and you know, as a council, um, you know, all we can do is cut, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2586.072s">So</a>  I don't think you know, I don't think we've ever taken a cut vote, actually, since, um, but a cut motion, but I don't think we ever taken a cut vote since, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2596.602s">and</a>  I'm glad that the building commissioners here to I sent an email and I've just read I never responded to either of you earlier in April, just talking about assessments and new growth and flips and kind of there's just this <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2626.98s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2628.2s">Parcels</a>  buildings and parcels being undervalued and, you know, selective valuation of parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2634.022s">And</a>  I know we've gone through it a million times. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2635.722s">I</a>  won't ask you to go through again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2636.902s">The</a>  assessing process, state law, what you follow, you know, and all of the different things that go into making sure that all of the parcels in the city are at a fair value. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2646.824s">But</a>  I did have one question from the response. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2650.245s">we</a>  did take that vote to go to the June 30th valuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2653.127s">So</a>  I know that added a little bit more for this fiscal year of new growth in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2656.669s">Is</a>  that going to shorten the lag between when a property value is valued and when the tax bill is adjusted?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2663.132s">Yeah,</a>  short answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2663.953s">Yes,</a>  it was the January 1st preceding the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2667.535s">Now</a>  we can catch it up until June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2670.576s">So</a>  it's sort of a six eliminates that additional six month lag, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2674.398s">So</a>  the lag time between the <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2677.847s">when</a>  the market condition and when the value effects is gonna go from about a year to six months?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2684.169s">Yeah,</a>  from 18 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2686.129s">18</a>  to 12, got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2687.67s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2688.41s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2688.79s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2689.87s">So</a>  we're cutting six months off of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2691.411s">Definitely.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2692.151s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2694.092s">And</a>  other than that, is there anything else, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2699.929s">that,</a>  you know, your department's been doing or, you know, any, I guess my only question is, you know, some, something we, um, I'm trying to get a little bit more of a focus on, and we've been focusing on with some other departments and I'm guessing it might be a factor with your department is like our technology systems, you know, is there any, you know, do you feel like the systems that you have in place are, are effective? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2719.666s">Is</a>  there anything that might need to be upgraded in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2721.968s">Is</a>  there anything, you know, as director Crowley talked about, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2725.643s">you</a>  know, they're looking at some systems that might add some automation that might help the office, you know, operate more efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2730.791s">Is</a>  there anything like that with the assessing office? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2732.554s">I</a>  don't think I've ever asked you guys that before.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2734.844s">Yeah,</a>  we definitely, obviously, I know it's only an 11% increase, but we do have software costs that are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2742.006s">That's</a>  pretty typical across the market right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2745.787s">Our</a>  main software vision, Cama, is a robust computer-assisted mass appraisal software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2752.129s">We</a>  publish every single record card online every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2756.67s">We</a>  also have a personal property software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2759.791s">One</a>  area of improvement, I'd say, is we are using <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2763.832s">artificial</a>  intelligence to scan our deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2767.265s">So</a>  it's not just like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2769.238s">Us</a>  reading 950 deeds, we kind of are using a software that grabs all the important information into a file. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2776.74s">We</a>  can then quickly look at it, kind of puts everything in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2779.701s">And</a>  then we're clicking on the back end, and it's kind of going into our Canvas system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2784.443s">So</a>  if that makes sense, it's not like manual data entry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2787.483s">It's</a>  like you see it on a screen, you agree with it, and you're clicking it, and it appears into the software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2792.705s">So</a>  that's been a huge time savings and a good use of software.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2796.718s">Great,</a>  yeah, for those filling out their budget bingo cards, that's the first mention of AI this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2803.041s">Yep,</a>  there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2804.682s">It's</a>  coming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2805.923s">Yeah,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2806.603s">That's</a>  great to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2807.323s">Really</a>  exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2808.344s">And</a>  it sounds like you have the systems you need, but the costs go up every year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2813.867s">Unfortunately.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2814.707s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2815.287s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2816.028s">Any</a>  questions, further questions by members of the council for our assessor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2823.431s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2824.392s">Seeing</a>  none, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2826.892s">We'll</a>  talk soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2827.993s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2832.416s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2832.856s">Next,</a>  we have building departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2836.298s">We</a>  have Commissioner van der Waal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2844.644s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2845.245s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2845.945s">Good</a>  to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2847.546s">I'm</a>  just going to read through really quickly the bottom top line budget, and I'll talk a little bit about the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2856.328s">We'd</a>  love to hear anything that you weren't able to include this year, but that you envision needing for the department in the future, and then hear about your narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2864.494s">So</a>  just giving a quick start, building department, fiscal 24 budgeted $1,085,531. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2868.657s">Fiscal</a>  25 proposed budget $1,030,354.29. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2879.744s">And</a>  we have a decrease, net decrease, mainly due to facilities budget, our utilities budgeting moving over to the facilities department and a decrease in overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2892.813s">And</a>  then the fixed cost growth, we have salaries with the raises, union and non-union raises, eligibility for longevity and a $2,500 increase in the cost and supplies needed for our inspectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2908.123s">So</a>  with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2909.352s">I'll</a>  turn it over to you, feel free to share anything you want about the budget, and we'll hear about the great work of your department.</p>

    <p>[QyOHt10oLs0_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2916.819s">As</a>  you know, I'm entering my fourth month being here, and we have been busy as a department, as we often are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2924.166s">Yeah,</a>  a big part of the budget certainly was transferring some of the facilities over to Paul and starting to sort out that bits and pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2933.614s">One</a>  of the bigger areas of expense growth was the mail sorter machine, postage increases and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2940.315s">We</a>  did sign a new three-year lease just a couple of months ago, so we're on a new machine, but we did acquire some capabilities for analytics to help us start looking at how mailing goes out and hopefully see some gains in budget savings down the road with that as a strong potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2958.868s">Now</a>  this department is heavy personnel oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2961.13s">It's</a>  primary personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2962.451s">We</a>  don't really buy a lot or sell a lot or create anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2965.493s">So,</a>  and most, almost all of that, except for me is on a union contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2969.637s">So</a>  that's a lot of it is locked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2973.54s">We're</a>  starting to make changes in system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2975.962s">We've</a>  done some changes with our permitting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2978.944s">We're</a>  trying to capture some other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2980.986s">We're</a>  trying to really develop something that's set. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2984.629s">Languid</a>  I'd say for the last four years, there's no expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2987.591s">We're</a>  just, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2988.852s">trying</a>  to bring things into the next century and starting to use some reporting capacities to look for things that we have never really stayed on top of in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=2996.173s">And</a>  we hope to implement some other types of inspection programs, such as periodics and things that should be done by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3003.015s">We</a>  have not been able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3004.755s">They</a>  certainly are revenue gainers for us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3007.275s">So</a>  there are changes undergoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3009.236s">As</a>  a matter of fact, we just debuted the new portal, the public facing portal upgrade tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3015.977s">We'll</a>  go into more of an icon stage instead of writing and clicking on hyperlinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3020.418s">So</a>  it'll be a nice thing and it'll come in multiple languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3024.038s">So</a>  we're doing all sorts of things with the tools we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3027.779s">It's</a>  going good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3030.359s">We're</a>  also doing a lot of training. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3032.06s">We</a>  have new energy codes coming on and new building codes coming on and a lot of stuff changing this second half of the year that's gonna force all of us to learn a lot more and to do some more enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3043.082s">So</a>  it's a busy time down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3045.722s">And</a>  we're just going to keep pushing forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3050.425s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3051.806s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3052.826s">Just</a>  anything that wasn't requested in this year's budget that you may envision us needing for your department to request in future budgets?</p>

    <p>[QyOHt10oLs0_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3061.672s">Well,</a>  certainly one of the things we're starting to grapple with more is public records requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3066.595s">We're</a>  starting to see requests come from far across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3069.897s">We</a>  have them from Atlanta, we've had them from Oklahoma, their mortgage assessors and risk assessors and stuff from other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3077.002s">They</a>  wanna do code reviews of documents we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3080.384s">And</a>  they tend to just sort of send in a letter and give me everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3084.187s">And</a>  everything can be quite a lot to copy and send. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3086.669s">So</a>  ultimately down the road, we'd like to start finding a way to get our records in the basement on a digital so that they're much more accessible and so people can do their own searching and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3095.594s">We</a>  just did one, it took us eight hours to copy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3098.856s">That's</a>  time I don't really have to give away routinely and to them, it's just a piece of paper, an email for us, it's a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3106.702s">So</a>  I think the ability to put all of our records into the computer per se is a huge, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3114.409s">need</a>  for us down the road as these computerized requests continue to increase through the public records process.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3121.657s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3122.017s">So</a>  the digitization of the paper records is a future project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3126.862s">And</a>  right now, we're not working on it.</p>

    <p>[QyOHt10oLs0_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3130.134s">Well,</a>  we're not really working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3131.815s">We</a>  don't have any great way to work on it, other than the occasional when we get a request for a file, we'll scan and copy it at that time and keep it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3139.08s">But</a>  there's a huge room downstairs full of thousands of records, and it will take a concentrated effort to truly do it by someone focused on it and whose eyeballs don't burn out within a few hours.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3153.561s">So</a>  maybe AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3154.462s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Leming, and then I see Councilor Scarpelli, and then I have a couple questions as well.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3162.549s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3163.109s">So</a>  I know we've talked about this a little bit just over the phone, but I'd like to, one thing that I'm personally concerned with is just the amount of vacant buildings around Medford, vacant storefronts and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3175.68s">So,</a>  and I've been looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3180.242s">that</a>  would allow the city to hopefully get a slightly better grasp on that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3185.884s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit about what extra technology or staff capacity the building commission would need in order to keep better track of the vacant buildings in the city and, you know, who owns them and what could possibly be done about that?</p>

    <p>[QyOHt10oLs0_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3208.479s">Within</a>  our CitizenServe program, we have that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3211.741s">And</a>  in the new portal set up that debuted tonight, we set an icon aside for that potential program to be built on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3218.325s">And</a>  quite frankly, we don't generally build out these modules or elements blindly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3223.588s">We</a>  sort of borrow from other citizen service across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3226.81s">And</a>  I'm not hesitant to steal somebody else's program, bring it in and put our name on it and utilize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3233.274s">That</a>  combined with the fact that when I got here, we switched from once to twice a year update of our records from assessor into the system down to now we're weekly upgrades of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3244.079s">So</a>  we're getting ownership data, we're developing this element that'll be able to track it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3248.722s">The</a>  biggest challenge to vacant will be identifying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3252.143s">And</a>  that's just field work and other things we're gonna have to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3254.904s">But</a>  we're ready to take that information in and keep track of it once we start <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3260.347s">Developing</a>  how we're going to identify vacant properties and keep track of them.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3264.814s">And</a>  is there capacity to have a public interface of the vacant of vacant properties and people who may be interested in reaching out to the owners of them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3275.512s">business</a>  opportunities could get in contact with them directly.</p>

    <p>[QyOHt10oLs0_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3278.394s">Yes,</a>  everything on CitizenServe is publicly accessible as a guest, as a user, as a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3285.26s">You</a>  can, you know, that's one of the upsides to the public records then of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3288.763s">It's</a>  all publicly facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3290.124s">Anybody</a>  can technically log in there and pull up all the information they need down to the permits, the documents that came in attached to them, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3297.99s">You</a>  don't need to be a registered user. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3299.532s">So</a>  yeah, just like the assessor, if you know an address you want to go dig in, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3303.795s">You</a>  can pull it up pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3305.117s">You</a>  can pull up the building card, you can pull up anything associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3308.883s">So,</a>  yes, very publicly accessible if you want to do your homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3312.989s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3313.81s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3319.028s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3321.009s">I</a>  think my biggest thing, as we've talked over the years, is the staffing and what, you know, it seems to be that every time we have an initiative, it's always, well, we'll put the building department on it, or we'll put the health department on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3338.078s">So</a>  I know something that came about in conversations of a possibility, and, you know, especially looking into this year's budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3348.083s">It's</a>  a little concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3349.665s">If</a>  we, if we, the council did move forward with a registry for our landlords and renters, do we have the capacity for staffing in your department to oversee that?</p>
