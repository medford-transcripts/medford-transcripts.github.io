[SPEAKER_09]: City Council, Committee of the Whole, May 1st, 2024.

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,630

[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.

00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:41,219
[SPEAKER_09]: in the City Council Chambers, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom.

[SPEAKER_09]: To submit written comments, please email ahertovice at medford-ma.gov.

8
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:52,248
[SPEAKER_09]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss paper 24-045, the annual budget process for fiscal 2025.

9
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:58,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is our fourth preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 25 budget process.

10
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,175
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the following departments present.

11
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:09,579
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our human resources, also health insurance and workers comp, assessor, building, diversity, equity, inclusion, and treasury.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who would like to jump to the front of the line if they need to?

13
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are we comfortable going in order?

14
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:30,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems like everyone's okay with going in order, so we'll go in order, and I will start with human resources, health insurance, and workers comp.

15
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:38,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure, I think you might just, Lisa, might just be doing the human resources part, and then maybe Bob and Courtney, are you doing health insurance and workers comp?

16
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:39,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're doing that too, great.

17
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, they're your muscle, okay.

18
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:46,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like trying to suss out why you were here.

19
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, so I will go over,

20
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,552
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do HR department, then we can do health insurance, then we can do workers comp.

21
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:58,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go over the top line really quickly.

22
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:03,335
[SPEAKER_09]: The fiscal 25 proposed budget for human resources, $267,537.23 is up from $202,357 in fiscal 24.

23
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:05,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to the change sheet, there are two increases here.

24
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:26,087
[SPEAKER_09]: One is, and again, this is in the fixed cost growth area, moving an ARPA-funded position onto the general fund budget, it looks like.

25
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:36,253
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second is the, and it's the only item that's a new expense, is implementing safety compliance management leadership disciplinary trainings and a department head training.

26
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:37,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

27
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:44,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like to just ask for kind of four-ish questions or three questions and a statement.

28
00:02:45,959 --> 00:03:03,503
[SPEAKER_09]: and you can take it from there director just let us know anything else you'd like us to know about the budget I did a very very short summary so feel free to share anything more that you'd like to share and then we'd love to hear about any programs that you did not request this year that you may

29
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:11,961
[SPEAKER_09]: like to request in the future, any staffing really, any expense that you envision your department needing but that we weren't able to request this year.

30
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:19,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'd love to hear about what you have done over this current fiscal year 24, what your plans are for the next fiscal year.

31
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And then just describing the process, which I've been doing every meeting since this is a newer

32
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:28,242
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a brand new process for the city.

33
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:35,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We started with, this is following our new budget ordinance, which was just ordained last night by the city council.

34
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:42,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had been following it though in advance, and we appreciate the administration for working with us on that.

35
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,883
[SPEAKER_09]: In March, the city council developed budget recommendations and submitted them to the mayor.

36
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:53,177
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we are holding preliminary budget meetings with our department heads, which is a departure from past practice.

37
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We're holding them before the final submission of the budget by the mayor at the end of May.

38
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:04,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we will consider the budget at that time and how that is directly relevant to you.

39
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,262
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's anything that changes significantly from what we've talked about tonight,

40
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:16,239
[SPEAKER_09]: by the in the actual budget presentation, either we might invite you back or the administration can say we want to come back with the department.

41
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can hear more from you in June.

42
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:24,025
[SPEAKER_09]: But if not, then this may be the one time that you're here with us for the budget session.

43
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really it.

44
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:37,135
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, all you just what anything more about your budget, anything you see that in the future that wasn't in this budget, and then we'd love to hear about the

45
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,701
[SPEAKER_09]: the past and future of your department's work.

46
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:52,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we on?

47
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,593
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're gonna be bringing on a personnel coordinator for July 1st.

48
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:03,738
[SPEAKER_02]: That again is taking the place of part-time funded upper position that we have now.

49
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,919
[SPEAKER_02]: We were also able to

50
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: have some funds in our budget for our training.

51
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:16,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We are bringing on JJ Keller for DPW safety training.

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We are partnering with Trilliant, who is going to be providing our compliance training.

53
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:27,846
[SPEAKER_02]: There is gonna be online training and classroom training programs that they'll be able to support.

54
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:30,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the budget is what it is.

55
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of surprises here in HR.

56
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,330
[SPEAKER_02]: What we may have asked for

57
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't because of the budget, may have been another part-time position that hopefully maybe next fiscal year we'll be able to add to that budget.

58
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:51,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, as the years go on, training increases, so it would just be more funding for training.

59
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, our budget is pretty supportive right now.

60
00:05:55,487 --> 00:06:00,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

61
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:05,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so we're looking forward to next year, and we're excited for next year.

62
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the HR office has been very busy collaborating, especially with the DEI office and our finance department.

63
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:21,670
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to work with finance and I appreciate all the help they gave us to put together what we're calling the ENSO project.

64
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:26,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is currently the life cycle of every city employee that we have currently.

65
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:35,941
[SPEAKER_02]: from their demographics, to their salaries, to what step they're on, to what union they might be in, what department, just everything about that employee.

66
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually have to look through different systems to get one complete picture.

67
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now we have an entire spreadsheet, which is multiple pages and colorful, that gives us everything we need to know about every employee.

68
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:58,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody comes up and says, I need to know about John Jones, we have a full history of him without having to go into his personnel file every single time.

69
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:02,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's being updated in real time.

70
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So as status changes for an employee, we automatically go into that ENSO project and update the status of that employee.

71
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fluid.

72
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be updated as, you know,

73
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:16,653
[SPEAKER_02]: time goes on for every single employee.

74
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:21,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty exciting to be able to go to one place and find all the information we need.

75
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:27,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have been very busy with hiring.

76
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:39,661
[SPEAKER_02]: We had about 10 emergency responders this year, about 28 city staff personnel, including recently over the last week or two, a new deputy DPW director and an elections manager.

77
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,583
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll both be starting over the next couple of weeks.

78
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very excited to have them on board.

79
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:50,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've also been able to have several promotions within the fire department over the last couple of weeks.

80
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very excited about that, too.

81
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also currently working with the Collins Center on a comp and class study.

82
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:03,457
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is going to be implemented over the next couple of months.

83
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they're gonna be working on our FLSA classifications, compensation, updating the job descriptions to really reflect what the jobs are these days.

84
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Our job descriptions are very old.

85
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are from the 80s.

86
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not very reflective of what the actual position is now.

87
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:25,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're setting up individual meetings with employees and the call-in center.

88
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,304
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna go through what their job description actually is.

89
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:30,406
[SPEAKER_02]: to what it looks like on paper.

90
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:40,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to go through the department heads to make sure that they, um, agree with what we're working with with the employees and come up with comprehensive job descriptions for every employee in the city.

91
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:46,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working on a new hire process with our DEI director.

92
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:55,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So between Frances and myself in our offices, we've come up with a comprehensive system on a new hire process, which is pretty detailed.

93
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It outlines every step of the process from posting

94
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:21,854
[SPEAKER_02]: to hiring and at what levels each individual department head would be responsible to make sure things are in place at the right time, who will be on the hiring process, who will be taking care of setting up interviews, coming up with interview questions, and making sure that we're complying with state and federal law.

95
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:27,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also developed streamlined processes on our postings and our recruiting.

96
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with better teams and jobs along with MMA to make sure that we get the most qualified personnel for the city.

97
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,466
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on internal processes and procedures.

98
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:42,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We just put together an internship policy.

99
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:50,223
[SPEAKER_02]: so that all departments that are working with interns will have a streamlined policy to get those staff on board.

100
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:56,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We came in and completed an I-9 audit of the city, making sure that all our I-9s were compliant.

101
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that many were not, so we were able to go back and rectify those and have notice with each for the state, just in case we ever got audited.

102
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also working on the CORI process every three years,

103
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:15,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Individuals must be recorded.

104
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:16,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Any employee must be recorded.

105
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It hadn't been done in the past.

106
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've put together a system so that every three years, everybody gets quarried just to be in compliance with the state.

107
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:30,748
[SPEAKER_02]: we have established a new employee announcement program.

108
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:34,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So when new employees would come on, nobody would know who they were.

109
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,551
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be walking through the halls and it was like, who is that?

110
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we do a spotlight for all new employees.

111
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:45,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody kind of knows there's a new director coming in or there's a new clerk coming in depending at all levels.

112
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:55,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that'll help the employee get acclimated with their surroundings and people can go up and introduce themselves and make sure that they feel welcomed with the city.

113
00:10:57,476 --> 00:11:04,902
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working with JJ Keller on a comprehensive safety program with the DPW staff that I have mentioned during the budget process.

114
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also expanding transparency with the HR office where we are now posting all newly ratified CBAs on our website.

115
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,732
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not done in the past that I know of.

116
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:22,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also any city policies that we're starting to implement will be online.

117
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:26,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And having the CBAs online really helps with the FOIA requests.

118
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:31,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can just direct people to the website if they're looking for anything on any of our contracts.

119
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,669
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about partnering with Trilliant.

120
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with our DEI office as well on that.

121
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a background process where we have compliance training, preventing harassment, sexual harassment, creating positive work environments, being an ally, civility in the workplace.

122
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:52,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It really has a DEI and HR lens to it.

123
00:11:53,752 --> 00:12:05,778
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody will have an individual login, and then our DEI office will also conduct classroom trainings, just in case somebody's not really comfortable with using computers or being online.

124
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,582
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a classroom component for that, so everybody in the city can get trained at the level that they're at right now.

125
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:25,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also working on streamlining a lot of our processes and programs, working really closely with the DEI office because our office is kind of intertwined on a lot of our programs and processes.

126
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been very helpful.

127
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:29,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And Francis has been wonderful working with us on that.

128
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, we have implemented

129
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:36,245
[SPEAKER_02]: partnering with Armstrong, our CPR training.

130
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,846
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have already saw the emails.

131
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, please register.

132
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:45,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a training on May 15th and June 5th, and I think that's a positive step in the right direction.

133
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you have any questions on any of that, or I'll just kind of get into our goals.

134
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:55,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

135
00:12:56,232 --> 00:13:08,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to continue working with DEI office and finance to make sure that we're giving our employees a comprehensive start and process through their employment.

136
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:15,860
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to continue creating an inviting environment so our employees feel supported, they feel heard, and they feel valued.

137
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, when people come into my office, they feel like they come into the principal's office, and we really want to make them feel welcomed, so that they don't feel like it's always, what did I do wrong?

138
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:31,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to be able to come in and talk to us if they have problems or issues, or even if they have ideas of how to better support them.

139
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So our office is always open, and we hope that they start using it for those issues.

140
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also want to build lasting and respectful relationships with our union representatives.

141
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:55,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the more collaborative we can be and the more respectful we can be at the table, the more we can get things done.

142
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:58,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're really moving in that direction.

143
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:07,999
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been building really good relationships with our union representatives and I appreciate their participation in all the processes that we've been going forward with them.

144
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:16,406
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to continue to grow and cultivate our awareness of how to better support our employees and our staff and how to better communicate with them.

145
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody communicates at a different level, and we want to make sure that we're being respectful of how to come to them and how for them to come to us to communicate what their needs are.

146
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:42,771
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also working on an HIRS system that is going to help automate our HR processes and procedures and get everybody to be on boarded through automation instead of all this paper that we've been using.

147
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping to get that implemented.

148
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So many others.

149
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:51,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on a handbook with our DEI office.

150
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Our handbook, we have one, but it's old and it's antiquated and some of it's outdated.

151
00:14:56,921 --> 00:15:09,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on a new comprehensive handbook and a policy tracking system so that we can make sure that our policies are up to date and we're complying with state and federal law.

152
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:17,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So and aside from applying for grants that we can get through the HR office to help us support some of these initiatives.

153
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:21,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what we're going to be working towards come this fiscal year.

154
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:24,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

155
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Crowley.

156
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:30,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Any, um, comments or questions from the council?

157
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:37,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

158
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Director.

159
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:47,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is so exciting, hearing so many positive moves from our HR department.

160
00:15:49,515 --> 00:16:00,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this might have been for the Executive Council President, but I just might have forgotten, but any movement or any thoughts of

161
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:08,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one of our strong initiatives is the City Solicitor and the Assistant City Solicitor's position.

162
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:16,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we talked about maybe increasing that CAF to bring in candidates who will actually look at that as an appealing position?

163
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:23,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really low and from the people that I've talked to they won't even consider even applying in Bedford.

164
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So this might not be for

165
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:35,170
[SPEAKER_04]: this conversation, but I did want to put it on our to-do list if we can, whether it's a form of a motion.

166
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I didn't want to leave this out.

167
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:41,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's an important agenda piece that we focus on.

168
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,520
[SPEAKER_09]: you.

169
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, um, comment on that.

170
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be happy to, um, speak with the mayor and the chief of staff on any initiative we can have.

171
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:57,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are working on that class study, and we're hoping that that might identify some of the outliers.

172
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would include the solicitor and city solicitor.

173
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

174
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:01,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

175
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:21,121
[SPEAKER_09]: our city council budget recommendations, which we submitted March 20th to the administration.

176
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:30,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did receive a response from the mayor that we're looking at putting a paper before the council around the solicitor.

177
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:35,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I think that is probably going to be around the budget time and the personnel ordinance.

178
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,650
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did want to say that that was

179
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:40,635
[SPEAKER_09]: that we received our budget recommendation.

180
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:45,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did get the administration's response on that, um, and agree with Councilors Scarpelli.

181
00:17:45,997 --> 00:18:00,304
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a priority, and we're open for more details, but also just wanted to highlight that that was, um, a benefit of our new budget process that we did submit that recommendation, and I will go to Councilor Leming, and then I do have a question as well.

182
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:00,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor

183
00:18:01,977 --> 00:18:16,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So not to open this can of worms again, but I just like to kind of, well, I just like to, to understand, um, some, uh, some parts of the HR and, uh, back pay process.

184
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:22,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So when, so there, there are complaints about, um, employees receiving retroactive pay.

185
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:30,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you just, um, just talk about like the reasoning behind some of those delays, like, you know, I've heard outdated systems.

186
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And so sort of what happened.

187
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,108
[SPEAKER_05]: from your perspective there?

188
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:33,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

189
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:38,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, we do have integrated systems, so it did make it very difficult.

190
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,531
[SPEAKER_02]: What we tried to do is we ratified a contract.

191
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the retros we worked on first, just to keep everybody in the same system.

192
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want to jump one group before another if we'd ratified their contract first.

193
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:56,658
[SPEAKER_02]: It was painstaking, let me tell you.

194
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob was a big component of that.

195
00:18:58,698 --> 00:18:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually had to go through

196
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:06,884
[SPEAKER_02]: every single employee's payroll for every single year, we had an increase, line by line by line.

197
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:15,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And then see where they had a step increase or where they had a change or where they had a promotion, if they had overtime, because overtime was affected.

198
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like it's a simple thing.

199
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as easy as taking everybody's salary, adding 2%, 3%, 5%, whatever it was.

200
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: you really had to do individual employee by employee by employee.

201
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:34,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So once Bob was able to get that information, then we sent it to our payroll office.

202
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:41,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our treasure collector actually went through every line by line by line to make sure that it was

203
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,320
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the way it should be.

204
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it came to me for a spot check, and then it went to our chief of staff for a spot check.

205
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe Horton may have looked at some of them too.

206
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very painstaking.

207
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:07,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just for the fire department, I think it was over several hundred pages, because one employee might have four pages, and that's four pages of spreadsheets, because some of them have been here.

208
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And would a more updated software system be able to help with that?

209
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it sounds like you were doing everything by hand.

210
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:17,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was by hand.

211
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:19,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

212
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean by hand.

213
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:25,983
[SPEAKER_02]: It was spreadsheets, but we had to look at everything individually.

214
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:28,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was from two systems.

215
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:31,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we just have one system where everything was held.

216
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:35,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did take long, and I will admit that.

217
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,710
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't by design.

218
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by necessity.

219
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was afraid if we didn't pay somebody what they were supposed to get paid, then we would have to stop that process.

220
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to be as accurate as we could.

221
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:48,157
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

222
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

223
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:49,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

224
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

225
00:20:50,941 --> 00:21:07,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And my question is, jumping back to the classification and compensation study, I heard basically that a bunch of the classification piece of that is being implemented administratively over the next few months, so I think that's great.

226
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:12,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Always glad to hear something from the 80s or the 90s is being brought to today.

227
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:13,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's really good.

228
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:17,830
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more we do that, the less we'll have to do it in the future, right?

229
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:19,331
[SPEAKER_09]: In that groove.

230
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:28,611
[SPEAKER_09]: On the compensation side of the study, the council has had a lot of questions around compensation.

231
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:36,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli raised one about the solicitor's office, the law office, and whether the pay and the compensation is sufficient to bring on staff.

232
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:41,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And our experience with that over the last couple of years seems to be that it isn't.

233
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:54,074
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, but I think in general, the council is very interested in updating the personnel ordinance, something that we have talked about as getting the personnel ordinance back on Muni code.

234
00:21:54,114 --> 00:22:01,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't want to do that until we had worked through the process of, um, you know, making sure it was accurate and getting all the figures correct.

235
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's part of the compensation element of the study.

236
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:10,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just interested to know, um, what the timeline is on that part of the project.

237
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:13,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so right now we're in the interview stage.

238
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:23,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did have all our employees and department heads actually go through the actual job descriptions and then fill out a questionnaire about what they actually do compared to what's on that job description.

239
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:29,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of them are so old, it talks about typewriters and mimeograph machines, which we don't have anymore.

240
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now we are setting up individual interviews with the staff.

241
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: with the call-in center.

242
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hoping by June that we have something presented to us from the call-in center.

243
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:46,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna take about six more weeks or so, I would think.

244
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would include the compensation?

245
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:49,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all one package.

246
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

247
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:53,917
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I assume that we would be able to see it?

248
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.

249
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:59,559
[SPEAKER_09]: And then guessing that we'll talk about updating the personnel ordinance

250
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:03,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to help you with that too.

251
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:04,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that we have done some mini

252
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:14,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we're hiring new people, we always kind of look at that when we're bringing on new people.

253
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,251
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not that far off, which is a good thing.

254
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:17,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

255
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,292
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

256
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:18,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

257
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:23,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for us, you know, for me, I mean, there's some obvious positions where it seems to be off scope.

258
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere right where we should be right in the middle.

259
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: We never want to be at the top because, you know, we're not the biggest community, but we never want to be at the bottom either.

260
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:31,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

261
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's great.

262
00:23:32,397 --> 00:23:38,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for us, the other is just the logistical piece of people always ask us, so how much do these people get paid or what's the salary rate?

263
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to be able to start pointing them again.

264
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:41,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

265
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems- You can point them to my direction.

266
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I can let them know.

267
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I do do that.

268
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to do that.

269
00:23:46,932 --> 00:24:01,382
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seems at some point prior to this council being on the council and prior to the clerk and prior to having HR and prior to this mayor's administration, the personal ordinance was pulled off of the ordinances website.

270
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

271
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:06,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm guessing probably because it was updated so frequently, we now have

272
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:13,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say the most favorable explanation would be that it was being updated so frequently that we didn't want to pay the current page cost.

273
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a better contract with MuniCode now, so it's much easier to update the website.

274
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:20,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that was the reason, we'd solve that.

275
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:21,988
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go with that one.

276
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:22,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

277
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:28,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions on the HR side of things before we jump into health insurance and workers' compensation?

278
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scrively, do you have your hand raised?

279
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:37,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I think not.

280
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:40,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that may be- Yeah, sorry about that.

281
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:41,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It was up before, I apologize.

282
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:46,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought so, but Adam was doing his due diligence.

283
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:52,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, so that's the human resources piece of the budget.

284
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:52,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

285
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, you're welcome.

286
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Next is insurance.

287
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:01,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is budgeted fiscal 2024, 25, oh wow, 25,500,000.

288
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:14,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going up to $28,255,000 for fiscal 25.

289
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:27,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like the main driver of this is a $2.725 million increase in the health, dental, and life insurance budget.

290
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, that is the vast majority of this budget already.

291
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:37,083
[SPEAKER_09]: but also $120,000 in insurance premiums.

292
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:46,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So obviously, especially in any budget, this would be a significant increase, especially seeing it this year.

293
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a large chunk already of the $9 million.

294
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,822
[SPEAKER_09]: dollars that is available above last year's general fund budget.

295
00:25:56,862 --> 00:26:08,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you wanna talk about why that's happening, I understand we did talk about it a little bit with Bob, Director Dickinson last week, but I understand it's because the GIC rates are going up.

296
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,430
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you wanna get into that more.

297
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, I can talk about the increase.

298
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't talk about what was forecasted last year, because I wasn't here.

299
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:20,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have an average of 10% increase over the GIC rates.

300
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:25,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 10% for every single employee that's on that program.

301
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a big... I don't think we've had increases.

302
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:38,485
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past couple of years, and that's why usually you get small increases or you don't get any, and then one year you get hit with a bomb, and then it settles down a little.

303
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:47,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did have an average of 10% increase on the GIC side, as well as a 6 1⁄2 or 6.25% on the dental.

304
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, really, it's hard.

305
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:57,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Health insurance is fluid, so we don't know from day to day if we're gonna have 10 people that might come to us and say,

306
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,382
[SPEAKER_02]: my husband or my spouse or whatever just lost their job, we need your insurance.

307
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:03,965
[SPEAKER_02]: That sends us right over the top right there.

308
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:10,472
[SPEAKER_02]: We could in another month have 10 come in and say, my spouse just got a job, so now I don't need the insurance.

309
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:15,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to pinpoint an actual number because it's so fluid.

310
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:18,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we took what we spent,

311
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:23,965
[SPEAKER_02]: currently, and I believe these are from March 27 of 24 numbers.

312
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took what we spent till then, divided it by the eight and a half months to project what it's gonna cost for the next couple of months, and then increased every single line.

313
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through every single employee and added the 10% and the 6.25% wherever that fell.

314
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:44,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the actual number we came up with.

315
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:46,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

316
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:55,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is obvious, you know, rates are going up 10%, that'll go up 12%, so that's pretty much in line with this estimate.

317
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:03,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything other than the health insurance, the other insurance premiums, or any other thing you want to touch on?

318
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:06,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you use the same process to kind of arrive at those figures?

319
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:06,854
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

320
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,654
[SPEAKER_02]: We used the same process.

321
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:14,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same work as just with the workers' comp when we get there, too.

322
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:22,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fluid, so we have to do our best with estimating and projecting what we have in front of us and what we think might be coming in the future.

323
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:24,498
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we had 28 new employees.

324
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we're going to have another 10 or 15 or 20 this year.

325
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to almost plan that they're all going to want the insurance.

326
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:31,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

327
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:32,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

328
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:33,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Better that they don't.

329
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the money than they do.

330
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:36,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't.

331
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:36,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

332
00:28:36,646 --> 00:28:44,370
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I know the organization that I work for in my full time job, we we plan for everybody to take family insurance.

333
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

334
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:49,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are grateful if they don't look high and hope it goes low.

335
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:50,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

336
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:58,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you're, when you talk about budgeting for you're talking about like just the vacant positions, you're expecting that they would all be filled and everyone would take the biggest health insurance they could take.

337
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:00,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the safest way to plan it.

338
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:10,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could say it's an 80 20 split and we hope for that, but I'd rather have, you know, the number is really the number, the way we forecast insurance.

339
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:12,035
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best pinpointing we can do.

340
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:17,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions on the insurance budget or fiscal 25?

341
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:37,380
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing none, I'm just going to make one comment, which is that I want to note again, you know, hopefully we have that averaging out over years, but, you know, 10, 12%, 11% is more than 2.5%.

342
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:46,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we have the growth of costs like this, it eats up whatever the city is able to raise in the levy.

343
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:50,711
[SPEAKER_09]: We're spending, you know, we're so far through this budget,

344
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:56,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's been one department that has had a new expense and it may have been HR for $21,000 for training.

345
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything else has been a fixed cost growth, a union contract or health insurance costs or increased cost of office supplies, paper and ink, you know, and it's more than 2.5%.

346
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:16,360
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about what the city is able to do every year, we are doing more with less.

347
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Our costs are going up faster than our revenues are increasing.

348
00:30:20,746 --> 00:30:27,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And it means that we are at best maintaining what we have and not really adding very much.

349
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:39,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make that point, because as we go through this process and we see budget after budget after budget, all we can do is keep what we have, even though we hear from departments.

350
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's no slight against anyone.

351
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:41,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It's systemic.

352
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:43,412
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a systemic revenue shortage.

353
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:56,979
[SPEAKER_09]: every department needs one more person to take on a function, or a halftime person, or new programming, or wants to launch something that could help benefit our residents, and we can't implement it.

354
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:05,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this seems to be the big driver this year with the insurance, with $3 million of our $9 million going towards that.

355
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,626
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to raise that point.

356
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:18,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And I definitely understand that I just not that this department is any more valuable than others, but we're so compliance driven.

357
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:21,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that the training that we need is compliance driven.

358
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:21,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not

359
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:29,165
[SPEAKER_02]: the HR director saying, oh, I'd like to have, this is really all compliance and that we're just trying to make sure the city is complying with state and federal law.

360
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:32,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and that point wasn't the point I was, you know, I wasn't trying to spite you at all.

361
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want anybody out there listening that, you know, HR is getting what they're getting.

362
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,473
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually the minimum to get the compliance training that we're actually needing.

363
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:44,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the thing, you know, we're scraping for essentials.

364
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:46,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I get it.

365
00:31:49,969 --> 00:32:05,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it, this is just a question coming from a councilor going through his first budget process, but is it typical in other cities to have between 10 to 15% of the city's budget going towards health and or life insurance?

366
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is that it?

367
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:06,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest ticket items.

368
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That's typical, okay.

369
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

370
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

371
00:32:12,704 --> 00:32:17,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions on health insurance or I guess the insurance department, which is all of our different insurances?

372
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:33,242
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, to workers comp, bottom line, if I can flip the page, we budgeted fiscal 24, 675,000, budget for fiscal 25, 788,000.

373
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:34,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an increase of 17%.

374
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is driven, looking again, like by the actuals process that you just talked about that we did for health insurance.

375
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:46,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

376
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:47,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming with all the good news.

377
00:32:50,447 --> 00:33:00,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I can only talk about this year and what we're doing, but again, workers' comp is another piece that you can't pinpoint.

378
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:00,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fluid.

379
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,510
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we may have had more incidences than they had in the past.

380
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they were forecasting for last year, they were working on different numbers.

381
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:15,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Us forecasting for this coming fiscal year, we're working on actual numbers that we have now.

382
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:17,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So again,

383
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:24,691
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something where we could have all our workers' comp folks come back and say, we're healthy, we can come back to work.

384
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number goes down.

385
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:35,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the same instance, you could have some kind of, I don't even want to say the word, tragedy, where you have multiple employees now having to come back on workers' comp.

386
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:36,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just fluid.

387
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:37,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to pinpoint.

388
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:47,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some settlements that we had on the books for a very long time, which I'm happy to say we were able to settle and stop that bleeding right there.

389
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:50,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's ever fluid.

390
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to actually pinpoint.

391
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:54,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what we pay now.

392
00:33:54,767 --> 00:34:01,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what we're paying, as you'll see in the actuals as of March 27th, those actual numbers.

393
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:15,124
[SPEAKER_02]: We then have to take what's left for the upcoming months, because we have to assume that those people are still gonna be on, most of them will still be on for the next couple of weeks of workers' comp, and factor out what we're gonna come into for fiscal year 25.

394
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:17,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

395
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions on workers comp?

396
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpellilli?

397
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:27,293
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry, Councilor.

398
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my hand up and direct your answer to the question.

399
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

400
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:32,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

401
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:32,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

402
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:42,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one clarifying question, and maybe it might be, you may have kind of already answered it, but I just want to fully understand it.

403
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,961
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you're talking about

404
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:50,571
[SPEAKER_09]: a workers' comp claim, we're paying out of the workers' comp, and then you're saying when there's a settlement, it comes off.

405
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:57,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those settlements, you know, does that affect our insurance side of things at all?

406
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:58,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are those settlements paying insurance?

407
00:34:58,617 --> 00:34:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Our health insurance side of things?

408
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:03,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily health insurance, but like other insurance, like liability insurance.

409
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are we paying out any of those settlements?

410
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a cash payment, and is that coming?

411
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:08,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so what happens is

412
00:35:11,294 --> 00:35:14,475
[SPEAKER_02]: you obviously have a settlement and it would come out of those funds.

413
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:19,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be whatever, we try to see what we're gonna pay.

414
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:23,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some people that we own for life, because that's just how workers' comp works.

415
00:35:24,057 --> 00:35:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the folks you try to see, forecast how long they're gonna still be on our workers' comp, what we can come to a settlement to get them off.

416
00:35:31,578 --> 00:35:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in workers' comp, you do own some people until they pass actually, depending on the injury.

417
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to settle,

418
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,860
[SPEAKER_02]: those claims so that we're not continuing on that process over the next few years.

419
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,703
[SPEAKER_02]: We can kind of cut it here and then know that they're not going to be on.

420
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:50,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we can help with the forecasting.

421
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:52,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

422
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:55,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions?

423
00:35:58,348 --> 00:35:59,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

424
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:00,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even need your backup.

425
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:01,530
Thank you.

426
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:10,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

427
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:11,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me double check.

428
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:12,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

429
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:12,817
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

430
00:36:12,877 --> 00:36:14,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Next department is assessor.

431
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,600
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our assessor, chief assessor, Ted Costian here.

432
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:29,464
[SPEAKER_09]: As I noted, and I'll just read again, basically, I will quickly read the budget, and then we'd love to hear you expound on that, anything that I didn't cover.

433
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:33,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'd love to hear what you've been up to this year, what you're up to over the next year.

434
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:40,989
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a big change in your budget, once the budget's submitted at the end of the month, we may invite you back in June.

435
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:42,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll give it a start.

436
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,391
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the assessor's department.

437
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:46,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal 24 budget, $559,637.

438
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal 25 proposed, $586,609.84.

439
00:36:47,312 --> 00:36:47,892
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an increase of $26,972.84.

440
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:07,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of those increases are in the fixed cost growth field where we have step increases.

441
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:16,352
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have half of a position being funded through ARPA and half is gonna be coming on the general fund since ARPA ends December 31st.

442
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:26,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was also a decrease in the legal services line item from, I believe, 50,000 to 9,600, if I'm remembering correctly.

443
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that is what we have.

444
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:36,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go to our assessor if you want to expand on that, and then tell us what you've been up to as well.

445
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Councilors.

446
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me here just to touch on those two topics.

447
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:49,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Our part time employees were funded through the opera revenue replacement that ends, um, statutorily at the end of this calendar year.

448
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to backfill the rest of the fiscal year, we are proposing

449
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:54,571
[SPEAKER_00]: the city.

450
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:55,972
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on a $23,000 line.

451
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I am for a part time field assessor.

452
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:02,915
[SPEAKER_00]: That field assessor has helped us do, you know, bulk of about 3000.

453
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:11,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Property reviews in about 800 800 building permit reviews, which are the basis of our new growth, which is

454
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:23,666
[SPEAKER_00]: the line item you mentioned was the legal going down from 50,000 to 9,600.

455
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:31,949
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a really good job this year at the Appellate Tax Board getting our caseload way down, both valuation-wise and just number of cases.

456
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:47,296
[SPEAKER_00]: So I anticipate in the next fiscal year, given the number of abatements we got this fiscal year, not needing a specialized attorney or appraisal in front of the court system so that, you know,

457
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:48,016
[SPEAKER_00]: the city.

458
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:48,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

459
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:49,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Work went to saving the city money there.

460
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:59,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be addressed in a year if I feel that you know our abatement load is such that our appeals load is such that I'll need specialized attorneys at the appellate tax board.

461
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:01,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shifting

462
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:08,288
[SPEAKER_00]: We had building permits.

463
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:10,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a strong year in field reviews.

464
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:18,019
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate the council, you know, funding that, and we're using our staff, you know, wisely to really target areas of growth in the city.

465
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,700
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.

466
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,567
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that growth goes into funding teachers and government and police and fire, so we're

467
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:25,988
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be able to do that.

468
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:26,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

469
00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:26,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Cognizant of that.

470
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:30,351
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a exempt to taxable review where I looked at every exempt property in the city.

471
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:40,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh and you know, we have four parcels that are going to be coming on his new growth in addition to about 2.2 million in new growth for the city.

472
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:44,877
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously have to track all ownership changes.

473
00:39:44,978 --> 00:40:08,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that 900 arm's length sales, we record the new owners, but we also do an in-depth market analysis looking at different areas of the city on the residential side, but also a commercial and industrial review, looking at income and expense to derive income approach values, which we believe are more stable values when it comes to fair market value of property in the city.

474
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:13,130
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we did see a significant decrease in abatements.

475
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:25,097
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel like we've done a good job talking with taxpayers before values come out, particularly in our commercial class, which, going into the next evaluation year, may be a little up and down, just given the market.

476
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:34,062
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing a strong sales market continue, even though interest rates in the last 18 months have gone up, you know, 300 to 400 basis points.

477
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:37,164
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like 18 months ago we were at

478
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:39,785
[SPEAKER_00]: In the threes, 30-year mortgage.

479
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're in the sevens.

480
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:47,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would typically see a valuation decrease because people are going to buy homes for less.

481
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:53,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the supply is not there, so we're seeing pretty consistent valuations across our residential sales.

482
00:40:54,171 --> 00:41:02,314
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely keeping an eye on our retail, our office, our industrial to make sure we're aligned with the valuations in the fair market sales we're seeing there.

483
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:10,973
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, just administratively, we're processing over 1,000 motor vehicle excise abatements for our taxpayers.

484
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:12,553
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their money back when they sell a vehicle.

485
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:14,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria downstairs does a great job with that.

486
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:30,699
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, Rita downstairs, processing over 400 statutory exemptions for our low-income residents that own properties, our wounded veterans that own properties that are legally blind that own properties in the city, making sure we serve them.

487
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,021
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all of our condo conversions, which also are new growth.

488
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jared really did a good job.

489
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:36,203
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in here today.

490
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:40,387
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing a lot of great work capturing that and capturing new growth.

491
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,512
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll take any other questions now.

492
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:47,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

493
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:48,334
[SPEAKER_09]: One question.

494
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:56,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything not requested in this budget that you might see a need for in future budgets, either staffing, systems, programming?

495
00:41:57,827 --> 00:42:02,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as I mentioned, we are going to be going through a revaluation in fiscal year 26.

496
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:06,309
[SPEAKER_00]: The state mandates that we visit every property every 10 years.

497
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:10,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a really good job with our 3,500 property visits this year.

498
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,050
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of checking them off the list.

499
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:16,292
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 3,000 more to go going into the fiscal year 26 valuation.

500
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:20,533
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that line item for the field assessor is extremely important.

501
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:25,594
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just hope that council going forward in the next year would consider funding that sort of

502
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,575
[SPEAKER_00]: for a full year because, you know, this year's a half year.

503
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:35,597
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty crucial just with our new growth for the city in revenue wise and then just meeting that state mandate for the inspection cycle.

504
00:42:37,377 --> 00:42:37,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

505
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:42,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And that led right into my next question, which was, you know, how do we plan to keep the field assessor position on it?

506
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:45,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like that would be a request that we'd make in the next fiscal year budget.

507
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:53,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that that position alone, I can comfortably say is responsible for over half a million dollars in revenue for the city.

508
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:55,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be very important.

509
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:56,367
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep that on worth it.

510
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:57,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.

511
00:42:58,088 --> 00:42:59,228
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything you do, that's worth it.

512
00:42:59,749 --> 00:42:59,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

513
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

514
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:05,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and you know, as a council, um, you know, all we can do is cut, right?

515
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:15,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think you know, I don't think we've ever taken a cut vote, actually, since, um, but a cut motion, but I don't think we ever taken a cut vote since, uh,

516
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm glad that the building commissioners here to I sent an email and I've just read I never responded to either of you earlier in April, just talking about assessments and new growth and flips and kind of there's just this

517
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

518
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Parcels buildings and parcels being undervalued and, you know, selective valuation of parcels.

519
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,702
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we've gone through it a million times.

520
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:56,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't ask you to go through again.

521
00:43:56,902 --> 00:44:05,984
[SPEAKER_09]: The assessing process, state law, what you follow, you know, and all of the different things that go into making sure that all of the parcels in the city are at a fair value.

522
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,025
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did have one question from the response.

523
00:44:10,245 --> 00:44:13,107
[SPEAKER_09]: we did take that vote to go to the June 30th valuation.

524
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:16,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that added a little bit more for this fiscal year of new growth in the future.

525
00:44:16,669 --> 00:44:22,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that going to shorten the lag between when a property value is valued and when the tax bill is adjusted?

526
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:23,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, short answers.

527
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:27,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was the January 1st preceding the fiscal year.

528
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:30,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can catch it up until June 30th.

529
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:34,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of a six eliminates that additional six month lag, right?

530
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:36,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So the lag time between the

531
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:43,329
[SPEAKER_09]: when the market condition and when the value effects is gonna go from about a year to six months?

532
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:46,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, from 18 to 12.

533
00:44:46,129 --> 00:44:47,650
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 12, got it.

534
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

535
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:48,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

536
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

537
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,111
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're cutting six months off of it.

538
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:51,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

539
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:53,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

540
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And other than that, is there anything else,

541
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:19,606
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, your department's been doing or, you know, any, I guess my only question is, you know, some, something we, um, I'm trying to get a little bit more of a focus on, and we've been focusing on with some other departments and I'm guessing it might be a factor with your department is like our technology systems, you know, is there any, you know, do you feel like the systems that you have in place are, are effective?

542
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything that might need to be upgraded in the future?

543
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:24,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything, you know, as director Crowley talked about, um,

544
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:30,771
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, they're looking at some systems that might add some automation that might help the office, you know, operate more efficiently.

545
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything like that with the assessing office?

546
00:45:32,554 --> 00:45:33,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've ever asked you guys that before.

547
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:41,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely, obviously, I know it's only an 11% increase, but we do have software costs that are going up.

548
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:45,007
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty typical across the market right now.

549
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:51,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main software vision, Cama, is a robust computer-assisted mass appraisal software.

550
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:55,430
[SPEAKER_00]: We publish every single record card online every year.

551
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,731
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a personal property software.

552
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,172
[SPEAKER_00]: One area of improvement, I'd say, is we are using

553
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:06,663
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial intelligence to scan our deeds.

554
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,248
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just like,

555
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:16,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Us reading 950 deeds, we kind of are using a software that grabs all the important information into a file.

556
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,301
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then quickly look at it, kind of puts everything in order.

557
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:23,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're clicking on the back end, and it's kind of going into our Canvas system.

558
00:46:24,443 --> 00:46:27,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that makes sense, it's not like manual data entry.

559
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:32,685
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you see it on a screen, you agree with it, and you're clicking it, and it appears into the software.

560
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:35,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a huge time savings and a good use of software.

561
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:42,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, yeah, for those filling out their budget bingo cards, that's the first mention of AI this year.

562
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:44,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, there you go.

563
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:45,422
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.

564
00:46:45,923 --> 00:46:46,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

565
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great to hear.

566
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:48,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Really exciting.

567
00:46:48,344 --> 00:46:52,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And it sounds like you have the systems you need, but the costs go up every year.

568
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:54,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately.

569
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:54,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

570
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:55,547
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

571
00:46:56,028 --> 00:47:00,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions, further questions by members of the council for our assessor?

572
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:04,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

573
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:05,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you.

574
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:07,973
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll talk soon.

575
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

576
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:12,656
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

577
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:15,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Next, we have building departments.

578
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:18,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Commissioner van der Waal here.

579
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:25,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

580
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:25,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

581
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:27,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.

582
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:34,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to read through really quickly the bottom top line budget, and I'll talk a little bit about the change.

583
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:44,294
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd love to hear anything that you weren't able to include this year, but that you envision needing for the department in the future, and then hear about your narrative.

584
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So just giving a quick start, building department, fiscal 24 budgeted $1,085,531.

585
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal 25 proposed budget $1,030,354.29.

586
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:12,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a decrease, net decrease, mainly due to facilities budget, our utilities budgeting moving over to the facilities department and a decrease in overtime.

587
00:48:12,813 --> 00:48:27,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the fixed cost growth, we have salaries with the raises, union and non-union raises, eligibility for longevity and a $2,500 increase in the cost and supplies needed for our inspectors.

588
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:28,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that,

589
00:48:29,352 --> 00:48:36,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it over to you, feel free to share anything you want about the budget, and we'll hear about the great work of your department.

590
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:44,126
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, I'm entering my fourth month being here, and we have been busy as a department, as we often are.

591
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:52,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a big part of the budget certainly was transferring some of the facilities over to Paul and starting to sort out that bits and pieces.

592
00:48:53,614 --> 00:49:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the bigger areas of expense growth was the mail sorter machine, postage increases and things like that.

593
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We did sign a new three-year lease just a couple of months ago, so we're on a new machine, but we did acquire some capabilities for analytics to help us start looking at how mailing goes out and hopefully see some gains in budget savings down the road with that as a strong potential.

594
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:21,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this department is heavy personnel oriented.

595
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's primary personnel.

596
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really buy a lot or sell a lot or create anything.

597
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:29,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and most, almost all of that, except for me is on a union contract.

598
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:31,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a lot of it is locked in.

599
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to make changes in system.

600
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:38,904
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done some changes with our permitting system.

601
00:49:38,944 --> 00:49:40,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to capture some other things.

602
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to really develop something that's set.

603
00:49:44,629 --> 00:49:47,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Languid I'd say for the last four years, there's no expense.

604
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:47,951
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just,

605
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:56,133
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to bring things into the next century and starting to use some reporting capacities to look for things that we have never really stayed on top of in the past.

606
00:49:56,173 --> 00:50:02,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And we hope to implement some other types of inspection programs, such as periodics and things that should be done by law.

607
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:04,395
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not been able to do.

608
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,175
[SPEAKER_06]: They certainly are revenue gainers for us as well.

609
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:09,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are changes undergoing.

610
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:15,277
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, we just debuted the new portal, the public facing portal upgrade tonight.

611
00:50:15,977 --> 00:50:20,358
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go into more of an icon stage instead of writing and clicking on hyperlinks.

612
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be a nice thing and it'll come in multiple languages.

613
00:50:24,038 --> 00:50:27,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing all sorts of things with the tools we have.

614
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going good.

615
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,020
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also doing a lot of training.

616
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:43,042
[SPEAKER_06]: We have new energy codes coming on and new building codes coming on and a lot of stuff changing this second half of the year that's gonna force all of us to learn a lot more and to do some more enforcement.

617
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a busy time down there.

618
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:47,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to keep pushing forward.

619
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:50,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

620
00:50:51,806 --> 00:50:52,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

621
00:50:52,826 --> 00:51:00,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Just anything that wasn't requested in this year's budget that you may envision us needing for your department to request in future budgets?

622
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:05,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, certainly one of the things we're starting to grapple with more is public records requests.

623
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:09,877
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to see requests come from far across the country.

624
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:16,942
[SPEAKER_06]: We have them from Atlanta, we've had them from Oklahoma, their mortgage assessors and risk assessors and stuff from other places.

625
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:19,744
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanna do code reviews of documents we have.

626
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:23,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And they tend to just sort of send in a letter and give me everything.

627
00:51:24,187 --> 00:51:26,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything can be quite a lot to copy and send.

628
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:35,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So ultimately down the road, we'd like to start finding a way to get our records in the basement on a digital so that they're much more accessible and so people can do their own searching and stuff.

629
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:37,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We just did one, it took us eight hours to copy it.

630
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:46,682
[SPEAKER_06]: That's time I don't really have to give away routinely and to them, it's just a piece of paper, an email for us, it's a lot of work.

631
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:53,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the ability to put all of our records into the computer per se is a huge,

632
00:51:54,409 --> 00:52:00,776
[SPEAKER_06]: need for us down the road as these computerized requests continue to increase through the public records process.

633
00:52:01,657 --> 00:52:01,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

634
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:06,562
[SPEAKER_09]: So the digitization of the paper records is a future project.

635
00:52:06,862 --> 00:52:08,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now, we're not working on it.

636
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're not really working out.

637
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:18,980
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any great way to work on it, other than the occasional when we get a request for a file, we'll scan and copy it at that time and keep it.

638
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:32,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a huge room downstairs full of thousands of records, and it will take a concentrated effort to truly do it by someone focused on it and whose eyeballs don't burn out within a few hours.

639
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe AI.

640
00:52:34,462 --> 00:52:41,368
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to Councilor Leming, and then I see Councilor Scarpelli, and then I have a couple questions as well.

641
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

642
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:55,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know we've talked about this a little bit just over the phone, but I'd like to, one thing that I'm personally concerned with is just the amount of vacant buildings around Medford, vacant storefronts and whatnot.

643
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,122
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I've been looking into

644
00:53:00,242 --> 00:53:05,864
[SPEAKER_05]: that would allow the city to hopefully get a slightly better grasp on that problem.

645
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:26,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk a little bit about what extra technology or staff capacity the building commission would need in order to keep better track of the vacant buildings in the city and, you know, who owns them and what could possibly be done about that?

646
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Within our CitizenServe program, we have that capacity.

647
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the new portal set up that debuted tonight, we set an icon aside for that potential program to be built on.

648
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:43,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite frankly, we don't generally build out these modules or elements blindly.

649
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of borrow from other citizen service across the country.

650
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not hesitant to steal somebody else's program, bring it in and put our name on it and utilize it.

651
00:53:53,274 --> 00:54:03,679
[SPEAKER_06]: That combined with the fact that when I got here, we switched from once to twice a year update of our records from assessor into the system down to now we're weekly upgrades of data.

652
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're getting ownership data, we're developing this element that'll be able to track it.

653
00:54:08,722 --> 00:54:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest challenge to vacant will be identifying them.

654
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just field work and other things we're gonna have to work on.

655
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:19,567
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're ready to take that information in and keep track of it once we start

656
00:54:20,347 --> 00:54:23,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Developing how we're going to identify vacant properties and keep track of them.

657
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:34,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there capacity to have a public interface of the vacant of vacant properties and people who may be interested in reaching out to the owners of them for.

658
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:38,314
[SPEAKER_05]: business opportunities could get in contact with them directly.

659
00:54:38,394 --> 00:54:45,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, everything on CitizenServe is publicly accessible as a guest, as a user, as a contractor.

660
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,583
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, you know, that's one of the upsides to the public records then of it.

661
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:50,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all publicly facing.

662
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:57,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody can technically log in there and pull up all the information they need down to the permits, the documents that came in attached to them, et cetera, et cetera.

663
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,492
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to be a registered user.

664
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:03,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, just like the assessor, if you know an address you want to go dig in,

665
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:05,097
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pull it up pretty quickly.

666
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pull up the building card, you can pull up anything associated with it.

667
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:11,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, very publicly accessible if you want to do your homework.

668
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:13,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

669
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

670
00:55:19,028 --> 00:55:20,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

671
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:38,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my biggest thing, as we've talked over the years, is the staffing and what, you know, it seems to be that every time we have an initiative, it's always, well, we'll put the building department on it, or we'll put the health department on it.

672
00:55:38,078 --> 00:55:46,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know something that came about in conversations of a possibility, and, you know, especially looking into this year's budget,

673
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little concerning to me.

674
00:55:49,665 --> 00:56:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: If we, if we, the council did move forward with a registry for our landlords and renters, do we have the capacity for staffing in your department to oversee that?

675
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:10,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, a lot of that is what you call registration.

676
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:13,667
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sort of voluntary action by somebody that needs to register.

677
00:56:13,687 --> 00:56:20,611
[SPEAKER_06]: In the system, we are working on putting a short-term rental registration that's a little more clear and vacant properties in some of these.

678
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:25,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of the action may be taken by the actual applicant who needs to get into the system.

679
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:30,756
[SPEAKER_06]: The challenge more for us is the footwork or the chasing of them and how much of that we want to do it.

680
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully by improving some of our efficiencies using

681
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:43,425
[SPEAKER_06]: the computer programs we have that will give us a little bit of space to do the footwork, the chasing, what the live bodies in the field have to do.

682
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very early in the process.

683
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:51,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really come up with a great answer for you other than we'll do our best to try to accommodate it.

684
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll use our existing systems efficiencies to help us as much as we possibly can.

685
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,437
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the goal of it all.

686
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the walking the line on the answer, but I think that it's concerning to me that, and probably not to be answered today, but I probably will ask when we come to the final budget, when we look at the building department's budget and asking and realizing the responsibilities with this type of rollout.

687
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:26,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you kind of skimmed over it, but I don't want to disrespect you in any way, but

688
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:41,708
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a monumental, um, process to be, uh, policing, um, all these properties and making sure, especially when you're talking about the fines that you see that might be implemented.

689
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:50,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, because I think then that leaves us into some liabilities, some equity issues that, um, are we covering, are we doing our job?

690
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:52,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the staffing to do our job?

691
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, but like, again, I, I appreciate, um,

692
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:12,898
[SPEAKER_04]: the answer, but I will let you know that I'll probably ask a little bit more in-depth questioning with some more guidance as we move forward because it looks like it might be an initiative that this council might bring down the line.

693
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:16,379
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't have the staffing, I can't see it.

694
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in the meeting that we had that

695
00:58:21,782 --> 00:58:23,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Your department supported it.

696
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:24,044
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it was little.

697
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:34,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We were told by a correct me if I'm wrong, Council President, that it was stated at the meeting that the building department is actually that you actually initiated that.

698
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:40,576
[SPEAKER_04]: the process of looking into this and implementing this.

699
00:58:40,616 --> 00:58:51,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to get a little more depth later on to see how we can manage this with the staffing that we have.

700
00:58:52,344 --> 00:58:53,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I appreciate it.

701
00:58:53,965 --> 00:58:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

702
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:56,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

703
00:58:57,694 --> 00:59:24,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had some questions right along the lines of that, and I think more what was said at the meeting was A, that the rental licensing ordinance proposals in the city's comprehensive plan, and we had had some, I had had some very light discussions talking about how we do already have the short-term rental registry in the books in our zoning, and that's something that we already have, as we've recognized that that's an issue for our community to

704
00:59:25,456 --> 00:59:44,749
[SPEAKER_09]: know about, and it wasn't so much that the building department said, hey, we're initiating this process, it's in the comprehensive plan, and we had had some discussions about how there are ways that a rental registry could improve efficiency and functionality of some of the functions of the department, I think would be a fair characterization of what the discussions have been had.

705
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually had some questions along that line.

706
00:59:47,711 --> 01:00:13,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that we've been talking about with our planning department, and I've had some conversations with folks in your department in the past, prior commissioners, is seeing more of these LLCs and corporations kind of purchasing properties, and it's becoming a little bit more difficult to maybe get in touch with a real person or a live person if there's an issue on a property.

707
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:20,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, you know, I know 1 of the features of some of the more recent rental licensing ordinances have been saying.

708
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:36,932
[SPEAKER_09]: that either the owner needs to be within 60 miles or there needs to be a property management contact who lives within 60 miles of a property so that if there is an issue, a violation, or something else, that there's a person that the tenant or the city could get in contact with.

709
01:00:37,072 --> 01:00:39,933
[SPEAKER_09]: So just wanted to kind of go along those lines.

710
01:00:40,773 --> 01:00:46,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you seeing any sort of impact like where we have more of these kind of

711
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:49,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to necessarily call them shell companies.

712
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:57,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they're not all shell companies, but where you have corporate owners and it's tougher to get in touch with them to enforce code violations or building issues.

713
01:00:58,036 --> 01:01:04,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we certainly see it frequently enough LLCs and all kinds of variations of that.

714
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:17,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not uncommon to go onto the old corporate database on the secretary of state site and start looking for who the managing person is to find a name to contact because some of our enforcement activities requires to have a name, not just an entity.

715
01:01:18,089 --> 01:01:26,493
[SPEAKER_06]: We see it a lot of areas, and I'll be blunt, I've been here not quite 90 days, I don't know the full scope of how dramatic this could possibly be.

716
01:01:26,513 --> 01:01:42,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I've not been involved in terribly many conversations about it, and I certainly didn't stand up and volunteer to take this on, but we will do our part, and I'm gonna learn more as we go, and we'll try to see where staffing can help, where the permitting can help.

717
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:53,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, especially in the world of Airbnbs, it's an LLC world and you need to get condos, you got multiple LLCs and some are specific to the property, some are large companies.

718
01:01:53,572 --> 01:02:02,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we see it just in general permitting, nevermind ownership of properties and trusts and all types of entities seem to pop up to the stuff.

719
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all right.

720
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:06,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Along that line, you did mention the portal being

721
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:11,054
[SPEAKER_09]: adding more of the short-term rental registry element of it.

722
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:15,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you go into a little bit more of what that's going to look like with the new portal that launched tonight?

723
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:18,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Well right now it's set up as to be coming.

724
01:02:19,661 --> 01:02:25,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We sort of have zeroed in on there's a couple communities around that are doing similar things.

725
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:30,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So quite frankly we're going to borrow from them as much as we can and then modify for our needs.

726
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sort of have a basis where

727
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:37,996
[SPEAKER_06]: we're thinking of and as your end of it develops, we'll try to follow along and develop it to match it.

728
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're gonna borrow some other people's theories and processes and just try to not create it from dead zero so that we can get it up and running.

729
01:02:48,403 --> 01:02:54,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I learn more, we'll talk with our guys about how we can implement it and how we do it.

730
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:56,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know the full answer to that right now.

731
01:02:57,129 --> 01:02:58,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it, yeah.

732
01:02:58,310 --> 01:02:59,831
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we do have the short-term rental

733
01:03:00,247 --> 01:03:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: the existing zoning.

734
01:03:00,787 --> 01:03:14,913
[SPEAKER_09]: We are looking at the existing registration requirements in the existing zoning, something that I had spoken with Commissioner 40 about, uh, the prior building commissioner, and we are looking at as part of our zoning changes, seeing if we can require other communities have done this, and I think we should try the same required the

735
01:03:24,111 --> 01:03:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: using their platforms for short-term rentals versus the flip side of trying to say you have to register, but then having to literally go on Airbnb and say Medford and see who's registered in Medford.

736
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:46,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a ton of legwork there that we're hoping we can put into the zoning as other cities have to require that they actually report that information to us rather than asking us to try to figure it out.

737
01:03:46,995 --> 01:03:51,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that is, again, a huge piece of the puzzle here.

738
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:54,688
[SPEAKER_09]: just knowing where we have properties.

739
01:03:54,768 --> 01:04:03,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know that I've spoken with inspectors, and when there are complaints or reports of issues, that that's the main way that the department is going out and addressing things.

740
01:04:03,592 --> 01:04:07,514
[SPEAKER_06]: It commonly is to react to what's going on in the community.

741
01:04:07,654 --> 01:04:11,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Finding a way to get in front of it is always a challenge with the way they hide it.

742
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:16,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have a recent conversation, I think, with Airbnb, who has a government representative.

743
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:21,982
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of mixed reaction at this point, but they're supposed to do some work and get back to us.

744
01:04:22,982 --> 01:04:29,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And at least we've opened up a gate with them, and I'm sure we'll have to pursue that with Verbo and some of the other elements.

745
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:31,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the ones that are listed somewhere.

746
01:04:32,026 --> 01:04:38,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's certainly going to be a lot of work, and you're not going to escape having to go out and find them to some extent.

747
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:39,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

748
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:51,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully we can give you a city ordinance to point to that might help government relations when they go to legal, say that they have to give you the documentation.

749
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:58,957
[SPEAKER_09]: My only other questions are one about, you know, we always talk about it.

750
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:07,939
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of this council's priorities has, at least for all of my five budgets, has been additional code enforcement staff and just more folks in the department.

751
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:15,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be, I think it's kind of a, you know, I'm guessing you would say that would help you do more work.

752
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:17,383
[SPEAKER_09]: you had more people to do work.

753
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:23,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not gonna say it won't help me do more work, whether or not it's something we have a desperate need for at this time, I don't think so.

754
01:05:24,067 --> 01:05:25,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think there's other efficiencies.

755
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:34,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I'm really focusing on what we have, the tools we have, and making them more efficient and getting more out of what we have in front of us.

756
01:05:34,855 --> 01:05:40,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's room to be gained in those areas more so than just putting on staff for sake of staff.

757
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:42,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're at that point yet.

758
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:44,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They may argue with me,

759
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:48,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're okay for the moment.

760
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's focus on what we have in front of us and make that work better for us.

761
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:52,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

762
01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:52,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

763
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:54,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that perspective.

764
01:05:54,546 --> 01:06:00,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And the council has always felt that five folks maybe isn't enough folks, but maybe we're wrong.

765
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:10,753
[SPEAKER_09]: My last question is also the email I didn't respond to, but I appreciate you responding to my initial email around the valuations.

766
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I did just have one question.

767
01:06:12,754 --> 01:06:14,495
[SPEAKER_09]: You noted that, you know,

768
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Generally, we do the permit work value accompanied by a contract.

769
01:06:18,953 --> 01:06:21,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be at all possible and reasonable?

770
01:06:21,196 --> 01:06:26,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing those contracts are estimates before construction because they have to get a permit to start construction.

771
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:27,221
[SPEAKER_06]: They are.

772
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:29,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there are actual bids a lot of time.

773
01:06:29,343 --> 01:06:31,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a proposal from a contractor.

774
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:33,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Theoretically, you've signed up for that proposal.

775
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:34,728
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it should cost.

776
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:37,163
[SPEAKER_06]: But it always varies.

777
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:50,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be possible to or do you think there would even be value to asking the permit holder to return a final cost of the project compared to what the bid was?

778
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:52,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It's currently in there.

779
01:06:53,528 --> 01:06:59,013
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some value in it, but like anything, I can make it look like whatever you'd like it to look.

780
01:06:59,093 --> 01:07:01,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somebody else's paperwork that I have asked for.

781
01:07:01,575 --> 01:07:04,457
[SPEAKER_06]: We do theoretically ask for affidavits and stuff.

782
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,921
[SPEAKER_06]: It will add certainly work to us to chase those and challenge those.

783
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:13,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer to try to get them on the front end as best as we can.

784
01:07:14,762 --> 01:07:20,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We recently changed the system to paying for permits on the back end to paying for permits on the front end.

785
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:29,708
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to capture as much information and whatever else we have coming to us on the front end so we're not trying to chase it in the days when people are scattering or people are not available.

786
01:07:30,068 --> 01:07:31,229
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some value in it.

787
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:34,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's as much value in it as I would hope.

788
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:38,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, I guess we'll call it cook in the books, but you can tell me anything you want to tell me.

789
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:42,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's hard to argue with sometimes when a homeowner says, this is what I spend.

790
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:43,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a big part of it.

791
01:07:44,017 --> 01:07:51,462
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a giant disparity between what a homeowner views as the value of the work and how they present it versus what a contractor might present it as.

792
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:52,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We find homeowners,

793
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:57,943
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll buy a bunch of materials, and they don't think about including the cost themselves.

794
01:07:57,983 --> 01:07:59,384
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know how to include the cost.

795
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:03,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So what they get it for may be vastly different than they could go hire a contractor for.

796
01:08:03,428 --> 01:08:09,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a great disparity between contractors from that man in a truck to the full tilt professional company.

797
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:13,358
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably value in chasing the big projects that have

798
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:17,482
[SPEAKER_06]: AIA G703 documents behind them and stuff like that.

799
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to present paperwork to banks and appraisers.

800
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:24,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The smaller you get, the harder it gets to extract good information out of folks.

801
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,309
[SPEAKER_06]: They just plain don't know.

802
01:08:26,329 --> 01:08:28,631
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just sort of wandering into things.

803
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:40,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a threshold that you kind of have in the department saying, okay, this project's big enough or they require a certain documentation, so we're going to triple check at the end?

804
01:08:41,206 --> 01:08:50,549
[SPEAKER_06]: We really look for something signed with a professional contractor, something that is fully licensed, fully insured, has a professional contract associated.

805
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:56,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We assume at that level, they have the professional ability, accounting-wise, to track their costs in a reasonable manner.

806
01:08:57,771 --> 01:09:02,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But sole proprietors working out of their truck, they may not even know what the full cost of the job is.

807
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,953
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just trying to keep their checkbook one step ahead of their bills sometimes.

808
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:09,234
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a fair share of them out there right now.

809
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,939
[SPEAKER_06]: or they're doing work a little too cheap.

810
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

811
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:14,340
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

812
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions for the Building Commissioner, Councilor Leming?

813
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:18,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I see you?

814
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:21,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

815
01:09:21,422 --> 01:09:25,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of my questions were answered in the succeeding conversation.

816
01:09:25,822 --> 01:09:26,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

817
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:29,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions by members of the Council?

818
01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:33,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we do have one public comment.

819
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:35,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go to Eunice on Zoom.

820
01:09:35,365 --> 01:09:36,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice, name and address for the record, please.

821
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:39,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thanks very much.

822
01:09:40,368 --> 01:09:41,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Eunice brown green leaf have.

823
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:50,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting back to when the prior building commissioner presented his budget just about a year ago.

824
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:50,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I recall that.

825
01:09:54,013 --> 01:10:03,039
[SPEAKER_14]: He had stated that he had taken a look at our commercial building fees and discovered that they were quite low compared to our neighboring towns.

826
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:15,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was looking to bring them up to be more in line with our neighbors, given the development that was going to be coming through that would be

827
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:20,071
[SPEAKER_14]: bringing us some significant revenue that we need.

828
01:10:21,773 --> 01:10:27,897
[SPEAKER_14]: And he had stated, you know, he made this discussion back, you know, around about this time last year.

829
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:32,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It stated that he didn't want to do that until after the election.

830
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:39,545
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, people might think it was, you know, some sort of, you know, involvement with, you know, election

831
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:42,427
[SPEAKER_14]: results or whatever, I can't recall.

832
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:57,093
[SPEAKER_14]: But I followed up with him back in November, and I know that he was the interim commissioner at the time, by that time, and he had stated that it was

833
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:04,697
[SPEAKER_14]: something that he wanted to do, but it was an initiative that had to come from the City Council and the Mayor.

834
01:11:05,598 --> 01:11:13,804
[SPEAKER_14]: And given that, you know, revenue is talked about so much, I'm wondering where that stands at this point.

835
01:11:14,865 --> 01:11:22,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And my other question, also recalling what Mr. Forty said a year ago, was that there were

836
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:29,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Permits and fees that had not been collected by the building department in the past.

837
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:39,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was something that he was also trying to clean up when he was when the department was under his auspices as well.

838
01:11:40,502 --> 01:11:41,203
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know.

839
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:51,978
[SPEAKER_14]: get these fees and permits and so forth that had not been traditionally collected to get them collected again to bring us in revenue.

840
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering where all of that stands.

841
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

842
01:11:57,122 --> 01:11:58,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your comment.

843
01:11:58,603 --> 01:12:07,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I can mention on the fee schedule that the city council did have a resolution to review the fee schedule that went to the planning and permitting committee.

844
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:21,098
[SPEAKER_09]: we're looking right now for the specific timing, but we did request all of our city departments to take a look at that and send back, you know, take a look at their fees.

845
01:12:21,138 --> 01:12:22,719
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the last time they were adjusted?

846
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:35,063
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the, what are comparable fee charges in other communities and to report back to the council so that we can consider comprehensively updating fees across all of our city departments.

847
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is an initiative that we have undertaken.

848
01:12:40,413 --> 01:12:46,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I will go to Councilor Leming and then the Building Commissioner if you have any comments on the public comment.

849
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:53,616
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of this is in the fee schedule and appendix A, I also did.

850
01:12:54,276 --> 01:13:07,621
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a motion to request that legal advice as to whether the fee schedule could just be automatically updated in later years based on some index of inflation.

851
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:17,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we have a lot of legal questions coming out of council these days, so I was following up.

852
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:26,971
[SPEAKER_05]: with the city's legal advisors and trying to get a specific answer to that question.

853
01:13:26,991 --> 01:13:32,415
[SPEAKER_05]: The turnaround time is always a little bit long for those, but it is in the works.

854
01:13:33,796 --> 01:13:37,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever receive the request from this council?

855
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:37,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

856
01:13:37,839 --> 01:13:38,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

857
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I think last week I did.

858
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:46,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, 90 days you'd ask for a response, if I recall, and that is our plan to work towards that response in 90 days.

859
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:54,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And to your knowledge, were there fees that hadn't been collected in the past?

860
01:13:54,077 --> 01:13:54,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

861
01:13:56,646 --> 01:14:06,975
[SPEAKER_06]: When I got here, I immediately, I started working with citizens because I saw some consistencies as I explored what had been done and get a sense of how things were done.

862
01:14:07,015 --> 01:14:16,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And we generated some accounting reports that started to show that, yeah, a lot of permits had been applied for and maybe not fully paid for.

863
01:14:18,627 --> 01:14:22,011
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of contractors, especially small ones, have this perspective.

864
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: If I file it, I'm good.

865
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:25,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And that isn't the true answer.

866
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:33,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a driving force between why we, several weeks ago, converted from paying at the end of the process to paying when you apply for a permit.

867
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:43,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll prove our ability, and that's my experience and how I've done it before, prove our ability to collect the monies up front that are owed to us rather than chasing them on the tail end.

868
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:50,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We even have set up sort of a basic process for returning money in the rare cases that I think it might have to happen.

869
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, in my experience,

870
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very uncommon occasion where somebody had a reason to have their money's returned to them.

871
01:14:58,043 --> 01:15:03,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Occasionally things don't go ahead, but that was a main, a main early focus.

872
01:15:03,968 --> 01:15:09,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get the money up front and you don't get a permit or an inspection until you've paid.

873
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we're going to control something with that.

874
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:13,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And I expect to see some gains with that over the next couple of years.

875
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:24,120
[SPEAKER_05]: ballpark and it's totally fine if you don't have this number, but like how much revenue do you think was lost by those practices annually, if you can even provide?

876
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:32,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly in the thousands of dollars, maybe the multiples of thousands of dollars, enough to make it hurt.

877
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:37,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw some three and four and $5,000 permits that were issued that we never collected the fee on.

878
01:15:38,104 --> 01:15:39,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So they got hung up in a paperwork stage.

879
01:15:41,215 --> 01:15:42,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been collecting those.

880
01:15:42,777 --> 01:15:46,963
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a weekly list we go through and we're focusing on the big dollar ones.

881
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:50,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had one guy had 10 permits out and paid for one.

882
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a few, each one was worth five, 600 bucks a pop.

883
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:56,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, there's some dollars we're talking about in there that were.

884
01:15:57,338 --> 01:15:59,499
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going back after some of those as much as we can.

885
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:07,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I may not get all the $40 ones for the water heater that didn't get paid, but we're certainly gonna collect it from as many people as we can.

886
01:16:07,465 --> 01:16:19,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have the ability and citizen serve to basically red flag a file, a contract or an address that hasn't paid one and say, you don't get another permit until you pay for what you did the first time.

887
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:22,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So we expect to see some gain in that.

888
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:23,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

889
01:16:25,776 --> 01:16:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

890
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:27,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

891
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:28,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for being here.

892
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:41,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of my specific questions have been spoken to already, but just gosh, that last point really brings home the, you know, looking at efficiencies with what we're already working with before rolling out new systems.

893
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:47,570
[SPEAKER_12]: So really appreciate your attention to making sure we're not leaving money on the table by just tweaking that process.

894
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:53,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm making sure people are following up on paying their fair share for the permits that we already put out.

895
01:16:54,254 --> 01:16:56,575
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to congratulate you on the launch of the new public

896
01:16:57,171 --> 01:16:57,991
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks great.

897
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:02,412
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that that'll make that process easier for residents, developers, for your staff.

898
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:04,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's designed to be easier to use for folks.

899
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's designed to have multiple languages attached to it.

900
01:17:07,533 --> 01:17:13,274
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll help our staff, too, who we do deal with folks where there is a difficulty in the language barrier.

901
01:17:13,374 --> 01:17:16,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, we can point them in the right direction a little quicker and get them going on their own.

902
01:17:17,735 --> 01:17:18,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

903
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:23,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions or comments for the building department?

904
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:28,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you, Commissioner.

905
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:30,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you very much.

906
01:17:38,682 --> 01:17:43,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next department is our Department of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Director Francis Nwaje.

907
01:17:43,964 --> 01:17:48,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are joined by Director Nwaje today by Zoom.

908
01:17:48,906 --> 01:17:52,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And welcome, Director, thank you for being here.

909
01:17:53,971 --> 01:18:00,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all so much and once again my apologies for not being able to be with you in person.

910
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:03,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, totally understand.

911
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:08,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I will just go quickly over the budget here.

912
01:18:10,194 --> 01:18:13,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have our departmental budget for fiscal 24 was $107,996.

913
01:18:13,335 --> 01:18:15,115
[SPEAKER_09]: For fiscal 25, the proposed departmental budget is $117,552.53.

914
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:19,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And the change sheet shows that this is mainly the 2% change in the cost of living adjustment.

915
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:21,717
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the trainings for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

916
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:52,925
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is moving funding from the ARPA, currently funded by ARPA, for language access to the general fund budget, which I think is a great thing.

917
01:18:53,946 --> 01:19:01,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of the first things that President, former President Morell and I did in our first budget in the fiscal 2021 budget, I believe,

918
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what was the fiscal 20?

919
01:19:05,396 --> 01:19:09,557
[SPEAKER_09]: No, fiscal 2021 was requesting a line item for language access.

920
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:19,100
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are great, grateful to see that continue to be a priority here of the, uh, Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and of the administration.

921
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:27,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, um, if there's anything that I, uh, that I you'd like to further add on the summary of the budget, we'd love to hear it.

922
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:28,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and also

923
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,803
[SPEAKER_09]: share the work that's going on in your department.

924
01:19:31,884 --> 01:19:33,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also know you have a presentation.

925
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:36,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, sure.

926
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:36,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

927
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:40,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I'm just gonna follow the presentation for myself.

928
01:19:40,336 --> 01:19:43,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just to help me keep on track today.

929
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, right.

930
01:19:45,598 --> 01:20:04,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, you know, understanding the current fiscal climate that we're in, I'm really happy to see the language access allocation in the budget because it is essential and it brings us in compliance with not just state laws, but the federal laws.

931
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:12,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of times people forget that the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is actually guided by Title VII.

932
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:19,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a federal law, affirmative action, equal opportunity, and civil rights.

933
01:20:19,254 --> 01:20:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very thankful that that is in there.

934
01:20:22,857 --> 01:20:36,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And the ability to have funding for training allows me to interface and supplement with the Office of Human Resources, as Director Crowley had mentioned.

935
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,789
[SPEAKER_08]: because there are many different kinds of trainings.

936
01:20:38,809 --> 01:20:56,161
[SPEAKER_08]: There are the ongoing trainings, but we could also find ourselves in a situation where we have to provide mandated trainings, especially with changes to federal law that will govern how we move forward, starting with fiscal year 26.

937
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:56,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is...

938
01:21:00,953 --> 01:21:06,641
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty much the two things just to discuss in regards to the budget at this time.

939
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:14,231
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as overview and highlights of Qanon,

940
01:21:15,027 --> 01:21:21,313
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, there are three commissions that currently sit under the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

941
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:32,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Charter Study Commission, Commission for Persons with Disabilities and Human Rights Commission, the latter two guided by the Municipal Ordinance.

942
01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:46,137
[SPEAKER_08]: very proud to say that the Human Rights Commission in the month of January partnered with the West Medford Community Center to really support the Martin Luther King Jr.

943
01:21:46,678 --> 01:21:53,705
[SPEAKER_08]: annual breakfast, as well as in February, hosted the first annual Lunar New Year.

944
01:21:54,666 --> 01:22:16,381
[SPEAKER_08]: given that Medford has a high percentage of Asian heritage community members, I think that this was truly a wonderful opportunity to create that much-needed space for members of your community that you may not necessarily see on a day-to-day basis.

945
01:22:17,502 --> 01:22:23,946
[SPEAKER_08]: The event was hosted at the library and I did receive numbers from the Director Kerr

946
01:22:24,726 --> 01:22:30,369
[SPEAKER_08]: of the library and they were in the 500s for the Lunar New Year's celebration.

947
01:22:30,469 --> 01:22:34,751
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what the count showed at one time.

948
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:46,857
[SPEAKER_08]: The Commission for Persons with Disabilities also stood out in October, Disability Awareness Month, and hosted a disability fair.

949
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:52,539
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the first one of its kind and really what this did was it brought together

950
01:22:53,820 --> 01:23:00,945
[SPEAKER_08]: vendors of all different avenues that cater to individuals within the disability community.

951
01:23:01,486 --> 01:23:10,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also heard from some speakers, either family members or advocates for the disability community.

952
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the first event that was fully language

953
01:23:14,295 --> 01:23:37,002
[SPEAKER_08]: accessible as we had three ASL interpreters on site as a municipal entity, it is important that we move towards a pathway where ASL interpretation is not an add-on, but a part of our communication strategy.

954
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:56,261
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to that, ODEI worked across many departments, the police department and the fire department, sitting in on interviews to bring on new law enforcement officers and new firefighters.

955
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:00,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are referred to as the oral board interviews.

956
01:24:01,545 --> 01:24:05,588
[SPEAKER_08]: They're formal in structure, but they are not the civil service aspect.

957
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:10,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was also done in partnership with the Office of Human Resources.

958
01:24:11,533 --> 01:24:20,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Continue to work closely with the Medford Public School Department, as well as community partners across the city.

959
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: A big focus behind the scenes was also monitoring some of the legal changes.

960
01:24:29,725 --> 01:24:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act received a major update in June 2023, and as of June 18th of this year,

961
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:45,680
[SPEAKER_08]: the final act is effective.

962
01:24:46,280 --> 01:25:06,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So what this means is that ODEI has the responsibility of ensuring that all practices across the city, be it city employment, school department, and believe it or not, union contracts are worded in a manner

963
01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:10,447
[SPEAKER_08]: that is in alignment with these federal laws.

964
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:21,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not that ODEI is negotiating contracts, but in the event that a contract creates a disparity within the federal law,

965
01:25:22,734 --> 01:25:30,060
[SPEAKER_08]: and there is an incident as a result, the municipality would bear the burden of the blame.

966
01:25:31,141 --> 01:25:38,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do follow a lot of the EEOC briefings and I share that with the administration.

967
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:46,373
[SPEAKER_08]: They have been supportive in ensuring that I have the ability to attend the trainings on the federal platform.

968
01:25:49,049 --> 01:25:53,473
[SPEAKER_08]: The ADA in July will be celebrating 34 years.

969
01:25:54,433 --> 01:26:01,659
[SPEAKER_08]: That is important because another aspect of ODEI is being the city's ADA coordinator.

970
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:12,727
[SPEAKER_08]: This means responding to issues highlighted by constituents, be it lack of accessible parking, curb cuts,

971
01:26:14,728 --> 01:26:28,119
[SPEAKER_08]: accessible parking that are in awkward places, accessible parking that are the wrong widths, accessible parking that don't have the grading for vans.

972
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's been instrumental working with Department of Public Works, our engineering department, especially traffic engineer, Todd Blake,

973
01:26:41,275 --> 01:27:04,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I have my boots on ground days and my bright orange jacket that we wear and we go out and we measure and we propose suggestions for much needed changes so that our roads and sidewalks can be used by all people.

974
01:27:05,313 --> 01:27:16,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Also working with the facilities director in terms of bringing us up to code in terms of our wayfinding signage.

975
01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:20,369
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, our city hall building is a historical building.

976
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:34,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And while many of the signage that we have in that building has that historical value and the memorabilia value, they are actually out of code and out of compliance.

977
01:27:35,296 --> 01:27:42,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We did attempt to apply for a mass office of disability ADA improvement grant last year.

978
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:56,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we were not one of the award recipients, but that does not prevent us from moving forward in continuing to apply for those sorts of grants.

979
01:27:56,664 --> 01:28:02,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to repeat much of what Director Crowley mentioned.

980
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:19,914
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of the work is done behind the scenes in terms of creating that equitable systems process change that is needed within a city such as ours.

981
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:22,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, diversity is about

982
01:28:23,217 --> 01:28:36,442
[SPEAKER_08]: the people and the perspectives in the room, the equity is the policy and the practice, and the inclusion is finding a way to ensure that all of the voices and visions can come to light.

983
01:28:37,282 --> 01:28:44,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the things to look forward to, well some of the things that passed are Black History Month,

984
01:28:44,625 --> 01:29:05,113
[SPEAKER_08]: and then to look forward to the big Pride Month events, which are really being co-hosted by our GSA groups at the middle school, the high school, and the chameleon groups at the library, as well as our Juneteenth event as well.

985
01:29:05,393 --> 01:29:07,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm open for questions at this time.

986
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:12,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Director Nwaje.

987
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions from members of the Council?

988
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

989
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:20,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Barras.

990
01:29:20,456 --> 01:29:23,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Director Nwaje, for being with us tonight.

991
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:26,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any specific questions about your budget.

992
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,963
[SPEAKER_12]: It is, you know, predictably, admirably straightforward.

993
01:29:30,423 --> 01:29:39,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it really drives home the point, your department in particular, you know, how much this city is doing with the resources that we currently have available.

994
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:40,631
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, whenever I

995
01:29:41,124 --> 01:29:44,506
[SPEAKER_12]: hear about the work that your one-person department is doing.

996
01:29:44,526 --> 01:29:47,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty amazed at the breadth of your scope.

997
01:29:47,949 --> 01:30:03,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's everything from helping community members, liaisons, and representatives plan community events to making sure that City Hall is ADA accessible to trainings, working with multiple commissions, everything in between.

998
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:09,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Budget season is a great time to recap the work of our

999
01:30:10,287 --> 01:30:19,729
[SPEAKER_12]: city departments and hearing the update from the DEI department to me just always brings home how much our city staff are carrying with limited resources.

1000
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:20,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for your work.

1001
01:30:20,929 --> 01:30:37,792
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly as we get through this tough fiscal spot that we've been in these past few years for the next couple of years, I'm certainly looking forward to seeing how this department might further expand and blossom as the city gains in resources and latitude overall.

1002
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:38,812
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much for your work.

1003
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1004
01:30:43,573 --> 01:30:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Saint.

1005
01:30:47,718 --> 01:30:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Biz.

1006
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:57,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And to follow up with Vice President Collins was saying, I just want to just echo what was just said.

1007
01:30:57,966 --> 01:31:04,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what you're doing as a one man team, one person team, I think is just phenomenal.

1008
01:31:04,632 --> 01:31:09,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to highlight something that we've heard yesterday and again today.

1009
01:31:11,437 --> 01:31:32,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And the initiatives that we're seeing that your office and recreation and what we're trying to do with disability acts and what we're trying to do for programming for disabilities and and our adaptive programming, I think is as a super surprise and excitement.

1010
01:31:32,592 --> 01:31:34,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to share that.

1011
01:31:34,173 --> 01:31:35,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for all your hard work.

1012
01:31:38,735 --> 01:31:39,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1013
01:31:39,976 --> 01:31:41,157
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to Councilor Tseng.

1014
01:31:42,658 --> 01:31:47,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the kind words from the previous two councilors are super well-deserved.

1015
01:31:48,543 --> 01:31:56,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I always love the heat praise on you and the work that you and our commissions that work with you do.

1016
01:31:57,070 --> 01:32:06,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, I think, very underrated work, but it's work that raises the standards of living and working in the city of Bedford.

1017
01:32:07,459 --> 01:32:15,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there's been quite a lot of, you know, there's always competition for resources, and we always have a finite amount of resources.

1018
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've done very well to find funds.

1019
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:26,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering, you know, have there been any moments in the last year where you've found, you know,

1020
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:34,907
[SPEAKER_07]: where you might have wanted to sponsor an event but you weren't able to and will the line item increase in the events help you?

1021
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think this increase is enough to help you fund the events that are sitting should be sponsoring?

1022
01:32:45,694 --> 01:32:48,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So the line, thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1023
01:32:48,775 --> 01:32:57,117
[SPEAKER_08]: The line item increase in the event is a starting point because previously, as you can see, it was $500.

1024
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:14,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Fortunately, ARPA funding and MVP funding, the Municipal Vulnerability Grant through the Office of Prevention and Outreach has been used to supplement the events thus far.

1025
01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:24,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I can continue to utilize that until the end of December of this year.

1026
01:33:25,118 --> 01:33:33,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And then next year, I'll be able to start tapping into what is currently budgeted in the

1027
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,285
[SPEAKER_08]: proposed for FY25.

1028
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:45,675
[SPEAKER_08]: The reality is, as we move forward, it's important to understand that DEI is very fluid.

1029
01:33:46,877 --> 01:33:51,902
[SPEAKER_08]: The cost of what is valuable to each person changes.

1030
01:33:52,663 --> 01:33:58,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's difficult to say, oh, X amount is going to be sufficient.

1031
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:05,255
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at your community, when you look at your community demographics two years ago,

1032
01:34:05,808 --> 01:34:19,041
[SPEAKER_08]: in comparison to today, you will see changes in your demographics and you have to respond to those changes if you really are going to create a community of belonging.

1033
01:34:19,682 --> 01:34:23,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we all know, just the cost of doing business, right?

1034
01:34:23,846 --> 01:34:28,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So folks who would ordinarily come out and set up

1035
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:31,492
[SPEAKER_08]: now want a minimum guarantee.

1036
01:34:31,873 --> 01:34:35,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the sorts of things to keep in mind.

1037
01:34:35,655 --> 01:34:39,097
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, as we say in DEI, we don't stop.

1038
01:34:39,157 --> 01:34:40,798
[SPEAKER_08]: We just keep going forward.

1039
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1040
01:34:49,302 --> 01:34:53,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And just for myself, unless there are further comments or questions by the council.

1041
01:34:53,244 --> 01:34:55,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any.

1042
01:34:55,466 --> 01:34:57,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to also add my thanks.

1043
01:34:57,427 --> 01:34:57,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I know

1044
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, you've heard me say it about other departments tonight.

1045
01:35:01,602 --> 01:35:04,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking tonight about, uh, diversity, equity and inclusion department.

1046
01:35:05,405 --> 01:35:06,746
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a one person show.

1047
01:35:06,766 --> 01:35:14,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, although also supported, um, you know, by commissioners and volunteers, but one full time staff person doing so much for our community.

1048
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:23,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and you know, we've heard, uh, from other departments about, um, how you've been engaged with them, HR.

1049
01:35:25,457 --> 01:35:26,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the clerk's office.

1050
01:35:26,478 --> 01:35:35,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I know many other offices where your presence has been highly and deeply valued and your support has been irreplaceable.

1051
01:35:35,864 --> 01:35:41,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to highlight that you've already spoken to it as this budget being a starting point.

1052
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:42,548
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to just

1053
01:35:43,015 --> 01:35:57,285
[SPEAKER_09]: give you the chance, as I've asked of all the other departments, is there anything that wasn't able to be requested in this budget that you really see as being something that your department needs and that we can hopefully fund in future budgets?

1054
01:35:59,235 --> 01:36:15,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it would be fair and honest to say that, you know, I would hope that the city would think about moving forward to expanding this office in terms of the capacity of having another person.

1055
01:36:16,912 --> 01:36:45,100
[SPEAKER_08]: as a city of 65,000, I think we're at now, the scope of work that is required, be it the ADA, so think the human side of the ADA, that's the employees and their needs, in comparison to the physical aspect of the ADA, that's accessibility, that's looking at our curb cuts, looking at our city buildings,

1056
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:54,508
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to require more work, more boots on the ground, more interaction.

1057
01:36:54,988 --> 01:36:59,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot respond to some of these things without seeing them.

1058
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:10,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't respond to somebody that says the accessible button doesn't work without actually going on location and finding that button.

1059
01:37:12,037 --> 01:37:15,925
[SPEAKER_08]: and taking a picture and making sure it gets to the right place.

1060
01:37:16,487 --> 01:37:21,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And whilst you do that, right, there's still work that has to be done.

1061
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:32,183
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still work that's moving and there are many changes that are happening on the federal level that govern Title VII.

1062
01:37:32,963 --> 01:37:47,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to become critical that we create an avenue where focus can be given so that we don't find ourselves in a situation where we're trying to catch up, but the train has already left the station.

1063
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:59,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the answer, and I definitely share the sentiments that you shared and hope to see in the future.

1064
01:37:59,337 --> 01:38:06,802
[SPEAKER_09]: The city invest and have the capacity to invest more in the D. E. I. Department and all the great work that you do.

1065
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:11,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any further questions by members of the council for director?

1066
01:38:11,265 --> 01:38:16,248
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I say seeing none and seeing no

1067
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:17,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1068
01:38:17,312 --> 01:38:17,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1069
01:38:17,732 --> 01:38:18,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to all the hands raised by the public.

1070
01:38:18,693 --> 01:38:23,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for your time tonight and for the great work that you're doing and for presenting the budget.

1071
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:31,960
[SPEAKER_09]: If there are any major changes after the final budget is the mayor's final proposal is sent to us at the end of May.

1072
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:32,900
[SPEAKER_09]: We may have you back.

1073
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,282
[SPEAKER_09]: But if not best of luck in the next fiscal year.

1074
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:38,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1075
01:38:39,203 --> 01:38:39,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1076
01:38:41,485 --> 01:38:41,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Judy.

1077
01:38:44,781 --> 01:38:51,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you should change your department name to Collector Treasurer, and then you could be in the C instead of the T. Oh, is that why we do them alphabetical?

1078
01:38:51,185 --> 01:38:52,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We're alphabetical.

1079
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:58,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I put HR first because they had Health Insurance and Workers' Comp, and it's, you know, what, you know, $28 million.

1080
01:38:59,331 --> 01:39:02,873
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, other than that, we went alphabetical, so.

1081
01:39:03,054 --> 01:39:04,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1082
01:39:04,435 --> 01:39:06,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, Nina, I'm going to do Collector.

1083
01:39:09,244 --> 01:39:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: great.

1084
01:39:09,764 --> 01:39:10,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make note.

1085
01:39:10,865 --> 01:39:14,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just as we've done, you've watched us do it a few times tonight.

1086
01:39:15,306 --> 01:39:18,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to go quickly through the budget.

1087
01:39:18,628 --> 01:39:22,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're free to share anything that you want to add to what I said.

1088
01:39:23,150 --> 01:39:27,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd love to hear your narrative of what was done over the previous year, some goals for the next year.

1089
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:38,516
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as I just noted, we'd also love to hear anything that you really see as being essential for your office that we weren't able to request this year, but that you hope will be included in future budgets.

1090
01:39:38,716 --> 01:39:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So

1091
01:39:39,505 --> 01:39:40,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go quickly and start.

1092
01:39:40,866 --> 01:39:41,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal 24 budgeted amount was $719,358.

1093
01:39:41,847 --> 01:39:42,788
[SPEAKER_09]: The fiscal 25 proposed budget $755,193.69.

1094
01:39:42,828 --> 01:39:45,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And the changes there are in our fixed cost growth.

1095
01:39:46,090 --> 01:39:47,211
[SPEAKER_09]: There is contractual increases, 2% non-union.

1096
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:48,392
[SPEAKER_09]: There is the part-time salaries.

1097
01:40:05,342 --> 01:40:12,426
[SPEAKER_09]: and then there is increased cost in payroll, data processing services, online processing, and there's a postage rate increase.

1098
01:40:12,566 --> 01:40:16,307
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is what composes the change.

1099
01:40:16,688 --> 01:40:17,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I'll turn it over to you.

1100
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:31,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the postage increase is going way up because we had, I think, two increases this year, and I think, well, in the previous fiscal year, and I think that I've heard that the rates are going up in

1101
01:40:32,102 --> 01:40:35,165
[SPEAKER_03]: July again, and they could go up any other time.

1102
01:40:35,405 --> 01:40:42,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do need to get all our bills out for real estate, personal property, and excise bills.

1103
01:40:42,831 --> 01:40:44,272
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we use our postage for.

1104
01:40:44,332 --> 01:40:47,855
[SPEAKER_03]: The regular city mail goes out through the building department postage.

1105
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the increased costs for

1106
01:40:56,385 --> 01:41:02,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything goes up, we have the payroll, we have the online services, and we have our software.

1107
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:06,812
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all incorporated in the one account.

1108
01:41:09,394 --> 01:41:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.

1109
01:41:12,663 --> 01:41:17,706
[SPEAKER_03]: our progress for going forward is to recollect all the money in the city.

1110
01:41:18,567 --> 01:41:22,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just make sure that we get it all posted so that it goes right to the finance.

1111
01:41:22,549 --> 01:41:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: They can see it.

1112
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:28,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else that wants to know what's in their accounts, they can have it updated.

1113
01:41:30,114 --> 01:41:32,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it on a daily basis to post all our receipts.

1114
01:41:32,976 --> 01:41:34,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pretty much up to date.

1115
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Today was the due date.

1116
01:41:35,838 --> 01:41:36,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been very

1117
01:41:36,943 --> 01:41:42,726
[SPEAKER_03]: busy because we have water bills due Thursday, we have real estate due today, and we have excise bills.

1118
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:45,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just sent out demands and warrants on excise bills.

1119
01:41:45,528 --> 01:41:47,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very busy in the office right now.

1120
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:49,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a lot of foot traffic that comes in.

1121
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:55,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do collect all the cash for the parking department, too.

1122
01:41:56,974 --> 01:41:57,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1123
01:41:58,855 --> 01:42:03,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at the window a few weeks ago because I misplaced my excise tax bill.

1124
01:42:04,682 --> 01:42:11,775
[SPEAKER_09]: easily a new one was printed and I paid my excise tax, so no demand or warrant on me this time.

1125
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:16,564
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of them that were sent out.

1126
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:27,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, just if there's anything, um, goals wise, some, some of any improvements made over the last year, any improvements to make over the next year?

1127
01:42:27,322 --> 01:42:32,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get my certification for the, um, through the Mass Collector Treasurer Association for the collector.

1128
01:42:32,444 --> 01:42:36,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I am certified for treasurer and collector through the MCTA.

1129
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the assistant treasurer collector was, um,

1130
01:42:42,443 --> 01:42:44,024
[SPEAKER_03]: certified as an assistant collector.

1131
01:42:44,124 --> 01:42:45,485
[SPEAKER_03]: She took the test and she passed.

1132
01:42:45,625 --> 01:42:50,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big accomplishment for us that happened last year.

1133
01:42:50,827 --> 01:42:52,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in September, we found out.

1134
01:42:54,689 --> 01:43:00,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're trying to keep up with all our payments, making sure our bills go out on time, everything's collected and everything's posted.

1135
01:43:00,772 --> 01:43:08,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Our tax titles we've been collecting, we've worked with Brown Legal and everything seems to be working out good with them.

1136
01:43:08,436 --> 01:43:11,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We've collected through April,

1137
01:43:12,465 --> 01:43:16,726
[SPEAKER_03]: $515,404 so far this year to keep up.

1138
01:43:16,786 --> 01:43:19,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're on schedule.

1139
01:43:19,547 --> 01:43:30,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I have schedules on everything when I do my tax takings and everything so that we're gonna get them done by the end of December every year, instead of waiting until we have, so we have two years out the following fiscal year.

1140
01:43:31,289 --> 01:43:34,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting them all done on a timely basis.

1141
01:43:35,190 --> 01:43:37,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1142
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:39,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions by members of the council

1143
01:43:43,069 --> 01:43:44,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two for you.

1144
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:49,415
[SPEAKER_09]: One might be easy, one might not have to come back or send an email, and no worries about that.

1145
01:43:50,536 --> 01:43:54,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the first one, I noticed we're going from four full-time clerks to three and a half.

1146
01:43:55,681 --> 01:43:57,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like the cost is staying about the same, though.

1147
01:43:58,484 --> 01:44:00,486
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could just speak a little bit more to that change.

1148
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:08,926
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost is staying about the same because there were contractual agreements for the clerical union that theirs went back years.

1149
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:20,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a clerk that retired last year and I've been waiting and I was granted the half clerk, part-time clerk in the budget.

1150
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:24,933
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still short, we're working on getting a payroll clerk.

1151
01:44:25,033 --> 01:44:27,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a payroll clerk right now.

1152
01:44:28,533 --> 01:44:33,899
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the budget, but we have, the assistant right now is doing all the payroll right now.

1153
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

1154
01:44:35,641 --> 01:44:37,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's advertised, we're just waiting.

1155
01:44:37,723 --> 01:44:38,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally understood.

1156
01:44:39,846 --> 01:44:47,655
[SPEAKER_09]: My only other question, and again, feel free to get back to me or maybe you might have to, this may be a bigger question than just,

1157
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:51,161
[SPEAKER_09]: the treasure collector, maybe it's for finance in general.

1158
01:44:51,841 --> 01:44:59,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been some court cases lately on what's called or has been branded as equity theft.

1159
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:07,551
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's when we're doing collection, if someone is a delinquent on their taxes, eventually the city will take the property and

1160
01:45:08,109 --> 01:45:10,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they're taking the equity in the property.

1161
01:45:10,072 --> 01:45:11,414
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just the tax amount.

1162
01:45:11,454 --> 01:45:15,260
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also the equity and the Supreme Court ruled that that's not legal.

1163
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And now the state courts are starting to rule that that's not legal.

1164
01:45:18,424 --> 01:45:23,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just wondering if that had any impact on your office's operations or if you're looking at that.

1165
01:45:23,394 --> 01:45:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we are looking at it.

1166
01:45:24,595 --> 01:45:28,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Our attorneys are looking at it and we haven't really taking any properties.

1167
01:45:28,938 --> 01:45:33,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the attorneys do is they try to work with the homeowner so that they don't have to take them.

1168
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want the people's properties.

1169
01:45:35,544 --> 01:45:37,545
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure they pay their taxes.

1170
01:45:37,625 --> 01:45:46,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So they either, you know, help them try to get a loan or to have somebody secure to sell the property so that they can get the equity in it because we don't want it.

1171
01:45:46,552 --> 01:45:51,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, they are very up on all these laws and things that we don't want that.

1172
01:45:51,656 --> 01:45:52,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are aware of it.

1173
01:45:53,657 --> 01:45:59,681
[SPEAKER_03]: at the school, the treasurer collector school, they were talking about that last August too, you know, we have to be careful about that.

1174
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: But we haven't taken any properties we put what we when we when I say we put a taking on, we just record a tax taking on the property doesn't mean that we own it, it just means that we have a right to collect our money before, you know,

1175
01:46:15,475 --> 01:46:17,256
[SPEAKER_03]: before they sell the property or anything happens.

1176
01:46:17,336 --> 01:46:17,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it is.

1177
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:23,898
[SPEAKER_03]: If you foreclose on the property and take it that way, then you have to worry about that.

1178
01:46:23,938 --> 01:46:26,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not in business to do that.

1179
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:27,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We try not to do that.

1180
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1181
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1182
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:31,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have one question.

1183
01:46:31,741 --> 01:46:34,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that an email went out about fees?

1184
01:46:34,943 --> 01:46:35,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1185
01:46:35,303 --> 01:46:36,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that go to everyone?

1186
01:46:36,383 --> 01:46:37,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't remember getting one.

1187
01:46:38,044 --> 01:46:40,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a question for Vice President Collins or the clerk.

1188
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:48,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I would check because I know it went up but I didn't check.

1189
01:46:52,520 --> 01:47:01,985
[SPEAKER_09]: the Planning and Permitting Committee is considering the fee schedule and a communication was supposed to go out to departments to request them to let us know about their fees so that we can look at updating them.

1190
01:47:02,506 --> 01:47:03,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll follow up on that.

1191
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:04,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, okay.

1192
01:47:04,246 --> 01:47:06,168
[SPEAKER_09]: The clerk and Vice President Collins will follow up.

1193
01:47:06,188 --> 01:47:11,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because we do have fees for like demand fees and things and we are on the low side.

1194
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:17,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to the assessor and he asked how much we charge and it's $10, but by the state, you can go up to 30.

1195
01:47:17,614 --> 01:47:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have other fees that we can increase if we

1196
01:47:22,253 --> 01:47:22,714
[SPEAKER_03]: chose to.

1197
01:47:23,054 --> 01:47:23,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for flagging that.

1198
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:25,136
[SPEAKER_09]: That's much appreciated.

1199
01:47:25,176 --> 01:47:26,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's exactly what we're looking for.

1200
01:47:26,417 --> 01:47:31,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to see similar to what Director Crowley was talking about with job descriptions from the 1980s.

1201
01:47:32,063 --> 01:47:34,125
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some fees from the 1980s as well.

1202
01:47:34,585 --> 01:47:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have gone up because when I first started, we were a $5 demand fee.

1203
01:47:38,389 --> 01:47:40,972
[SPEAKER_03]: We did go to $10, but we are stuck at $10 right now.

1204
01:47:41,292 --> 01:47:41,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1205
01:47:41,813 --> 01:47:42,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1206
01:47:42,393 --> 01:47:42,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantastic.

1207
01:47:42,954 --> 01:47:43,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1208
01:47:43,354 --> 01:47:43,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1209
01:47:45,043 --> 01:47:49,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions by members of the council, comments by members of the council, or motions on any budget?

1210
01:47:50,267 --> 01:47:51,268
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just, yeah, you're done.

1211
01:47:51,368 --> 01:47:52,489
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good.

1212
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:55,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1213
01:47:55,832 --> 01:47:56,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else for tonight?

1214
01:47:56,973 --> 01:47:57,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

1215
01:47:58,174 --> 01:47:58,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1216
01:47:58,494 --> 01:47:59,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a general comment.

1217
01:48:00,055 --> 01:48:08,242
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, as one Councilor who's been through this just a couple times before, it's really helpful to be able to start this process this early

1218
01:48:09,361 --> 01:48:20,283
[SPEAKER_12]: to be able to have these conversations, you know, kind of with more time on our side with department heads, rather than trying to squeeze everybody into a few weeks in late May and June.

1219
01:48:20,403 --> 01:48:25,585
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a lot of thanks to all the department heads for coming prepared, starting in April and early May.

1220
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:29,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Many thanks to the administration for accommodating and working with us on this earlier timeline.

1221
01:48:29,765 --> 01:48:36,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's been really valuable to be having these discussions about what's in, what's not in, what's changed, what are you looking forward to.

1222
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:43,635
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, six months, one year, five years out at this point in the year is adding a lot to this process for me compared to prior years.

1223
01:48:44,276 --> 01:48:49,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I just want to thank all of our city staff for participating in this new timeline and to the administration for supporting it.

1224
01:48:51,902 --> 01:48:52,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

1225
01:48:53,122 --> 01:48:53,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Council is our

1226
01:48:54,683 --> 01:49:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I will add is that these meetings have been really beneficial to me as a new Councilor, but also just as a private citizen seeing that many, most of the departments that have presented to us are basically just asking for a level of funding, but that the increases do not translate to level.

1227
01:49:16,272 --> 01:49:24,075
[SPEAKER_01]: There are necessary additions each time a department presents something that necessitates an increase

1228
01:49:25,908 --> 01:49:30,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is adding up exponentially as all of these departments come together.

1229
01:49:31,432 --> 01:49:43,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we had to do this all over the course of just a few nights, it would have been, I'm sure you guys experienced this before, it would have been so overwhelming to see it all compiled all at once.

1230
01:49:43,442 --> 01:49:45,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate the bite-sized pieces.

1231
01:49:45,704 --> 01:49:48,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate everybody taking multiple nights out of there.

1232
01:49:49,591 --> 01:49:53,794
[SPEAKER_01]: of their lives to present this to us in easily consumable portions.

1233
01:49:54,295 --> 01:49:55,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to everybody.

1234
01:49:56,176 --> 01:49:56,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1235
01:49:56,536 --> 01:49:56,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1236
01:49:56,977 --> 01:50:01,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know that that really is the bottom line so far.

1237
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:02,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure it will be for everybody.

1238
01:50:03,021 --> 01:50:11,347
[SPEAKER_09]: You know these level service budgets keeping the same amount of services still cost more money every year because costs go up.

1239
01:50:11,587 --> 01:50:18,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that we also request as part of the process and I want to thank the administration for providing it is that on these change sheets it breaks out

1240
01:50:19,468 --> 01:50:20,669
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the fixed cost growth?

1241
01:50:20,889 --> 01:50:21,909
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the new expenses?

1242
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:29,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I noted earlier, basically everything we've had, fixed cost growth, just keeping what we have and seeing those costs go up.

1243
01:50:29,893 --> 01:50:40,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, again, the one new expense we've seen, certainly the one new expense item that we saw tonight, was literally compliance trainings for HR, which is a basic thing that we need.

1244
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:53,379
[SPEAKER_09]: When we talk about efficiency, when we talk about government, and we talk about how our tax dollars are being spent, we are maximizing that value every day.

1245
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:54,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly,

1246
01:50:56,718 --> 01:50:57,658
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going beyond that.

1247
01:50:57,758 --> 01:51:07,663
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now at the point, I think, in many departments where there are things that we think departments should do, that departments would like to do, that the community would like departments to do, that we don't do because the funds aren't there.

1248
01:51:07,943 --> 01:51:20,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's an important message, I think, for the community to be aware of because, you know, they see it and they comment on it and we get what we pay for.

1249
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:23,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

1250
01:51:26,818 --> 01:51:27,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1251
01:51:27,318 --> 01:51:27,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1252
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:27,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1253
01:51:28,339 --> 01:51:29,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1254
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:29,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1255
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:29,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1256
01:51:38,482 --> 01:51:40,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Midterm thank you, mid-budget thank yous.

1257
01:51:40,724 --> 01:51:58,859
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to thank the council for the collaboration, but I really want to come up here, and I know you all know this, but every time I sit here, and it just gets better and better as the years go on, you know, we have such an incredibly talented group of department heads who are doing such an incredible job in their departments.

1258
01:51:58,919 --> 01:52:03,103
[SPEAKER_13]: They come up here and they describe all the initiatives that they're moving forward, and I,

1259
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:11,850
[SPEAKER_13]: I know from myself, from the mayor, we sit back and we look at that incredible talent, and we're just so appreciative and so proud.

1260
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:17,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think you all see that, but it probably warrants being said.

1261
01:52:17,194 --> 01:52:22,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just so thankful to those who have presented, those who will come after those who have already presented.

1262
01:52:22,678 --> 01:52:25,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't hold a match to these folks.

1263
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,642
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just so good at what they do.

1264
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:28,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just so thankful.

1265
01:52:28,363 --> 01:52:32,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the city of Method should be incredibly proud for the department heads that are here.

1266
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:33,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1267
01:52:33,817 --> 01:52:34,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1268
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:39,982
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1269

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1273

[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

1274
01:53:09,806 --> 01:53:10,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
