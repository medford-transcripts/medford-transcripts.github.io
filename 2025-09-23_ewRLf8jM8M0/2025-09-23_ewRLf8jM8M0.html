    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=915.061s">So</a>  I did just want to say thank you to the MNA and the team that worked with us to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=921.409s">We</a>  started meeting in maybe April or so, and it has been, you know, it's very difficult to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=929.599s">adjust</a>  for schedules during the summertime and they rose to that challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=934.804s">So</a>  I want to thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=937.247s">I</a>  want to thank them for the discussion, particularly when we got to talk about things that didn't work in our school buildings and come up with better ways to make things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=948.137s">on</a>  behalf of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=949.278s">So</a>  I really applaud their hard work and their delivering for our students at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=955.482s">So</a>  I really do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=958.444s">And</a>  Mr. Carboneau is here with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=962.727s">He</a>  is the bargaining liaison to the MNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=967.15s">And</a>  if you, I didn't know if you would like to say something or just have us say thank you, but you're welcome to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=973.974s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.059s">You</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.939s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=979.8s">You're</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Mark Carboneau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=980.62s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=981.24s">So</a>  my name is Mark Carboneau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=982.7s">I'm</a>  an associate director with the Massachusetts Nurse Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=986.341s">And</a>  I just would like to say that this was a sometimes intense process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=993.283s">But</a>  I really felt that we collaborated to work together on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1000.325s">And</a>  I think that the document that we came up with, this collective bargaining agreement, was something <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1005.928s">everyone</a>  should be proud of and we look forward to working with you all on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1009.791s">So</a>  I'd like to thank chairperson Graham, who I was able to have a series of off the record discussions as far as off the record bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1017.218s">And</a>  I'd like to thank all the members for all the work you guys have done on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1020.941s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1022.602s">And</a>  I'd like to thank you on behalf of the nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1024.784s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1026.723s">Thank</a>  you, I will miss our daily chats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1031.685s">And</a>  I think for those who may be viewing this either tonight or in the future, some of the big central issues that we were grappling with was alignment of the schedule for the nurses to the new school day and the new professional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1045.931s">So</a>  that was a very big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1048.572s">We</a>  also worked through a number of changes to create <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1055.275s">a</a>  bank of flexible hours for the nurses to participate in some of the things that happen outside of their core hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1064.922s">And</a>  that I think will become really, really useful as we talk about how we register students in a timely way for athletics or for kindergarten or run vaccine clinics and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1079.212s">So</a>  there's any number of things that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1081.693s">In</a>  the past, we have had to sort of scrounge money to pay our nurses to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1089.18s">And</a>  we were able to integrate all of that into the contract which is a really big deal and create this bank of hours that will like allow really allow us to serve the needs that are going to evolve as this new schedule unfolds so I'm really <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1103.253s">delighted</a>  that we were able to get all of that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1106.794s">And</a>  the new schedule starts tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1108.895s">So</a>  we will, we will see you all on the new schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1114.457s">Thank</a>  you, Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1117.779s">Is</a>  there a motion to take a brief recess? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1120.58s">By</a>  Member Intoppa, seconded by, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1124.941s">Member</a>  Ruseau, will you call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Jayden Vil]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1930.031s">Well,</a>  thank you, school committee, superintendent and mayor for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1935.057s">And</a>  my name is Jayden Ville, and I think I speak for all of us here when I say that we're here because we want to make a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1942.063s">We</a>  want to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1943.984s">The</a>  theme at MHS this year is belonging, making students feel like they're a part of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1949.368s">And</a>  we believe the key way to do that is making sure that students feel like their voices are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1954.933s">I</a>  know personally, I see a lot of students walking through the schools every day, and they have things they want to fix about the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1961.138s">They</a>  see certain things, and they just say, I wish it was something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1964.675s">However,</a>  they don't always have a platform to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1967.736s">That's</a>  where we come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1969.176s">We</a>  wanna champion the student voice, give a microphone to the voices that they wanna hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1974.578s">Because</a>  when we know that everyone is at the table and we have as many different constituents as possible and making an inclusive decision that we get the past results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1983.48s">Over</a>  the past few years, started with seniors, Darren and Noah, the class of 2024, we advocated for students <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1992.735s">For</a>  a big concern we had was that students were kind of having trouble carrying their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1997.617s">And</a>  so we asked that, you know, what if we could remove the backpack policy or have a way to something that can just carry around school to make their lives a bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2005.121s">Let's</a>  talk about the homework policy and how can we make students lives easier while they have the enriching part of homework, but also can balance it with their extracurriculars and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2014.205s">And</a>  with class government just this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2018.318s">We</a>  open it up just from the original five class president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2026.123s">We</a>  open it up so that more students can run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2028.625s">And</a>  now there's 10 class representatives to better represent the class and help fundraise for our class and get more ideas done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2036.43s">However,</a>  the key to that success is not just raising questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2042.86s">It's</a>  about fixing problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2045.681s">And</a>  so that is why we continue to work and advocate for the student body here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2051.583s">And</a>  that's also why we are expanding our reach into the regional student advisory council to continue to see how can we not just help our school, our community, but also maybe our region, even the state as a large. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2065.727s">Archimedes</a>  once said, give me a place to stand and I'll move the earth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2069.902s">When</a>  I say, give us a place to stand, give us a voice and we can make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2075.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2075.647s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2089.102s">Student</a>  involvement is integral integration, sorry, an integral part of the way that our school functions right it allows for the student voice that is generally under representative and splintered across many different perspectives to be assimilated and be <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2108.9s">presented</a>  to the school committee who has the power to make actual change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2113.224s">The</a>  legislation created by this committee and the changes wrought by it have had significant positive impact over the course of many years that the school advisory committee has been running. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2123.995s">And</a>  we hope to continue this legacy forward into the coming 2025-2026 year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2131.591s">This</a>  assimilation of ideas is not a process that happens out of nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2135.953s">It</a>  is a process that involves deliberation and that involves research, that involves taking the opinions of the student body and drafting solutions and speaking to members of school administration and members of the government here in Medford to find which solutions are reasonable, which solutions feel like they're attainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2158.353s">and</a>  then drafting responses, drafting opinion, which is brought here to you to deliberate on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2165.278s">And</a>  it is this process that has allowed us to have success in years previously, and we hope to bring forward into the following year when we talk about our regional council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2176.627s">Because</a>  the scope of these problems are not restricted to Medford alone, they're restricted to any student everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2183.064s">And</a>  by bringing these issues to a state level, we feel that we may be able to influence more schools and bring a better, more representative opinion of the student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2195.769s">This</a>  process is aided not only by my fellow committee members, but also by our advisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2201.552s">Freitas</a>  Haley, who provides <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2204.857s">I</a>  would say the role of another one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2208.319s">She</a>  also brings forward opinions, also questions our outlooks, also asks what can be done here to the point where we feel that her contribution has been just as instrumental as the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2223.947s">So</a>  I'd like to give a special shout out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2228.03s">This</a>  is especially meaningful to me because it is an outlet through which we can <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2233.129s">enforce</a>  ideas of effective altruism and change that we can bring that is positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2239.652s">The</a>  devotion of our life to the helping of others is, in my opinion, the highest pursuit, and this opportunity is the epitome of doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2250.457s">I</a>  believe that it's a podium that we all strive for to accurately represent those that place their faith in us, and we hope to continue doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2261.222s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Christine DesAutels]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2271.105s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2273.126s">So</a>  I'm going to say that I first joined this group of people back in like junior, sophomore, freshman year, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2282.332s">But</a>  I joined it because I had a lot of ideas, and I didn't really have anywhere to go with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2288.716s">And</a>  I think that that's part of the reason why this is such an important group of people is because we <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2295.459s">take</a>  in those ideas, we gather together the people in the student involvement organization, which is the like broader group of the student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2303.222s">And</a>  we sort of conglomerate them into like this big group in order to find the commonalities between them and find ways that the student body is agreeing that there's something that needs to happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2316.367s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2318.83s">as</a>  a group of driven individuals and with the help of the broader population, we're able to draft up ideas and find ways to fix those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2329.176s">And</a>  I especially appreciate this because it's such a like general process that involves so many different voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2334.919s">And</a>  it gives a chance for people to bring forward their ideas and bring forward their solutions in a way that they're not usually able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2344.744s">Because</a>  other than this group, the main other way to have <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2349.398s">a</a>  voice at a larger administrative role is through student government, which is honestly a harder process to get into and ends up blocking out a lot of different voices, which we've been trying to fix with the expansion of that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2364.443s">But</a>  still, if people have an idea, but they don't necessarily have the chance to run for student office and put in that time just for that idea, this gives them an outlet to bring it forward, then we discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2378.668s">And</a>  we find what sort of problems come from that initial problem, what sort of solutions come from the initial solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2386.512s">We</a>  are able to bring together all different ideas and all different voices in a very broad discussion format in order to formulate the best <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2396.177s">option</a>  plan to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2398.118s">And</a>  then from that discussion, we bring things to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2401.48s">And</a>  we bring this fleshed out idea that comes from so many different voices, so many different perspectives, and really, I guess, epitomizes the student body's voice in a way that no other group really seems to do.</p>

    <p>[Jayden Giang]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2424.947s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2426.048s">Um,</a>  so I believe I joined student advisory committee when I was back in sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2432.413s">Yeah,</a>  when I was a sophomore, and I had seen a problem and I had wanted it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2438.073s">So</a>  I am a part of the Vogue School at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2442.437s">And</a>  something about the Vogue School is that schedules are very different compared to like the normal high school where half the day consists of your shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2452.725s">And</a>  because of that, a lot of people weren't able to take the classes they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2457.029s">So</a>  I saw an opportunity to try and change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2462.554s">I</a>  got some friends, we talked about it and we were like, yeah, you should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2465.896s">So</a>  I joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2467.542s">and</a>  this year we finally got it implemented and that made me very happy because I could finally take the classes I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2476.688s">Something</a>  I've noticed like these past three years was that a lot of people like to use our organization as kind of like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2489.356s">a</a>  therapeutic like kind of area where you can vent your worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2493.038s">We</a>  have like guidance Councilors that measured high and a lot of people like to vent to them too, but it's not the same as like venting to your peers, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2499.981s">And</a>  at the same time, we also get stuff fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2502.422s">We</a>  can listen to their ideas, bring them up with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2507.964s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2515.848s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2518.449s">Member</a>  Tapa?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.183s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.983s">It's</a>  no surprise to anyone that I'm super psyched about this because I was a member of student government at Medford High and then also all throughout higher education was involved with student leadership and student government and how do we advise and work to help form policy that we want to see every day that affects us every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2540.388s">And</a>  it's what led me to being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2542.828s">And</a>  I super appreciate the idea of expanding that and for bringing this committee back to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2548.81s">I</a>  loved working with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2550.691s">two</a>  years ago a lot on some things and I'm really excited to see what you bring to the table moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2555.577s">So</a>  thank you very much for doing this work and I really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2567.622s">Oh,</a>  I was going to say thank you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2569.685s">And</a>  just to let you know, so the rules of the school committee have a place for the student representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2575.953s">And</a>  we hope to see at least one of you at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2579.518s">And</a>  just to, I think, work with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2582.943s">Freitas</a>  Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2584.605s">members</a>  of the committee to figure out how you get on the agenda if you have things you want to talk about and of course anything that we're discussing on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2591.849s">Your</a>  seat is there but I think member on top is the one who's going to get tapped on the shoulder and borrow his microphone at any point, because we really do want to hear from you and a lot of the things that we do here come from <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2603.855s">your</a>  voices, whether or not they are in this public forum, but I love the idea and the practice of making them more visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2610.439s">So</a>  thank you for being here and keep showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2613.201s">And</a>  we want you to be part of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2615.302s">And</a>  I think many of us would be very happy to be invited to your meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2619.024s">I</a>  think several of us attended in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2621.785s">We</a>  can't all show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2623.607s">That</a>  would be a problem for open meeting law, but we would love to be a part of it and make sure that this conversation goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2629.95s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.251s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.611s">I</a>  think something that my colleague just mentioned actually both my colleagues mentioned is seeing a need and feeling a need I think you all kind of commented in your own ways that noticing something that you're seeing day to day in your classroom in your school, you know, amongst your peers your friends your teachers, whatever may be, and acknowledging that there's an opportunity here as someone who's witnessing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2654.36s">I</a>  have a perspective that I want to communicate out to the people who can make the changes that I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2658.622s">And</a>  it's something really important that we don't get the privilege of seeing necessarily because we're not in the classroom each day like you all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2664.264s">So</a>  I think maintain that, hold on to the opportunity that you are noticing to say, what can I do as someone who is seeing this need and how can I fill it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2672.927s">And</a>  even if that's just coming to a meeting like this, sitting in that student advisory chair and letting us know what you're noticing, what your colleagues or your peers are seeing and how we can best support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2681.79s">So</a>  I think just appreciate that you guys are seeing that and you're actually living into that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2685.771s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2755.543s">I</a>  think that we all feel very grateful that you recognize the importance of student opinion in the creation of legislature affecting said students, as we hope that we can provide a touchstone for the student body throughout your decision making process and look forward to the future year.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2903.134s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Pippicelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2907.225s">So</a>  at the beginning, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2908.966s">At</a>  the beginning of each school year, we usually report on just a brief overview of the enrollment at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2917.213s">So</a>  making sure that we have the disclaimer that enrollment at this time of year is pretty fluid and it fluctuates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2925.72s">I</a>  can make sure that I provide this body with <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2929.432s">updates</a>  as we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2931.494s">The</a>  October 1st SIMS data is due to the Department of Education by the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2938.679s">So</a>  right now, currently, as of last week, our total enrollment is 4,125 students across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2948.085s">Here</a>  on the screen, you have just a snapshot of grade level and school with the district-wide view of 4,125. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2958.132s">One</a>  of the things that I want to just call out is there's an asterisk, there is a column that says TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2965.598s">There's</a>  a small number of students that are still not officially enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2970.682s">They're</a>  just through the registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2973.744s">This</a>  year we have put some parameters in place to make sure that we are getting students into our buildings as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2981.63s">And</a>  so that we're not having students wait longer than a few days before they're entering Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2987.494s">However,</a>  there are some pieces of <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2991.717s">Things</a>  that can hold that up for some students, that's EL testing, special education placement, or sometimes just medical needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3002.443s">Director</a>  Silva is working with families directly because we don't want that to be a barrier to them starting school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3009.507s">Those</a>  are some of the pieces that we've kind of put in place this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3014.191s">but</a>  you will see just across the board what the enrollment looks like at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3019.853s">I</a>  will pause here before we go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3021.714s">I</a>  don't know if there are any specific questions that you may have regarding enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3031.037s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3032.457s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3035.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3035.998s">Without</a>  digging through the data, are we approaching the need for any more kindergarten classrooms?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3043.557s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3044.538s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3045.298s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3046.398s">Actually,</a>  I think what we've seen a little bit this year is we have seen a decrease in some of our student enrollment or populations, especially around EL families.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3063.486s">Well,</a>  that's a whole conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3065.507s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3068.92s">But</a>  I could just remind, I will just maybe, I'm sorry, Member Graham, but just to remind people that we did, the Roberts, since COVID, we've always had, we've had to put in a fifth K section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3081.964s">They</a>  started this year with one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3083.384s">We</a>  just, it was automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3085.325s">We</a>  did have to add kindergarten classrooms everywhere but the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3094.148s">Well,</a>  no, the Missittuc, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3096.566s">is</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3097.167s">They</a>  have three of every section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3100.649s">The</a>  Brooks has five, the Missituk has four, the McGlynn has four, and the Roberts has five.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3107.834s">Member</a>  Branley, did you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3111.436s">I</a>  just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3112.777s">Do</a>  you know offhand the number of students that we had enrolled on our 10-1 report last year?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3119.245s">We</a>  have, there is a just, well, I would have to go back just to make sure because when looking at the data for last year, it's the entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3127.972s">And</a>  right now I just have like a month's snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3131.214s">So</a>  it wouldn't be fair to necessarily tell you what those numbers were at the end of last year because enrollment ebbs and flows throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3140.621s">But</a>  there is at least like a 25 student difference.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3146.365s">Is</a>  it an increase or a decrease? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3147.786s">Decrease.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3150.279s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3152.44s">Yes,</a>  I have the report from last September 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3158.322s">And</a>  we had 4,207. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3161.664s">Interestingly,</a>  just three days before that, we had 4,214. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3166.106s">So</a>  when we say it's fluid, it's kind of wildly fluid at this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3173.229s">Do</a>  we have the EL students? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3176.49s">Is</a>  that a separate category on there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3178.391s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3181.041s">Not</a>  on the one that is on this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3183.802s">I</a>  can get you that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3185.202s">OK,</a>  that'd be good to know.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3187.823s">And</a>  my question is too complicated for this, but I just have a lot of questions about EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3195.845s">And</a>  when students leave, not just EL students, when all students, when students leave the district, there's not often a, we're leaving, goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3210.157s">And</a>  so it's hard to know why they left. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3214.919s">We</a>  know if they go somewhere else and then that place asks for their transcripts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3219.561s">That's</a>  sort of the only way to know, but not all students, that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3225.284s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3226.384s">The</a>  overarching piece I could give you is there are two buckets for that data trend right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3233.368s">And</a>  there are students that have left the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3236.86s">either</a>  permanently or visiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3239.741s">But</a>  if it's for an extended amount of time, then that does affect their registration and they have to kind of go through that process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3247.405s">There's</a>  the other bucket, which students have left Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3251.828s">And</a>  so we do have the data as to the places that they have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3257.07s">The</a>  majority are not to a private or parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3261.993s">The</a>  majority are actually, they have moved residency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3266.337s">I</a>  can give you that breakdown if you would like.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3268.099s">I</a>  would.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3269.24s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3271.642s">Member</a>  Olapade.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3274.044s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3274.444s">I</a>  had a quick question about the high school enrollment data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3278.088s">For</a>  the final report, I know this is just preliminary, would there be a way to separate MHS from MVTHS just so we have an idea about the actual numbers of students that are allocating from the middle schools and then students that are coming into the districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3289.337s">I</a>  know that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3290.238s">the</a>  middle school count is 282, you know, obviously, but then the count for ninth grade is 307, so there is a, you know, 25, 30-ish student uptick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3299.941s">So</a>  just understand what that looks like and where that's coming from would be just awesome to have.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3304.503s">Yes,</a>  so because of the freshman rotations, I won't have ninth grade yet, but I can give you the split for 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3313.586s">Awesome,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3317.908s">Member</a>  Branley?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3321.392s">just</a>  to follow up on member Rousseau's comment for the special ed piece I know that I code all the kids in a couple of different aspects of where they're moving to and why when they unenroll so if they don't come to school for so many days obviously the school will flag us and let us know and then we have to put that code in <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3340.185s">And</a>  there are times that I'm sure it happens with the Yale students, because that's not my department, but with the specialist students, I'm like, well, where did this kid go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3345.829s">You</a>  have to show that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3348.431s">And</a>  then so when we're placing students, which happens to me every day in my role during the day, but all those specialist students come through my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3358.779s">How</a>  long does it take us to in Medford to place a special ed student?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3364.567s">I</a>  think that varies depending on the needs, but we worked, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3370.211s">Bowen,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3370.872s">Silva,</a>  and I worked very hard to make sure that we're shrinking that timeline based on some of the data we were collecting last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3379.579s">So</a>  I can get you what those specifics are, but we're really hoping for no more than three days.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3386.004s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3388.606s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3388.986s">I'll</a>  put three days-ish.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3392.809s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3394.284s">Any</a>  other questions about enrollment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3397.587s">Member</a>  Lopate?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3398.228s">It's</a>  just to clarify, what does the KF stand for?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3403.072s">That's</a>  kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3404.734s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3405.735s">No,</a>  I'm glad you brought that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3406.776s">KF</a>  is kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3408.758s">PK</a>  is pre-K or our MEAP programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3412.341s">And</a>  then I believe at the high school, the SP is project transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3418.763s">So</a>  that's for our students that are 18 to 22 years old.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3422.644s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3423.764s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3487.283s">All</a>  right, so the school-based handbook, family and student handbooks saw three updates globally for this 25-26 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3498.345s">That</a>  was for the Metro Public Schools AI responsible use policy and guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3504.027s">It</a>  was for the expansion of curricular accommodations based on sincerely held religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3509.868s">And</a>  then it was the adjustments to our new arrival and dismissal times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3516.233s">So</a>  first we had a very dedicated group of Medford public schools administrators and staff members that worked throughout the year Tyler tirelessly last year to create language for students and staff and families around our AI policies guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3534.879s">One</a>  of those was school committee member Erica Reinfeld, and joining her from Medford Public Schools staff was also Molly Layden, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Will Pippicelli, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Dr. Peter Cushing, and teachers Dan Wagner, Jason Campbell, Rebecca McGinnis, Allison Quealy, Grace Turnbull, May Abusan, and Lindsay Rapucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3558.992s">So</a>  they worked throughout the year to create a comprehensive tool that lays out the responsibilities and the resources that are available to our community around the guidance for AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3572.582s">So</a>  the principles, just to highlight like the principles of this guidance were how the resources would support teaching and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3580.601s">It</a>  addressed data privacy and security considerations, and it supported the ethical and responsible use of generated AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3591.283s">If</a>  we go to the next slide, DESI has come out with their, last year they had their suggested timeline for districts that they wanted to see engage in this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3604.945s">And</a>  this to the left was their projected timeline for doing such work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3610.284s">So</a>  for us here in Medford Public Schools, we have met their deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3615.546s">DESE</a>  had the policy going into effect next school year, 26-27. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3620.687s">We're</a>  just a little bit ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3625.048s">What</a>  we are continuing to work on, I would say, would be just further professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3631.23s">There</a>  has been some professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3633.751s">throughout</a>  last year around cyber security around AI and the use of it in classrooms, but the continuation of offering professional development to our staff is still a goal and still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3649.117s">If</a>  we go to the next, just the high level pieces that are in this AI guidance, all we have here just to give the community a brief overview is like a list of the table of contents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3664.564s">So</a>  these are the areas that are explained in the Medford Public Schools guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3670.805s">guidelines,</a>  both for students and for educators, there are embedded resources and links for people to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3679.611s">I</a>  don't know, Member Reinfeld, if you wanted to maybe highlight anything or mention anything about the work.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3690.788s">I</a>  will note that this was not done in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3693.609s">This</a>  was informed by a district-wide survey of, I will say, staff, teachers, administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3700.092s">There</a>  were conversations around bringing in feedback from students and from families as a follow-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3706.234s">The</a>  goal was really to get something on paper, but I think we had 120 or so responses, and we pulled out patterns, and we looked at those, and that really informed the discussions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3720.481s">And</a>  I will say this when we go to read the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3724.703s">Well,</a>  maybe I won't since I'm saying it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3727.365s">But</a>  the review timeline on this we set at one year because things are changing so much as we learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3737.652s">and</a>  as different software companies, programs decide to comply or not comply with student privacy laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3746.114s">So</a>  this is something that will be continually reviewed and that was always the goal and to see how with an eye to our student council representatives here, how this is actually affecting students and what this looks for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3758.776s">So</a>  we were looking for a policy and guidelines that teachers at different grade levels and in different subject areas could <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3767.618s">customized</a>  to the needs of their particular learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3770.861s">So</a>  those were all parts of the conversation that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3773.383s">I'm</a>  happy to say more or answer specific questions, but I don't need to go on about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3779.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3780.849s">Other</a>  questions, members of HAPA?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3787.134s">So</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3788.175s">Thank</a>  you for all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3789.837s">So</a>  we have on our agenda a policy on AI guidance and how that's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3796.834s">If</a>  we vote this into the handbook, is that the same ruling? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3800.176s">Or</a>  are these two different rulings for two different things? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3802.638s">Because</a>  inherently, if we vote yes on this, it automatically brings it in.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3806.02s">So</a>  the policy that is in paper, it takes the educator and student guidelines directly from the materials in the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3815.686s">The</a>  handbook contains additional information, like the resources and the language for syllabus, which wouldn't be a school committee policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3823.951s">And</a>  then the policy also adds a little bit of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3826.753s">top</a>  level framing for the policy book and a section on use in district operations, just because that was new guidance that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3836.98s">The</a>  committee was really focused on the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3840.282s">But</a>  are you asking whether we then have to approve both things in both places every time?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3846.626s">I'm</a>  asking in terms of, no, I was just more of like if they were similar because <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3851.482s">I</a>  have opinions about generative AI, and I have concerns, and I have issues with it, specifically how it's being used in the handbook and in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3862.291s">And</a>  I was just making sure that how we vote on the handbook doesn't affect the policy, because I get into my specifics in reviewing the full policy in the text that it's written.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3876.005s">So</a>  a lot of the language is overlapping and I think one of the, as we discussed in the handbook policy, the handbook update policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3887.651s">those</a>  get reviewed and then summarized to align with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3893.416s">So</a>  if the policy changes, the handbook would then have a follow-on update to reflect the new policy.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.54s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.7s">Yeah,</a>  because just my question was then, do I say my concerns now, or do I wait till the policy reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3904.985s">But</a>  if I can just wait until the policy reading, I can more dissect it in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3910.209s">It's</a>  a good question.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3912.25s">So</a>  what I might suggest is that you, at some point, when we're done, and I would like to hear from our students, a motion to sever the AI approval in the handbook until we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3927.375s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I was planning on doing.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3929.676s">So</a>  thank you for affirming that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3930.776s">I</a>  think I would just like to second that.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3939.939s">With</a>  regards to generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3942.134s">my</a>  understanding that this is not the time to talk about that, but we have also some concerns with specific wording within the school student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3950.761s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3953.443s">So,</a>  member Intoppa, do you want to make a motion to sever the MPS AI guidance from the handbook?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3963.151s">Motion</a>  to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3964.292s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3965.133s">Handbook</a>  approval or handbook</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3968.352s">Okay,</a>  if that makes the most sense, then I'll motion to, I'll take the recommendation of Member Ruseau, motion to table the handbook discussion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3974.754s">Okay,</a>  there's a motion to table the handbook discussion by Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3978.615s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3979.615s">Second</a>  by Member Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3982.656s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3984.396s">Member</a>  Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3985.817s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3987.557s">Sorry,</a>  I just, I would like to hear the rest of the overview of the handbook updates before we table the full discussion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3995.099s">I</a>  think- Motion to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3998.835s">to</a>  be withdrawn.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4000.937s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4001.217s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4001.677s">So</a>  it's like 10 minutes from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4004.119s">So</a>  I think it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4004.979s">We</a>  can just shift gears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4077.007s">That's</a>  what I've described here.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4084.72s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4085.32s">This</a>  project now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4088.702s">Which</a>  one? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4089.883s">Well</a>  yeah I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4092.644s">So</a>  I would say specifically the HVAC project.</p>

    <p>[Kenneth Lord]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4095.225s">Okay</a>  so right now we have the McGlynn and Anders HVAC project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4098.387s">We</a>  have an owner's project manager JLL who's driving that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4102.209s">They</a>  work with the architect B2Q and the contractor Consigli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4107.692s">And</a>  what Tom Ellis the representative from JLL is recommending <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4113.514s">we</a>  identify someone to learn those systems as they bring them on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4117.315s">They</a>  haven't started up any of those systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4119.056s">The</a>  software is not even purchased yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4121.257s">So</a>  we want to get this person in and ready to be able to hit that ground running when they're ready.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4126.158s">Okay,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[Kenneth Lord]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4127.118s">The</a>  existing systems are managed by our maintenance staff.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4130.62s">And</a>  they have the equipment to do what they need for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4134.081s">And</a>  then obviously everything will be updated when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4136.942s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4137.082s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4137.582s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kenneth Lord]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4155.327s">I</a>  think I think the pay is anti pay is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4159.488s">I</a>  think that there's we look for a little bit more of a mixture of experience rather than just someone who's saying, you know, a contract is licensed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4165.789s">Some</a>  of them are HBC experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4167.069s">What</a>  is the core or mixture that?</p>

    <p>[Kenneth Lord]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4181.955s">It's</a>  the same one.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4240.652s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4245.756s">Next</a>  up, we have continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4249.259s">We</a>  have an update and recommendation to approve the Cummings Foundation $35,000 grant for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4258.967s">Mr.</a>  Trotta submitted a report, and I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galusi.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4265.089s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4266.81s">So</a>  I know that Mr. Trotter provided the membership with a little bit more description. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4274.813s">I</a>  will say that just to maybe get to like the key points in conversation with Mr. Trotter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4282.905s">The</a>  language that was in there that was causing some concern, I believe, was in there mistakenly and will not be in there in the future years of this grant, which is a 10-year grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4295.391s">But</a>  you can see here the categories of pretty much how that for this school year, which follows how the other budgets have typically gone, what the buckets of spend are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4307.958s">So</a>  the largest here is for staff stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4312.2s">So</a>  there are chapters of CCSR at every school across the district, and these are going to the stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4320.644s">Now,</a>  every school has one stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4323.946s">Some</a>  schools, depending on the number of students that are in that chapter, they may have two advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4329.829s">That's</a>  work for this year that's still unfolding to see how students are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4335.232s">participate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4336.353s">Some</a>  of the stipends also go to administrative assistant or secretarial type work in order to keep the purchase orders for materials and supplies going through Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4349.905s">So</a>  it's not just, just to clarify, there's those additional stipends, one stipend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4357.283s">A</a>  bulk of the work goes to the supplies and the materials that are needed for each chapter to engage in the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4367.133s">So</a>  when students are working with their advisors to come up with what they want their project, their civic minded project to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4376.18s">There's</a>  money that's allocated to their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4380.543s">I</a>  did ask about professional development materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4384.326s">I</a>  did learn that there is a resource library in the Medford High School library that all of the advisors have access to, and that library keeps building in terms of resource for the advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4398.515s">And</a>  then the last piece was just a small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4402.818s">If</a>  there is an advisor, which has come up in the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4406.605s">wants</a>  to bring students on a field trip or bring in a guest speaker that is related to the work that they have chosen to do, that money is earmarked for just in case opportunities throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4423.356s">Happy</a>  to answer any further questions that you may have.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4428.119s">Member</a>  Intoppa, Member Reinfeld, and then Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4432.682s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4433.803s">I'm</a>  really happy to see this <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4436.178s">breakdown</a>  and also you know the clarification in terms of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4439.28s">I</a>  think one thing to make very clear and important to folks is that this is not the only basis of funding for the CCSR, that the CCSR actually, especially in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4451.907s">secondary</a>  education part of the CCSR actually encourages students to get grants elsewhere and to help fund the projects through that as a way of project learning and a way for folks to learn how to do that in the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4464.151s">I</a>  know that my project in the CCSR was mainly funded actually through Tufts and through Harbor Freight and that was done in with my advisor Michael Skorka teaching me how and Richard Trotta teaching me how to sort of do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4477.514s">So</a>  when we see <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4480.616s">These</a>  numbers outside of the scope of, well, how does that fund everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4485.198s">It's</a>  important to know that at the core of the CCSR they are teaching students how to be advocates and how to advocate for themselves in terms of what they want to get funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4493.683s">So</a>  oftentimes they're reaching out to community partners for sponsorships and a lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4498.646s">So</a>  just kind of like a point of information, I guess, about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4502.289s">this</a>  funding when we see this here and we go, well, how does 4,000 sustain the various grade levels and various intricacies of projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4509.252s">Oftentimes</a>  we rely on our community partners and thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4513.234s">So</a>  thank you for the clarification and I appreciate all the information presented.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4520.117s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4523.238s">Yep,</a>  I just wanted to thank Mr. Trotta for providing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4525.879s">I</a>  know I was the one who severed this last time and I just want to say thank you for providing the additional info. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4530.461s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4532.794s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4535.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4537.038s">I</a>  was just looking at the letter again from last meeting, and I don't really feel like we got answers to the question we were asking, which was, what does the grant require? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4547.848s">The</a>  letter explicitly references a relaxing of requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4552.378s">what</a>  were the requirements and what are the requirements now is still unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4557.462s">And</a>  I went back and looked at the presentations from June and I still don't know how the $29,000 gets spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4565.128s">I</a>  mean, is it $28,995 for one person and a dollar for each other person? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4570.152s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4571.192s">It's</a>  not in any of the presentations we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4574.775s">So</a>  I'm not satisfied that this answers our questions and I'd like to get those questions answered.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4583.088s">I</a>  think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4584.469s">So</a>  I have requested a further drill down from Mr. Trotta around this for this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4593.354s">I</a>  can go back and get it for last school year, if that is the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4597.837s">This</a>  school year, we just don't have it yet because the participation is still, they're still kind of like building through enrollment of student participation, the number of advisors and what that will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4609.664s">But</a>  I'm happy to give that to you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4613.443s">I</a>  would like last year's Yeah, I mean, because my sense after all these years is it's, it's pretty much been the same for the last eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4623.566s">Well,</a>  almost whatever the years have been, it's been, we've been paying the staff and everybody about the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4631.229s">But</a>  I don't know who's getting paid what. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4634.736s">And</a>  that's really not, I mean, if it has nothing to do with us and we shouldn't be talking about the CCSR in any way, shape or form, then let's say that and stop talking about the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4644.74s">But</a>  we talk about it a lot and I have no idea what happens to the money and where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4649.702s">And</a>  that's not my opinion as a body that is responsible, acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4656.525s">So</a>  last year would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4658.786s">And</a>  if it's particularly different than the year before that, then I'd like to know that too.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4666.45s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4668.533s">My</a>  understanding for one for the in terms of where we find what those that is actually outlined in the 10 year grant contract executed in 2021 so we'd have to refer to that language to find out what that means outside of the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4681.42s">My</a>  understanding of the faculty and staff stipends when it comes to advising is more in the term of that this is the allotted amount and that it is earmarked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4693.39s">So</a>  that way every, you know, and I don't know what the number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4697.174s">I</a>  know I was asked to be an advisor at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4699.856s">I</a>  never got to that point of asking what the stipend weeks I didn't ask ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4704.66s">that</a>  I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4706.581s">But</a>  as far as I'm concerned, it's a baseline stipend of whatever the amount is, and then that $29,000 is basically reachable to them because we pay part of Mr. Trotta's salary through the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4718.207s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, it's for folks outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4720.889s">But</a>  I could be completely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4722.81s">I</a>  don't know the answer 100%, so I don't want to pretend like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4727.092s">But</a>  that is my interpretation of this letter and from past context, working with Director Trotta on this.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4736.879s">There</a>  are no Medford Public Schools operating funds that pay for CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4742.342s">It</a>  is entirely grant funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4745.404s">Except</a>  for Mr. Trotta's stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4747.526s">Except</a>  for Mr. Trotta's stipend.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4749.647s">It</a>  has to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4751.038s">I'm</a>  so sorry, I don't know if I'm like out of order by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4755.562s">But</a>  his stipend, part of the grant, I have learned part of the grant is that his stipend has to be separate from the grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4762.648s">So</a>  that does go all to the work of CCSR and Medford Public Schools pays his stipend to oversee the grant.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4776.331s">everyone</a>  else's, all the other advisors and assistants, whether it's faculty or staff, is from this, but TRADA is the only one that is paid for in our budget.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4786.217s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4787.938s">Member</a>  Branley? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4788.819s">So</a>  who holds on to this $35,000?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4795.423s">There's</a>  an account, like a grant account in Medford Public Schools that is allocated each year and then it's drawn down for the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4803.095s">for</a>  them to pay the stipends and to pay the materials and to so our grant manager Susan Callahan helps to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4809.859s">Okay,</a>  this funding members so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4816.763s">So</a>  that's sort of it there is a line item that pays for Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4822.048s">But</a>  when there's this relaxation in that letter, does that mean we could perhaps use the grant to pay for him instead of the very limited Medford Public Schools funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4832.336s">But</a>  it says relaxed with no explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4836.399s">What</a>  does that mean?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4838.22s">And</a>  it's not in writing, but that's why I was told it was in error. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4846.507s">it</a>  was an error and should not have been part of the clause and that clause is removed moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4856.715s">So</a>  what I could maybe do is ask for them to like reissue the letter.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4860.537s">I</a>  think what I'm not clear about is what is the clause that was an error? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4866.862s">Like</a>  what did we think we had to do that we no longer had to do?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4870.345s">It's</a>  just the wording around it being relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4873.763s">like</a>  and could be earmarked for other purposes, the language that you were concerned for last time.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4878.8s">But</a>  what is being relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4881.283s">I'm</a>  not quite like, what is relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4884.145s">Is</a>  it like a particular requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4887.647s">I'm</a>  just trying to be very clear about what we're being asked to approve a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4892.03s">And</a>  there's a lot of lore around how CCSR is funded, including I have been told by past people in the administration that we are required to pay stipends at certain levels to certain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4905.719s">I</a>  don't know if that's true or if it's not true, but what I'm trying to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4910.442s">is</a>  what are we required to do under the contract that we signed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4916.226s">What</a>  are those features? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4918.348s">And</a>  when we relaxed something, is it all of it or is it a specific thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4924.232s">So</a>  I just want to be clear what we're saying because I don't want people to go out and be like, the school committee is gonna go spend this money on whatever they want because it was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4934.96s">I</a>  just want to be very clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4938.342s">what</a>  it is that was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4941.005s">Nothing</a>  has been relaxed.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4942.747s">Nothing</a>  has been relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4944.149s">The</a>  language was an error that how you're spending the money could be relaxed, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4959.841s">Nothing</a>  is being relaxed moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4962.443s">These</a>  are the three buckets of spend, which is stipends, materials, and field trips, transportation costs, guest speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4971.67s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4972.291s">There's</a>  no relaxing of how we're spending our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4974.893s">Those</a>  are the three buckets in which CCSR is spending their money.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4980.537s">Then</a>  I would like to ask that we get an official correct <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4985.56s">letter</a>  from the Cummings Foundation so that we can approve this in a way that is diligent with what they're asking us to do, especially if nothing has been relaxed.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4998.764s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5000.705s">I</a>  think we're in year eight of a 10 year grant.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.367s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.907s">And</a>  I think the other thing is to say, oh, this was in the grant 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5008.689s">I'm</a>  sure that it was, but it's been 10 years and it would just also be helpful for people to say, here are the key features of the grant that was signed 10 years ago by nobody who's still in the building except for Mr. Trotta so that we can parse fact from fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5024.598s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5027.977s">Member</a>  Rizzo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5029.758s">And</a>  I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I'm going to anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5034.34s">But</a>  this paragraph, like nobody wakes up as they're typing a memo and writes a paragraph that says the foundation has lifted restrictions on the use of grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5044.604s">That</a>  didn't come out of thin air. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5046.124s">That</a>  came out of an email or a letter or a memo that somebody received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5050.806s">Nobody</a>  just wrote that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5053.118s">for</a>  kicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5054.119s">So</a>  I can understand if you're saying that there has in fact been nothing relaxed, but somebody received something somewhere along the line that definitely said restrictions have been relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5065.704s">This</a>  isn't a sentence you can accidentally add a and or a not and suddenly get this sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5072.948s">This</a>  is clearly a paragraph written based on some other thing that exists somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5078.671s">So</a>  I look forward to the report on what is</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5083.316s">I</a>  will have the letter reissued. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5085.658s">I'm</a>  still in my learning of CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5090.361s">So</a>  I can't speak to what it was in the past, but I will absolutely get a yes, a revised letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5098.066s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5099.246s">Member</a>  Intoppa, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5100.747s">And</a>  one more not to like you said, I'm going to make maybe a dangerous assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5106.871s">What</a>  I'm assuming is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5109.578s">And</a>  again, I use the word assuming strongly, is that the Cummings Foundation had guidelines on what they wanted the grant funding to be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5118.164s">And</a>  now, with a lot of things happening federally with grant funding, what they're earmarked for, they are lifting certain recommendations to avoid becoming targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5130.887s">I'm</a>  going to assume that they are basically saying we had priorities and now it's whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5137.45s">Because</a>  that seems to be the trend that seems to be what's happening nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5142.872s">And</a>  I have a feeling that it was just more of or maybe it wasn't that deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5146.433s">Maybe</a>  it's nothing like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5147.453s">And</a>  maybe it's just, you know, hey, we wanted to use it for this, but now <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5152.135s">you</a>  know, whatever floats your boat, whatever we can do to make sure that students have student success and that they're doing the projects they want to do, and that we actually really don't care what you use it for as long as you spend it appropriately and responsibly.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5164.646s">And</a>  I think getting to the bottom of those choices is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5169.59s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying that that's probably... Is there a motion to table this update, this request to approve the donation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5180.136s">Well,</a>  we took it up on the agenda, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5182.657s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5185.099s">Motion</a>  to table by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5186.539s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5191.302s">Seconded</a>  by Member Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5192.543s">Roll</a>  call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5193.763s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5938.775s">So</a>  the educational staff and the student is taken directly from the committee's language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5944.977s">Most</a>  of this overview language is from, but I added the bits about consistency across grade level and within subject areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5954.139s">The</a>  thinking on that, right, is that if a student on side A at the Andrews has a different <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5959.8s">policy</a>  than side B at the McGlynn, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5962.981s">But</a>  recognizing that these tools are used very differently in a humanities class, a science class, a world language class, special education, so special education professionals were on in this group to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5976.647s">say</a>  when things are using English language learners have a different need than others and in terms of assessing where the students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5985.391s">So</a>  that's that was there and then as I mentioned the district operations that is kind of brand new in the DESE guidelines that came out at the end of August and I recognize that this work was done before our <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6000.337s">chief</a>  operating officer and assistant superintendent for instruction and curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6005.301s">This</a>  actually began right in our surprise superintendent transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6009.904s">And</a>  so I have to thank Director Chiesa for stepping in and doing some of that material. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6018.97s">So</a>  that's where this came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6023.287s">I</a>  put it on the agenda tonight because I knew the handbooks were on the agenda and I think it would be inappropriate to be referencing a policy that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6031.713s">So</a>  I welcome the discussion, friendly amendments, whatever we need to show that we're thoughtful and to make sure that we are supporting students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6040.719s">The</a>  discussion in these committee meetings was these resources are here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6045.222s">We</a>  need to be using them responsibly and we need to have a position and not just let things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6052.587s">because</a>  someone comes up with an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6054.308s">So</a>  I am excited to have a consistent policy in this area.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6060.833s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6062.054s">Questions</a>  from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6065.136s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6068.385s">Thank</a>  you for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6070.968s">There's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6072.67s">I</a>  really appreciate that there's, it's not just focused on students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6076.814s">I</a>  think that would have been the easy way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6081.859s">And</a>  I don't envy the staff that have to learn all these things that are <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6088.146s">frankly,</a>  changing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6089.787s">I</a>  think perhaps for students, it's easier to learn all this stuff, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6096.349s">But</a>  did we have a mention of professional development in this?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6102.548s">I</a>  believe we said that the district will provide training and resources.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6106.791s">Okay,</a>  that's the training is word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6108.492s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6108.792s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6109.192s">So</a>  one of the one of the objectives of the of this task force working group was to identify the training needs not prescribe what they should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6120.339s">So</a>  I know that document exists, but has not been codified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6124.561s">Thank</a>  you mad for meetings, and I will also note that the language that is in the handbooks was reviewed at department meetings and building levels so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6135.335s">It</a>  has seen other eyes, although, as we mentioned, additional input from different stakeholders is still needed here.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6142.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6143.284s">I</a>  would just ask that in the next budget that we, I'm guessing that professional development around generative AI will not be free. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6152.107s">It</a>  might be quite an expensive professional development offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6156.188s">So</a>  just something to keep in mind for the next budget because our staff is certainly gonna need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6164.491s">But</a>  as you pointed out, like different departments and different grade levels will need frankly, very different training. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6171.433s">I'm</a>  assuming the sciences, probably a lot of those teachers, at least at the high school level, are already pretty aware of a lot of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6181.799s">But</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6183.921s">It's</a>  incredibly concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6187.703s">And</a>  I love the use of the word ethical over and over, because that is a harder one to nail down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6196.568s">And</a>  I do like the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6200.851s">the</a>  academic honesty panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6202.672s">I'm</a>  wondering if you could tell us a little bit about why there's this panel's decision is final.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6208.666s">I</a>  would defer to the staff on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6210.687s">That</a>  was their language and not to pass the buck, but that was our teachers and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6218.05s">I</a>  think they wanted it to be very consistent with the existing academic honesty and integrity policy, but I'm hoping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6227.013s">And</a>  I want to note that director Layden is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6231.455s">Shana</a>  Tova to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6233.25s">our</a>  Rosh Hashanah observers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6235.432s">So</a>  there may be some questions here that our director of technology and library services may be better equipped to answer, but perhaps Dr. Galusi can talk about the panel.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6246.921s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6247.442s">I</a>  think that was really nicely said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6249.143s">The</a>  only thing I would say is that I'm sure it's not a big surprise that especially secondary teachers are dealing with these issues quite regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6257.991s">And</a>  probably, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6262.201s">I</a>  wouldn't maybe necessarily say a daily basis, but I do think that it's, this is a conversation that is happening in a lot of secondary department meetings, classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6271.987s">I</a>  also know it's quite a conversation at college campuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6275.949s">There's</a>  a lot of higher level institutions that are talking about going back to the oral exams and the blue books as a way to kind of navigate what is happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6287.055s">And</a>  every time you turn around, there's now another like third, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6290.657s">party</a>  platform that's claiming to do some other involvement of AI functioning that can determine who's used it determine who's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6301.361s">I</a>  think the real main goal for this which member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6308.762s">so</a>  eloquently said, but it's really to educate how it can be used as a tool, but not to replace critical thinking, problem solving, and teaching our students the skills that they need to thrive in college and in the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6325.709s">But</a>  there are some instances where it can aid and support productivity and workflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6333.693s">And</a>  I think that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6335.113s">having</a>  the opportunities to do that in classrooms where we're teaching students, the difference, getting back to that ethical word again, is really the essence of this guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6347.825s">And</a>  it is important to, once approved and have the greater conversation, it is important to be reflected in the handbook.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6362.336s">I</a>  was just going to add that in our initial survey, we asked what the committee was, what the task should be, but also we got a high positive response to both generative AI tools support student learning and generative AI tools undermine student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6377.123s">And</a>  I think everyone kind of recognizes the complexity of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6380.965s">Then</a>  this question that people are kind of most mixed on was, I know when my students are using generative AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6387.068s">There</a>  was a big range of, I know, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6392.277s">And</a>  I think more people said that their students didn't use the tools, but there was a recognition that that was going to increase over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6403.984s">And</a>  that's why we really wanted to get ahead of this with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6408.046s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6409.107s">Yeah,</a>  of course.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6410.187s">Member</a>  Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6411.588s">So</a>  yeah, so my question was surrounding that academic honesty panel too, like who determines it at what grade level and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6419.893s">Is</a>  there answer to that based on what you just said, or is that something?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6422.955s">I</a>  know you said it was sort of brought by the teachers, but... The way that for the situations that have been arising prior to this guidance, the way that's being handled is with in-school teams that usually comprise school leaders, teachers, and school Councilors.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6444.51s">Okay,</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6446.14s">And</a>  then bringing in at times if needed department heads to like a doctor keys or Dr. Khan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6451.974s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6452.396s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6453.458s">Remember</a>  in tapa</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.398s">I</a>  want to say first and foremost, thank you member Reinfeld and everyone on the committee for putting their heads together, thinking about what this looks like, thinking about the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.006s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.587s">It</a>  is very clear on a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6470.85s">There's</a>  a lot of, you know, the policy is bulky in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6474.233s">There's</a>  a lot of guidance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6475.654s">There's</a>  some things we just can't avoid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6476.895s">It's</a>  sometimes like we want to make them as short and simple as we can, but you always want to make sure things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6481.459s">There's</a>  clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6484.172s">There's</a>  clarity amongst other things that better less likely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6489.858s">The</a>  first question I have is, has the district identified what generative AI models are state approved, are district approved, are OK to use in the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6501.426s">Because</a>  it mentions that in the DESE guidelines, they have to be vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6505.108s">And</a>  I was curious.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6506.449s">The</a>  district maintains a list of acceptable software programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6510.732s">And</a>  it, I believe, includes generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6512.894s">Or</a>  they were adding the generative AI tools as of the writing of this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6516.796s">That's</a>  a great question for Molly Leighton as well.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6519.318s">Yeah,</a>  in terms of what, because there's thousands of models and there's different third party softwares in terms of which- Only a certain number of them have the agreement.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6529.535s">to</a>  for student data protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6531.995s">And</a>  that's really the that's the filter there.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6535.016s">I</a>  was gonna say, because that is that's my biggest concern is in terms of student data privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6540.317s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6542.037s">And</a>  we kind of said there, there isn't a, it doesn't make sense to list those out in the policy because things change and legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6550.759s">So</a>  the district maintains that in the same way that they maintain other acceptable software and <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6556.7s">why</a>  Google this works and Microsoft that doesn't, or I'm not trying to slam any particular company that was random. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6562.905s">Right,</a>  I understand.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6563.865s">Yeah,</a>  no, my question, it was more in terms of like, have we identified yet, you know what I mean, in terms of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6569.63s">Obviously,</a>  like you said, things are fluid, things change, we find a problem with the software, we take it off the list, it happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6575.949s">I'm</a>  sort of breaking this apart in terms of, so I understand in terms of citing AI sources, I find it very interesting because it basically seems like the old adage of you can't cite Google because you can't cite a Google search. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6592.353s">And</a>  that's exactly what an AI citation is through MLA and APA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6595.694s">It's</a>  just, you're writing what you searched up, what model you used and what day it was, which is funny because you go through primary and secondary education and they tell you not to do that with Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6605.136s">And</a>  yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6606.578s">This</a>  isn't our language, but this is what the language is across the nation in terms of MLA and APA, what is acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6614.12s">So</a>  I think that's kind of hilarious, especially if you know how AI works in terms of machine learning that inherently it is plagiarism because it is pulling together a bunch of sources and spitting out a summary without any real citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6627.288s">And</a>  if you've, you know, in college, they always teach you, even if you summarize, even if you don't use every single word, word by word, or even have two of the same, you still have to cite it because you're still using someone else's information to form your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6637.855s">And</a>  so generative AI being cited is an interesting sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6643.315s">cycle</a>  of like, that's an interesting kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6646.356s">In</a>  terms of us implementing generative AI, I know that we as a committee stand on policies that are sustainable and making sure we're in our environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6656.519s">And</a>  if you know about AI, generative AI, you know how much energy it uses and how much water it uses and how much fossil fuels it inherently uses to generate answers and to machine learn these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6668.203s">And</a>  so from a sustainability standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6671.466s">not</a>  that sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6673.247s">There</a>  are ways for them to, I'm sure, to get the energy from solar or wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6678.171s">But</a>  for the most part, it's really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6680.992s">In</a>  terms of ethical usage in the arts, there is no way to ethically use AI, except for if you code an AI system and feed it only your artwork, it is inherently plagiarism and not stealing like an artist, which you and I both understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6695.242s">It</a>  is more of the stealing of everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6699.845s">So</a>  these are sort of some of my concerns.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6702.267s">I</a>  will note that the environmental piece came up as ethical as an umbrella, both ethically in terms of personal development and learning, but also in terms of societal impact.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6715.055s">Oh</a>  yeah, 100%.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6715.956s">So</a>  it was certainly discussed, but the point is taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6720.979s">I</a>  will say I wrote a very different policy for my graduate students than I wrote here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6726.485s">Fair</a>  enough.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6726.966s">Yeah,</a>  I'm definitely pulling in from what the conversations are happening in the art world in terms of higher ed and these are the conversations we're having every single day in terms of how AI is implemented in policy in the classroom in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6740.421s">Also,</a>  the part of bias and critical thinking should be checked for accuracy, bias, and misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6746.225s">For</a>  me, it's at this point, what's the point then in terms of taking a shortcut to summarize these things and then have to go back and still check them to make sure they're factual and to make sure that they are appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6757.875s">And</a>  then who is doing that checking? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6759.376s">And</a>  I think my colleagues behind me have some opinions about that in terms of what then</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6767.314s">I</a>  think we would like to hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6768.656s">Did</a>  you have anything that you wanted to amend about this policy?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6772.258s">I</a>  actually, in opposition of the policy, I think that we shouldn't be, it is my personal opinion that we really shouldn't be implementing this into the curriculum in terms of its usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6781.966s">I</a>  believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6783.828s">Being</a>  aware, especially in terms of literacy when we look at political and also national literacy around what is generative AI what is real and what is not I think is a very scary thing it is approaching very quickly in terms of we look at AI models that are generated from last year until this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6801.663s">So</a>  I'm sort of more nitpicking this in terms of that my amendment would be to only have a literacy aspect to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6808.206s">And</a>  the only times that we use this is to teach about what generative AI is, but it is not my welcoming to incorporate this into the curriculum in terms of as a tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6817.491s">I</a>  understand its benefits, but I personally do not have a positive outlook on generative AI and the future that it has in terms of where it will be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6826.856s">So</a>  to that, I defer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6829.201s">to</a>  my colleague next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6830.642s">That's</a>  not even my job, but that is my job.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6833.645s">I'm</a>  unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6834.286s">Are</a>  you making a motion or are you not making a motion at this time?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6836.968s">Well,</a>  at this time, there is no motion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6838.99s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6839.21s">These</a>  are just comments and questions.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6840.691s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6841.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6843.994s">I</a>  see we have a new colleague joining us.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6847.978s">I</a>  think that we have some specific <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6850.901s">issues</a>  with the wording present within the current student handbook in result in regards to generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6858.566s">This</a>  is more specific concerns, but under bias and critical thinking, all AI generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and politically and potentially negative content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6871.055s">And</a>  under citations, a record of prompts used in generative AI should be kept along with the output from the AI tool used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6878.7s">First</a>  of all, who is doing this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6882.263s">Who</a>  is keeping this record? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6883.784s">Who</a>  is responsible for ensuring this record is kept? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6886.366s">What</a>  is the punishment in case this record is not kept? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6889.908s">Secondly,</a>  does this apply to participate to preparation for assignments, as is mentioned elsewhere in the document, or <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6897.273s">simply</a>  to the creation of content for the assignments themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6900.758s">Again,</a>  this is generally not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6904.457s">The</a>  student handbook itself places particular emphasis on OpenAI's chat GPT over other generative AI models. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6911.402s">We</a>  believe that this is overly specific.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6914.604s">Can</a>  I stop you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6916.385s">Can</a>  we do this one at a time, just so that if there are answers, we can not forget what the answer is before we get to the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6923.03s">OK,</a>  so the first question, can you just tell us your first question again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6926.512s">It</a>  was about bias and critical thinking.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6929.394s">Yes,</a>  so under both the bias and critical thinking and citation sections, records are meant to be kept either of prompts or ensuring that they are checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6943.529s">Our</a>  question here is who is responsible for this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6947.173s">Who</a>  is responsible for ensuring that this list has been created? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6951.657s">And</a>  what are the repercussions should this work not be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6956.298s">And</a>  does this apply to only the creation of material for assignments themselves or preparation for tests, as mentioned, at other points throughout the document?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6967.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6968.542s">Member</a>  Reinfeld, did you have an answer?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6971.082s">So</a>  this was developed by committee, but I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6977.492s">The</a>  intention on who is keeping these records is the person completing the assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6984.096s">And</a>  I believe the prompts list is only for the assignments work that is turned in to say this is the sourcing for the content that I'm providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6994.221s">That</a>  is my understanding of what the teachers on the committee were thinking with this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7001.706s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7004.609s">So,</a>  I mean, it does depend on which tools you're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7006.852s">Certainly,</a>  I use AI all day, every day as a software developer, but, you know, the prompts that I make and the answers that I get <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7017.302s">I</a>  mean, I can look at them going back as far as I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7022.425s">They</a>  don't go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7023.346s">Now,</a>  if you're just using a free web version of something, you probably don't get all those features, which is why using the approved list would be very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7034.852s">And</a>  again, I'm not familiar with all the tools I use, the tools I use, which everybody knows there are many tools every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7041.416s">There</a>  seems to be another tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7043.157s">but</a>  using a tool for which you do not get an audit history of what you're doing seems like an absolute no-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7052.821s">As</a>  I read this policy, if you open a tool and it doesn't let you see what you asked it and what the answer was three weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7061.835s">You</a>  shouldn't be using that tool, because you can't comply with the policy that says here's you when you go to turn in the paper, unless you copied it down at that moment, which is also, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7074.918s">That's</a>  not how people do work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7076.399s">I</a>  mean, you're not gonna ask a question or make this paragraph better and then go off and write some gigantic audit log of your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7086.808s">That</a>  is totally unreasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7089.731s">But</a>  if you're using a tool that's keeping track of it, then it becomes, it's still a heavy lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7097.717s">The</a>  question is, is it a heavier lift than just doing it all without <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7101.597s">generative</a>  AI, and I suppose it depends what it is you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7108.04s">I</a>  would say that in most cases, I mean, I am wildly more productive as a software developer using generative AI than going off and learning an entire new whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7120.967s">When</a>  I only need a little tiny thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7124.109s">So,</a>  so to me that's the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7128.752s">But</a>  I obviously was not part of this committee, but I think that, you know, if you read something at the library and you don't write down the reference, and then you have a great memory and you write down exactly what you read. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7142.39s">Sent</a>  word for word, but don't put any, you don't remember what book it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7147.634s">It</a>  still counts as academic dishonesty, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7151.557s">So</a>  I'd like to think this is actually less work than some of that other stuff that we used to have to do in the olden days, card catalogs and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7163.867s">I'm</a>  really aging myself, but that's how I interpret it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7168.07s">Now</a>  this is the policy, like policy is not, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7173.741s">most</a>  of the time is not implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7176.062s">So</a>  the gory details of how it gets done, like if there's 10 tools that are approved, the answer is probably different for every tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7185.584s">So</a>  our policy is not going to be for this specific tool, make sure you click this after you do a question and you get your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7193.346s">And</a>  that's just not, that's an option for policy, but it becomes incredibly brittle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7200.267s">And</a>  then we're constantly modifying policy</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7203.343s">every</a>  week when there's a new AI tool so that's how I interpret this to answer your question and I will add I back in this language so it's all use of Jenny I for schoolwork must be recorded and shared with teachers such as with a transcript of prompts and responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7220.027s">So</a>  the policy is written to give teachers some flexibility in explaining what their expectations are and to say, this is how I want you to be citing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7231.559s">It</a>  doesn't require that list of prompts, but the teacher, this is an example of something that a teacher might request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7239.167s">Another</a>  teacher might say, I want a disclosure of AI to say, I use this tool in my introduction, or I use this in my research to create an outline, but I don't need the specific prompt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7248.85s">So</a>  I think the such as is actually important here in that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7252.831s">I</a>  don't know if that addresses the concern.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7256.533s">And</a>  if I might from the chair, this policy lays out that students are responsible for this and teachers are responsible for setting the parameters by which it will be used in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7268.756s">So</a>  just like any assignment that you get, your teacher is going to tell you what they expect from the assignment, how to cite things, whether you type it or you send it to them in the mail, like all of those things come from your teacher on an assignment by assignment basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7285.54s">And</a>  this is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7287.021s">asking</a>  anybody to do anything different than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7289.043s">It</a>  is asking teachers to clearly outline that to you all, but it is asking you as a student to adhere to the use of the tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7297.554s">So</a>  from a bias perspective, this policy is asking you to do it and it is asking teachers to do it and be clear about it.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7307.03s">I</a>  think that is a very helpful explanation of the intent behind the message present within the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7313.376s">We're</a>  simply requesting that within the document itself, this intent is better expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7322.145s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7323.166s">And</a>  I don't, as for Mr. Hsu, I <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7330.508s">I</a>  don't think that it's pertinent to discuss exactly which models are allowed at this moment, given that they change so frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7337.832s">But</a>  on your point in increased productivity, I think it's a common concern here shared by the board members that there's a difference between AI allowing you to do something faster and you actually understanding the process in which you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7355.885s">As</a>  for the rest of the document, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7364.513s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7364.693s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7365.474s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7366.595s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7368.236s">The</a>  document, we believe that the document is overly specific in reference to particularly OpenAI's Chachapiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7374.36s">While</a>  it remains the most commonly used AI model in terms of user base at the moment, we recognize that the landscape is rapidly changing and believe that more general knowledge would be, general wording would be helpful in this regard.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7389.571s">I</a>  can speak to that if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7391.732s">So</a>  that's in the definition section, because a lot of people use chat GPT interchangeably with generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7400.956s">And</a>  so it was to specify that it is a specific tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7404.238s">It</a>  is not the list of approved resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7407.639s">It's</a>  a definition of clarifying language.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7413.03s">I</a>  understand that that might be the case in that particular section, but it is mentioned throughout the document at other points, including differences in citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7420.892s">And</a>  I don't have any other examples written down, but I believe that there was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7424.873s">So</a>  I might be wrong, but I don't believe that that is restricted only to the section you're referencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7435.116s">But</a>  yes, it is important to define those terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7439.457s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7448.402s">I</a>  think that, like my colleague, sorry, board member here said, there are vastly different security profiles that constantly change for different models. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7464.874s">And</a>  so we would also like to, again, second the importance of regulating the use of specific models within the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7475.381s">You</a>  know, DeepSeek, which is owned by a Chinese company, may have different policies than OpenAI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7482.086s">So</a>  again, that is a concern we would like to second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7486.89s">In</a>  terms of environmental impact, we recognize, again, that these models have significant energy requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7494.695s">However,</a>  there is a general trend that these companies are turning to cleaner sources of energy we've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7501.4s">two</a>  purchases of and construction of nuclear power plants for the running of AI data centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7509.464s">So</a>  this is a trend that is not exclusive to the use of fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7515.768s">And</a>  then again, I wanna second the concern for cognitive decline as the result of over-reliance on these models.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7530.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7532.151s">That's</a>  quite a lot for your first meeting.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7533.711s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7542.395s">If</a>  this passes its first reading, we will have a second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7547.037s">I'm</a>  happy to take the request to explicitly call out energy requirements as a separate thing from general ethics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7556.281s">I</a>  think that's <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7557.881s">That's</a>  a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7559.082s">And</a>  the cognitive decline is a really important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7566.705s">It's</a>  embedded in the critical thinking, but I think maybe an understanding the impact of AI is maybe part of the literacy component of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7578.29s">So</a>  I think we can look at the policy with that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7583.272s">And</a>  I was going to say something <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7585.137s">else?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7585.577s">Oh,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7586.638s">I</a>  will note that I did add the phrase developmentally appropriate in front of technology use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7594.761s">And</a>  so I think in a future meeting, I may bring that to the technology responsible use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7599.663s">But</a>  I think that was part of the idea here in terms of what's happening to our brains as we use these tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7607.287s">Because</a>  that's that research is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7610.533s">coming</a>  out fast and furious, and to member on top was a point very alarmingly so.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7618.434s">Yes,</a>  although this is a very new topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7621.096s">So</a>  I just, again, would like to exercise caution in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7625.12s">And</a>  then one last point, which I forgot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7628.202s">The</a>  student handbook refers to generative AI as Gen AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7631.725s">This</a>  is a minor nitpick, which is fine, but it doesn't make clear that it's an abbreviation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7638.091s">And</a>  so it's just slightly problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7641.514s">It's</a>  not a huge deal.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7642.915s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7643.598s">I</a>  thought we put it in the first mention, but if we didn't, that can certainly be fixed.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7647.461s">Just</a>  gen.ai or any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7653.306s">Making</a>  it more clear than ever.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7656.77s">So</a>  if I could recap on the policy, I think I've heard a request to make clear that it is both student and teacher responsibility to check for bias, critical thinking and citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7677.836s">that</a>  we clarify the use of the phrase ethical use and that we reference not just critical thinking but also the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7695.289s">potential</a>  cognitive decline that is associated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7698.311s">Those</a>  are the three changes potentially that I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7703.713s">And</a>  the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7705.194s">And</a>  the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7707.935s">So</a>  I just wanted to recap that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7709.996s">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7713.252s">No,</a>  I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7715.333s">No,</a>  it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7719.835s">So</a>  potential updates would be reference to cognitive decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7727.319s">Like</a>  direct reference that it is the expectation of both students and teachers to check for bias and citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7738.624s">The</a>  environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7742.226s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7744.648s">We</a>  said the clarification of ethical is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7747.389s">And</a>  clarification of the word ethical to include environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7755.21s">So</a>  those are the three things that I'm hearing in the room that might warrant an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7762.912s">Can</a>  we also add security concerns in the selection of appropriate models for use in classrooms?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7769.757s">Can</a>  you say more about what you're thinking about?</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7773.501s">Yes,</a>  certain models have different policies when it comes to disclosure of user data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7778.205s">And</a>  as these are students and minors that are interacting with these models, it's important that in the selection of appropriate models, we keep in mind the security concerns.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7792.796s">Um,</a>  I believe that that is actually covered because it does talk about our data security practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7798.92s">So</a>  any tool that would be approved would have to be compliant in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7805.264s">Otherwise,</a>  it could not be approved.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7988.259s">I'm</a>  just going to give one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7995.257s">great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7995.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7996.238s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Pippa Sully. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7998.479s">So</a>  there's two more sections as previously stated that are updates to the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8003.642s">Um,</a>  this one is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8007.505s">June</a>  27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8008.825s">The</a>  U. S Supreme Court issued a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8011.747s">Um</a>  in Mahmood versus Taylor, which is requiring school districts nationwide to provide parents and caregivers the opportunity to review instructional content in advance if they request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8024.845s">to</a>  allow students to be excused or receive curriculum accommodations if it conflicts with their sincerely held religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8034.948s">So</a>  it is important to note that curriculum decisions still remain under the authority of public schools and that it does not alter our instructional standards or our program of studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8047.472s">But</a>  what it does is just affirm that upon request materials can be provided to parents and caregivers so that they can review and request reasonable accommodations for their religious objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8062.588s">So</a>  what that there is on the next slide language that we are adding into our handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8069.175s">so</a>  that we are consistent with the Massachusetts Regulation 603 CMR 26.05 Section 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8077.941s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools, through its curricula and materials, encourages respect for the human and civil rights of all individuals, regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8092.271s">And</a>  in accordance with district guidelines, families may request information from building principals <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8098.935s">on</a>  available accommodations related to curriculum content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8103.96s">So</a>  what we are encouraging here is our charge, our collective charge this year is about belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8110.565s">And</a>  that is for every single student, every single staff member, every single family member, every single community member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8117.411s">And</a>  so what we really want to ensure is that we are prioritizing conversation and communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8125.1s">So</a>  if there is a caregiver that has concern over any curriculum related materials, they need to reach out to the building principal who will engage in dialogue with the caregiver regarding the scope and sequence and what those curricular materials may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8142.175s">And</a>  on a district level that those building principals may reach out to Dr. Kim Talbot, who was our assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8155.95s">Member</a>  Ruseau, did you have a question about this topic before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8159.431s">Yes,</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8160.171s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8161.771s">The</a>  floor is yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8162.711s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8163.331s">I</a>  just wanted to be clear that accommodations does not mean alternative education.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8168.912s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8170.052s">We</a>  don't provide two educations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8173.553s">So</a>  when a student opts out, they will simply be missing out on their education or the education that we had planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8182.995s">They</a>  will not be getting an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8184.975s">They</a>  will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8186.204s">whether</a>  that's not being class or, you know, it depends of course on the class and the grade level and all that other, we're not sending a kindergartner to sit in the hall, but, or maybe I don't know what we're doing, but I just want folks to understand that that does not mean that every parent can decide they wanna have a separate education for their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8206.02s">They</a>  can decide that their kid will not get some education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8211.004s">I'm</a>  wondering about, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8214.379s">Parental</a>  review of curriculum is, have we gone down the path of what does it mean for review? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8222.209s">Like</a>  if I have a high school, if I didn't finish high school and my child is in AP physics and I wanna know what the curriculum is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8233.133s">Are</a>  we obligated to hand the curriculum over? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8235.914s">And</a>  I'm assuming, of course, probably inappropriately, but perhaps the parents will not be capable of knowing what the hell they're reading or looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8246.92s">What</a>  is our obligation to help them understand what the curriculum is? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8250.942s">I</a>  mean, when I started on school committee, I was like, let's see our sex education curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8255.524s">And</a>  I went in and I got it and it was a binder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8257.665s">It</a>  was like a thousand pages long or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8259.987s">Actually,</a>  it was multiple binders like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8264.154s">And</a>  that was quite the slap in the face for somebody who doesn't have an education background. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8270.599s">Like</a>  when I say, let me see the curriculum, that's not quite as simple a request as I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8278.224s">So</a>  are we saying we will, and I realize this maybe hasn't happened yet, and maybe we haven't worked it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8286.658s">but</a>  are we handing over, and by the way, when I was handed those curriculums, I wasn't like, those are licensed copies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8293.622s">I</a>  couldn't take them home because like, they were not, like we had a certain number, they belong to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8302.047s">Are</a>  we sending parents home with curriculum and being like, well, here you go, or are we helping them understand what's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8310.672s">And</a>  if that's the case, that seems like a very large, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8317.492s">amount</a>  of effort on our part. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8322.534s">And</a>  I realize that this is new, and maybe there isn't an answer, but I'm worried that we're going to be accused of burying parents who are wanting to perhaps opt their kids out of certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8341.34s">I'm</a>  worried about the teaching staff because all of our curriculum is not like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8346.891s">off</a>  the shelf curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8348.611s">It's</a>  not like there's like a, you know, a lot of our curriculum is because we've been improving and getting it, you know, modernized, but not all of our curriculum is here's the, you know, here's the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8362.495s">So</a>  what happens to teachers who teach a class that has no specific curriculum, that they've made it up themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8370.797s">And</a>  I know we have classes like that in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8374.918s">do</a>  they have, and I keep asking questions and don't let you answer, but I'm just very worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8378.641s">I'm</a>  trying to remember them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8380.762s">I'll</a>  stop talking, but this whole thing is freaking me out, as I'm sure it's freaking you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8386.747s">And</a>  I want, I'll just do one final thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8390.23s">I</a>  hope we're going to keep track of this very carefully, so we understand what it costs us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8396.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8398.836s">Dr.</a>  DeLuzzi?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8399.937s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8400.417s">So</a>  I think the biggest, as I previously mentioned, but the biggest piece that I want to say is that this requires conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8408.8s">So</a>  this is not a request that can be made through email or through just one phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8418.923s">This</a>  needs to be a conversation that building leaders are engaging in with caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8427.099s">It</a>  would require the caregivers to have a review of like the scope and sequence, so they can see maybe content that is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8437.989s">It</a>  is not something where it's an individual lesson per se but I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8443.553s">One</a>  of the things that Dr. Talbot is working on with directors is making sure that we have scope and sequence available to caregivers so that they can engage in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8456.242s">We</a>  are recording requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8458.904s">We</a>  are making sure that we're documenting our efforts of outreach <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8463.587s">and</a>  working with caregivers so that we can understand and have an internal path as to what was requested and how we came about those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8473.772s">Yes,</a>  it is true that the Supreme Court ruling did not rule that school systems are obligated to provide alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8484.438s">materials,</a>  lessons, activities for students, but a lot of I think that that also speaks to why the conversation is so important to have with caregivers and what that might mean for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8502.09s">So</a>  in like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8504.685s">Again,</a>  there is no judgment here, but I also want to make sure that the conversations are like what this looks like for the student and the impact that that has for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8516.494s">and</a>  what that means in terms of what their experience in that class will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8522.656s">And</a>  so making sure that parents know that it's a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8528.338s">The</a>  other piece is that this is about religiously held beliefs and content that may <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8540.014s">they</a>  may find objectionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8541.494s">And</a>  that also requires conversation to make sure we're getting at the root as to how and why does this particular content go against your religiously held beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8553.783s">And</a>  that's also a matter of conversation that needs to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8557.025s">I</a>  hope I answered your questions.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8566.962s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8568.443s">When</a>  you said it, the impact on the student, I think I'm reminded of our work on discipline that shows that when a student is out and they come back, every other student is negatively impacted by the need to bring that student up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8585.834s">When</a>  a student is missing and they come back, they didn't get what they needed yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8589.816s">For</a>  whatever reason, the teacher does not have <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8593.04s">you</a>  know, a bifurcation of curricula for every single student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8597.202s">So</a>  the student that comes back the next day having missed the content, it's like research has really solved all this, negatively impacts every other student in the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8610.25s">And</a>  so that's one of the reasons we should be incredibly careful about taking kids out of classes for discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8616.834s">So</a>  I think that I would just also say that we should include that in our conversations, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8622.51s">it</a>  isn't just that kid who might be removed because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8627.233s">In</a>  math and science where every single day is building on the previous day, I was never really an English person, so maybe in the humanities as well, but little is taught that is never referenced again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8646.343s">So</a>  deciding you don't want your student to receive some content <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8652.46s">there's</a>  not a lot of classes where that's the one time it's ever discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8655.922s">So</a>  I, I'm glad you're starting with conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8661.966s">Because</a>  that I hopefully can we can reduce this to a very small number. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8666.449s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8667.049s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8667.83s">Member</a>  Rheingold.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8670.969s">I</a>  was hoping you could comment just on what the expectations or requirements are for teachers in terms of posting syllabus having the curriculum night and I know we also in some cases do information sessions about potentially sensitive content, I know we did that when that when we. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8689.76s">in</a>  fifth grade when the puberty unit comes up, that is available as a resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8696.025s">And</a>  we've, I think, talked previously about listing what curricula are being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8701.049s">I</a>  know DESE has it on their site, but putting it on our website and saying this is the curriculum we use for math and for science. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8708.374s">As</a>  Member Ruseau mentioned, you can't just hand over a curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8712.897s">It's</a>  very protected, but what are the expectations for educators to make that information available proactively?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8721.483s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8722.084s">That's</a>  actually part of the ongoing conversations that we're having right now to make sure that things are kind of housed in one location and it makes it easier for reference and for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8733.251s">A</a>  lot of teachers use Google Classroom and it <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8738.054s">It</a>  is a landing page for caregivers and for students to be able to go right there and see what the syllabi, or the resources, or the content is and so us encouraging and making sure that that is still happening so that it's accessible to caregivers, especially at the secondary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8759.993s">is</a>  the expectation.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8761.113s">Not</a>  a mandate, but it is an expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8764.695s">Is</a>  it explicit or implicit? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8768.096s">A</a>  little bit of both.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8768.996s">I</a>  was just going to say, I know that's not answering your question, but that's pretty much how I would like to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8775.838s">Because</a>  it is, I mean, this was something that happened over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8781.14s">And</a>  so this is the work that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8783.917s">Dr.</a>  Talbot is doing with directors and school leaders, and they are doing with educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8790.902s">So</a>  that has been the expectation at the secondary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8794.164s">That</a>  is still the expectation as we work through what this looks like as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8799.848s">Of</a>  course, it's completely different for elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8802.49s">And</a>  so additionally, that kind of chain of command is if once teachers receive any sort of outreach or request from caregivers, they immediately go to their <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8814.049s">principle.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8815.511s">Because</a>  I know sometimes I sign a syllabus for my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8818.553s">Sometimes</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8820.915s">And</a>  different things are available at different curriculum nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8823.076s">But</a>  we've always had that information up front.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8826.339s">So</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8827.94s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8831.163s">Hi,</a>  I think our students have something they would like to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8834.305s">Is</a>  that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8835.246s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8836.767s">So</a>  hold on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8838.588s">Is</a>  your mic on red?</p>

    <p>[Christine DesAutels]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8840.01s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8840.19s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8842.31s">One</a>  of the main things is that it's opening up the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8846.272s">But</a>  one of the questions that we had is, who is having this conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8849.314s">Because</a>  they go to the building principal, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8851.796s">But</a>  is, first of all, the building principal having the conversation with the parent? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8857.459s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8858.019s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8858.179s">And</a>  then when it comes to the accommodations, are they the ones determining the accommodations on a building level? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8863.863s">Or</a>  is that overall, there's a list of accommodations that are acceptable?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8869.683s">There's</a>  not a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8870.643s">This</a>  is a case by case basis because it really depends on the specific needs of the family as well as what the content is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8877.927s">So</a>  that's why it really needs to be a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8880.828s">So</a>  the conversations are with the building principal and the caregivers, the parents, and then the building principal has conversations with the teachers to make sure that when it comes down to the student level, both the teacher and the caregiver are able to make sure that that communication is aligned.</p>

    <p>[Christine DesAutels]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8900.61s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8900.69s">So</a>  it will be case by case on what the accommodations are.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8904.553s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Christine DesAutels]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8906.454s">And</a>  then the other thing is, this is mostly for high school level, but is the student going to be involved in this discussion at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8916.48s">If</a>  they, for some reason, disagree with their parent, is there going to be a way to determine if that is a disagreement in there?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8922.664s">It's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8925.366s">That</a>  is a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8926.446s">And</a>  I'm really glad you raised it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8929.21s">And</a>  I, again, I would say that's why we need to have the conversation with the caregiver and why I did mention the impact on the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8939.193s">So</a>  I wanna be careful that I don't answer you by necessarily saying yes always all the time, but that would be the goal for sure.</p>

    <p>[Christine DesAutels]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8954.925s">Like,</a>  is the student going to be made aware of the conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8957.867s">100%</a>  included in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8959.989s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8966.034s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8968.056s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8968.736s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8970.017s">Member</a>  Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8973.383s">Christine's</a>  question raised another point, which is what kind of supports are available for the teachers to have these conversations in the moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8983.472s">Because</a>  sometimes it's something that comes up kind of unexpectedly if we've encountered it as we're reading or so facilitating the conversations in the moment in the classroom as well, I think is a really important piece here.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9003.723s">So</a>  I, I would say that that's why right now it's resting with the building principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9008.966s">And</a>  so if there is an accommodation made the principal is having conversations if it's it let's say if we're sticking with the high school level that conversation is had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9019.059s">with</a>  all the teachers that that student has on their caseload, but it may not be that there's an accommodation in every class. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9030.828s">So</a>  the support to teachers is coming from the building principal, and the building principal is getting support from Dr. Talbot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9040.935s">And</a>  so there's definitely a chain, a hierarchy here, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9044.938s">we</a>  also need to make sure that that conversation flow is happening from Dr. Talbot to the principals to the educators.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9052.34s">Right,</a>  so yes, I think that's the core of it, is making sure that this is being discussed in a department meeting or a building meeting, particularly since it's new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9062.942s">And</a>  I know educators want support in how to</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9066.671s">To</a>  respond has already had some meetings with principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9070.634s">There's</a>  lots of ongoing one on one conversations, but there's also group conversations happening.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9077.48s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9081.022s">Member</a>  Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9081.683s">In</a>  my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9084.677s">I</a>  think that this is gonna get really tricky as time goes on because I think maybe a discussion with the principal in one building with a parent is gonna be different maybe than a principal in another building with a parent just based on what the parent's needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9098.12s">And</a>  I just, I feel this tornado happening of social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9107.922s">Well,</a>  this is what happened here and this was our situation here and every case is gonna be case by case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9113.556s">So</a>  I just feel like this is going to really open up a door to a lot of stormy waters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9119.54s">I</a>  think everybody has the right to obviously be able to make the decision for their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9127.085s">But</a>  I think even as she said, moving forward as your older children, how do we protect a student? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9137.498s">from</a>  being, you know, chastised or, you know, like, I mean, where are we drawing the line here? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9141.4s">Like,</a>  this is really opening up a broad, a broad purview that we're really can't control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9148.664s">I</a>  mean, this is like, the more I'm hearing about this, I'm like, oh gee, this is gonna be tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9156.028s">This</a>  is gonna be tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9157.549s">I</a>  don't think it's as easy as just saying like, okay, you don't sit in math during this lesson and you can go for a walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9165.976s">I</a>  would say for appropriate, like, I mean, like you said, sorry, not to trip you, but like, even like kindergarten, we won't let you go in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9172.12s">Oh,</a>  well, we'll be like, what is, what is going to be the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9175.482s">Like,</a>  this is such a broad. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9177.203s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9179.224s">Really</a>  broad.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9182.827s">Well,</a>  and first and foremost, I would say that like ever since COVID the adaptability that education has had to have every year of <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9194.162s">building</a>  as we're going here, and last year with a lot of the way national decisions were made, I just think that this has been the nature of education for the past couple of years, which is why the conversation and the nature of the request is really the priority and the critical part. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9216.834s">I</a>  just can't say that enough because <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9221.961s">The</a>  chain, the communication chain of teachers going to principals and principals going to Dr. Talbot is what is making sure that there's not only like the level of support but the alignment, and it also depends on <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9238.4s">If</a>  it's high school, maybe there are experiences that they've already had that are going to be part of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9248.145s">That's</a>  why there's no way to answer this other than making sure we have conversations about why the request is coming in, what the nature of the request is, what the impact will be, and then trying to figure out <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9264.174s">what</a>  the accommodation needs to be, if any. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9267.315s">Maybe</a>  sometimes it's just the conversation that needs to be had, and there isn't an accommodation that's necessary because you had the conversation.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9274.437s">I</a>  just want to make sure that our principals and our staff, along with Dr. Talbot, are really being supported in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9282.279s">Because</a>  at the end of the day, as I always say, it's about the kids at the end of the day and supporting their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9286.801s">So</a>  it's really going to have to be individual and discussion-based.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9291.972s">So</a>  I would say for all of you, I would just highly ask that you respect that chain of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9297.073s">And</a>  just, you know, if caregivers are coming to you, then you need to put them back to the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9304.294s">And</a>  that's where the conversation starts.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9315.256s">I</a>  think we have one more handbook change to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9321.312s">Dr.</a>  Galusi.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9323.033s">And</a>  the last one is just updating the arrival and dismissal times, which is pretty easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9330.516s">It</a>  has been highlighted a lot in the Friday memos. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9335.418s">It</a>  is reflected on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9338.14s">It</a>  is here in this lovely chart, but each individual school has also just updated the change in either or both arrival and dismissal times across the district.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9351.773s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9352.054s">I</a>  think we have somebody who has had their hand up online for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9356.757s">Will,</a>  do you think you can unmute our guest? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9360.601s">While</a>  you do that, members of the public are welcome to speak for up to three minutes on a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9366.566s">And</a>  if you could please give us your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9374.392s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9376.694s">Hello?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9376.974s">Hi,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9377.675s">Yes,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9380.433s">Good</a>  evening, I was calling about safety concern at the Roberts Junior High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9386.116s">My</a>  name is Constantine Lombardakis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9388.477s">I</a>  live at 19 Joyce Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9390.338s">My</a>  son's a student at the Roberts Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9394.921s">I</a>  noticed on Park Street there's about four or five cross crossing guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9401.084s">And</a>  there's flashing lights and crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9404.546s">And</a>  everything school signs, but there's absolutely nothing on <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9409.567s">on</a>  Court Street at the main entrance on 35, at 35 Court Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9415.231s">No</a>  signs, no speed limit signs, no nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9418.293s">And</a>  that's the entrance that they use for the special needs students that enter the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9424.698s">I</a>  would like to see some sort of control there, whether it be a crosswalk on Court Street and some signs that say school and a speed limit sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9439.082s">maybe</a>  some flashing lights, some cones, but crossing guards would be good to have in front of the building, because that's where the special needs students go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9450.246s">And</a>  I've noticed that cars go speeding on that street, and also I've noticed kids slipping out of parents' hands when they're being brought into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9463.792s">And</a>  I talked to the sergeant in charge of traffic, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9469.672s">I</a>  also reached out to the special ed department, and I also called the mayor's office last Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9476.618s">I</a>  don't know if that's something you would be able to do there, but it would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9481.462s">I'm</a>  just concerned because my son enters the building there, and it's unsafe for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9488.147s">Would</a>  that be something that the school committee could do as far as getting <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9495.799s">some</a>  crossing guards and some kind of controls on that street.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9499.642s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9504.587s">Hi,</a>  thank you for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9507.209s">In</a>  general, a lot of those safety improvements that you're talking about would come from city resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9512.473s">But</a>  what we can do and I'm going to do is ask the superintendent to be in contact with the chief of police so that if there are short term measures like a crossing guard, that we can have that conversation because that would have <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9528.931s">that</a>  would happen under the guidance of the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9532.833s">So</a>  we can ask the superintendent to do that, and then also talk with the building leader and some of our municipal staff about the broader safety questions that you're raising. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9546.181s">So</a>  thank you for bringing those to our attention.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9548.422s">All</a>  right, because I watched a garbage truck speed by there last week, and it was unnerving. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9557.665s">I</a>  was going to bring my son to the front door and it's just not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9564.247s">It's</a>  very dangerous over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9567.728s">Something's</a>  going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9568.689s">It's</a>  not going to be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9572.19s">God</a>  forbid if anything happens, it would be good to put something there just to keep the kids safe.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9584.837s">Superintendent,</a>  did you have something you wanted to add? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9586.998s">Mr.</a>  DeSimone, is it at both arrival and dismissal that you have concerns or just one?</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9593.881s">Well,</a>  my son takes the bus home, but I bring him there in the morning and people are off and going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9602.324s">So</a>  they use that street to bypass Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9605.566s">So</a>  they speed up there to get over towards <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9610.83s">Forest</a>  Street and Lawrence Road just to cut through the traffic in Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9616.615s">So</a>  that street becomes a note for people that are trying to avoid the Method Square traffic and head towards Lawrence Road and towards that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9627.864s">So</a>  I see a lot of cars speeding down that street trying to get out of the school traffic on the Elm Street.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9639.645s">Okay,</a>  thank you, that's very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9642.145s">Thank</a>  you and thank you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9645.086s">We've</a>  waylaid the agenda here, so appreciate you hanging in with us and the superintendent will reach out.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9652.367s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9654.348s">Through</a>  the chair too, I know that Todd Blake, our traffic director and Sergeant Rogers have been in discussions in the last few days and are looking at this.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9663.029s">I</a>  spoke with the sergeant last week.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9667.634s">Okay,</a>  I was just updating the committee as well.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9671.177s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9672.037s">I'm</a>  sorry, let me interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9674.319s">Yep,</a>  they're in discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9675.62s">I</a>  know the area is too, I have got an update today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9679.784s">There's</a>  no room for a crosswalk, but they're looking into the area and potential plans with you on drop off for your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9687.93s">So</a>  we'll definitely stay on top of this.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9691.213s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9692.073s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9692.794s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9693.935s">Thank</a>  you, school committee, I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9697.371s">Thank</a>  you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9699.433s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Constantine Lembidakis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9700.854s">You</a>  too, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9705.097s">Is</a>  there a motion on the approval of the handbooks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9709.021s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9712.123s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to sever the AI policy from the handbook as we are currently discussing a lot of the AI possibilities in another policy and I'm afraid that they will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9725.61s">clash</a>  with one another in terms of development we have with the second reading of the policy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9731.373s">The</a>  motion is to sever the AI policy from the handbook approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9736.796s">Is</a>  your motion also to otherwise move approval?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9741.738s">Yeah,</a>  move for approval, but sever the AI policy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9745.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9746.741s">Motion</a>  by Member Intoppa to move approval of the handbooks with the exception of the AI policy, which will be on hold for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9756.915s">Seconded</a>  by Member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9761.437s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9762.798s">Yes,</a>  so the handbooks will not get published then, correct?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9770.301s">So</a>  the handbooks are available on school websites and Medford Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9776.825s">I</a>  would say the distinction right now is that the MPS AI guidance tool <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9784.063s">is</a>  listed in the handbooks, not as a policy, but as the guidance for caregivers and students to reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9794.169s">And</a>  maybe that is the distinction right now.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9797.731s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9798.392s">And</a>  that just as soon as you said that, I remembered that, you know, until a school committee actually has a policy, you have full policy authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9807.984s">And</a>  so the absence of us adopting an AI policy means you set AI policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9813.648s">You</a>  literally can say, this is our policy until we adopt a policy or, well, that's just the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9822.954s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9827.456s">I</a>  would just maybe just say that that document as created by the committee was guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9832.92s">And</a>  so that's what's in the handbook right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9835.461s">And</a>  I think that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9837.227s">important</a>  to make sure that caregivers and students are aware of what the guidance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9844.992s">And</a>  then we proceed with the reading of the policy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9855.219s">So</a>  the motion on the floor is to approve the handbooks <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9862.496s">with</a>  the exception of the AI component of the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9866.998s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9868.639s">By</a>  member Intoppa, seconded by member Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=9875.161s">Will</a>  you call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10135.599s">Patricia</a>  Cherry, 20 Wellesley Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10138.628s">So</a>  we just kind of wanted to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10141.57s">I</a>  know, Jenny, thank you so much for reaching out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10145.053s">So</a>  we do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10147.355s">We</a>  wanted to get an update on what this was going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10151.475s">I</a>  know that we came to you with some asks last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10154.977s">Best</a>  buddies programs going great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10156.618s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10158.979s">But</a>  as far as I've had some feedback about the buses and the Paris and the safety on the buses already and we're only two weeks into school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10169.205s">So</a>  if you could just kind of give us what you're thinking or what <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10176.31s">what</a>  you have plans to go forward with, what this is gonna look like.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10185.858s">Absolutely,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10188.16s">So</a>  right now what we're doing is having some internal conversations based on what this resolution said by member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10196.707s">We've</a>  had lots of conversations internally around need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10201.363s">and</a>  making sure where the coverage, where we have to schedule the coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10208.13s">Right</a>  now, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10210.312s">Bowen</a>  has been, Director Bowen has been working with school leaders on the schedule as reflected in this resolution based on the new CBA for the paraprofessionals where <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10224.325s">looking</a>  at the individual schedules at each school so that we can create assignments for bus monitors, especially starting with the prioritized areas first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10239.132s">We</a>  also did look into what it would mean for the company, the bus company that we have the contract with, to be able to supply that, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10252.537s">an</a>  astronomical cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10255.459s">So</a>  this is where we've between the flexibility that we have with some of the schedules of our staff members, as well as maybe the potential need for stipend depositions, we are now creating the schedules at each school.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10274.19s">So</a>  I just want to make sure because I don't want this to be, we've kind of noticed that we're seeing more door-to-door this year.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10285.214s">What</a>  do you mean by that?</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10287.294s">More</a>  offers for kids to take alternative vans.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10290.895s">Oh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10291.215s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10293.861s">And</a>  I'm just hoping that that's not the answer, taking our kids off the other buses and putting them on vans that some kids are now in the city of Medford on for an hour and some change on the way just to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10313.03s">So</a>  that's where I'm a little bit concerned that we are.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10317.956s">That</a>  has not been part of the conversation, just to put that right out there and to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10323.458s">No,</a>  right now it's just once the CBA passed, it's looking at what the schedules are at each school so that we can create the coverage that's needed at each school.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10336.063s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10338.744s">Did</a>  you have other things you would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10343.122s">infuse</a>  into the conversation so that when the report comes back at our next meeting, it can anticipate some of the other questions that you have about this coverage.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10352.425s">I</a>  think that was what I was- Regarding the paras and the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10357.827s">The</a>  buses, that was my biggest concern, is that kids are getting on buses at 2.30 in the afternoon, say from the high school, and then they're on the bus going to a middle school to pick up other kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10371.986s">And</a>  then they're, you know, and all because we now have larger amounts of kids on the vans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10382.538s">So</a>  kids that were taking, you know, the buses, but the other buses back and forth to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10393.288s">I</a>  was just concerned that I want to make sure that we're not taking those kids off rather than getting them a safety person on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10402.757s">We're</a>  not taking them off that bus that they're in inclusion with other kids and putting them on an already overcrowded van to solve the problem.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10412.162s">That's</a>  very helpful context. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10413.163s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10413.743s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10414.964s">And</a>  then that's for the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10417.286s">As</a>  far as the power is, we're still moving forward with them doing the professional development days with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10424.531s">That's</a>  all I really have on that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10521.873s">Seven</a>  any affirmative zero negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10526.415s">Okay,</a>  we still have a ways to go here, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10528.837s">So</a>  I'm going to take number seven, which is new business, we have an MSBA update, I'm going to try to give you a lightning update, so that we don't have to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10543.782s">here</a>  for too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10546.164s">On</a>  Thursday of this week and then again on the 7th of October, Dr. Galusi, the mayor and I will be attending the designer selection panel with 10 colleagues from the MSBA and out of those two meetings will come a decision about who our designer will be and we will execute the contract in the month of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10565.822s">With</a>  that designer on board, they will do two things that are sort of broadly called the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10571.764s">One</a>  is they will prepare for a January submission where we talk about, essentially, what is our goal and what are we trying to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10579.948s">So</a>  it includes things like, what is the educational program? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10582.949s">What</a>  is our space summary? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10584.129s">What</a>  are the existing conditions of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10586.75s">What</a>  are we trying to accomplish with this bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10590.532s">That</a>  is January 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10594.173s">In</a>  June of 2026, we will do the second half of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10600.652s">which</a>  will answer the question of what would a repair look like that is required by the MSBA? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10609.439s">What</a>  would an ad reno look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10611.481s">And</a>  what would a new building look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10613.283s">Those</a>  three choices are required by the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10616.726s">And</a>  those answers will be part of the report that we are targeting to the MSBA in June of 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10628.854s">From</a>  there, we will then go into the sort of heavier design where we will be picking the actual systems that go into the building based on the preferred design, either repair, ad reno, or new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10645.145s">Based</a>  on that, we'll start what they call schematic design, which is where we will look at the actual systems and the details and all of the nitty gritty that bring that box to life in a school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10658.014s">We</a>  will, that's where we will onboard the construction manager more than likely, who will work alongside us as we do schematic design. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10667.416s">And</a>  that process for schematic design will provide a scope and budget submission to the MSBA as well as ultimately a budget agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10679.759s">Our</a>  plan for schematic design submission is January 2027 with board approval in April of 2027 and a vote to authorize the project to move forward presumably by debt exclusion in May of 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10699.332s">That</a>  may spring vote will require approval by the building committee, it will come here, it will require a two thirds vote at the council and the agreement of the mayor to put those things on the ballot for decision by the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10716.523s">And</a>  then shovels can go in the ground once the project is greenlighted by the taxpayers and the funding sources are secured in collaboration with MSBA and the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10727.829s">So</a>  between now and June of 2027, there is a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10732.37s">But</a>  I just wanted to give you that update because the most exciting part is we get to start the feasibility study very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10738.031s">That</a>  is the question people are asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10740.132s">Are</a>  we going to build new? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10741.072s">Where</a>  is it going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10742.192s">Are</a>  we going to keep the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10744.193s">All</a>  of those questions get answered in feasibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10746.793s">So</a>  between now and June of next year, we will have those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10749.854s">And</a>  then we will begin moving forward based on a particular design. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10754.435s">Questions?</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10757.529s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10758.29s">You</a>  answered my question about what is required of city council may or school committee, particularly with the mind to there's an election going on and who we elect is going to affect this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10768.824s">My</a>  other question is when are the community conversations happening.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10772.462s">Once</a>  the designer is onboarded, they will lay out a schedule for all of that community input, which will be sort of many layers and phases, including time with educators, time with RCTE, time with the public, info sessions, all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10787.055s">So</a>  all of that will start once that team is onboarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10791.179s">We</a>  have four proposals, all very qualified designers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10797.124s">to</a>  work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10799.105s">And</a>  we will know who that is at the beginning of October, and then we'll execute an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10802.967s">And</a>  then it will really be a question of timing in terms of do we start those kinds of engagement conversations before Thanksgiving, between Thanksgiving and the winter break, or something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10815.913s">So</a>  that is a conversation that the building committee will have with the designer and the OPM so that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10821.576s">we</a>  can keep on this tight timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10823.997s">We</a>  are advancing some of the work due in January already, so that work is ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10828.92s">But</a>  the OPM feels good that our timeline can be met and will be met by whoever is selected at the designer selection panel on the 7th of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10842.171s">this</a>  year of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10843.552s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10844.973s">Yeah,</a>  so there's so the first meeting is this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10848.236s">It</a>  is sort of a roundtable like review of all of the proposals and then specific vendors will be invited back on the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10856.723s">And</a>  at that meeting, they'll be invited to answer some specific questions and provide a presentation and then the panel of 16 will vote.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10864.992s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10866.073s">And</a>  I would like to motion that this committee hear from the final designer about their thoughts or via the building committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10874.417s">And</a>  I was going to put a date on that, but now I'm not, I think perhaps before the feasibility study would make sense sometime between October 7th and the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10885.983s">And</a>  I defer to the building committee members to say what that,</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10890.125s">So</a>  there's a should be so the motion is to hear from the chosen designer at a school committee meeting upcoming as they commence their work, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10900.134s">By</a>  Member Reinfeld seconded by Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=10904.378s">Roll</a>  call.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11194.072s">So</a>  I think we, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11197.053s">We</a>  know that our district needs a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11199.113s">This</a>  resolution is written the way it is to frame kind of why we are where we are in the strategic planning process and to lay out that plan, recognizing that there is currently an interim leader, an interim person in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11212.938s">The</a>  superintendent position is currently interim and so the strategic planning subcommittee by definition defines a lot of the strategic planning and so the idea here is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11225.043s">My</a>  vision here is that the strategic planning committee, that the school committee will be leading the vision setting, and then a superintendent, once appointed, will do the how we get there component of the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11240.153s">So</a>  that's the thought here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11241.174s">But</a>  what does that process look like, given all of the community meetings that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11245.096s">we</a>  need to be having anyway all of the content that has already been developed that is in service of a strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11253.318s">It's</a>  this resolution is here because it's time to start the process and we have completed a lot of these other components that will feed into it and I think it's time to synthesize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11265.521s">That's</a>  that's my recap very quickly knowing that it's late but happy to questions, comments, etc.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11368.85s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11370.61s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11371.45s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11380.355s">seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion to waive the reading passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11384.496s">So</a>  I will just give a quick introduction to what's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11388.738s">Member</a>  Ruseau and I are the only ones who have ever gone through a superintendent evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11394.539s">So</a>  the goal of this was to do two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11398.041s">One</a>  is to give us a timeline for doing that because we are somewhat off cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11402.862s">These</a>  things typically happen in May or June for the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11406.584s">But</a>  we want to make sure that we are evaluating the superintendent at the one year mark as important input to our coming decisions about the superintendent, the permanent appointment of a superintendent on July one, that Jesse does also require <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11423.541s">that</a>  you set goals and then you measure progress against those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11428.184s">Because</a>  of where we are in the process, this asks that we will use DESE's goals for evaluating new superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11437.791s">And</a>  it also identifies the focus indicators on which I am proposing that we evaluate the superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11446.236s">So</a>  there are many <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11448.177s">There</a>  are many focused indicators on the evaluation and school committees are instructed to pick one or two per category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11455.662s">So</a>  the resolution lists the recommendation that I made around the one or two from each category. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11462.867s">There</a>  are four standards, but it also, for your reference, lists all the rest of the focus indicators that are possibly ones that we would use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11474.635s">and</a>  it does ask that the superintendent provide herself evaluation by the end of the calendar year this year, and that the superintendent's evaluation committee lead the process so that we are having this conversation by the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11488.72s">In</a>  a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11491.24s">Happy</a>  to take any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11494.141s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11495.222s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11497.923s">One</a>  of the questions I have is for the focus indicators, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11503.654s">Does</a>  the superintendent find that the list, those selected by member Graham in this resolution are acceptable? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11513.579s">What</a>  do you think about those?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11516.841s">Dr.</a>  Melissi. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11518.222s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11518.822s">I</a>  don't know if I was expecting that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11521.744s">I</a>  did review, of course, when the agenda was posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11525.346s">It's</a>  work that's ongoing and that I am engaged in doing, and I find them completely appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11533.546s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11533.907s">I</a>  thought they were appropriate as well, but I figured I should ask you in case you had thoughts on changing any of them.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11541.678s">No,</a>  I do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11542.48s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11547.587s">Member</a>  Olapade?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11549.335s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11550.575s">It's</a>  a question, I think, for both the chair and I think member Ruseau, just as a clarifying question, as you both have had prior experience, I know that you mentioned that DESE has their own valuating criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11561.12s">Are</a>  we allowed to incorporate our own criteria or things that we believe as Medford specific district would benefit from having? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11568.362s">That</a>  may also just be what you listed out as the prior experience, but I wanted to know, is that also been incorporated into this?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11576.063s">I</a>  can answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11576.924s">So</a>  in a typical cycle, the entire process starts with a goal setting where the superintendent says, this is what I think my goal should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11585.707s">And</a>  we say, yes, we agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11586.888s">So</a>  that's the Medford specific piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11588.929s">And</a>  then at that time, we also say, and these indicators are the things that will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11593.971s">Additionally,</a>  tell us that these goals are being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11595.992s">So</a>  that's what you would do in a typical process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11598.734s">Because</a>  we did not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11600.836s">My</a>  proposal here is that we use the Jesse's rubric essentially for new superintendents in terms of what they should be doing in their first year, so that we're not deciding in October to on goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11614.304s">and</a>  then we're going to evaluate them basically in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11617.067s">So</a>  the idea behind that shift was because we did not do the formal goal setting when she started for all the reasons that the resolution lays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11627.278s">So</a>  this is like a one-time kind of difference in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11632.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11635.407s">Member</a>  Reinfeld.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11637.047s">Yes,</a>  I'm hoping you can clarify, maybe for people watching and people new to the process, what is the role of community input into this evaluation process?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11649.272s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11650.793s">The</a>  role of community input can be any number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11656.115s">And</a>  when the evaluation subcommittee meets, they may choose to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11661.837s">work</a>  with the superintendent to identify something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11665.359s">Her</a>  evaluation the superintendent's reflection on her own performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11670.601s">It</a>  happens in this meeting, it is a matter of public record, the public is welcome to come speak for three minutes on any topic on our agenda so that stands and we can be really explicit about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11681.146s">If</a>  we want to be, I think it's sort of a general standing rule but <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11684.388s">given</a>  where we are at in this process, that could be something that we want to take some extra care to describe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11691.732s">And</a>  then the committee goes through a process where we all individually evaluate based on the rubric, and then that gets aggregated to a single <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11703.876s">evaluation</a>  and that comes before this committee and then this committee has to accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11708.139s">So</a>  that is another opportunity for community input that is built into the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11713.824s">But</a>  if the evaluation subcommittee wants to do something different, I think we are able to do those things if we want to.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11724.913s">I</a>  just looked at the website knowing that I'm on that superintendent evaluation <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11733.748s">member</a>  Olapati as the chair, but it says his name twice on our website instead of a third member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11740.272s">So</a>  who, I'm assuming it's either.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11742.613s">It's</a>  actually member Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11744.334s">Intoppa,</a>  okay, perfect.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11745.774s">But</a>  member Rousseau and I have done this before and we do have templates and we'll make sure that member Olapati has what he needs to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11755.119s">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11755.8s">And</a>  then I had just asked Will if he could update the webpage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11759.882s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11760.745s">with</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11761.446s">He's</a>  probably doing it right now.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11763.907s">We</a>  had that talk earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11764.788s">I</a>  was like, I can send you an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11765.989s">I</a>  know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11766.389s">And</a>  then we could just, since I'm on this and I had already asked him if we could just update the voting and non-voting members on the MSBA process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11772.734s">Those</a>  aren't updated also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11773.854s">So</a>  if we could just add that to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11775.776s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11776.256s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11781.22s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11783.381s">The</a>  mayor also was <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11784.878s">a</a>  person who has done evaluations too.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11787.059s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11787.64s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11788.3s">She's</a>  not in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11789.08s">So</a>  it's, I did want to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11791.602s">And</a>  I, I do have templates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11793.082s">I'm</a>  a template man. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11794.143s">So</a>  a lot of, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11797.905s">I</a>  do think it's important to, you know, one of the things you'll discover doing an evaluation is that, you know, in literally no other setting, probably on the planet, you are evaluating in public on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11815.129s">So</a>  it is a very, when you have constructive criticism or just criticism, it's a very uncomfortable thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11826.517s">Hopefully</a>  we won't have much, but it is a very, I do wish the legislature had found another way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11836.945s">Are</a>  they working? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11837.586s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11844.438s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11846.419s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11848.961s">For</a>  the time being, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11851.182s">I</a>  don't still think it's beneficial for the superintendent being evaluated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11855.284s">It's</a>  not beneficial for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11856.585s">It's</a>  not a beneficial for the students if we're pulling our punches and, you know, and it's just not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11863.889s">I</a>  also will say that our individual evaluations that we provide that gets <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11870.253s">combined,</a>  those are actually discoverable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11873.455s">So</a>  I mean, public record not discoverable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11876.357s">So,</a>  you know, just that'll be included in the instructions that you get, because I have a template for that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11885.664s">So</a>  that nobody gets confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11887.145s">Because</a>  it is, it is confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=11889.286s">And</a>  if you've done any evaluation of anybody in your life, it will have never been like this before.</p>
