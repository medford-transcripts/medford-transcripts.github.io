    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=915.061s">So</a>  I did just want to say thank you to the MNA and the team that worked with us to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=921.409s">We</a>  started meeting in maybe April or so, and it has been, you know, it's very difficult to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=929.599s">adjust</a>  for schedules during the summertime and they rose to that challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=934.804s">So</a>  I want to thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=937.247s">I</a>  want to thank them for the discussion, particularly when we got to talk about things that didn't work in our school buildings and come up with better ways to make things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=948.137s">on</a>  behalf of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=949.278s">So</a>  I really applaud their hard work and their delivering for our students at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=955.482s">So</a>  I really do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=958.444s">And</a>  Mr. Carboneau is here with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=962.727s">He</a>  is the bargaining liaison to the MNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=967.15s">And</a>  if you, I didn't know if you would like to say something or just have us say thank you, but you're welcome to say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=973.974s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.059s">You</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=978.939s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=979.8s">You're</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Mark Carboneau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=980.62s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=981.24s">So</a>  my name is Mark Carboneau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=982.7s">I'm</a>  an associate director with the Massachusetts Nurse Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=986.341s">And</a>  I just would like to say that this was a sometimes intense process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=993.283s">But</a>  I really felt that we collaborated to work together on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1000.325s">And</a>  I think that the document that we came up with, this collective bargaining agreement, was something <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1005.928s">everyone</a>  should be proud of and we look forward to working with you all on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1009.791s">So</a>  I'd like to thank chairperson Graham, who I was able to have a series of off the record discussions as far as off the record bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1017.218s">And</a>  I'd like to thank all the members for all the work you guys have done on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1020.941s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1022.602s">And</a>  I'd like to thank you on behalf of the nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1024.784s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1026.723s">Thank</a>  you, I will miss our daily chats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1031.685s">And</a>  I think for those who may be viewing this either tonight or in the future, some of the big central issues that we were grappling with was alignment of the schedule for the nurses to the new school day and the new professional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1045.931s">So</a>  that was a very big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1048.572s">We</a>  also worked through a number of changes to create <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1055.275s">a</a>  bank of flexible hours for the nurses to participate in some of the things that happen outside of their core hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1064.922s">And</a>  that I think will become really, really useful as we talk about how we register students in a timely way for athletics or for kindergarten or run vaccine clinics and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1079.212s">So</a>  there's any number of things that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1081.693s">In</a>  the past, we have had to sort of scrounge money to pay our nurses to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1089.18s">And</a>  we were able to integrate all of that into the contract which is a really big deal and create this bank of hours that will like allow really allow us to serve the needs that are going to evolve as this new schedule unfolds so I'm really <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1103.253s">delighted</a>  that we were able to get all of that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1106.794s">And</a>  the new schedule starts tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1108.895s">So</a>  we will, we will see you all on the new schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1114.457s">Thank</a>  you, Mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1117.779s">Is</a>  there a motion to take a brief recess? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1120.58s">By</a>  Member Intoppa, seconded by, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1124.941s">Member</a>  Ruseau, will you call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Jaden Ville]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1930.031s">Well,</a>  thank you, school committee, superintendent and mayor for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1935.057s">And</a>  my name is Jayden Ville, and I think I speak for all of us here when I say that we're here because we want to make a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1942.063s">We</a>  want to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1943.984s">The</a>  theme at MHS this year is belonging, making students feel like they're a part of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1949.368s">And</a>  we believe the key way to do that is making sure that students feel like their voices are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1954.933s">I</a>  know personally, I see a lot of students walking through the schools every day, and they have things they want to fix about the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1961.138s">They</a>  see certain things, and they just say, I wish it was something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1964.675s">However,</a>  they don't always have a platform to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1967.736s">That's</a>  where we come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1969.176s">We</a>  wanna champion the student voice, give a microphone to the voices that they wanna hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1974.578s">Because</a>  when we know that everyone is at the table and we have as many different constituents as possible and making an inclusive decision that we get the past results. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1983.48s">Over</a>  the past few years, started with seniors, Darren and Noah, the class of 2024, we advocated for students <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1992.735s">For</a>  a big concern we had was that students were kind of having trouble carrying their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=1997.617s">And</a>  so we asked that, you know, what if we could remove the backpack policy or have a way to something that can just carry around school to make their lives a bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2005.121s">Let's</a>  talk about the homework policy and how can we make students lives easier while they have the enriching part of homework, but also can balance it with their extracurriculars and ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2014.205s">And</a>  with class government just this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2018.318s">We</a>  open it up just from the original five class president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2026.123s">We</a>  open it up so that more students can run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2028.625s">And</a>  now there's 10 class representatives to better represent the class and help fundraise for our class and get more ideas done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2036.43s">However,</a>  the key to that success is not just raising questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2042.86s">It's</a>  about fixing problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2045.681s">And</a>  so that is why we continue to work and advocate for the student body here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2051.583s">And</a>  that's also why we are expanding our reach into the regional student advisory council to continue to see how can we not just help our school, our community, but also maybe our region, even the state as a large. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2065.727s">Archimedes</a>  once said, give me a place to stand and I'll move the earth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2069.902s">When</a>  I say, give us a place to stand, give us a voice and we can make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2075.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2075.647s">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2089.102s">Student</a>  involvement is integral integration, sorry, an integral part of the way that our school functions right it allows for the student voice that is generally under representative and splintered across many different perspectives to be assimilated and be <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2108.9s">presented</a>  to the school committee who has the power to make actual change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2113.224s">The</a>  legislation created by this committee and the changes wrought by it have had significant positive impact over the course of many years that the school advisory committee has been running. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2123.995s">And</a>  we hope to continue this legacy forward into the coming 2025-2026 year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2131.591s">This</a>  assimilation of ideas is not a process that happens out of nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2135.953s">It</a>  is a process that involves deliberation and that involves research, that involves taking the opinions of the student body and drafting solutions and speaking to members of school administration and members of the government here in Medford to find which solutions are reasonable, which solutions feel like they're attainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2158.353s">and</a>  then drafting responses, drafting opinion, which is brought here to you to deliberate on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2165.278s">And</a>  it is this process that has allowed us to have success in years previously, and we hope to bring forward into the following year when we talk about our regional council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2176.627s">Because</a>  the scope of these problems are not restricted to Medford alone, they're restricted to any student everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2183.064s">And</a>  by bringing these issues to a state level, we feel that we may be able to influence more schools and bring a better, more representative opinion of the student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2195.769s">This</a>  process is aided not only by my fellow committee members, but also by our advisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2201.552s">Freitas</a>  Haley, who provides <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2204.857s">I</a>  would say the role of another one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2208.319s">She</a>  also brings forward opinions, also questions our outlooks, also asks what can be done here to the point where we feel that her contribution has been just as instrumental as the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2223.947s">So</a>  I'd like to give a special shout out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2228.03s">This</a>  is especially meaningful to me because it is an outlet through which we can <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2233.129s">enforce</a>  ideas of effective altruism and change that we can bring that is positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2239.652s">The</a>  devotion of our life to the helping of others is, in my opinion, the highest pursuit, and this opportunity is the epitome of doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2250.457s">I</a>  believe that it's a podium that we all strive for to accurately represent those that place their faith in us, and we hope to continue doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2261.222s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2271.105s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2273.126s">So</a>  I'm going to say that I first joined this group of people back in like junior, sophomore, freshman year, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2282.332s">But</a>  I joined it because I had a lot of ideas, and I didn't really have anywhere to go with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2288.716s">And</a>  I think that that's part of the reason why this is such an important group of people is because we <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2295.459s">take</a>  in those ideas, we gather together the people in the student involvement organization, which is the like broader group of the student body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2303.222s">And</a>  we sort of conglomerate them into like this big group in order to find the commonalities between them and find ways that the student body is agreeing that there's something that needs to happen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2316.367s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2318.83s">as</a>  a group of driven individuals and with the help of the broader population, we're able to draft up ideas and find ways to fix those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2329.176s">And</a>  I especially appreciate this because it's such a like general process that involves so many different voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2334.919s">And</a>  it gives a chance for people to bring forward their ideas and bring forward their solutions in a way that they're not usually able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2344.744s">Because</a>  other than this group, the main other way to have <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2349.398s">a</a>  voice at a larger administrative role is through student government, which is honestly a harder process to get into and ends up blocking out a lot of different voices, which we've been trying to fix with the expansion of that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2364.443s">But</a>  still, if people have an idea, but they don't necessarily have the chance to run for student office and put in that time just for that idea, this gives them an outlet to bring it forward, then we discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2378.668s">And</a>  we find what sort of problems come from that initial problem, what sort of solutions come from the initial solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2386.512s">We</a>  are able to bring together all different ideas and all different voices in a very broad discussion format in order to formulate the best <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2396.177s">option</a>  plan to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2398.118s">And</a>  then from that discussion, we bring things to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2401.48s">And</a>  we bring this fleshed out idea that comes from so many different voices, so many different perspectives, and really, I guess, epitomizes the student body's voice in a way that no other group really seems to do.</p>

    <p>[Jaden Zhang]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2424.947s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2426.048s">Um,</a>  so I believe I joined student advisory committee when I was back in sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2432.413s">Yeah,</a>  when I was a sophomore, and I had seen a problem and I had wanted it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2438.073s">So</a>  I am a part of the Vogue School at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2442.437s">And</a>  something about the Vogue School is that schedules are very different compared to like the normal high school where half the day consists of your shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2452.725s">And</a>  because of that, a lot of people weren't able to take the classes they wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2457.029s">So</a>  I saw an opportunity to try and change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2462.554s">I</a>  got some friends, we talked about it and we were like, yeah, you should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2465.896s">So</a>  I joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2467.542s">and</a>  this year we finally got it implemented and that made me very happy because I could finally take the classes I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2476.688s">Something</a>  I've noticed like these past three years was that a lot of people like to use our organization as kind of like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2489.356s">a</a>  therapeutic like kind of area where you can vent your worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2493.038s">We</a>  have like guidance Councilors that measured high and a lot of people like to vent to them too, but it's not the same as like venting to your peers, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2499.981s">And</a>  at the same time, we also get stuff fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2502.422s">We</a>  can listen to their ideas, bring them up with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2507.964s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2515.848s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2518.449s">Member</a>  Tapa?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.183s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2520.983s">It's</a>  no surprise to anyone that I'm super psyched about this because I was a member of student government at Medford High and then also all throughout higher education was involved with student leadership and student government and how do we advise and work to help form policy that we want to see every day that affects us every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2540.388s">And</a>  it's what led me to being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2542.828s">And</a>  I super appreciate the idea of expanding that and for bringing this committee back to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2548.81s">I</a>  loved working with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2550.691s">two</a>  years ago a lot on some things and I'm really excited to see what you bring to the table moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2555.577s">So</a>  thank you very much for doing this work and I really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2567.622s">Oh,</a>  I was going to say thank you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2569.685s">And</a>  just to let you know, so the rules of the school committee have a place for the student representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2575.953s">And</a>  we hope to see at least one of you at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2579.518s">And</a>  just to, I think, work with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2582.943s">Freitas</a>  Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2584.605s">members</a>  of the committee to figure out how you get on the agenda if you have things you want to talk about and of course anything that we're discussing on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2591.849s">Your</a>  seat is there but I think member on top is the one who's going to get tapped on the shoulder and borrow his microphone at any point, because we really do want to hear from you and a lot of the things that we do here come from <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2603.855s">your</a>  voices, whether or not they are in this public forum, but I love the idea and the practice of making them more visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2610.439s">So</a>  thank you for being here and keep showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2613.201s">And</a>  we want you to be part of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2615.302s">And</a>  I think many of us would be very happy to be invited to your meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2619.024s">I</a>  think several of us attended in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2621.785s">We</a>  can't all show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2623.607s">That</a>  would be a problem for open meeting law, but we would love to be a part of it and make sure that this conversation goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2629.95s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.251s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2635.611s">I</a>  think something that my colleague just mentioned actually both my colleagues mentioned is seeing a need and feeling a need I think you all kind of commented in your own ways that noticing something that you're seeing day to day in your classroom in your school, you know, amongst your peers your friends your teachers, whatever may be, and acknowledging that there's an opportunity here as someone who's witnessing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2654.36s">I</a>  have a perspective that I want to communicate out to the people who can make the changes that I'd like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2658.622s">And</a>  it's something really important that we don't get the privilege of seeing necessarily because we're not in the classroom each day like you all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2664.264s">So</a>  I think maintain that, hold on to the opportunity that you are noticing to say, what can I do as someone who is seeing this need and how can I fill it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2672.927s">And</a>  even if that's just coming to a meeting like this, sitting in that student advisory chair and letting us know what you're noticing, what your colleagues or your peers are seeing and how we can best support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2681.79s">So</a>  I think just appreciate that you guys are seeing that and you're actually living into that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2685.771s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2691.16s">I</a>  just want to say thank you.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2755.543s">I</a>  think that we all feel very grateful that you recognize the importance of student opinion in the creation of legislature affecting said students, as we hope that we can provide a touchstone for the student body throughout your decision making process and look forward to the future year.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2903.134s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Pippicelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2907.225s">So</a>  at the beginning, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2908.966s">At</a>  the beginning of each school year, we usually report on just a brief overview of the enrollment at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2917.213s">So</a>  making sure that we have the disclaimer that enrollment at this time of year is pretty fluid and it fluctuates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2925.72s">I</a>  can make sure that I provide this body with <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2929.432s">updates</a>  as we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2931.494s">The</a>  October 1st SIMS data is due to the Department of Education by the end of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2938.679s">So</a>  right now, currently, as of last week, our total enrollment is 4,125 students across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2948.085s">Here</a>  on the screen, you have just a snapshot of grade level and school with the district-wide view of 4,125. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2958.132s">One</a>  of the things that I want to just call out is there's an asterisk, there is a column that says TBD. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2965.598s">There's</a>  a small number of students that are still not officially enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2970.682s">They're</a>  just through the registration process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2973.744s">This</a>  year we have put some parameters in place to make sure that we are getting students into our buildings as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2981.63s">And</a>  so that we're not having students wait longer than a few days before they're entering Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2987.494s">However,</a>  there are some pieces of <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=2991.717s">Things</a>  that can hold that up for some students, that's EL testing, special education placement, or sometimes just medical needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3002.443s">Director</a>  Silva is working with families directly because we don't want that to be a barrier to them starting school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3009.507s">Those</a>  are some of the pieces that we've kind of put in place this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3014.191s">but</a>  you will see just across the board what the enrollment looks like at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3019.853s">I</a>  will pause here before we go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3021.714s">I</a>  don't know if there are any specific questions that you may have regarding enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3031.037s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3032.457s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3035.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3035.998s">Without</a>  digging through the data, are we approaching the need for any more kindergarten classrooms?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3043.557s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3044.538s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3045.298s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3046.398s">Actually,</a>  I think what we've seen a little bit this year is we have seen a decrease in some of our student enrollment or populations, especially around EL families.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3063.486s">Well,</a>  that's a whole conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3065.507s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3068.92s">But</a>  I could just remind, I will just maybe, I'm sorry, Member Graham, but just to remind people that we did, the Roberts, since COVID, we've always had, we've had to put in a fifth K section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3081.964s">They</a>  started this year with one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3083.384s">We</a>  just, it was automatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3085.325s">We</a>  did have to add kindergarten classrooms everywhere but the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3094.148s">Well,</a>  no, the Missittuc, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3096.566s">is</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3097.167s">They</a>  have three of every section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3100.649s">The</a>  Brooks has five, the Missituk has four, the McGlynn has four, and the Roberts has five.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3107.834s">Member</a>  Branley, did you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3111.436s">I</a>  just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3112.777s">Do</a>  you know offhand the number of students that we had enrolled on our 10-1 report last year?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3119.245s">We</a>  have, there is a just, well, I would have to go back just to make sure because when looking at the data for last year, it's the entire year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3127.972s">And</a>  right now I just have like a month's snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3131.214s">So</a>  it wouldn't be fair to necessarily tell you what those numbers were at the end of last year because enrollment ebbs and flows throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3140.621s">But</a>  there is at least like a 25 student difference.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3146.365s">Is</a>  it an increase or a decrease? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3147.786s">Decrease.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3150.279s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3152.44s">Yes,</a>  I have the report from last September 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3158.322s">And</a>  we had 4,207. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3161.664s">Interestingly,</a>  just three days before that, we had 4,214. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3166.106s">So</a>  when we say it's fluid, it's kind of wildly fluid at this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3173.229s">Do</a>  we have the EL students? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3176.49s">Is</a>  that a separate category on there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3178.391s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3181.041s">Not</a>  on the one that is on this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3183.802s">I</a>  can get you that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3185.202s">OK,</a>  that'd be good to know.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3187.823s">And</a>  my question is too complicated for this, but I just have a lot of questions about EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3195.845s">And</a>  when students leave, not just EL students, when all students, when students leave the district, there's not often a, we're leaving, goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3210.157s">And</a>  so it's hard to know why they left. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3214.919s">We</a>  know if they go somewhere else and then that place asks for their transcripts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3219.561s">That's</a>  sort of the only way to know, but not all students, that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3225.284s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3226.384s">The</a>  overarching piece I could give you is there are two buckets for that data trend right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3233.368s">And</a>  there are students that have left the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3236.86s">either</a>  permanently or visiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3239.741s">But</a>  if it's for an extended amount of time, then that does affect their registration and they have to kind of go through that process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3247.405s">There's</a>  the other bucket, which students have left Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3251.828s">And</a>  so we do have the data as to the places that they have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3257.07s">The</a>  majority are not to a private or parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3261.993s">The</a>  majority are actually, they have moved residency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3266.337s">I</a>  can give you that breakdown if you would like.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3268.099s">I</a>  would.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3269.24s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3271.642s">Member</a>  Olapade.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3274.044s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3274.444s">I</a>  had a quick question about the high school enrollment data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3278.088s">For</a>  the final report, I know this is just preliminary, would there be a way to separate MHS from MVTHS just so we have an idea about the actual numbers of students that are allocating from the middle schools and then students that are coming into the districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3289.337s">I</a>  know that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3290.238s">the</a>  middle school count is 282, you know, obviously, but then the count for ninth grade is 307, so there is a, you know, 25, 30-ish student uptick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3299.941s">So</a>  just understand what that looks like and where that's coming from would be just awesome to have.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3304.503s">Yes,</a>  so because of the freshman rotations, I won't have ninth grade yet, but I can give you the split for 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3313.586s">Awesome,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3317.908s">Member</a>  Branley?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3321.392s">just</a>  to follow up on member Rousseau's comment for the special ed piece I know that I code all the kids in a couple of different aspects of where they're moving to and why when they unenroll so if they don't come to school for so many days obviously the school will flag us and let us know and then we have to put that code in <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3340.185s">And</a>  there are times that I'm sure it happens with the Yale students, because that's not my department, but with the specialist students, I'm like, well, where did this kid go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3345.829s">You</a>  have to show that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3348.431s">And</a>  then so when we're placing students, which happens to me every day in my role during the day, but all those specialist students come through my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3358.779s">How</a>  long does it take us to in Medford to place a special ed student?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3364.567s">I</a>  think that varies depending on the needs, but we worked, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3370.211s">Bowen,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3370.872s">Silva,</a>  and I worked very hard to make sure that we're shrinking that timeline based on some of the data we were collecting last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3379.579s">So</a>  I can get you what those specifics are, but we're really hoping for no more than three days.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3386.004s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3388.606s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3388.986s">I'll</a>  put three days-ish.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3392.809s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3394.284s">Any</a>  other questions about enrollment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3397.587s">Member</a>  Lopate?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3398.228s">It's</a>  just to clarify, what does the KF stand for?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3403.072s">That's</a>  kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3404.734s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3405.735s">No,</a>  I'm glad you brought that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3406.776s">KF</a>  is kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3408.758s">PK</a>  is pre-K or our MEAP programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3412.341s">And</a>  then I believe at the high school, the SP is project transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3418.763s">So</a>  that's for our students that are 18 to 22 years old.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3422.644s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3423.764s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3487.283s">All</a>  right, so the school-based handbook, family and student handbooks saw three updates globally for this 25-26 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3498.345s">That</a>  was for the Metro Public Schools AI responsible use policy and guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3504.027s">It</a>  was for the expansion of curricular accommodations based on sincerely held religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3509.868s">And</a>  then it was the adjustments to our new arrival and dismissal times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3516.233s">So</a>  first we had a very dedicated group of Medford public schools administrators and staff members that worked throughout the year Tyler tirelessly last year to create language for students and staff and families around our AI policies guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3534.879s">One</a>  of those was school committee member Erica Reinfeld, and joining her from Medford Public Schools staff was also Molly Layden, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Will Pippicelli, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Dr. Peter Cushing, and teachers Dan Wagner, Jason Campbell, Rebecca McGinnis, Allison Quealy, Grace Turnbull, May Abusan, and Lindsay Rapucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3558.992s">So</a>  they worked throughout the year to create a comprehensive tool that lays out the responsibilities and the resources that are available to our community around the guidance for AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3572.582s">So</a>  the principles, just to highlight like the principles of this guidance were how the resources would support teaching and learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3580.601s">It</a>  addressed data privacy and security considerations, and it supported the ethical and responsible use of generated AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3591.283s">If</a>  we go to the next slide, DESI has come out with their, last year they had their suggested timeline for districts that they wanted to see engage in this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3604.945s">And</a>  this to the left was their projected timeline for doing such work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3610.284s">So</a>  for us here in Medford Public Schools, we have met their deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3615.546s">DESE</a>  had the policy going into effect next school year, 26-27. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3620.687s">We're</a>  just a little bit ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3625.048s">What</a>  we are continuing to work on, I would say, would be just further professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3631.23s">There</a>  has been some professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3633.751s">throughout</a>  last year around cyber security around AI and the use of it in classrooms, but the continuation of offering professional development to our staff is still a goal and still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3649.117s">If</a>  we go to the next, just the high level pieces that are in this AI guidance, all we have here just to give the community a brief overview is like a list of the table of contents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3664.564s">So</a>  these are the areas that are explained in the Medford Public Schools guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3670.805s">guidelines,</a>  both for students and for educators, there are embedded resources and links for people to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3679.611s">I</a>  don't know, Member Reinfeld, if you wanted to maybe highlight anything or mention anything about the work.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3690.788s">I</a>  will note that this was not done in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3693.609s">This</a>  was informed by a district-wide survey of, I will say, staff, teachers, administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3700.092s">There</a>  were conversations around bringing in feedback from students and from families as a follow-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3706.234s">The</a>  goal was really to get something on paper, but I think we had 120 or so responses, and we pulled out patterns, and we looked at those, and that really informed the discussions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3720.481s">And</a>  I will say this when we go to read the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3724.703s">Well,</a>  maybe I won't since I'm saying it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3727.365s">But</a>  the review timeline on this we set at one year because things are changing so much as we learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3737.652s">and</a>  as different software companies, programs decide to comply or not comply with student privacy laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3746.114s">So</a>  this is something that will be continually reviewed and that was always the goal and to see how with an eye to our student council representatives here, how this is actually affecting students and what this looks for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3758.776s">So</a>  we were looking for a policy and guidelines that teachers at different grade levels and in different subject areas could <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3767.618s">customized</a>  to the needs of their particular learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3770.861s">So</a>  those were all parts of the conversation that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3773.383s">I'm</a>  happy to say more or answer specific questions, but I don't need to go on about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3779.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3780.849s">Other</a>  questions, members of HAPA?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3787.134s">So</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3788.175s">Thank</a>  you for all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3789.837s">So</a>  we have on our agenda a policy on AI guidance and how that's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3796.834s">If</a>  we vote this into the handbook, is that the same ruling? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3800.176s">Or</a>  are these two different rulings for two different things? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3802.638s">Because</a>  inherently, if we vote yes on this, it automatically brings it in.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3806.02s">So</a>  the policy that is in paper, it takes the educator and student guidelines directly from the materials in the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3815.686s">The</a>  handbook contains additional information, like the resources and the language for syllabus, which wouldn't be a school committee policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3823.951s">And</a>  then the policy also adds a little bit of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3826.753s">top</a>  level framing for the policy book and a section on use in district operations, just because that was new guidance that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3836.98s">The</a>  committee was really focused on the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3840.282s">But</a>  are you asking whether we then have to approve both things in both places every time?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3846.626s">I'm</a>  asking in terms of, no, I was just more of like if they were similar because <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3851.482s">I</a>  have opinions about generative AI, and I have concerns, and I have issues with it, specifically how it's being used in the handbook and in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3862.291s">And</a>  I was just making sure that how we vote on the handbook doesn't affect the policy, because I get into my specifics in reviewing the full policy in the text that it's written.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3876.005s">So</a>  a lot of the language is overlapping and I think one of the, as we discussed in the handbook policy, the handbook update policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3887.651s">those</a>  get reviewed and then summarized to align with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3893.416s">So</a>  if the policy changes, the handbook would then have a follow-on update to reflect the new policy.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.54s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3899.7s">Yeah,</a>  because just my question was then, do I say my concerns now, or do I wait till the policy reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3904.985s">But</a>  if I can just wait until the policy reading, I can more dissect it in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3910.209s">It's</a>  a good question.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3912.25s">So</a>  what I might suggest is that you, at some point, when we're done, and I would like to hear from our students, a motion to sever the AI approval in the handbook until we get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3927.375s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I was planning on doing.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3929.676s">So</a>  thank you for affirming that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3930.776s">I</a>  think I would just like to second that.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3939.939s">With</a>  regards to generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3942.134s">my</a>  understanding that this is not the time to talk about that, but we have also some concerns with specific wording within the school student handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3950.761s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3953.443s">So,</a>  member Intoppa, do you want to make a motion to sever the MPS AI guidance from the handbook?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3963.151s">Motion</a>  to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3964.292s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3965.133s">Handbook</a>  approval or handbook</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3968.352s">Okay,</a>  if that makes the most sense, then I'll motion to, I'll take the recommendation of Member Ruseau, motion to table the handbook discussion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3974.754s">Okay,</a>  there's a motion to table the handbook discussion by Member Intoppa. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3978.615s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3979.615s">Second</a>  by Member Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3982.656s">Roll</a>  call, please.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3984.396s">Member</a>  Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3985.817s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3987.557s">Sorry,</a>  I just, I would like to hear the rest of the overview of the handbook updates before we table the full discussion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3995.099s">I</a>  think- Motion to table is undebatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=3998.835s">to</a>  be withdrawn.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4000.937s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4001.217s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4001.677s">So</a>  it's like 10 minutes from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4004.119s">So</a>  I think it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4004.979s">We</a>  can just shift gears.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4077.007s">That's</a>  what I've described here.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4084.72s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4085.32s">This</a>  project now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4088.702s">Which</a>  one? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4089.883s">Well</a>  yeah I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4092.644s">So</a>  I would say specifically the HVAC project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4095.225s">Okay</a>  so right now we have the McGlynn and Anders HVAC project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4098.387s">We</a>  have an owner's project manager JLL who's driving that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4102.209s">They</a>  work with the architect B2Q and the contractor Consigli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4107.692s">And</a>  what Tom Ellis the representative from JLL is recommending <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4113.514s">we</a>  identify someone to learn those systems as they bring them on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4117.315s">They</a>  haven't started up any of those systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4119.056s">The</a>  software is not even purchased yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4121.257s">So</a>  we want to get this person in and ready to be able to hit that ground running when they're ready.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4126.158s">Okay,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4127.118s">The</a>  existing systems are managed by our maintenance staff.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4130.62s">And</a>  they have the equipment to do what they need for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4134.081s">And</a>  then obviously everything will be updated when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4136.942s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4137.082s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4137.582s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4143.445s">Thank</a>  you for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4145.105s">You</a>  just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4145.725s">Is</a>  there any type of shift in the qualifications of the applicant needs to have or the commensurate pay or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4152.246s">Or</a>  is it just the expectation of the needs that you're recognizing?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4155.327s">I</a>  think I think the pay is anti pay is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4159.488s">I</a>  think that there's we look for a little bit more of a mixture of experience rather than just someone who's saying, you know, a contract is licensed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4165.789s">Some</a>  of them are HBC experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4167.069s">What</a>  is the core or mixture that?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4168.91s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4181.955s">It's</a>  the same one.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4240.652s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4245.756s">Next</a>  up, we have continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4249.259s">We</a>  have an update and recommendation to approve the Cummings Foundation $35,000 grant for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4258.967s">Mr.</a>  Trotta submitted a report, and I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galusi.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4265.089s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4266.81s">So</a>  I know that Mr. Trotter provided the membership with a little bit more description. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4274.813s">I</a>  will say that just to maybe get to like the key points in conversation with Mr. Trotter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4282.905s">The</a>  language that was in there that was causing some concern, I believe, was in there mistakenly and will not be in there in the future years of this grant, which is a 10-year grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4295.391s">But</a>  you can see here the categories of pretty much how that for this school year, which follows how the other budgets have typically gone, what the buckets of spend are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4307.958s">So</a>  the largest here is for staff stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4312.2s">So</a>  there are chapters of CCSR at every school across the district, and these are going to the stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4320.644s">Now,</a>  every school has one stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4323.946s">Some</a>  schools, depending on the number of students that are in that chapter, they may have two advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4329.829s">That's</a>  work for this year that's still unfolding to see how students are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4335.232s">participate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4336.353s">Some</a>  of the stipends also go to administrative assistant or secretarial type work in order to keep the purchase orders for materials and supplies going through Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4349.905s">So</a>  it's not just, just to clarify, there's those additional stipends, one stipend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4357.283s">A</a>  bulk of the work goes to the supplies and the materials that are needed for each chapter to engage in the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4367.133s">So</a>  when students are working with their advisors to come up with what they want their project, their civic minded project to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4376.18s">There's</a>  money that's allocated to their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4380.543s">I</a>  did ask about professional development materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4384.326s">I</a>  did learn that there is a resource library in the Medford High School library that all of the advisors have access to, and that library keeps building in terms of resource for the advisors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4398.515s">And</a>  then the last piece was just a small amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4402.818s">If</a>  there is an advisor, which has come up in the past, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4406.605s">wants</a>  to bring students on a field trip or bring in a guest speaker that is related to the work that they have chosen to do, that money is earmarked for just in case opportunities throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4423.356s">Happy</a>  to answer any further questions that you may have.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4428.119s">Member</a>  Intoppa, Member Reinfeld, and then Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4432.682s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4433.803s">I'm</a>  really happy to see this <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4436.178s">breakdown</a>  and also you know the clarification in terms of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4439.28s">I</a>  think one thing to make very clear and important to folks is that this is not the only basis of funding for the CCSR, that the CCSR actually, especially in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4451.907s">secondary</a>  education part of the CCSR actually encourages students to get grants elsewhere and to help fund the projects through that as a way of project learning and a way for folks to learn how to do that in the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4464.151s">I</a>  know that my project in the CCSR was mainly funded actually through Tufts and through Harbor Freight and that was done in with my advisor Michael Skorka teaching me how and Richard Trotta teaching me how to sort of do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4477.514s">So</a>  when we see <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4480.616s">These</a>  numbers outside of the scope of, well, how does that fund everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4485.198s">It's</a>  important to know that at the core of the CCSR they are teaching students how to be advocates and how to advocate for themselves in terms of what they want to get funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4493.683s">So</a>  oftentimes they're reaching out to community partners for sponsorships and a lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4498.646s">So</a>  just kind of like a point of information, I guess, about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4502.289s">this</a>  funding when we see this here and we go, well, how does 4,000 sustain the various grade levels and various intricacies of projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4509.252s">Oftentimes</a>  we rely on our community partners and thank them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4513.234s">So</a>  thank you for the clarification and I appreciate all the information presented.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4520.117s">Member</a>  Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4523.238s">Yep,</a>  I just wanted to thank Mr. Trotta for providing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4525.879s">I</a>  know I was the one who severed this last time and I just want to say thank you for providing the additional info. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4530.461s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4532.794s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4535.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4537.038s">I</a>  was just looking at the letter again from last meeting, and I don't really feel like we got answers to the question we were asking, which was, what does the grant require? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4547.848s">The</a>  letter explicitly references a relaxing of requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4552.378s">what</a>  were the requirements and what are the requirements now is still unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4557.462s">And</a>  I went back and looked at the presentations from June and I still don't know how the $29,000 gets spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4565.128s">I</a>  mean, is it $28,995 for one person and a dollar for each other person? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4570.152s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4571.192s">It's</a>  not in any of the presentations we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4574.775s">So</a>  I'm not satisfied that this answers our questions and I'd like to get those questions answered.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4583.088s">I</a>  think that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4584.469s">So</a>  I have requested a further drill down from Mr. Trotta around this for this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4593.354s">I</a>  can go back and get it for last school year, if that is the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4597.837s">This</a>  school year, we just don't have it yet because the participation is still, they're still kind of like building through enrollment of student participation, the number of advisors and what that will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4609.664s">But</a>  I'm happy to give that to you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4613.443s">I</a>  would like last year's Yeah, I mean, because my sense after all these years is it's, it's pretty much been the same for the last eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4623.566s">Well,</a>  almost whatever the years have been, it's been, we've been paying the staff and everybody about the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4631.229s">But</a>  I don't know who's getting paid what. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4634.736s">And</a>  that's really not, I mean, if it has nothing to do with us and we shouldn't be talking about the CCSR in any way, shape or form, then let's say that and stop talking about the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4644.74s">But</a>  we talk about it a lot and I have no idea what happens to the money and where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4649.702s">And</a>  that's not my opinion as a body that is responsible, acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4656.525s">So</a>  last year would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4658.786s">And</a>  if it's particularly different than the year before that, then I'd like to know that too.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4666.45s">Member</a>  Intoppa.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4668.533s">My</a>  understanding for one for the in terms of where we find what those that is actually outlined in the 10 year grant contract executed in 2021 so we'd have to refer to that language to find out what that means outside of the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4681.42s">My</a>  understanding of the faculty and staff stipends when it comes to advising is more in the term of that this is the allotted amount and that it is earmarked for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4693.39s">So</a>  that way every, you know, and I don't know what the number is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4697.174s">I</a>  know I was asked to be an advisor at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4699.856s">I</a>  never got to that point of asking what the stipend weeks I didn't ask ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4704.66s">that</a>  I care. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4706.581s">But</a>  as far as I'm concerned, it's a baseline stipend of whatever the amount is, and then that $29,000 is basically reachable to them because we pay part of Mr. Trotta's salary through the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4718.207s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, it's for folks outside of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4720.889s">But</a>  I could be completely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4722.81s">I</a>  don't know the answer 100%, so I don't want to pretend like I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4727.092s">But</a>  that is my interpretation of this letter and from past context, working with Director Trotta on this.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4736.879s">There</a>  are no Medford Public Schools operating funds that pay for CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4742.342s">It</a>  is entirely grant funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4745.404s">Except</a>  for Mr. Trotta's stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4747.526s">Except</a>  for Mr. Trotta's stipend.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4749.647s">It</a>  has to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4751.038s">I'm</a>  so sorry, I don't know if I'm like out of order by saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4755.562s">But</a>  his stipend, part of the grant, I have learned part of the grant is that his stipend has to be separate from the grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4762.648s">So</a>  that does go all to the work of CCSR and Medford Public Schools pays his stipend to oversee the grant.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4776.331s">everyone</a>  else's, all the other advisors and assistants, whether it's faculty or staff, is from this, but TRADA is the only one that is paid for in our budget.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4786.217s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4787.938s">Member</a>  Branley? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4788.819s">So</a>  who holds on to this $35,000?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4795.423s">There's</a>  an account, like a grant account in Medford Public Schools that is allocated each year and then it's drawn down for the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4803.095s">for</a>  them to pay the stipends and to pay the materials and to so our grant manager Susan Callahan helps to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4809.859s">Okay,</a>  this funding members so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4816.763s">So</a>  that's sort of it there is a line item that pays for Mr. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4822.048s">But</a>  when there's this relaxation in that letter, does that mean we could perhaps use the grant to pay for him instead of the very limited Medford Public Schools funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4832.336s">But</a>  it says relaxed with no explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4836.399s">What</a>  does that mean?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4838.22s">And</a>  it's not in writing, but that's why I was told it was in error. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4846.507s">it</a>  was an error and should not have been part of the clause and that clause is removed moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4856.715s">So</a>  what I could maybe do is ask for them to like reissue the letter.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4860.537s">I</a>  think what I'm not clear about is what is the clause that was an error? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4866.862s">Like</a>  what did we think we had to do that we no longer had to do?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4870.345s">It's</a>  just the wording around it being relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4873.763s">like</a>  and could be earmarked for other purposes, the language that you were concerned for last time.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4878.8s">But</a>  what is being relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4881.283s">I'm</a>  not quite like, what is relaxed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4884.145s">Is</a>  it like a particular requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4887.647s">I'm</a>  just trying to be very clear about what we're being asked to approve a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4892.03s">And</a>  there's a lot of lore around how CCSR is funded, including I have been told by past people in the administration that we are required to pay stipends at certain levels to certain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4905.719s">I</a>  don't know if that's true or if it's not true, but what I'm trying to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4910.442s">is</a>  what are we required to do under the contract that we signed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4916.226s">What</a>  are those features? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4918.348s">And</a>  when we relaxed something, is it all of it or is it a specific thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4924.232s">So</a>  I just want to be clear what we're saying because I don't want people to go out and be like, the school committee is gonna go spend this money on whatever they want because it was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4934.96s">I</a>  just want to be very clear about <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4938.342s">what</a>  it is that was relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4941.005s">Nothing</a>  has been relaxed.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4942.747s">Nothing</a>  has been relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4944.149s">The</a>  language was an error that how you're spending the money could be relaxed, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4959.841s">Nothing</a>  is being relaxed moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4962.443s">These</a>  are the three buckets of spend, which is stipends, materials, and field trips, transportation costs, guest speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4971.67s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4972.291s">There's</a>  no relaxing of how we're spending our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4974.893s">Those</a>  are the three buckets in which CCSR is spending their money.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4980.537s">Then</a>  I would like to ask that we get an official correct <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4985.56s">letter</a>  from the Cummings Foundation so that we can approve this in a way that is diligent with what they're asking us to do, especially if nothing has been relaxed.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=4998.764s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5000.705s">I</a>  think we're in year eight of a 10 year grant.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.367s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5003.907s">And</a>  I think the other thing is to say, oh, this was in the grant 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5008.689s">I'm</a>  sure that it was, but it's been 10 years and it would just also be helpful for people to say, here are the key features of the grant that was signed 10 years ago by nobody who's still in the building except for Mr. Trotta so that we can parse fact from fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5024.598s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5027.977s">Member</a>  Rizzo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5029.758s">And</a>  I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I'm going to anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5034.34s">But</a>  this paragraph, like nobody wakes up as they're typing a memo and writes a paragraph that says the foundation has lifted restrictions on the use of grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5044.604s">That</a>  didn't come out of thin air. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5046.124s">That</a>  came out of an email or a letter or a memo that somebody received. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5050.806s">Nobody</a>  just wrote that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5053.118s">for</a>  kicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5054.119s">So</a>  I can understand if you're saying that there has in fact been nothing relaxed, but somebody received something somewhere along the line that definitely said restrictions have been relaxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5065.704s">This</a>  isn't a sentence you can accidentally add a and or a not and suddenly get this sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5072.948s">This</a>  is clearly a paragraph written based on some other thing that exists somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5078.671s">So</a>  I look forward to the report on what is</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5083.316s">I</a>  will have the letter reissued. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5085.658s">I'm</a>  still in my learning of CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5090.361s">So</a>  I can't speak to what it was in the past, but I will absolutely get a yes, a revised letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5098.066s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5099.246s">Member</a>  Intoppa, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5100.747s">And</a>  one more not to like you said, I'm going to make maybe a dangerous assumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5106.871s">What</a>  I'm assuming is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5109.578s">And</a>  again, I use the word assuming strongly, is that the Cummings Foundation had guidelines on what they wanted the grant funding to be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5118.164s">And</a>  now, with a lot of things happening federally with grant funding, what they're earmarked for, they are lifting certain recommendations to avoid becoming targeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5130.887s">I'm</a>  going to assume that they are basically saying we had priorities and now it's whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5137.45s">Because</a>  that seems to be the trend that seems to be what's happening nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5142.872s">And</a>  I have a feeling that it was just more of or maybe it wasn't that deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5146.433s">Maybe</a>  it's nothing like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5147.453s">And</a>  maybe it's just, you know, hey, we wanted to use it for this, but now <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5152.135s">you</a>  know, whatever floats your boat, whatever we can do to make sure that students have student success and that they're doing the projects they want to do, and that we actually really don't care what you use it for as long as you spend it appropriately and responsibly.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5164.646s">And</a>  I think getting to the bottom of those choices is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5169.59s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying that that's probably... Is there a motion to table this update, this request to approve the donation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5180.136s">Well,</a>  we took it up on the agenda, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5182.657s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5185.099s">Motion</a>  to table by Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5186.539s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5191.302s">Seconded</a>  by Member Lopate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5192.543s">Roll</a>  call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5193.763s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5938.775s">So</a>  the educational staff and the student is taken directly from the committee's language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5944.977s">Most</a>  of this overview language is from, but I added the bits about consistency across grade level and within subject areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5954.139s">The</a>  thinking on that, right, is that if a student on side A at the Andrews has a different <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5959.8s">policy</a>  than side B at the McGlynn, that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5962.981s">But</a>  recognizing that these tools are used very differently in a humanities class, a science class, a world language class, special education, so special education professionals were on in this group to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5976.647s">say</a>  when things are using English language learners have a different need than others and in terms of assessing where the students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=5985.391s">So</a>  that's that was there and then as I mentioned the district operations that is kind of brand new in the DESE guidelines that came out at the end of August and I recognize that this work was done before our <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6000.337s">chief</a>  operating officer and assistant superintendent for instruction and curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6005.301s">This</a>  actually began right in our surprise superintendent transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6009.904s">And</a>  so I have to thank Director Chiesa for stepping in and doing some of that material. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6018.97s">So</a>  that's where this came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6023.287s">I</a>  put it on the agenda tonight because I knew the handbooks were on the agenda and I think it would be inappropriate to be referencing a policy that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6031.713s">So</a>  I welcome the discussion, friendly amendments, whatever we need to show that we're thoughtful and to make sure that we are supporting students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6040.719s">The</a>  discussion in these committee meetings was these resources are here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6045.222s">We</a>  need to be using them responsibly and we need to have a position and not just let things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6052.587s">because</a>  someone comes up with an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6054.308s">So</a>  I am excited to have a consistent policy in this area.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6060.833s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6062.054s">Questions</a>  from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6065.136s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6068.385s">Thank</a>  you for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6070.968s">There's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6072.67s">I</a>  really appreciate that there's, it's not just focused on students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6076.814s">I</a>  think that would have been the easy way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6081.859s">And</a>  I don't envy the staff that have to learn all these things that are <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6088.146s">frankly,</a>  changing every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6089.787s">I</a>  think perhaps for students, it's easier to learn all this stuff, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6096.349s">But</a>  did we have a mention of professional development in this?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6102.548s">I</a>  believe we said that the district will provide training and resources.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6106.791s">Okay,</a>  that's the training is word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6108.492s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6108.792s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6109.192s">So</a>  one of the one of the objectives of the of this task force working group was to identify the training needs not prescribe what they should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6120.339s">So</a>  I know that document exists, but has not been codified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6124.561s">Thank</a>  you mad for meetings, and I will also note that the language that is in the handbooks was reviewed at department meetings and building levels so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6135.335s">It</a>  has seen other eyes, although, as we mentioned, additional input from different stakeholders is still needed here.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6142.824s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6143.284s">I</a>  would just ask that in the next budget that we, I'm guessing that professional development around generative AI will not be free. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6152.107s">It</a>  might be quite an expensive professional development offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6156.188s">So</a>  just something to keep in mind for the next budget because our staff is certainly gonna need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6164.491s">But</a>  as you pointed out, like different departments and different grade levels will need frankly, very different training. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6171.433s">I'm</a>  assuming the sciences, probably a lot of those teachers, at least at the high school level, are already pretty aware of a lot of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6181.799s">But</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6183.921s">It's</a>  incredibly concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6187.703s">And</a>  I love the use of the word ethical over and over, because that is a harder one to nail down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6196.568s">And</a>  I do like the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6200.851s">the</a>  academic honesty panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6202.672s">I'm</a>  wondering if you could tell us a little bit about why there's this panel's decision is final.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6208.666s">I</a>  would defer to the staff on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6210.687s">That</a>  was their language and not to pass the buck, but that was our teachers and administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6218.05s">I</a>  think they wanted it to be very consistent with the existing academic honesty and integrity policy, but I'm hoping. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6227.013s">And</a>  I want to note that director Layden is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6231.455s">Shana</a>  Tova to <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6233.25s">our</a>  Rosh Hashanah observers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6235.432s">So</a>  there may be some questions here that our director of technology and library services may be better equipped to answer, but perhaps Dr. Galusi can talk about the panel.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6246.921s">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6247.442s">I</a>  think that was really nicely said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6249.143s">The</a>  only thing I would say is that I'm sure it's not a big surprise that especially secondary teachers are dealing with these issues quite regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6257.991s">And</a>  probably, I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6262.201s">I</a>  wouldn't maybe necessarily say a daily basis, but I do think that it's, this is a conversation that is happening in a lot of secondary department meetings, classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6271.987s">I</a>  also know it's quite a conversation at college campuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6275.949s">There's</a>  a lot of higher level institutions that are talking about going back to the oral exams and the blue books as a way to kind of navigate what is happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6287.055s">And</a>  every time you turn around, there's now another like third, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6290.657s">party</a>  platform that's claiming to do some other involvement of AI functioning that can determine who's used it determine who's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6301.361s">I</a>  think the real main goal for this which member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6308.762s">so</a>  eloquently said, but it's really to educate how it can be used as a tool, but not to replace critical thinking, problem solving, and teaching our students the skills that they need to thrive in college and in the real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6325.709s">But</a>  there are some instances where it can aid and support productivity and workflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6333.693s">And</a>  I think that like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6335.113s">having</a>  the opportunities to do that in classrooms where we're teaching students, the difference, getting back to that ethical word again, is really the essence of this guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6347.825s">And</a>  it is important to, once approved and have the greater conversation, it is important to be reflected in the handbook.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6362.336s">I</a>  was just going to add that in our initial survey, we asked what the committee was, what the task should be, but also we got a high positive response to both generative AI tools support student learning and generative AI tools undermine student learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6377.123s">And</a>  I think everyone kind of recognizes the complexity of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6380.965s">Then</a>  this question that people are kind of most mixed on was, I know when my students are using generative AI tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6387.068s">There</a>  was a big range of, I know, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6392.277s">And</a>  I think more people said that their students didn't use the tools, but there was a recognition that that was going to increase over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6403.984s">And</a>  that's why we really wanted to get ahead of this with the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6408.046s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6409.107s">Yeah,</a>  of course.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6410.187s">Member</a>  Branley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6411.588s">So</a>  yeah, so my question was surrounding that academic honesty panel too, like who determines it at what grade level and all of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6419.893s">Is</a>  there answer to that based on what you just said, or is that something?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6422.955s">I</a>  know you said it was sort of brought by the teachers, but... The way that for the situations that have been arising prior to this guidance, the way that's being handled is with in-school teams that usually comprise school leaders, teachers, and school Councilors.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6444.51s">Okay,</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6446.14s">And</a>  then bringing in at times if needed department heads to like a doctor keys or Dr. Khan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6451.974s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6452.396s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6453.458s">Remember</a>  in tapa</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6458.398s">I</a>  want to say first and foremost, thank you member Reinfeld and everyone on the committee for putting their heads together, thinking about what this looks like, thinking about the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.006s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6467.587s">It</a>  is very clear on a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6470.85s">There's</a>  a lot of, you know, the policy is bulky in terms of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6474.233s">There's</a>  a lot of guidance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6475.654s">There's</a>  some things we just can't avoid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6476.895s">It's</a>  sometimes like we want to make them as short and simple as we can, but you always want to make sure things are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6481.459s">There's</a>  clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6484.172s">There's</a>  clarity amongst other things that better less likely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6489.858s">The</a>  first question I have is, has the district identified what generative AI models are state approved, are district approved, are OK to use in the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6501.426s">Because</a>  it mentions that in the DESE guidelines, they have to be vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6505.108s">And</a>  I was curious.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6506.449s">The</a>  district maintains a list of acceptable software programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6510.732s">And</a>  it, I believe, includes generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6512.894s">Or</a>  they were adding the generative AI tools as of the writing of this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6516.796s">That's</a>  a great question for Molly Leighton as well.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6519.318s">Yeah,</a>  in terms of what, because there's thousands of models and there's different third party softwares in terms of which- Only a certain number of them have the agreement.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6529.535s">to</a>  for student data protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6531.995s">And</a>  that's really the that's the filter there.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6535.016s">I</a>  was gonna say, because that is that's my biggest concern is in terms of student data privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6540.317s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6542.037s">And</a>  we kind of said there, there isn't a, it doesn't make sense to list those out in the policy because things change and legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6550.759s">So</a>  the district maintains that in the same way that they maintain other acceptable software and <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6556.7s">why</a>  Google this works and Microsoft that doesn't, or I'm not trying to slam any particular company that was random. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6562.905s">Right,</a>  I understand.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6563.865s">Yeah,</a>  no, my question, it was more in terms of like, have we identified yet, you know what I mean, in terms of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6569.63s">Obviously,</a>  like you said, things are fluid, things change, we find a problem with the software, we take it off the list, it happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6575.949s">I'm</a>  sort of breaking this apart in terms of, so I understand in terms of citing AI sources, I find it very interesting because it basically seems like the old adage of you can't cite Google because you can't cite a Google search. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6592.353s">And</a>  that's exactly what an AI citation is through MLA and APA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6595.694s">It's</a>  just, you're writing what you searched up, what model you used and what day it was, which is funny because you go through primary and secondary education and they tell you not to do that with Google. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6605.136s">And</a>  yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6606.578s">This</a>  isn't our language, but this is what the language is across the nation in terms of MLA and APA, what is acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6614.12s">So</a>  I think that's kind of hilarious, especially if you know how AI works in terms of machine learning that inherently it is plagiarism because it is pulling together a bunch of sources and spitting out a summary without any real citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6627.288s">And</a>  if you've, you know, in college, they always teach you, even if you summarize, even if you don't use every single word, word by word, or even have two of the same, you still have to cite it because you're still using someone else's information to form your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6637.855s">And</a>  so generative AI being cited is an interesting sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6643.315s">cycle</a>  of like, that's an interesting kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6646.356s">In</a>  terms of us implementing generative AI, I know that we as a committee stand on policies that are sustainable and making sure we're in our environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6656.519s">And</a>  if you know about AI, generative AI, you know how much energy it uses and how much water it uses and how much fossil fuels it inherently uses to generate answers and to machine learn these systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6668.203s">And</a>  so from a sustainability standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6671.466s">not</a>  that sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6673.247s">There</a>  are ways for them to, I'm sure, to get the energy from solar or wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6678.171s">But</a>  for the most part, it's really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6680.992s">In</a>  terms of ethical usage in the arts, there is no way to ethically use AI, except for if you code an AI system and feed it only your artwork, it is inherently plagiarism and not stealing like an artist, which you and I both understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6695.242s">It</a>  is more of the stealing of everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6699.845s">So</a>  these are sort of some of my concerns.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6702.267s">I</a>  will note that the environmental piece came up as ethical as an umbrella, both ethically in terms of personal development and learning, but also in terms of societal impact.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6715.055s">Oh</a>  yeah, 100%.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6715.956s">So</a>  it was certainly discussed, but the point is taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6720.979s">I</a>  will say I wrote a very different policy for my graduate students than I wrote here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6726.485s">Fair</a>  enough.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6726.966s">Yeah,</a>  I'm definitely pulling in from what the conversations are happening in the art world in terms of higher ed and these are the conversations we're having every single day in terms of how AI is implemented in policy in the classroom in higher education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6740.421s">Also,</a>  the part of bias and critical thinking should be checked for accuracy, bias, and misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6746.225s">For</a>  me, it's at this point, what's the point then in terms of taking a shortcut to summarize these things and then have to go back and still check them to make sure they're factual and to make sure that they are appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6757.875s">And</a>  then who is doing that checking? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6759.376s">And</a>  I think my colleagues behind me have some opinions about that in terms of what then</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6767.314s">I</a>  think we would like to hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6768.656s">Did</a>  you have anything that you wanted to amend about this policy?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6772.258s">I</a>  actually, in opposition of the policy, I think that we shouldn't be, it is my personal opinion that we really shouldn't be implementing this into the curriculum in terms of its usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6781.966s">I</a>  believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6783.828s">Being</a>  aware, especially in terms of literacy when we look at political and also national literacy around what is generative AI what is real and what is not I think is a very scary thing it is approaching very quickly in terms of we look at AI models that are generated from last year until this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6801.663s">So</a>  I'm sort of more nitpicking this in terms of that my amendment would be to only have a literacy aspect to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6808.206s">And</a>  the only times that we use this is to teach about what generative AI is, but it is not my welcoming to incorporate this into the curriculum in terms of as a tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6817.491s">I</a>  understand its benefits, but I personally do not have a positive outlook on generative AI and the future that it has in terms of where it will be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6826.856s">So</a>  to that, I defer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6829.201s">to</a>  my colleague next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6830.642s">That's</a>  not even my job, but that is my job.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6833.645s">I'm</a>  unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6834.286s">Are</a>  you making a motion or are you not making a motion at this time?</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6836.968s">Well,</a>  at this time, there is no motion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6838.99s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6839.21s">These</a>  are just comments and questions.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6840.691s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6841.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6843.994s">I</a>  see we have a new colleague joining us.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6847.978s">I</a>  think that we have some specific <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6850.901s">issues</a>  with the wording present within the current student handbook in result in regards to generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6858.566s">This</a>  is more specific concerns, but under bias and critical thinking, all AI generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and politically and potentially negative content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6871.055s">And</a>  under citations, a record of prompts used in generative AI should be kept along with the output from the AI tool used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6878.7s">First</a>  of all, who is doing this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6882.263s">Who</a>  is keeping this record? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6883.784s">Who</a>  is responsible for ensuring this record is kept? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6886.366s">What</a>  is the punishment in case this record is not kept? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6889.908s">Secondly,</a>  does this apply to participate to preparation for assignments, as is mentioned elsewhere in the document, or <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6897.273s">simply</a>  to the creation of content for the assignments themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6900.758s">Again,</a>  this is generally not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6904.457s">The</a>  student handbook itself places particular emphasis on OpenAI's chat GPT over other generative AI models. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6911.402s">We</a>  believe that this is overly specific.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6914.604s">Can</a>  I stop you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6916.385s">Can</a>  we do this one at a time, just so that if there are answers, we can not forget what the answer is before we get to the next thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6923.03s">OK,</a>  so the first question, can you just tell us your first question again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6926.512s">It</a>  was about bias and critical thinking.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6929.394s">Yes,</a>  so under both the bias and critical thinking and citation sections, records are meant to be kept either of prompts or ensuring that they are checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6943.529s">Our</a>  question here is who is responsible for this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6947.173s">Who</a>  is responsible for ensuring that this list has been created? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6951.657s">And</a>  what are the repercussions should this work not be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6956.298s">And</a>  does this apply to only the creation of material for assignments themselves or preparation for tests, as mentioned, at other points throughout the document?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6967.061s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6968.542s">Member</a>  Reinfeld, did you have an answer?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6971.082s">So</a>  this was developed by committee, but I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6977.492s">The</a>  intention on who is keeping these records is the person completing the assignment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6984.096s">And</a>  I believe the prompts list is only for the assignments work that is turned in to say this is the sourcing for the content that I'm providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=6994.221s">That</a>  is my understanding of what the teachers on the committee were thinking with this language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7001.706s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7004.609s">So,</a>  I mean, it does depend on which tools you're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7006.852s">Certainly,</a>  I use AI all day, every day as a software developer, but, you know, the prompts that I make and the answers that I get <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7017.302s">I</a>  mean, I can look at them going back as far as I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7022.425s">They</a>  don't go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7023.346s">Now,</a>  if you're just using a free web version of something, you probably don't get all those features, which is why using the approved list would be very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7034.852s">And</a>  again, I'm not familiar with all the tools I use, the tools I use, which everybody knows there are many tools every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7041.416s">There</a>  seems to be another tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7043.157s">but</a>  using a tool for which you do not get an audit history of what you're doing seems like an absolute no-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7052.821s">As</a>  I read this policy, if you open a tool and it doesn't let you see what you asked it and what the answer was three weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7061.835s">You</a>  shouldn't be using that tool, because you can't comply with the policy that says here's you when you go to turn in the paper, unless you copied it down at that moment, which is also, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7074.918s">That's</a>  not how people do work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7076.399s">I</a>  mean, you're not gonna ask a question or make this paragraph better and then go off and write some gigantic audit log of your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7086.808s">That</a>  is totally unreasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7089.731s">But</a>  if you're using a tool that's keeping track of it, then it becomes, it's still a heavy lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7097.717s">The</a>  question is, is it a heavier lift than just doing it all without <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7101.597s">generative</a>  AI, and I suppose it depends what it is you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7108.04s">I</a>  would say that in most cases, I mean, I am wildly more productive as a software developer using generative AI than going off and learning an entire new whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7120.967s">When</a>  I only need a little tiny thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7124.109s">So,</a>  so to me that's the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7128.752s">But</a>  I obviously was not part of this committee, but I think that, you know, if you read something at the library and you don't write down the reference, and then you have a great memory and you write down exactly what you read. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7142.39s">Sent</a>  word for word, but don't put any, you don't remember what book it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7147.634s">It</a>  still counts as academic dishonesty, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7151.557s">So</a>  I'd like to think this is actually less work than some of that other stuff that we used to have to do in the olden days, card catalogs and all that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7163.867s">I'm</a>  really aging myself, but that's how I interpret it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7168.07s">Now</a>  this is the policy, like policy is not, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7173.741s">most</a>  of the time is not implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7176.062s">So</a>  the gory details of how it gets done, like if there's 10 tools that are approved, the answer is probably different for every tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7185.584s">So</a>  our policy is not going to be for this specific tool, make sure you click this after you do a question and you get your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7193.346s">And</a>  that's just not, that's an option for policy, but it becomes incredibly brittle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7200.267s">And</a>  then we're constantly modifying policy</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7203.343s">every</a>  week when there's a new AI tool so that's how I interpret this to answer your question and I will add I back in this language so it's all use of Jenny I for schoolwork must be recorded and shared with teachers such as with a transcript of prompts and responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7220.027s">So</a>  the policy is written to give teachers some flexibility in explaining what their expectations are and to say, this is how I want you to be citing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7231.559s">It</a>  doesn't require that list of prompts, but the teacher, this is an example of something that a teacher might request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7239.167s">Another</a>  teacher might say, I want a disclosure of AI to say, I use this tool in my introduction, or I use this in my research to create an outline, but I don't need the specific prompt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7248.85s">So</a>  I think the such as is actually important here in that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7252.831s">I</a>  don't know if that addresses the concern.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7256.533s">And</a>  if I might from the chair, this policy lays out that students are responsible for this and teachers are responsible for setting the parameters by which it will be used in their classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7268.756s">So</a>  just like any assignment that you get, your teacher is going to tell you what they expect from the assignment, how to cite things, whether you type it or you send it to them in the mail, like all of those things come from your teacher on an assignment by assignment basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7285.54s">And</a>  this is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7287.021s">asking</a>  anybody to do anything different than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7289.043s">It</a>  is asking teachers to clearly outline that to you all, but it is asking you as a student to adhere to the use of the tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7297.554s">So</a>  from a bias perspective, this policy is asking you to do it and it is asking teachers to do it and be clear about it.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7307.03s">I</a>  think that is a very helpful explanation of the intent behind the message present within the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7313.376s">We're</a>  simply requesting that within the document itself, this intent is better expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7322.145s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7323.166s">And</a>  I don't, as for Mr. Hsu, I <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7330.508s">I</a>  don't think that it's pertinent to discuss exactly which models are allowed at this moment, given that they change so frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7337.832s">But</a>  on your point in increased productivity, I think it's a common concern here shared by the board members that there's a difference between AI allowing you to do something faster and you actually understanding the process in which you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7355.885s">As</a>  for the rest of the document, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7364.513s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7364.693s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7365.474s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7366.595s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7368.236s">The</a>  document, we believe that the document is overly specific in reference to particularly OpenAI's Chachapiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7374.36s">While</a>  it remains the most commonly used AI model in terms of user base at the moment, we recognize that the landscape is rapidly changing and believe that more general knowledge would be, general wording would be helpful in this regard.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7389.571s">I</a>  can speak to that if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7391.732s">So</a>  that's in the definition section, because a lot of people use chat GPT interchangeably with generative AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7400.956s">And</a>  so it was to specify that it is a specific tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7404.238s">It</a>  is not the list of approved resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7407.639s">It's</a>  a definition of clarifying language.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7413.03s">I</a>  understand that that might be the case in that particular section, but it is mentioned throughout the document at other points, including differences in citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7420.892s">And</a>  I don't have any other examples written down, but I believe that there was another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7424.873s">So</a>  I might be wrong, but I don't believe that that is restricted only to the section you're referencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7435.116s">But</a>  yes, it is important to define those terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7439.457s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7448.402s">I</a>  think that, like my colleague, sorry, board member here said, there are vastly different security profiles that constantly change for different models. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7464.874s">And</a>  so we would also like to, again, second the importance of regulating the use of specific models within the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7475.381s">You</a>  know, DeepSeek, which is owned by a Chinese company, may have different policies than OpenAI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7482.086s">So</a>  again, that is a concern we would like to second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7486.89s">In</a>  terms of environmental impact, we recognize, again, that these models have significant energy requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7494.695s">However,</a>  there is a general trend that these companies are turning to cleaner sources of energy we've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7501.4s">two</a>  purchases of and construction of nuclear power plants for the running of AI data centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7509.464s">So</a>  this is a trend that is not exclusive to the use of fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7515.768s">And</a>  then again, I wanna second the concern for cognitive decline as the result of over-reliance on these models.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7530.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7532.151s">That's</a>  quite a lot for your first meeting.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7533.711s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7542.395s">If</a>  this passes its first reading, we will have a second reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7547.037s">I'm</a>  happy to take the request to explicitly call out energy requirements as a separate thing from general ethics. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7556.281s">I</a>  think that's <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7557.881s">That's</a>  a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7559.082s">And</a>  the cognitive decline is a really important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7566.705s">It's</a>  embedded in the critical thinking, but I think maybe an understanding the impact of AI is maybe part of the literacy component of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7578.29s">So</a>  I think we can look at the policy with that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7583.272s">And</a>  I was going to say something <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7585.137s">else?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7585.577s">Oh,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7586.638s">I</a>  will note that I did add the phrase developmentally appropriate in front of technology use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7594.761s">And</a>  so I think in a future meeting, I may bring that to the technology responsible use policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7599.663s">But</a>  I think that was part of the idea here in terms of what's happening to our brains as we use these tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7607.287s">Because</a>  that's that research is <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7610.533s">coming</a>  out fast and furious, and to member on top was a point very alarmingly so.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7618.434s">Yes,</a>  although this is a very new topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7621.096s">So</a>  I just, again, would like to exercise caution in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7625.12s">And</a>  then one last point, which I forgot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7628.202s">The</a>  student handbook refers to generative AI as Gen AI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7631.725s">This</a>  is a minor nitpick, which is fine, but it doesn't make clear that it's an abbreviation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7638.091s">And</a>  so it's just slightly problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7641.514s">It's</a>  not a huge deal.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7642.915s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7643.598s">I</a>  thought we put it in the first mention, but if we didn't, that can certainly be fixed.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7647.461s">Just</a>  gen.ai or any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7653.306s">Making</a>  it more clear than ever.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7656.77s">So</a>  if I could recap on the policy, I think I've heard a request to make clear that it is both student and teacher responsibility to check for bias, critical thinking and citations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7677.836s">that</a>  we clarify the use of the phrase ethical use and that we reference not just critical thinking but also the <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7695.289s">potential</a>  cognitive decline that is associated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7698.311s">Those</a>  are the three changes potentially that I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7703.713s">And</a>  the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7705.194s">And</a>  the environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7707.935s">So</a>  I just wanted to recap that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7709.996s">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7713.252s">No,</a>  I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7715.333s">No,</a>  it's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7719.835s">So</a>  potential updates would be reference to cognitive decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7727.319s">Like</a>  direct reference that it is the expectation of both students and teachers to check for bias and citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7738.624s">The</a>  environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7742.226s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7744.648s">We</a>  said the clarification of ethical is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7747.389s">And</a>  clarification of the word ethical to include environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7755.21s">So</a>  those are the three things that I'm hearing in the room that might warrant an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7762.912s">Can</a>  we also add security concerns in the selection of appropriate models for use in classrooms?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7769.757s">Can</a>  you say more about what you're thinking about?</p>

    <p>[Alachie Yeager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7773.501s">Yes,</a>  certain models have different policies when it comes to disclosure of user data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7778.205s">And</a>  as these are students and minors that are interacting with these models, it's important that in the selection of appropriate models, we keep in mind the security concerns.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7792.796s">Um,</a>  I believe that that is actually covered because it does talk about our data security practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7798.92s">So</a>  any tool that would be approved would have to be compliant in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7805.264s">Otherwise,</a>  it could not be approved.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7988.259s">I'm</a>  just going to give one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7995.257s">great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7995.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7996.238s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Pippa Sully. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=7998.479s">So</a>  there's two more sections as previously stated that are updates to the handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8003.642s">Um,</a>  this one is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8007.505s">June</a>  27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8008.825s">The</a>  U. S Supreme Court issued a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8011.747s">Um</a>  in Mahmood versus Taylor, which is requiring school districts nationwide to provide parents and caregivers the opportunity to review instructional content in advance if they request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8024.845s">to</a>  allow students to be excused or receive curriculum accommodations if it conflicts with their sincerely held religious beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8034.948s">So</a>  it is important to note that curriculum decisions still remain under the authority of public schools and that it does not alter our instructional standards or our program of studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8047.472s">But</a>  what it does is just affirm that upon request materials can be provided to parents and caregivers so that they can review and request reasonable accommodations for their religious objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8062.588s">So</a>  what that there is on the next slide language that we are adding into our handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8069.175s">so</a>  that we are consistent with the Massachusetts Regulation 603 CMR 26.05 Section 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8077.941s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools, through its curricula and materials, encourages respect for the human and civil rights of all individuals, regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8092.271s">And</a>  in accordance with district guidelines, families may request information from building principals <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8098.935s">on</a>  available accommodations related to curriculum content. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8103.96s">So</a>  what we are encouraging here is our charge, our collective charge this year is about belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8110.565s">And</a>  that is for every single student, every single staff member, every single family member, every single community member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8117.411s">And</a>  so what we really want to ensure is that we are prioritizing conversation and communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8125.1s">So</a>  if there is a caregiver that has concern over any curriculum related materials, they need to reach out to the building principal who will engage in dialogue with the caregiver regarding the scope and sequence and what those curricular materials may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8142.175s">And</a>  on a district level that those building principals may reach out to Dr. Kim Talbot, who was our assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8155.95s">Member</a>  Ruseau, did you have a question about this topic before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8159.431s">Yes,</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8160.171s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8161.771s">The</a>  floor is yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8162.711s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8163.331s">I</a>  just wanted to be clear that accommodations does not mean alternative education.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8168.912s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8170.052s">We</a>  don't provide two educations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8173.553s">So</a>  when a student opts out, they will simply be missing out on their education or the education that we had planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8182.995s">They</a>  will not be getting an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8184.975s">They</a>  will <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8186.204s">whether</a>  that's not being class or, you know, it depends of course on the class and the grade level and all that other, we're not sending a kindergartner to sit in the hall, but, or maybe I don't know what we're doing, but I just want folks to understand that that does not mean that every parent can decide they wanna have a separate education for their child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8206.02s">They</a>  can decide that their kid will not get some education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8211.004s">I'm</a>  wondering about, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8214.379s">Parental</a>  review of curriculum is, have we gone down the path of what does it mean for review? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8222.209s">Like</a>  if I have a high school, if I didn't finish high school and my child is in AP physics and I wanna know what the curriculum is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8233.133s">Are</a>  we obligated to hand the curriculum over? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8235.914s">And</a>  I'm assuming, of course, probably inappropriately, but perhaps the parents will not be capable of knowing what the hell they're reading or looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8246.92s">What</a>  is our obligation to help them understand what the curriculum is? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8250.942s">I</a>  mean, when I started on school committee, I was like, let's see our sex education curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8255.524s">And</a>  I went in and I got it and it was a binder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8257.665s">It</a>  was like a thousand pages long or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8259.987s">Actually,</a>  it was multiple binders like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8264.154s">And</a>  that was quite the slap in the face for somebody who doesn't have an education background. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8270.599s">Like</a>  when I say, let me see the curriculum, that's not quite as simple a request as I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8278.224s">So</a>  are we saying we will, and I realize this maybe hasn't happened yet, and maybe we haven't worked it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8286.658s">but</a>  are we handing over, and by the way, when I was handed those curriculums, I wasn't like, those are licensed copies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8293.622s">I</a>  couldn't take them home because like, they were not, like we had a certain number, they belong to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8302.047s">Are</a>  we sending parents home with curriculum and being like, well, here you go, or are we helping them understand what's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8310.672s">And</a>  if that's the case, that seems like a very large, <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8317.492s">amount</a>  of effort on our part. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8322.534s">And</a>  I realize that this is new, and maybe there isn't an answer, but I'm worried that we're going to be accused of burying parents who are wanting to perhaps opt their kids out of certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8341.34s">I'm</a>  worried about the teaching staff because all of our curriculum is not like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8346.891s">off</a>  the shelf curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8348.611s">It's</a>  not like there's like a, you know, a lot of our curriculum is because we've been improving and getting it, you know, modernized, but not all of our curriculum is here's the, you know, here's the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8362.495s">So</a>  what happens to teachers who teach a class that has no specific curriculum, that they've made it up themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8370.797s">And</a>  I know we have classes like that in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8374.918s">do</a>  they have, and I keep asking questions and don't let you answer, but I'm just very worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8378.641s">I'm</a>  trying to remember them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8380.762s">I'll</a>  stop talking, but this whole thing is freaking me out, as I'm sure it's freaking you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8386.747s">And</a>  I want, I'll just do one final thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8390.23s">I</a>  hope we're going to keep track of this very carefully, so we understand what it costs us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8396.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8398.836s">Dr.</a>  DeLuzzi?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8399.937s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8400.417s">So</a>  I think the biggest, as I previously mentioned, but the biggest piece that I want to say is that this requires conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8408.8s">So</a>  this is not a request that can be made through email or through just one phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8418.923s">This</a>  needs to be a conversation that building leaders are engaging in with caregivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8427.099s">It</a>  would require the caregivers to have a review of like the scope and sequence, so they can see maybe content that is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8437.989s">It</a>  is not something where it's an individual lesson per se but I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8443.553s">One</a>  of the things that Dr. Talbot is working on with directors is making sure that we have scope and sequence available to caregivers so that they can engage in that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8456.242s">We</a>  are recording requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8458.904s">We</a>  are making sure that we're documenting our efforts of outreach <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8463.587s">and</a>  working with caregivers so that we can understand and have an internal path as to what was requested and how we came about those decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8473.772s">Yes,</a>  it is true that the Supreme Court ruling did not rule that school systems are obligated to provide alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8484.438s">materials,</a>  lessons, activities for students, but a lot of I think that that also speaks to why the conversation is so important to have with caregivers and what that might mean for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8502.09s">So</a>  in like <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8504.685s">Again,</a>  there is no judgment here, but I also want to make sure that the conversations are like what this looks like for the student and the impact that that has for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8516.494s">and</a>  what that means in terms of what their experience in that class will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8522.656s">And</a>  so making sure that parents know that it's a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8528.338s">The</a>  other piece is that this is about religiously held beliefs and content that may <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8540.014s">they</a>  may find objectionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8541.494s">And</a>  that also requires conversation to make sure we're getting at the root as to how and why does this particular content go against your religiously held beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8553.783s">And</a>  that's also a matter of conversation that needs to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ewRLf8jM8M0&t=8557.025s">I</a>  hope I answered your questions.</p>
