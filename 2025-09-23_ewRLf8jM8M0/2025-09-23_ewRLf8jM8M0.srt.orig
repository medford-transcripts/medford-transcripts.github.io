62
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:28,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We started meeting in maybe April or so, and it has been, you know, it's very difficult to

63
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:34,744
[SPEAKER_08]: adjust for schedules during the summertime and they rose to that challenge.

64
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:35,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to thank them for that.

65
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:47,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank them for the discussion, particularly when we got to talk about things that didn't work in our school buildings and come up with better ways to make things work.

66
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,198
[SPEAKER_08]: on behalf of students.

67
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:55,422
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really applaud their hard work and their delivering for our students at all times.

68
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really do appreciate that.

69
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:02,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Carboneau is here with us tonight.

70
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:06,970
[SPEAKER_08]: He is the bargaining liaison to the MNA.

71
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:13,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you, I didn't know if you would like to say something or just have us say thank you, but you're welcome to say something.

72
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

73
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:18,459
[SPEAKER_08]: You do.

74
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:19,499
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

75
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.

76
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:20,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

77
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,540
[SPEAKER_12]: So my name is Mark Carboneau.

78
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an associate director with the Massachusetts Nurse Association.

79
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:32,483
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just would like to say that this was a sometimes intense process.

80
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:39,525
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really felt that we collaborated to work together on this one.

81
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:44,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the document that we came up with, this collective bargaining agreement, was something

82
00:16:45,928 --> 00:16:49,751
[SPEAKER_12]: everyone should be proud of and we look forward to working with you all on that.

83
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:56,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to thank chairperson Graham, who I was able to have a series of off the record discussions as far as off the record bargaining.

84
00:16:57,218 --> 00:17:00,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd like to thank all the members for all the work you guys have done on that.

85
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,382
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much.

86
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:04,504
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd like to thank you on behalf of the nurses.

87
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:05,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

88
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:08,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, I will miss our daily chats.

89
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:25,871
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think for those who may be viewing this either tonight or in the future, some of the big central issues that we were grappling with was alignment of the schedule for the nurses to the new school day and the new professional day.

90
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:27,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a very big deal.

91
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:33,995
[SPEAKER_08]: We also worked through a number of changes to create

92
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:43,621
[SPEAKER_08]: a bank of flexible hours for the nurses to participate in some of the things that happen outside of their core hours.

93
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:59,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I think will become really, really useful as we talk about how we register students in a timely way for athletics or for kindergarten or run vaccine clinics and the like.

94
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's any number of things that

95
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:08,560
[SPEAKER_08]: In the past, we have had to sort of scrounge money to pay our nurses to do those things.

96
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:22,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were able to integrate all of that into the contract which is a really big deal and create this bank of hours that will like allow really allow us to serve the needs that are going to evolve as this new schedule unfolds so I'm really

97
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:26,554
[SPEAKER_08]: delighted that we were able to get all of that done.

98
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And the new schedule starts tomorrow.

99
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:32,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will, we will see you all on the new schedule.

100
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:34,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mark.

101
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to take a brief recess?

137
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:34,974
[SPEAKER_19]: For this evening's Mustang moment, we have our Student Advisory Council representatives.

138
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:48,047
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have seniors Jaden Ville, Jaden Zhang, Christine DeSotel, my apologies, and sophomore Alachi Yeager.

139
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:50,290
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm gonna ask them to come to the podium.

140
00:31:51,445 --> 00:32:03,569
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to discuss a little bit, give us an overview of what their role is as a student advisory council representative and a little bit of like some forward planning for the year.

141
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on?

142
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

143
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:09,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

144
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:14,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, school committee, superintendent and mayor for being here today.

145
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:21,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name is Jayden Ville, and I think I speak for all of us here when I say that we're here because we want to make a change.

146
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:23,304
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make a difference.

147
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:28,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The theme at MHS this year is belonging, making students feel like they're a part of the school.

148
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:33,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And we believe the key way to do that is making sure that students feel like their voices are heard.

149
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:40,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I know personally, I see a lot of students walking through the schools every day, and they have things they want to fix about the school.

150
00:32:41,138 --> 00:32:43,840
[SPEAKER_01]: They see certain things, and they just say, I wish it was something different.

151
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:47,216
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they don't always have a platform to do that.

152
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:48,476
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we come in.

153
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:54,217
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna champion the student voice, give a microphone to the voices that they wanna hear.

154
00:32:54,578 --> 00:33:02,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we know that everyone is at the table and we have as many different constituents as possible and making an inclusive decision that we get the past results.

155
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past few years, started with seniors, Darren and Noah, the class of 2024, we advocated for students

156
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:17,157
[SPEAKER_01]: For a big concern we had was that students were kind of having trouble carrying their stuff.

157
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:24,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we asked that, you know, what if we could remove the backpack policy or have a way to something that can just carry around school to make their lives a bit easier.

158
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:33,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the homework policy and how can we make students lives easier while they have the enriching part of homework, but also can balance it with their extracurriculars and ideas.

159
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And with class government just this year.

160
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:45,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We open it up just from the original five class president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer positions.

161
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,205
[SPEAKER_01]: We open it up so that more students can run.

162
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:55,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's 10 class representatives to better represent the class and help fundraise for our class and get more ideas done.

163
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,554
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the key to that success is not just raising questions.

164
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about fixing problems.

165
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:11,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is why we continue to work and advocate for the student body here today.

166
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:24,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also why we are expanding our reach into the regional student advisory council to continue to see how can we not just help our school, our community, but also maybe our region, even the state as a large.

167
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:29,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Archimedes once said, give me a place to stand and I'll move the earth.

168
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:34,346
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say, give us a place to stand, give us a voice and we can make a difference.

169
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:35,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

170
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

171
00:34:49,102 --> 00:35:06,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Student involvement is integral integration, sorry, an integral part of the way that our school functions right it allows for the student voice that is generally under representative and splintered across many different perspectives to be assimilated and be

172
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,383
[SPEAKER_16]: presented to the school committee who has the power to make actual change.

173
00:35:13,224 --> 00:35:23,475
[SPEAKER_16]: The legislation created by this committee and the changes wrought by it have had significant positive impact over the course of many years that the school advisory committee has been running.

174
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:27,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And we hope to continue this legacy forward into the coming 2025-2026 year.

175
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:35,933
[SPEAKER_16]: This assimilation of ideas is not a process that happens out of nowhere.

176
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:57,484
[SPEAKER_16]: It is a process that involves deliberation and that involves research, that involves taking the opinions of the student body and drafting solutions and speaking to members of school administration and members of the government here in Medford to find which solutions are reasonable, which solutions feel like they're attainable.

177
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:04,318
[SPEAKER_16]: and then drafting responses, drafting opinion, which is brought here to you to deliberate on.

178
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:16,487
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is this process that has allowed us to have success in years previously, and we hope to bring forward into the following year when we talk about our regional council meetings.

179
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:22,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the scope of these problems are not restricted to Medford alone, they're restricted to any student everywhere.

180
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:32,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And by bringing these issues to a state level, we feel that we may be able to influence more schools and bring a better, more representative opinion of the student body.

181
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:41,532
[SPEAKER_16]: This process is aided not only by my fellow committee members, but also by our advisor, Ms.

182
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:43,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Freitas Haley, who provides

183
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:47,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say the role of another one of us.

184
00:36:48,319 --> 00:37:03,847
[SPEAKER_16]: She also brings forward opinions, also questions our outlooks, also asks what can be done here to the point where we feel that her contribution has been just as instrumental as the rest of us.

185
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:07,549
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to give a special shout out.

186
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,952
[SPEAKER_16]: This is especially meaningful to me because it is an outlet through which we can

187
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:19,192
[SPEAKER_16]: enforce ideas of effective altruism and change that we can bring that is positive.

188
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:29,276
[SPEAKER_16]: The devotion of our life to the helping of others is, in my opinion, the highest pursuit, and this opportunity is the epitome of doing so.

189
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:40,622
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that it's a podium that we all strive for to accurately represent those that place their faith in us, and we hope to continue doing so.

190
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:41,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

191
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:51,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

192
00:37:53,126 --> 00:38:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to say that I first joined this group of people back in like junior, sophomore, freshman year, I'm not sure.

193
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:08,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But I joined it because I had a lot of ideas, and I didn't really have anywhere to go with them.

194
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:13,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's part of the reason why this is such an important group of people is because we

195
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:22,322
[SPEAKER_02]: take in those ideas, we gather together the people in the student involvement organization, which is the like broader group of the student body.

196
00:38:23,222 --> 00:38:36,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sort of conglomerate them into like this big group in order to find the commonalities between them and find ways that the student body is agreeing that there's something that needs to happen here.

197
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

198
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:48,235
[SPEAKER_02]: as a group of driven individuals and with the help of the broader population, we're able to draft up ideas and find ways to fix those problems.

199
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:54,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And I especially appreciate this because it's such a like general process that involves so many different voices.

200
00:38:54,919 --> 00:39:03,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gives a chance for people to bring forward their ideas and bring forward their solutions in a way that they're not usually able to.

201
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Because other than this group, the main other way to have

202
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:24,383
[SPEAKER_02]: a voice at a larger administrative role is through student government, which is honestly a harder process to get into and ends up blocking out a lot of different voices, which we've been trying to fix with the expansion of that role.

203
00:39:24,443 --> 00:39:38,008
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, if people have an idea, but they don't necessarily have the chance to run for student office and put in that time just for that idea, this gives them an outlet to bring it forward, then we discuss it.

204
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:46,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And we find what sort of problems come from that initial problem, what sort of solutions come from the initial solution.

205
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:55,357
[SPEAKER_02]: We are able to bring together all different ideas and all different voices in a very broad discussion format in order to formulate the best

206
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:57,878
[SPEAKER_02]: option plan to move forward.

207
00:39:58,118 --> 00:40:01,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from that discussion, we bring things to you.

208
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:15,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bring this fleshed out idea that comes from so many different voices, so many different perspectives, and really, I guess, epitomizes the student body's voice in a way that no other group really seems to do.

209
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:25,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

210
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:32,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I believe I joined student advisory committee when I was back in sophomore.

211
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:37,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when I was a sophomore, and I had seen a problem and I had wanted it fixed.

212
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:41,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a part of the Vogue School at Medford High.

213
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:52,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And something about the Vogue School is that schedules are very different compared to like the normal high school where half the day consists of your shop.

214
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:56,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, a lot of people weren't able to take the classes they wanted.

215
00:40:57,029 --> 00:41:00,352
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw an opportunity to try and change that.

216
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:05,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some friends, we talked about it and we were like, yeah, you should do it.

217
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:06,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So I joined.

218
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:13,506
[SPEAKER_00]: and this year we finally got it implemented and that made me very happy because I could finally take the classes I wanted.

219
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:28,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed like these past three years was that a lot of people like to use our organization as kind of like

220
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:32,637
[SPEAKER_00]: a therapeutic like kind of area where you can vent your worries.

221
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:39,500
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like guidance counselors that measured high and a lot of people like to vent to them too, but it's not the same as like venting to your peers, you know?

222
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we also get stuff fixed.

223
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,683
[SPEAKER_00]: We can listen to their ideas, bring them up with you guys.

224
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:48,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

225
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:58,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions from the committee or comments?

226
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:58,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Tapa?

227
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:00,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

228
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:19,728
[SPEAKER_14]: It's no surprise to anyone that I'm super psyched about this because I was a member of student government at Medford High and then also all throughout higher education was involved with student leadership and student government and how do we advise and work to help form policy that we want to see every day that affects us every day.

229
00:42:20,388 --> 00:42:22,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's what led me to being here.

230
00:42:22,828 --> 00:42:28,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And I super appreciate the idea of expanding that and for bringing this committee back to life.

231
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,970
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved working with you all.

232
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:35,397
[SPEAKER_14]: two years ago a lot on some things and I'm really excited to see what you bring to the table moving forward.

233
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:38,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much for doing this work and I really appreciate it.

234
00:42:47,622 --> 00:42:49,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was going to say thank you as well.

235
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:55,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to let you know, so the rules of the school committee have a place for the student representatives.

236
00:42:55,953 --> 00:42:59,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hope to see at least one of you at every meeting.

237
00:42:59,518 --> 00:43:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to, I think, work with Ms.

238
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:03,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Freitas Haley.

239
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:11,189
[SPEAKER_04]: members of the committee to figure out how you get on the agenda if you have things you want to talk about and of course anything that we're discussing on the floor.

240
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:22,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Your seat is there but I think member on top is the one who's going to get tapped on the shoulder and borrow his microphone at any point, because we really do want to hear from you and a lot of the things that we do here come from

241
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:30,379
[SPEAKER_04]: your voices, whether or not they are in this public forum, but I love the idea and the practice of making them more visible.

242
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for being here and keep showing up.

243
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want you to be part of these meetings.

244
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:38,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think many of us would be very happy to be invited to your meetings.

245
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:41,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I think several of us attended in the past.

246
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,086
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't all show up.

247
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a problem for open meeting law, but we would love to be a part of it and make sure that this conversation goes both ways.

248
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,611
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

249
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:55,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

250
00:43:55,611 --> 00:44:13,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I think something that my colleague just mentioned actually both my colleagues mentioned is seeing a need and feeling a need I think you all kind of commented in your own ways that noticing something that you're seeing day to day in your classroom in your school, you know, amongst your peers your friends your teachers, whatever may be, and acknowledging that there's an opportunity here as someone who's witnessing this.

251
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a perspective that I want to communicate out to the people who can make the changes that I'd like to see.

252
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:24,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's something really important that we don't get the privilege of seeing necessarily because we're not in the classroom each day like you all are.

253
00:44:24,264 --> 00:44:32,827
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think maintain that, hold on to the opportunity that you are noticing to say, what can I do as someone who is seeing this need and how can I fill it, right?

254
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:41,690
[SPEAKER_13]: And even if that's just coming to a meeting like this, sitting in that student advisory chair and letting us know what you're noticing, what your colleagues or your peers are seeing and how we can best support you.

255
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,751
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think just appreciate that you guys are seeing that and you're actually living into that a little bit.

256
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:46,312
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

257
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say thank you.

258
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:54,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your words tonight.

259
00:44:54,842 --> 00:45:02,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your dedication and your commitment to being advisors for Medford High School and to bring that work here.

260
00:45:02,145 --> 00:45:05,467
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's very important.

261
00:45:06,107 --> 00:45:07,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight was like the epitome.

262
00:45:07,587 --> 00:45:11,769
[SPEAKER_19]: This is why we wanted to make sure we start our meetings with the Mustang moment.

263
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:19,613
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's important not only to remind all of us, but just for the greater community to hear the work, the wonderful work that you're doing.

264
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:34,203
[SPEAKER_19]: to engage with your classmates, to work with school leadership, to raise concerns and issues and have a dialogue and a discourse for what that means for the student body and then how to work through it.

265
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:37,365
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very important, especially nowadays.

266
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:39,626
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think you are all leading by example.

267
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:46,731
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thank you very much for the work you're doing and very excited for you to be joining our meetings each time we meet.

268
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:48,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much.

269
00:45:55,543 --> 00:46:17,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we all feel very grateful that you recognize the importance of student opinion in the creation of legislature affecting said students, as we hope that we can provide a touchstone for the student body throughout your decision making process and look forward to the future year.

270
00:46:20,393 --> 00:46:21,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

271
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:23,735
[SPEAKER_08]: We look forward to seeing you at our meetings.

272
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they're long.

273
00:46:25,736 --> 00:46:27,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's OK if you have to leave.

274
00:46:27,957 --> 00:46:35,642
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need us to change the agenda so you can participate, please just let one of us know, and we will work that out if it's a particularly long agenda because we want to hear from you.

275
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:42,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we may need to do a photo op if we can all convene.

276
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:43,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

277
00:48:07,028 --> 00:48:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

278
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:15,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Item number 6.2, we have a preliminary report on enrollment.

279
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, Interim Superintendent.

280
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

281
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:24,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Pippicelli.

282
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:28,826
[SPEAKER_19]: So at the beginning, yes, thank you very much.

283
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:36,412
[SPEAKER_19]: At the beginning of each school year, we usually report on just a brief overview of the enrollment at this time.

284
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:44,859
[SPEAKER_19]: So making sure that we have the disclaimer that enrollment at this time of year is pretty fluid and it fluctuates.

285
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I can make sure that I provide this body with

286
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:50,773
[SPEAKER_19]: updates as we go through.

287
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:57,618
[SPEAKER_19]: The October 1st SIMS data is due to the Department of Education by the end of October.

288
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:06,884
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now, currently, as of last week, our total enrollment is 4,125 students across the district.

289
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:15,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Here on the screen, you have just a snapshot of grade level and school with the district-wide view of 4,125.

290
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:24,557
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that I want to just call out is there's an asterisk, there is a column that says TBD.

291
00:49:25,598 --> 00:49:29,861
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a small number of students that are still not officially enrolled.

292
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:32,863
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just through the registration process.

293
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:40,929
[SPEAKER_19]: This year we have put some parameters in place to make sure that we are getting students into our buildings as quickly as possible.

294
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:46,854
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that we're not having students wait longer than a few days before they're entering Medford public schools.

295
00:49:47,494 --> 00:49:49,976
[SPEAKER_19]: However, there are some pieces of

296
00:49:51,717 --> 00:50:01,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Things that can hold that up for some students, that's EL testing, special education placement, or sometimes just medical needs.

297
00:50:02,443 --> 00:50:08,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Director Silva is working with families directly because we don't want that to be a barrier to them starting school.

298
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are some of the pieces that we've kind of put in place this year.

299
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:19,213
[SPEAKER_19]: but you will see just across the board what the enrollment looks like at this time.

300
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,674
[SPEAKER_19]: I will pause here before we go on.

301
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:28,236
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if there are any specific questions that you may have regarding enrollment.

302
00:50:31,037 --> 00:50:32,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions from the committee?

303
00:50:32,457 --> 00:50:34,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Roussell?

304
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:35,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

305
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:41,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Without digging through the data, are we approaching the need for any more kindergarten classrooms?

306
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:43,917
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

307
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:44,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

308
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:45,598
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

309
00:50:46,398 --> 00:51:01,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I think what we've seen a little bit this year is we have seen a decrease in some of our student enrollment or populations, especially around EL families.

310
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:05,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's a whole conversation.

311
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:05,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

312
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:21,924
[SPEAKER_19]: But I could just remind, I will just maybe, I'm sorry, Member Graham, but just to remind people that we did, the Roberts, since COVID, we've always had, we've had to put in a fifth K section.

313
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:23,324
[SPEAKER_19]: They started this year with one.

314
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:24,745
[SPEAKER_19]: We just, it was automatic.

315
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:28,846
[SPEAKER_19]: We did have to add kindergarten classrooms everywhere but the McGlynn.

316
00:51:34,148 --> 00:51:35,168
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, no, the Missittuc,

317
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:37,027
[SPEAKER_19]: is four.

318
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,088
[SPEAKER_19]: They have three of every section.

319
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:45,152
[SPEAKER_19]: The Brooks has five, the Missituck has four, the McGlynn has four, and the Roberts has five.

320
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:49,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brantley, did you have a question?

321
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had one question.

322
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:57,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know offhand the number of students that we had enrolled on our 10-1 report last year?

323
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:07,792
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, there is a just, well, I would have to go back just to make sure because when looking at the data for last year, it's the entire year.

324
00:52:07,972 --> 00:52:10,574
[SPEAKER_19]: And right now I just have like a month's snapshot.

325
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:19,660
[SPEAKER_19]: So it wouldn't be fair to necessarily tell you what those numbers were at the end of last year because enrollment ebbs and flows throughout the year.

326
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:25,425
[SPEAKER_19]: But there is at least like a 25 student difference.

327
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:27,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an increase or a decrease?

328
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:28,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Decrease.

329
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:30,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau?

330
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I have the report from last September 8th.

331
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,283
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had 4,207.

332
00:52:41,664 --> 00:52:45,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Interestingly, just three days before that, we had 4,214.

333
00:52:46,106 --> 00:52:50,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we say it's fluid, it's kind of wildly fluid at this time of year.

334
00:52:53,229 --> 00:52:55,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have the EL students?

335
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a separate category on there?

336
00:52:58,391 --> 00:52:58,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

337
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,762
[SPEAKER_19]: Not on the one that is on this presentation.

338
00:53:03,802 --> 00:53:05,182
[SPEAKER_19]: I can get you that information.

339
00:53:05,202 --> 00:53:06,543
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, that'd be good to know.

340
00:53:07,823 --> 00:53:15,685
[SPEAKER_15]: And my question is too complicated for this, but I just have a lot of questions about EL students.

341
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:27,909
[SPEAKER_15]: And when students leave, not just EL students, when all students, when students leave the district, there's not often a, we're leaving, goodbye.

342
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:34,839
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's hard to know why they left.

343
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:38,821
[SPEAKER_15]: We know if they go somewhere else and then that place asks for their transcripts.

344
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:43,683
[SPEAKER_15]: That's sort of the only way to know, but not all students, that's the case.

345
00:53:45,284 --> 00:53:45,584
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

346
00:53:46,384 --> 00:53:53,168
[SPEAKER_19]: The overarching piece I could give you is there are two buckets for that data trend right now.

347
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:55,549
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are students that have left the country.

348
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,501
[SPEAKER_19]: either permanently or visiting.

349
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:07,385
[SPEAKER_19]: But if it's for an extended amount of time, then that does affect their registration and they have to kind of go through that process again.

350
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:11,307
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the other bucket, which students have left Medford.

351
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:16,010
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we do have the data as to the places that they have gone.

352
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,893
[SPEAKER_19]: The majority are not to a private or parochial school.

353
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:24,714
[SPEAKER_19]: The majority are actually, they have moved residency.

354
00:54:26,337 --> 00:54:28,079
[SPEAKER_19]: I can give you that breakdown if you would like.

355
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I would.

356
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

357
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:32,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Olopade.

358
00:54:34,044 --> 00:54:34,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

359
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:36,786
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a quick question about the high school enrollment data.

360
00:54:38,088 --> 00:54:49,297
[SPEAKER_13]: For the final report, I know this is just preliminary, would there be a way to separate MHS from MVTHS just so we have an idea about the actual numbers of students that are allocating from the middle schools and then students that are coming into the districts?

361
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:49,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that

362
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:59,901
[SPEAKER_13]: the middle school count is 282, you know, obviously, but then the count for ninth grade is 307, so there is a, you know, 25, 30-ish student uptick.

363
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:04,063
[SPEAKER_13]: So just understand what that looks like and where that's coming from would be just awesome to have.

364
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:13,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, so because of the freshman rotations, I won't have ninth grade yet, but I can give you the split for 10th grade, 11th grade, and 12th grade.

365
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:14,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome, thank you.

366
00:55:17,908 --> 00:55:18,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley?

367
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:39,705
[SPEAKER_09]: just to follow up on member Rousseau's comment for the special ed piece I know that I code all the kids in a couple of different aspects of where they're moving to and why when they unenroll so if they don't come to school for so many days obviously the school will flag us and let us know and then we have to put that code in

368
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:45,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are times that I'm sure it happens with the Yale students, because that's not my department, but with the specialist students, I'm like, well, where did this kid go?

369
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:48,171
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to show that data.

370
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:57,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And then so when we're placing students, which happens to me every day in my role during the day, but all those specialist students come through my office.

371
00:55:58,779 --> 00:56:02,882
[SPEAKER_09]: How long does it take us to in Medford to place a special ed student?

372
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:10,191
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that varies depending on the needs, but we worked, Ms.

373
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:10,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Bowen, Ms.

374
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:18,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Silva, and I worked very hard to make sure that we're shrinking that timeline based on some of the data we were collecting last year.

375
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:25,984
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can get you what those specifics are, but we're really hoping for no more than three days.

376
00:56:26,004 --> 00:56:26,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

377
00:56:28,606 --> 00:56:28,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

378
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put three days-ish.

379
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:33,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

380
00:56:34,284 --> 00:56:36,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions about enrollment?

381
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Lopate?

382
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,891
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just to clarify, what does the KF stand for?

383
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:43,933
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kindergarten.

384
00:56:44,093 --> 00:56:44,273
OK.

385
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:44,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

386
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,656
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm glad you brought that up.

387
00:56:46,776 --> 00:56:48,017
[SPEAKER_19]: KF is kindergarten.

388
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:51,240
[SPEAKER_19]: PK is pre-K or our MEAP programs.

389
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:57,726
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I believe at the high school, the SP is project transition.

390
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:01,964
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's for our students that are 18 to 22 years old.

391
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:03,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

392
00:57:03,764 --> 00:57:04,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

393
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:08,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions about enrollment?

394
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:13,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, member Rousseau.

395
00:57:16,946 --> 00:57:17,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I did just Google.

396
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:19,007
[SPEAKER_15]: The F is for full day.

397
00:57:19,027 --> 00:57:21,787
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I'm like, what's the F for?

398
00:57:21,807 --> 00:57:22,547
[SPEAKER_10]: What is she saying?

399
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,355
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean full day?

400
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,796
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

401
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:30,936
[SPEAKER_08]: KF.

402
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:32,657
[SPEAKER_08]: F is for kindergarten.

403
00:57:32,677 --> 00:57:34,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Some districts go half days.

404
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:38,841
[SPEAKER_13]: KF, kindergarten full day, which is all kindergarten students here in Bedford.

405
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:39,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Every acronym.

406
00:57:56,131 --> 00:58:05,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, moving on to item number three, we have a recommendation to approve handbooks by Dr. Pelosi.

407
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:05,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

408
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:17,565
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so the school-based handbook, family and student handbooks saw three updates globally for this 25-26 school year.

409
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:23,347
[SPEAKER_19]: That was for the Metro Public Schools AI responsible use policy and guidance.

410
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:29,288
[SPEAKER_19]: It was for the expansion of curricular accommodations based on sincerely held religious beliefs.

411
00:58:29,868 --> 00:58:34,049
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it was the adjustments to our new arrival and dismissal times.

412
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:53,602
[SPEAKER_19]: So first we had a very dedicated group of Medford public schools administrators and staff members that worked throughout the year Tyler tirelessly last year to create language for students and staff and families around our AI policies guidance.

413
00:58:54,879 --> 00:59:18,245
[SPEAKER_19]: One of those was school committee member Erica Reinfeldt, and joining her from Medford Public Schools staff was also Molly Layden, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Will Pippicelli, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Dr. Peter Cushing, and teachers Dan Wagner, Jason Campbell, Rebecca McGinnis, Allison Quealy, Grace Turnbull, May Abusan, and Lindsay Rapucci.

414
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:31,841
[SPEAKER_19]: So they worked throughout the year to create a comprehensive tool that lays out the responsibilities and the resources that are available to our community around the guidance for AI.

415
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:39,747
[SPEAKER_19]: So the principles, just to highlight like the principles of this guidance were how the resources would support teaching and learning.

416
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:49,843
[SPEAKER_19]: It addressed data privacy and security considerations, and it supported the ethical and responsible use of generated AI tools.

417
00:59:51,283 --> 01:00:04,465
[SPEAKER_19]: If we go to the next slide, DESI has come out with their, last year they had their suggested timeline for districts that they wanted to see engage in this work.

418
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:09,266
[SPEAKER_19]: And this to the left was their projected timeline for doing such work.

419
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:13,665
[SPEAKER_19]: So for us here in Medford Public Schools, we have met their deadline.

420
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:20,347
[SPEAKER_19]: DESE had the policy going into effect next school year, 26-27.

421
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:24,268
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just a little bit ahead of the curve.

422
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:31,110
[SPEAKER_19]: What we are continuing to work on, I would say, would be just further professional development.

423
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,251
[SPEAKER_19]: There has been some professional development.

424
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:46,805
[SPEAKER_19]: throughout last year around cyber security around AI and the use of it in classrooms, but the continuation of offering professional development to our staff is still a goal and still ongoing.

425
01:00:49,117 --> 01:01:04,403
[SPEAKER_19]: If we go to the next, just the high level pieces that are in this AI guidance, all we have here just to give the community a brief overview is like a list of the table of contents.

426
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:10,486
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are the areas that are explained in the Medford Public Schools guide.

427
01:01:10,805 --> 01:01:19,591
[SPEAKER_19]: guidelines, both for students and for educators, there are embedded resources and links for people to use.

428
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:27,276
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, Member Reinfeldt, if you wanted to maybe highlight anything or mention anything about the work.

429
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I will note that this was not done in a vacuum.

430
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:39,412
[SPEAKER_04]: This was informed by a district-wide survey of, I will say, staff, teachers, administrators.

431
01:01:40,092 --> 01:01:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There were conversations around bringing in feedback from students and from families as a follow-on.

432
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:59,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal was really to get something on paper, but I think we had 120 or so responses, and we pulled out patterns, and we looked at those, and that really informed the discussions that we had.

433
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:04,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say this when we go to read the policy.

434
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:06,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I won't since I'm saying it now.

435
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:16,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But the review timeline on this we set at one year because things are changing so much as we learn.

436
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:25,374
[SPEAKER_04]: and as different software companies, programs decide to comply or not comply with student privacy laws.

437
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:38,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something that will be continually reviewed and that was always the goal and to see how with an eye to our student council representatives here, how this is actually affecting students and what this looks for.

438
01:02:38,776 --> 01:02:46,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were looking for a policy and guidelines that teachers at different grade levels and in different subject areas could

439
01:02:47,618 --> 01:02:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: customized to the needs of their particular learners.

440
01:02:50,861 --> 01:02:53,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So those were all parts of the conversation that we had.

441
01:02:53,383 --> 01:02:58,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to say more or answer specific questions, but I don't need to go on about it.

442
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:00,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

443
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:02,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Other questions, members of HAPA?

444
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So quick question.

445
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:09,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for all this information.

446
01:03:09,837 --> 01:03:16,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have on our agenda a policy on AI guidance and how that's gonna work.

447
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,016
[SPEAKER_14]: If we vote this into the handbook, is that the same ruling?

448
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are these two different rulings for two different things?

449
01:03:22,638 --> 01:03:25,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Because inherently, if we vote yes on this, it automatically brings it in.

450
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:35,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So the policy that is in paper, it takes the educator and student guidelines directly from the materials in the handbook.

451
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: The handbook contains additional information, like the resources and the language for syllabus, which wouldn't be a school committee policy.

452
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:46,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the policy also adds a little bit of,

453
01:03:46,753 --> 01:03:55,799
[SPEAKER_04]: top level framing for the policy book and a section on use in district operations, just because that was new guidance that came out.

454
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,082
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee was really focused on the classroom.

455
01:04:00,282 --> 01:04:05,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you asking whether we then have to approve both things in both places every time?

456
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:10,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking in terms of, no, I was just more of like if they were similar because

457
01:04:11,482 --> 01:04:21,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I have opinions about generative AI, and I have concerns, and I have issues with it, specifically how it's being used in the handbook and in the policy.

458
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:34,242
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was just making sure that how we vote on the handbook doesn't affect the policy, because I get into my specifics in reviewing the full policy in the text that it's written.

459
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:45,939
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the language is overlapping and I think one of the, as we discussed in the handbook policy, the handbook update policies.

460
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: those get reviewed and then summarized to align with the policy.

461
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:59,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the policy changes, the handbook would then have a follow-on update to reflect the new policy.

462
01:04:59,540 --> 01:04:59,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

463
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:04,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because just my question was then, do I say my concerns now, or do I wait till the policy reading?

464
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:09,968
[SPEAKER_14]: But if I can just wait until the policy reading, I can more dissect it in terms of that.

465
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:11,309
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good question.

466
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:27,035
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I might suggest is that you, at some point, when we're done, and I would like to hear from our students, a motion to sever the AI approval in the handbook until we get there.

467
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I was planning on doing.

468
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:30,716
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for affirming that.

469
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:39,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I would just like to second that.

470
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:40,739
[SPEAKER_16]: With regards to generative AI.

471
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:50,120
[SPEAKER_16]: my understanding that this is not the time to talk about that, but we have also some concerns with specific wording within the school student handbook.

472
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:51,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

473
01:05:53,443 --> 01:05:59,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So, member Antapa, do you want to make a motion to sever the MPS AI guidance from the handbook?

474
01:06:03,151 --> 01:06:04,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table.

475
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:04,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

476
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:06,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Handbook approval or handbook

477
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:14,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if that makes the most sense, then I'll motion to, I'll take the recommendation of Member Rousseau, motion to table the handbook discussion.

478
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:18,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there's a motion to table the handbook discussion by Member Ntapa.

479
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:19,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

480
01:06:19,615 --> 01:06:20,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Member Lopate.

481
01:06:22,656 --> 01:06:23,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

482
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:25,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Brantley.

483
01:06:25,817 --> 01:06:26,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

484
01:06:27,557 --> 01:06:35,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I just, I would like to hear the rest of the overview of the handbook updates before we table the full discussion.

485
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I think- Motion to table is undebatable.

486
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:39,556
[SPEAKER_06]: to be withdrawn.

487
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:41,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

488
01:06:41,217 --> 01:06:41,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

489
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:44,059
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like 10 minutes from now.

490
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:44,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's okay.

491
01:06:44,979 --> 01:06:46,760
[SPEAKER_08]: We can just shift gears.

492
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:47,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham?

493
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:48,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

494
01:06:48,601 --> 01:06:49,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Tapa?

495
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:49,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

496
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:50,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Olapate?

497
01:06:50,443 --> 01:06:50,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

498
01:06:50,943 --> 01:06:51,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Rheinfeld?

499
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:52,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

500
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:52,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Russo?

501
01:06:52,984 --> 01:06:53,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

502
01:06:53,204 --> 01:06:53,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Longo?

503
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:54,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

504
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

505
01:06:59,088 --> 01:07:05,272
[SPEAKER_08]: We will table the handbook discussion until we get through the AI policy, which is coming up shortly.

506
01:07:08,535 --> 01:07:14,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there may be somebody online who would like to speak and we will be back to you shortly.

507
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:22,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, item number four is a project manager position update Mr Ken Lord our chief operations officer.

508
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, thank you.

509
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:40,823
[SPEAKER_18]: As I have detailed in the memo, I'm requesting that we change the proposed job description for project manager to include building systems slash project manager.

510
01:07:41,503 --> 01:07:56,947
[SPEAKER_18]: It's become clear in the first month that I've been here that we do need a position like this to work with the new McGlynn and Andrews HVAC system to learn that complex system, be in charge of that, as well as other systems, as well as deal with project manager duties.

511
01:07:57,007 --> 01:07:57,807
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I've described here.

512
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley.

513
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,982
[SPEAKER_09]: This project now.

514
01:08:08,702 --> 01:08:09,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one?

515
01:08:09,883 --> 01:08:10,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Well yeah I know.

516
01:08:12,644 --> 01:08:15,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say specifically the HVAC project.

517
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:18,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay so right now we have the McGlynn and Anders HVAC project.

518
01:08:18,387 --> 01:08:22,109
[SPEAKER_18]: We have an owner's project manager JLL who's driving that project.

519
01:08:22,209 --> 01:08:26,871
[SPEAKER_18]: They work with the architect B2Q and the contractor Consigli.

520
01:08:27,692 --> 01:08:32,454
[SPEAKER_18]: And what Tom Ellis the representative from JLL is recommending

521
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:37,255
[SPEAKER_18]: we identify someone to learn those systems as they bring them on board.

522
01:08:37,315 --> 01:08:39,016
[SPEAKER_18]: They haven't started up any of those systems.

523
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:41,197
[SPEAKER_18]: The software is not even purchased yet.

524
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:45,458
[SPEAKER_18]: So we want to get this person in and ready to be able to hit that ground running when they're ready.

525
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, perfect.

526
01:08:47,118 --> 01:08:49,999
[SPEAKER_18]: The existing systems are managed by our maintenance staff.

527
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:53,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have the equipment to do what they need for now.

528
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:56,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And then obviously everything will be updated when the time comes.

529
01:08:56,942 --> 01:08:57,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

530
01:08:57,082 --> 01:08:57,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, perfect.

531
01:08:57,582 --> 01:08:57,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

532
01:09:03,445 --> 01:09:05,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the update.

533
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:05,645
[SPEAKER_13]: You just mentioned.

534
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:12,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any type of shift in the qualifications of the applicant needs to have or the commensurate pay or anything like that?

535
01:09:12,246 --> 01:09:15,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it just the expectation of the needs that you're recognizing?

536
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:19,288
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I think the pay is anti pay is correct.

537
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:25,749
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that there's we look for a little bit more of a mixture of experience rather than just someone who's saying, you know, a contract is licensed.

538
01:09:25,789 --> 01:09:27,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them are HBC experience.

539
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:28,430
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the core or mixture that?

540
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:29,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

541
01:09:33,008 --> 01:09:33,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Brantley.

542
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:37,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed the salary here.

543
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:41,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that similar to the salary that it was before?

544
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:42,575
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same one.

545
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same one.

546
01:09:43,236 --> 01:09:43,336
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

547
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:43,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure.

548
01:09:44,577 --> 01:09:44,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

549
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to approve this job description?

550
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:58,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion approved by Member Lopate, seconded by Member Brantley.

551
01:09:59,227 --> 01:09:59,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

552
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:06,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the roll is called, may I ask just a question?

553
01:10:07,698 --> 01:10:18,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Refresh my memory on the salary range, please.

554
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:18,181
110.

555
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:21,342

565
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:31,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

566
01:10:31,985 --> 01:10:32,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Russo.

[SPEAKER_08]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

570
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,371
[SPEAKER_08]: The job description is approved.

571
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:40,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

572
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:41,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

573
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:47,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we have continued business.

574
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:57,265
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an update and recommendation to approve the Cummings Foundation $35,000 grant for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

575
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:03,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Trotta submitted a report, and I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galluzzi.

576
01:11:05,089 --> 01:11:05,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

577
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:14,793
[SPEAKER_19]: So I know that Mr Trotter provided the membership with a little bit more description.

578
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:21,096
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that just to maybe get to like the key points in conversation with Mr Trotter.

579
01:11:22,905 --> 01:11:33,891
[SPEAKER_19]: The language that was in there that was causing some concern, I believe, was in there mistakenly and will not be in there in the future years of this grant, which is a 10-year grant.

580
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:47,498
[SPEAKER_19]: But you can see here the categories of pretty much how that for this school year, which follows how the other budgets have typically gone, what the buckets of spend are for.

581
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:51,660
[SPEAKER_19]: So the largest here is for staff stipends.

582
01:11:52,200 --> 01:12:00,604
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are chapters of CCSR at every school across the district, and these are going to the stipends.

583
01:12:00,644 --> 01:12:03,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, every school has one stipend.

584
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:09,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Some schools, depending on the number of students that are in that chapter, they may have two advisors.

585
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:14,372
[SPEAKER_19]: That's work for this year that's still unfolding to see how students are going to

586
01:12:15,232 --> 01:12:15,893
[SPEAKER_19]: participate.

587
01:12:16,353 --> 01:12:29,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the stipends also go to administrative assistant or secretarial type work in order to keep the purchase orders for materials and supplies going through Medford Public Schools.

588
01:12:29,905 --> 01:12:36,010
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not just, just to clarify, there's those additional stipends, one stipend as well.

589
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:46,652
[SPEAKER_19]: A bulk of the work goes to the supplies and the materials that are needed for each chapter to engage in the projects.

590
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:55,100
[SPEAKER_19]: So when students are working with their advisors to come up with what they want their project, their civic minded project to be.

591
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,922
[SPEAKER_19]: There's money that's allocated to their needs.

592
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I did ask about professional development materials.

593
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:17,775
[SPEAKER_19]: I did learn that there is a resource library in the Medford High School library that all of the advisors have access to, and that library keeps building in terms of resource for the advisors.

594
01:13:18,515 --> 01:13:22,097
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the last piece was just a small amount of money.

595
01:13:22,818 --> 01:13:25,340
[SPEAKER_19]: If there is an advisor, which has come up in the past,

596
01:13:26,605 --> 01:13:42,035
[SPEAKER_19]: wants to bring students on a field trip or bring in a guest speaker that is related to the work that they have chosen to do, that money is earmarked for just in case opportunities throughout the year.

597
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:47,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy to answer any further questions that you may have.

598
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:52,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ntapa, Member Reinfeld, and then Member Rousseau.

599
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:53,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

600
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:55,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really happy to see this

601
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:59,200
[SPEAKER_14]: breakdown and also you know the clarification in terms of the language.

602
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:09,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one thing to make very clear and important to folks is that this is not the only basis of funding for the CCSR, that the CCSR actually, especially in the

603
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:24,111
[SPEAKER_14]: secondary education part of the CCSR actually encourages students to get grants elsewhere and to help fund the projects through that as a way of project learning and a way for folks to learn how to do that in the real world.

604
01:14:24,151 --> 01:14:37,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that my project in the CCSR was mainly funded actually through Tufts and through Harbor Freight and that was done in with my advisor Michael Skorka teaching me how and Richard Trotta teaching me how to sort of do that.

605
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,675
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we see

606
01:14:40,616 --> 01:14:44,438
[SPEAKER_14]: These numbers outside of the scope of, well, how does that fund everything?

607
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:53,623
[SPEAKER_14]: It's important to know that at the core of the CCSR they are teaching students how to be advocates and how to advocate for themselves in terms of what they want to get funded.

608
01:14:53,683 --> 01:14:57,585
[SPEAKER_14]: So oftentimes they're reaching out to community partners for sponsorships and a lot of other things.

609
01:14:58,646 --> 01:15:01,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So just kind of like a point of information, I guess, about

610
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:09,112
[SPEAKER_14]: this funding when we see this here and we go, well, how does 4,000 sustain the various grade levels and various intricacies of projects?

611
01:15:09,252 --> 01:15:13,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Oftentimes we rely on our community partners and thank them for that.

612
01:15:13,234 --> 01:15:18,796
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for the clarification and I appreciate all the information presented.

613
01:15:20,117 --> 01:15:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeldt.

614
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:25,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I just wanted to thank Mr. Trotta for providing this.

615
01:15:25,879 --> 01:15:30,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I was the one who severed this last time and I just want to say thank you for providing the additional info.

616
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

617
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau.

618
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:35,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

619
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:45,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just looking at the letter again from last meeting, and I don't really feel like we got answers to the question we were asking, which was, what does the grant require?

620
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:51,472
[SPEAKER_15]: The letter explicitly references a relaxing of requirements.

621
01:15:52,378 --> 01:15:56,501
[SPEAKER_15]: what were the requirements and what are the requirements now is still unanswered.

622
01:15:57,462 --> 01:16:03,707
[SPEAKER_15]: And I went back and looked at the presentations from June and I still don't know how the $29,000 gets spent.

623
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:10,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, is it $28,995 for one person and a dollar for each other person?

624
01:16:10,152 --> 01:16:10,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

625
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,574
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not in any of the presentations we've received.

626
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:20,940
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not satisfied that this answers our questions and I'd like to get those questions answered.

627
01:16:23,088 --> 01:16:23,848
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's fair.

628
01:16:24,469 --> 01:16:33,214
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have requested a further drill down from Mr. Trotta around this for this school year.

629
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:37,076
[SPEAKER_19]: I can go back and get it for last school year, if that is the request.

630
01:16:37,837 --> 01:16:49,624
[SPEAKER_19]: This school year, we just don't have it yet because the participation is still, they're still kind of like building through enrollment of student participation, the number of advisors and what that will look like.

631
01:16:49,664 --> 01:16:51,605
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm happy to give that to you.

632
01:16:53,443 --> 01:17:02,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like last year's Yeah, I mean, because my sense after all these years is it's, it's pretty much been the same for the last eight years.

633
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:10,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, almost whatever the years have been, it's been, we've been paying the staff and everybody about the same.

634
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:12,729
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't know who's getting paid what.

635
01:17:14,736 --> 01:17:24,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really not, I mean, if it has nothing to do with us and we shouldn't be talking about the CCSR in any way, shape or form, then let's say that and stop talking about the CCSR.

636
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:29,342
[SPEAKER_15]: But we talk about it a lot and I have no idea what happens to the money and where it goes.

637
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:36,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not my opinion as a body that is responsible, acceptable.

638
01:17:36,525 --> 01:17:38,326
[SPEAKER_15]: So last year would be great.

639
01:17:38,786 --> 01:17:43,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's particularly different than the year before that, then I'd like to know that too.

640
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Antapa.

641
01:17:48,533 --> 01:18:00,468
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding for one for the in terms of where we find what those that is actually outlined in the 10 year grant contract executed in 2021 so we'd have to refer to that language to find out what that means outside of the scope.

642
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:13,310
[SPEAKER_14]: My understanding of the faculty and staff stipends when it comes to advising is more in the term of that this is the allotted amount and that it is earmarked for that.

643
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:17,134
[SPEAKER_14]: So that way every, you know, and I don't know what the number is.

644
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:19,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I was asked to be an advisor at some point.

645
01:18:19,856 --> 01:18:23,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I never got to that point of asking what the stipend weeks I didn't ask ignored.

646
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,220
[SPEAKER_14]: that I care.

647
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:37,427
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as I'm concerned, it's a baseline stipend of whatever the amount is, and then that $29,000 is basically reachable to them because we pay part of Mr. Trotta's salary through the budget.

648
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:40,849
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as I'm concerned, it's for folks outside of that.

649
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:42,750
[SPEAKER_14]: But I could be completely wrong.

650
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:46,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the answer 100%, so I don't want to pretend like I do.

651
01:18:47,092 --> 01:18:55,798
[SPEAKER_14]: But that is my interpretation of this letter and from past context, working with Director Trotta on this.

652
01:18:56,879 --> 01:19:02,102
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no Medford Public Schools operating funds that pay for CCSR.

653
01:19:02,342 --> 01:19:03,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It is entirely grant funded.

654
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:07,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for Mr. Trotta's stipend.

655
01:19:07,526 --> 01:19:09,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for Mr. Trotta's stipend.

656
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:10,348
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to be

657
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:14,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so sorry, I don't know if I'm like out of order by saying this.

658
01:19:15,562 --> 01:19:22,247
[SPEAKER_19]: But his stipend, part of the grant, I have learned part of the grant is that his stipend has to be separate from the grant funding.

659
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:31,375
[SPEAKER_19]: So that does go all to the work of CCSR and Medford Public Schools pays his stipend to oversee the grant.

660
01:19:36,331 --> 01:19:44,896
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone else's, all the other advisors and assistants, whether it's faculty or staff, is from this, but TRADA is the only one that is paid for in our budget.

661
01:19:46,217 --> 01:19:47,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

662
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:48,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley?

663
01:19:48,819 --> 01:19:52,861
[SPEAKER_09]: So who holds on to this $35,000?

664
01:19:55,423 --> 01:20:02,267
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an account, like a grant account in Medford Public Schools that is allocated each year and then it's drawn down for the

665
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:09,539
[SPEAKER_19]: for them to pay the stipends and to pay the materials and to so our grant manager Susan Callahan helps to manage.

666
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:16,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, this funding members so thank you.

667
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:19,804
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's sort of it there is a line item that pays for Mr.

668
01:20:22,048 --> 01:20:31,255
[SPEAKER_15]: But when there's this relaxation in that letter, does that mean we could perhaps use the grant to pay for him instead of the very limited Medford Public Schools funding?

669
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:34,758
[SPEAKER_15]: But it says relaxed with no explanation.

670
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,179
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that mean?

671
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:44,405
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not in writing, but that's why I was told it was in error.

672
01:20:46,507 --> 01:20:54,553
[SPEAKER_19]: it was an error and should not have been part of the clause and that clause is removed moving forward.

673
01:20:56,715 --> 01:21:00,517
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I could maybe do is ask for them to like reissue the letter.

674
01:21:00,537 --> 01:21:06,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what I'm not clear about is what is the clause that was an error?

675
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:10,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what did we think we had to do that we no longer had to do?

676
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:12,927
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the wording around it being relaxed.

677
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:18,579
[SPEAKER_19]: like and could be earmarked for other purposes, the language that you were concerned for last time.

678
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,184
[SPEAKER_08]: But what is being relaxed?

679
01:21:21,283 --> 01:21:23,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not quite like, what is relaxed?

680
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like a particular requirement?

681
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:31,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to be very clear about what we're being asked to approve a grant.

682
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:45,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of lore around how CCSR is funded, including I have been told by past people in the administration that we are required to pay stipends at certain levels to certain people.

683
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:49,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's true or if it's not true, but what I'm trying to understand

684
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:55,786
[SPEAKER_08]: is what are we required to do under the contract that we signed?

685
01:21:56,226 --> 01:21:57,527
[SPEAKER_08]: What are those features?

686
01:21:58,348 --> 01:22:04,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we relaxed something, is it all of it or is it a specific thing?

687
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:14,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to be clear what we're saying because I don't want people to go out and be like, the school committee is gonna go spend this money on whatever they want because it was relaxed.

688
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to be very clear about

689
01:22:18,342 --> 01:22:20,945
[SPEAKER_08]: what it is that was relaxed.

690
01:22:21,005 --> 01:22:22,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing has been relaxed.

691
01:22:22,747 --> 01:22:24,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing has been relaxed.

692
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:30,976
[SPEAKER_19]: The language was an error that how you're spending the money could be relaxed,

693
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:42,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing is being relaxed moving forward.

694
01:22:42,443 --> 01:22:51,230
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the three buckets of spend, which is stipends, materials, and field trips, transportation costs, guest speakers.

695
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,171
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.

696
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:54,473
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no relaxing of how we're spending our money.

697
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:59,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the three buckets in which CCSR is spending their money.

698
01:23:00,537 --> 01:23:04,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I would like to ask that we get an official correct

699
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:16,906
[SPEAKER_08]: letter from the Cummings Foundation so that we can approve this in a way that is diligent with what they're asking us to do, especially if nothing has been relaxed.

700
01:23:18,764 --> 01:23:19,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

701
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:23,106
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're in year eight of a 10 year grant.

702
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:23,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

703
01:23:23,907 --> 01:23:27,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the other thing is to say, oh, this was in the grant 10 years ago.

704
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:44,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that it was, but it's been 10 years and it would just also be helpful for people to say, here are the key features of the grant that was signed 10 years ago by nobody who's still in the building except for Mr. Trotta so that we can parse fact from fiction.

705
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:44,898
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

706
01:23:47,977 --> 01:23:48,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rizzo.

707
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I'm going to anyways.

708
01:23:54,340 --> 01:24:04,084
[SPEAKER_15]: But this paragraph, like nobody wakes up as they're typing a memo and writes a paragraph that says the foundation has lifted restrictions on the use of grant funds.

709
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:05,804
[SPEAKER_15]: That didn't come out of thin air.

710
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:10,706
[SPEAKER_15]: That came out of an email or a letter or a memo that somebody received.

711
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:12,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody just wrote that

712
01:24:13,118 --> 01:24:13,678
[SPEAKER_15]: for kicks.

713
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:25,684
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can understand if you're saying that there has in fact been nothing relaxed, but somebody received something somewhere along the line that definitely said restrictions have been relaxed.

714
01:24:25,704 --> 01:24:32,908
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't a sentence you can accidentally add a and or a not and suddenly get this sentence.

715
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:38,031
[SPEAKER_15]: This is clearly a paragraph written based on some other thing that exists somewhere.

716
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:42,213
[SPEAKER_15]: So I look forward to the report on what is

717
01:24:43,316 --> 01:24:44,937
[SPEAKER_19]: I will have the letter reissued.

718
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:49,200
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm still in my learning of CCSR.

719
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:57,185
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can't speak to what it was in the past, but I will absolutely get a yes, a revised letter.

720
01:24:58,066 --> 01:24:58,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

721
01:24:59,246 --> 01:25:00,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ntapa, did you have a question?

722
01:25:00,747 --> 01:25:06,071
[SPEAKER_14]: And one more not to like you said, I'm going to make maybe a dangerous assumption.

723
01:25:06,871 --> 01:25:07,812
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm assuming is

724
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:17,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I use the word assuming strongly, is that the Cummings Foundation had guidelines on what they wanted the grant funding to be spent on.

725
01:25:18,164 --> 01:25:30,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, with a lot of things happening federally with grant funding, what they're earmarked for, they are lifting certain recommendations to avoid becoming targeted.

726
01:25:30,887 --> 01:25:36,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to assume that they are basically saying we had priorities and now it's whatever you want to do.

727
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:41,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that seems to be the trend that seems to be what's happening nationally.

728
01:25:42,872 --> 01:25:46,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have a feeling that it was just more of or maybe it wasn't that deep.

729
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's nothing like that.

730
01:25:47,453 --> 01:25:51,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe it's just, you know, hey, we wanted to use it for this, but now

731
01:25:52,135 --> 01:26:02,945
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, whatever floats your boat, whatever we can do to make sure that students have student success and that they're doing the projects they want to do, and that we actually really don't care what you use it for as long as you spend it appropriately and responsibly.

732
01:26:04,646 --> 01:26:09,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think getting to the bottom of those choices is a good idea.

733
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:16,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying that that's probably... Is there a motion to table this update, this request to approve the donation?

734
01:26:20,136 --> 01:26:22,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we took it up on the agenda, so.

735
01:26:22,657 --> 01:26:22,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

736
01:26:25,099 --> 01:26:26,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table by Member Rousseau.

737
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:28,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

738
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:32,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Member Lopate.

739
01:26:32,543 --> 01:26:33,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

740
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:41,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brandley.

741
01:26:41,227 --> 01:26:44,309
[SPEAKER_09]: We're holding off on accepting the money.

742
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:45,229
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already accepted the money.

743
01:26:45,269 --> 01:26:48,151
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just holding off on the letter.

744
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:50,900
[SPEAKER_08]: We are tabling the motion to approve.

745
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:56,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee is required to approve donations and grants.

746
01:26:56,904 --> 01:26:57,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're holding off.

747
01:26:58,945 --> 01:26:59,685
Okay.

748
01:27:00,146 --> 01:27:01,646
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just withholding our approval.

749
01:27:02,027 --> 01:27:03,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

750
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

751
01:27:06,189 --> 01:27:07,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm like, hold on.

752
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:12,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We just want to be clear about what our requirements are when we accept money.

753
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:13,033
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

754
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:13,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

755
01:27:13,813 --> 01:27:13,993

784
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:22,745
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

785

01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:23,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so 2025 dash 2027 offered by member Reinfeld policy I J and D, the AI use of generative AI and Medford public schools.

825
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I am going to read this here with me.

826
01:29:27,477 --> 01:29:31,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important if we're going to have a discussion about it that we all are on the same page about what is here.

827
01:29:33,955 --> 01:29:41,103
[SPEAKER_08]: member public schools view certain technologies and integral part of the educational experience and is committed to providing a strong digital learning environment for all students.

828
01:29:41,663 --> 01:29:50,552
[SPEAKER_08]: We are dedicating, we are dedicated to providing all students with a 21st century education that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributors to a diverse and rapidly changing world.

829
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:59,603
[SPEAKER_08]: The MPS technology responsible use policy outlines the guidelines and behaviors that our users are expected to follow when using all technology, including AI.

830
01:30:00,164 --> 01:30:06,752
[SPEAKER_08]: MPS supports the use of developmentally appropriate technology resources, including Gen AI, to improve teaching and learning for all students.

831
01:30:07,392 --> 01:30:14,055
[SPEAKER_08]: MPS recognizes that AI literacy includes understanding, evaluation, and use of appropriate Gen-AI tools.

832
01:30:14,515 --> 01:30:20,558
[SPEAKER_08]: These skills are important for students and staff to participate effectively in technology-driven academic and work realities.

833
01:30:21,138 --> 01:30:30,343
[SPEAKER_08]: In accordance with the above, MPS will provide guidance, training, and resources to support the ethical and educationally appropriate implementation of Gen-AI tools across the district.

834
01:30:31,103 --> 01:30:32,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Some important definitions.

835
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:42,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Generative Artificial Intelligence, also known as Gen AI, is the type of technology that generates content including images, text, video, audio, and other media when prompted by a user.

836
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:50,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Generative AI is a machine learning model that creates new content based on large amounts of training data in response to user prompts.

837
01:30:52,617 --> 01:30:58,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Predictive AI analyzes historical data to examine trends and patterns and make predictions about the future.

838
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:07,126
[SPEAKER_08]: AI literacy includes learner skills and knowledge that demonstrate their understanding of the opportunities, risks, and ethical considerations of generative AI.

839
01:31:07,687 --> 01:31:08,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Guidelines for use.

840
01:31:09,288 --> 01:31:19,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Medford Public Schools AI guiding principles consider how the resource we use supports teaching and learning, addresses data privacy and security considerations, and supports ethical and responsible use of Gen AI tools.

841
01:31:20,715 --> 01:31:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to these considerations, students and staff must ensure critical evaluation of Gen-AI content to recognize biases and misinformation.

842
01:31:30,338 --> 01:31:51,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Guidance for the student's default use of Gen AI tools in a given department shall be consistent across grade level and shall not infringe upon a teacher's discretion to allow or disallow their use for specific assignments or to provide learning supports or accommodations to students as designated by law and documented under a student's IEP 504 plan or other relevant provision.

843
01:31:52,442 --> 01:32:00,525
[SPEAKER_08]: All Gen AI use must be linked to one or more specific educationally relevant objectives and shall not undermine the development of critical thinking skills.

844
01:32:01,065 --> 01:32:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: When responding to concerns about the use of Gen AI tools, MPS shall apply the same criteria used to review other instructional materials and access technology.

845
01:32:08,867 --> 01:32:10,828
[SPEAKER_08]: For students, Gen-AI tools.

846
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:15,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Any Gen-AI tools being used must follow usage terms, e.g.

847
01:32:16,431 --> 01:32:22,835
[SPEAKER_08]: age restrictions, caregiver permission requirements, etc., and align with district student and data privacy and security requirements.

848
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:28,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Students should not use any generative AI tools without prior approval from educators or educational teams.

849
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:32,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Students must also properly cite all AI-generated content.

850
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:33,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Plagiarism.

851
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:39,522
[SPEAKER_08]: AI tools are only to be used with the express permission of educators and academic teams.

852
01:32:40,363 --> 01:32:46,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Obtaining answers or completing assignments without properly attributing AI generated content is plagiarism and is forbidden.

853
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:53,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Teachers will provide information on the purpose of the assignment and how Gen AI should and shouldn't be used in the classwork.

854
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,551
[SPEAKER_08]: The academic honesty panel.

855
01:32:55,731 --> 01:33:05,100
[SPEAKER_08]: If students are suspected of plagiarism with Gen AI, teachers will be required to supply relevant work examples for review and determination by the academic honesty panel.

856
01:33:05,521 --> 01:33:06,982
[SPEAKER_08]: The panel's decision is final.

857
01:33:07,562 --> 01:33:08,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Assessments.

858
01:33:08,303 --> 01:33:17,311
[SPEAKER_08]: If allowed by the educational staff, AI tools may be used to assist students in preparing for assessments, but cannot be used to complete assessments unless explicitly stated.

859
01:33:18,349 --> 01:33:19,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Bias and critical thinking.

860
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:25,333
[SPEAKER_08]: All AI-generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

861
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:33,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Students should understand the limitations of AI-generated information and the importance of using trusted sources for information verification.

862
01:33:33,838 --> 01:33:34,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Citations.

863
01:33:35,019 --> 01:33:39,882
[SPEAKER_08]: A record of prompts used in Gen AI should be kept along with the output of the AI tool used.

864
01:33:40,422 --> 01:33:47,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Any AI-generated content used in assignments must be cited, and teachers will provide guidance for how to attribute AI-generated content in student work.

865
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:49,528
[SPEAKER_08]: data collection, and privacy.

866
01:33:49,988 --> 01:33:58,672
[SPEAKER_08]: All technology resources utilized in the Medford Public Schools, including Gen AI, will adhere to the district student data privacy, data collection, regulations, and best practices.

867
01:33:59,653 --> 01:34:06,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Students should never input personally identifying information, sensitive, or confidential data into any AI system, including images.

868
01:34:07,237 --> 01:34:15,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Students should immediately report any security breaches, suspicious activities, or exposure to inappropriate content encountered during AI use in school authorities.

869
01:34:16,302 --> 01:34:16,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Ethical use.

870
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:23,041
[SPEAKER_08]: All AI, all gen AI content should be critically reviewed before use.

871
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: All AI generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

872
01:34:29,046 --> 01:34:32,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Users may not use AI to create or disseminate harmful content.

873
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:41,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Any form of communication with or through AI tools, including chatbots or virtual assistants, must adhere to the same standards of respect expected in human interactions.

874
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:44,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Abusive, harmful, or disrespectful conduct

875
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:46,742
[SPEAKER_08]: conduct through AI platforms is unacceptable.

876
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:50,308
[SPEAKER_08]: The use of Gen AI for schoolwork must be recorded and shared.

877
01:34:50,388 --> 01:34:54,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Gen AI tools used in Memphis public schools are for educational purposes only.

878
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:57,405
[SPEAKER_08]: for educational staff.

879
01:34:57,905 --> 01:35:03,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Educational staff should speak with students about the definition use of Gen AI and MPS for Gen AI tools.

880
01:35:03,389 --> 01:35:13,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Any Gen AI tools being used must follow usage terms, including age restrictions, caregiver permissions, et cetera, and align with district student and data privacy and security requirements.

881
01:35:13,535 --> 01:35:21,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Educators use of Gen AI should be as a tool to support teaching and learning environment, but is not to be solely relied on in place of educator review and judgment.

882
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:31,305
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as assignments and assessments, teachers are responsible for posting expectations, allowable, and or prohibited uses of Gen AI tools for students' use in their classes.

883
01:35:32,146 --> 01:35:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: These expectations may be specified in assignment directions, the syllabus, Google Classroom information, classroom postings, or other relevant locations for students to access.

884
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:47,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Teachers might allow the limited use of generative AI on entire assignments or parts of assignments.

885
01:35:47,633 --> 01:35:50,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Educators should identify when and how Gen AI can be used and why.

886
01:35:51,493 --> 01:35:58,657
[SPEAKER_08]: For bias and critical thinking, all AI-generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

887
01:35:59,197 --> 01:36:06,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Educational staff should understand the limitations of AI-generated information and the importance of using trusted sources for information verifications.

888
01:36:07,301 --> 01:36:08,382
[SPEAKER_08]: AI detection tools.

889
01:36:08,922 --> 01:36:17,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, detection tools that claim to detect content developed by generative AI are not reliable enough to accurately identify cheating plagiarism on their own.

890
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:19,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Data collection and privacy.

891
01:36:20,642 --> 01:36:30,111
[SPEAKER_08]: All technology resources utilized in Medford Public Schools, including Gen AI, will adhere to district student data privacy, data collection regulations, and best practices.

892
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:35,777
[SPEAKER_08]: No private, confidential, or personally identifying information should be entered into Gen AI tools.

893
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:41,282
[SPEAKER_08]: The district's approved use of online platforms, software, and resources, including AI tools, should always be consulted.

894
01:36:42,103 --> 01:36:42,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Ethical use.

895
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:46,284
[SPEAKER_08]: All Gen AI content should be critically viewed before use.

896
01:36:46,684 --> 01:36:52,065
[SPEAKER_08]: All AI-generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

897
01:36:52,585 --> 01:36:56,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Users cannot use AI tools to create or disseminate harmful content.

898
01:36:57,066 --> 01:37:04,987
[SPEAKER_08]: All use of Gen AI for school work must be recorded and shared with teachers, such as with a transcript of prompts and responses.

899
01:37:05,387 --> 01:37:08,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Gen AI tools used in member public schools are for educational purposes only.

900
01:37:09,753 --> 01:37:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: For district operations, Medford Public Schools recognize that Gen AI is increasingly embedded in the tools and systems that districts are used for budgeting, staffing, resource allocation, operational decision making.

901
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:31,078
[SPEAKER_08]: These systems can help forecast trends, streamline processes, identify patterns and data, but may also reflect flawed assumptions, limit human discretion, and reinforce inequities in funding, hiring, or access to services.

902
01:37:31,858 --> 01:37:39,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Public Schools commits to operational uses of Gen-AI with the same attention to ethical principles, communication equity, legality, as with instructional tools.

903
01:37:40,382 --> 01:37:57,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, the use of Gen-AI tools for operational purposes will ensure transparency and oversight, support human judgment and review, monitor for bias and equity risks, strengthen data literacy and interpretation, use responsible procurement practices, and align with legal requirements and community values.

904
01:37:59,477 --> 01:38:00,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Monitoring and review.

905
01:38:00,838 --> 01:38:01,959
[SPEAKER_08]: We're almost done, I promise.

906
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:08,584
[SPEAKER_08]: The district has a right to monitor the use of AI technologies to ensure compliance with this policy.

907
01:38:09,324 --> 01:38:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Monitoring will be conducted in an ethical manner, respecting the privacy and rights of students and staff.

908
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:27,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to restriction of access to AI resources, educational interventions, or other disciplinary measures as deemed appropriate by the school administration.

909
01:38:29,388 --> 01:38:41,376
[SPEAKER_08]: MPS guidance as to responsible ethical use of Gen AI will be reviewed and updated annually to reflect new developments in AI technology, changes in legal and ethical standards, and the evolving needs of the educational environment.

910
01:38:42,436 --> 01:38:52,903
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a series of related policies around instructional material, curriculum instruction, access to electronic media, internet acceptable use, software policy, and policy hygiene.

911
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:54,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeld.

912
01:38:58,775 --> 01:39:04,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So the educational staff and the student is taken directly from the committee's language.

913
01:39:04,977 --> 01:39:14,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of this overview language is from, but I added the bits about consistency across grade level and within subject areas.

914
01:39:14,139 --> 01:39:19,520
[SPEAKER_04]: The thinking on that, right, is that if a student on side A at the Andrews has a different

915
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,301
[SPEAKER_04]: policy than side B at the McGlynn, that's a problem.

916
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:35,967
[SPEAKER_04]: But recognizing that these tools are used very differently in a humanities class, a science class, a world language class, special education, so special education professionals were on in this group to

917
01:39:36,647 --> 01:39:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: say when things are using English language learners have a different need than others and in terms of assessing where the students are.

918
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:59,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that was there and then as I mentioned the district operations that is kind of brand new in the DESE guidelines that came out at the end of August and I recognize that this work was done before our

919
01:40:00,337 --> 01:40:04,780
[SPEAKER_04]: chief operating officer and assistant superintendent for instruction and curriculum.

920
01:40:05,301 --> 01:40:09,304
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually began right in our surprise superintendent transition.

921
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:18,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have to thank Director Chiesa for stepping in and doing some of that material.

922
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:20,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where this came from.

923
01:40:23,287 --> 01:40:31,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it on the agenda tonight because I knew the handbooks were on the agenda and I think it would be inappropriate to be referencing a policy that doesn't exist.

924
01:40:31,713 --> 01:40:39,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So I welcome the discussion, friendly amendments, whatever we need to show that we're thoughtful and to make sure that we are supporting students.

925
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: The discussion in these committee meetings was these resources are here to stay.

926
01:40:45,222 --> 01:40:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be using them responsibly and we need to have a position and not just let things happen.

927
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:54,208
[SPEAKER_04]: because someone comes up with an idea.

928
01:40:54,308 --> 01:40:58,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am excited to have a consistent policy in this area.

929
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:01,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.

930
01:41:02,054 --> 01:41:03,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions from the committee?

931
01:41:05,136 --> 01:41:05,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo?

932
01:41:08,385 --> 01:41:09,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for doing this.

933
01:41:10,968 --> 01:41:11,809
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of work.

934
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:16,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate that there's, it's not just focused on students.

935
01:41:16,814 --> 01:41:20,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would have been the easy way out.

936
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:27,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't envy the staff that have to learn all these things that are

937
01:41:28,146 --> 01:41:29,767
[SPEAKER_15]: frankly, changing every day.

938
01:41:29,787 --> 01:41:35,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I think perhaps for students, it's easier to learn all this stuff, perhaps.

939
01:41:36,349 --> 01:41:40,751
[SPEAKER_15]: But did we have a mention of professional development in this?

940
01:41:42,548 --> 01:41:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we said that the district will provide training and resources.

941
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:48,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's the training is word.

942
01:41:48,492 --> 01:41:48,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

943
01:41:48,792 --> 01:41:49,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

944
01:41:49,192 --> 01:41:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the one of the objectives of the of this task force working group was to identify the training needs not prescribe what they should be.

945
01:42:00,339 --> 01:42:03,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that document exists, but has not been codified.

946
01:42:04,561 --> 01:42:14,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you mad for meetings, and I will also note that the language that is in the handbooks was reviewed at department meetings and building levels so.

947
01:42:15,335 --> 01:42:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It has seen other eyes, although, as we mentioned, additional input from different stakeholders is still needed here.

948
01:42:22,824 --> 01:42:23,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

949
01:42:23,284 --> 01:42:32,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just ask that in the next budget that we, I'm guessing that professional development around generative AI will not be free.

950
01:42:32,107 --> 01:42:36,048
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be quite an expensive professional development offering.

951
01:42:36,188 --> 01:42:43,431
[SPEAKER_15]: So just something to keep in mind for the next budget because our staff is certainly gonna need it.

952
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:50,633
[SPEAKER_15]: But as you pointed out, like different departments and different grade levels will need frankly, very different training.

953
01:42:51,433 --> 01:43:01,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm assuming the sciences, probably a lot of those teachers, at least at the high school level, are already pretty aware of a lot of this stuff.

954
01:43:01,799 --> 01:43:03,741
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you.

955
01:43:03,921 --> 01:43:06,522
[SPEAKER_15]: It's incredibly concise.

956
01:43:07,703 --> 01:43:16,548
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love the use of the word ethical over and over, because that is a harder one to nail down.

957
01:43:16,568 --> 01:43:19,490
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do like the

958
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:22,592
[SPEAKER_15]: the academic honesty panel.

959
01:43:22,672 --> 01:43:27,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about why there's this panel's decision is final.

960
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I would defer to the staff on that.

961
01:43:30,687 --> 01:43:36,889
[SPEAKER_04]: That was their language and not to pass the buck, but that was our teachers and administrators.

962
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:46,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they wanted it to be very consistent with the existing academic honesty and integrity policy, but I'm hoping.

963
01:43:47,013 --> 01:43:50,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to note that director Layden is not here.

964
01:43:51,455 --> 01:43:52,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Shana Tova to

965
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,891
[SPEAKER_04]: our Rosh Hashanah observers.

966
01:43:55,432 --> 01:44:06,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So there may be some questions here that our director of technology and library services may be better equipped to answer, but perhaps Dr. Galluzzi can talk about the panel.

967
01:44:06,921 --> 01:44:07,402
[SPEAKER_19]: No, thank you.

968
01:44:07,442 --> 01:44:08,783
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that was really nicely said.

969
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:17,971
[SPEAKER_19]: The only thing I would say is that I'm sure it's not a big surprise that especially secondary teachers are dealing with these issues quite regularly.

970
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:20,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And probably, I don't know,

971
01:44:22,201 --> 01:44:31,326
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't maybe necessarily say a daily basis, but I do think that it's, this is a conversation that is happening in a lot of secondary department meetings, classrooms.

972
01:44:31,987 --> 01:44:34,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I also know it's quite a conversation at college campuses.

973
01:44:35,949 --> 01:44:46,395
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of higher level institutions that are talking about going back to the oral exams and the blue books as a way to kind of navigate what is happening now.

974
01:44:47,055 --> 01:44:49,777
[SPEAKER_19]: And every time you turn around, there's now another like third,

975
01:44:50,657 --> 01:45:00,800
[SPEAKER_19]: party platform that's claiming to do some other involvement of AI functioning that can determine who's used it determine who's not.

976
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:06,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the real main goal for this which member Reinfeldt.

977
01:45:08,762 --> 01:45:25,289
[SPEAKER_19]: so eloquently said, but it's really to educate how it can be used as a tool, but not to replace critical thinking, problem solving, and teaching our students the skills that they need to thrive in college and in the real world.

978
01:45:25,709 --> 01:45:33,292
[SPEAKER_19]: But there are some instances where it can aid and support productivity and workflow.

979
01:45:33,693 --> 01:45:34,513
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that like,

980
01:45:35,113 --> 01:45:47,284
[SPEAKER_19]: having the opportunities to do that in classrooms where we're teaching students, the difference, getting back to that ethical word again, is really the essence of this guidance.

981
01:45:47,825 --> 01:45:55,572
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is important to, once approved and have the greater conversation, it is important to be reflected in the handbook.

982
01:46:02,336 --> 01:46:17,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to add that in our initial survey, we asked what the committee was, what the task should be, but also we got a high positive response to both generative AI tools support student learning and generative AI tools undermine student learning.

983
01:46:17,123 --> 01:46:20,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think everyone kind of recognizes the complexity of that.

984
01:46:20,965 --> 01:46:26,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Then this question that people are kind of most mixed on was, I know when my students are using generative AI tools.

985
01:46:27,068 --> 01:46:30,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a big range of, I know, I have no idea.

986
01:46:32,277 --> 01:46:43,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think more people said that their students didn't use the tools, but there was a recognition that that was going to increase over time.

987
01:46:43,984 --> 01:46:47,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we really wanted to get ahead of this with the policy.

988
01:46:48,046 --> 01:46:48,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

989
01:46:49,107 --> 01:46:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.

990
01:46:50,187 --> 01:46:50,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Brantley.

991
01:46:51,588 --> 01:46:58,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so my question was surrounding that academic honesty panel too, like who determines it at what grade level and all of that stuff.

992
01:46:59,893 --> 01:47:02,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there answer to that based on what you just said, or is that something?

993
01:47:02,955 --> 01:47:24,230
[SPEAKER_19]: I know you said it was sort of brought by the teachers, but... The way that for the situations that have been arising prior to this guidance, the way that's being handled is with in-school teams that usually comprise school leaders, teachers, and school counselors.

994
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:24,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

995
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:31,353
[SPEAKER_19]: And then bringing in at times if needed department heads to like a doctor keys or Dr. Khan.

996
01:47:31,974 --> 01:47:32,375
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, good.

997
01:47:32,396 --> 01:47:33,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, thank you.

998
01:47:33,458 --> 01:47:35,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember in tapa

999
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:38,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1000
01:47:38,398 --> 01:47:46,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say first and foremost, thank you member Reinfeldt and everyone on the committee for putting their heads together, thinking about what this looks like, thinking about the policy.

1001
01:47:47,006 --> 01:47:47,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1002
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:50,830
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very clear on a lot of things.

1003
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:54,213
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of, you know, the policy is bulky in terms of that.

1004
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:55,594
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of guidance, right?

1005
01:47:55,654 --> 01:47:56,875
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some things we just can't avoid.

1006
01:47:56,895 --> 01:48:01,399
[SPEAKER_14]: It's sometimes like we want to make them as short and simple as we can, but you always want to make sure things are clear.

1007
01:48:01,459 --> 01:48:02,100
[SPEAKER_14]: There's clarity.

1008
01:48:04,172 --> 01:48:07,037
[SPEAKER_14]: There's clarity amongst other things that better less likely.

1009
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:21,406
[SPEAKER_14]: The first question I have is, has the district identified what generative AI models are state approved, are district approved, are OK to use in the system?

1010
01:48:21,426 --> 01:48:24,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it mentions that in the DESE guidelines, they have to be vetted.

1011
01:48:25,108 --> 01:48:26,429
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was curious.

1012
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:30,652
[SPEAKER_04]: The district maintains a list of acceptable software programs.

1013
01:48:30,732 --> 01:48:32,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, I believe, includes generative AI.

1014
01:48:32,894 --> 01:48:36,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they were adding the generative AI tools as of the writing of this policy.

1015
01:48:36,796 --> 01:48:39,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question for Molly Leighton as well.

1016
01:48:39,318 --> 01:48:49,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, in terms of what, because there's thousands of models and there's different third party softwares in terms of which- Only a certain number of them have the agreement.

1017
01:48:49,535 --> 01:48:51,955
[SPEAKER_04]: to for student data protection.

1018
01:48:51,995 --> 01:48:54,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really the that's the filter there.

1019
01:48:55,016 --> 01:49:00,297
[SPEAKER_14]: I was gonna say, because that is that's my biggest concern is in terms of student data privacy.

1020
01:49:00,317 --> 01:49:01,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1021
01:49:02,037 --> 01:49:10,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And we kind of said there, there isn't a, it doesn't make sense to list those out in the policy because things change and legal.

1022
01:49:10,759 --> 01:49:16,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So the district maintains that in the same way that they maintain other acceptable software and

1023
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:22,865
[SPEAKER_04]: why Google this works and Microsoft that doesn't, or I'm not trying to slam any particular company that was random.

1024
01:49:22,905 --> 01:49:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I understand.

1025
01:49:23,865 --> 01:49:28,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, my question, it was more in terms of like, have we identified yet, you know what I mean, in terms of what we have.

1026
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:35,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, like you said, things are fluid, things change, we find a problem with the software, we take it off the list, it happens all the time.

1027
01:49:35,949 --> 01:49:52,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sort of breaking this apart in terms of, so I understand in terms of citing AI sources, I find it very interesting because it basically seems like the old adage of you can't cite Google because you can't cite a Google search.

1028
01:49:52,353 --> 01:49:55,614
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's exactly what an AI citation is through MLA and APA.

1029
01:49:55,694 --> 01:50:05,016
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you're writing what you searched up, what model you used and what day it was, which is funny because you go through primary and secondary education and they tell you not to do that with Google.

1030
01:50:05,136 --> 01:50:05,436
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet,

1031
01:50:06,578 --> 01:50:12,789
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't our language, but this is what the language is across the nation in terms of MLA and APA, what is acceptable.

1032
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:26,367
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's kind of hilarious, especially if you know how AI works in terms of machine learning that inherently it is plagiarism because it is pulling together a bunch of sources and spitting out a summary without any real citation.

1033
01:50:27,288 --> 01:50:37,755
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you've, you know, in college, they always teach you, even if you summarize, even if you don't use every single word, word by word, or even have two of the same, you still have to cite it because you're still using someone else's information to form your opinion.

1034
01:50:37,855 --> 01:50:42,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And so generative AI being cited is an interesting sort of,

1035
01:50:43,315 --> 01:50:45,256
[SPEAKER_14]: cycle of like, that's an interesting kind of thing.

1036
01:50:46,356 --> 01:50:56,439
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of us implementing generative AI, I know that we as a committee stand on policies that are sustainable and making sure we're in our environment.

1037
01:50:56,519 --> 01:51:08,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you know about AI, generative AI, you know how much energy it uses and how much water it uses and how much fossil fuels it inherently uses to generate answers and to machine learn these systems.

1038
01:51:08,203 --> 01:51:10,224
[SPEAKER_14]: And so from a sustainability standpoint,

1039
01:51:11,466 --> 01:51:13,227
[SPEAKER_14]: not that sustainable.

1040
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:18,131
[SPEAKER_14]: There are ways for them to, I'm sure, to get the energy from solar or wind.

1041
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:19,932
[SPEAKER_14]: But for the most part, it's really not.

1042
01:51:20,992 --> 01:51:35,202
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of ethical usage in the arts, there is no way to ethically use AI, except for if you code an AI system and feed it only your artwork, it is inherently plagiarism and not stealing like an artist, which you and I both understand.

1043
01:51:35,242 --> 01:51:38,384
[SPEAKER_14]: It is more of the stealing of everything else.

1044
01:51:39,845 --> 01:51:42,247
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are sort of some of my concerns.

1045
01:51:42,267 --> 01:51:53,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I will note that the environmental piece came up as ethical as an umbrella, both ethically in terms of personal development and learning, but also in terms of societal impact.

1046
01:51:55,055 --> 01:51:55,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, 100%.

1047
01:51:55,956 --> 01:51:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was certainly discussed, but the point is taken.

1048
01:52:00,979 --> 01:52:05,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say I wrote a very different policy for my graduate students than I wrote here.

1049
01:52:06,485 --> 01:52:06,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1050
01:52:06,966 --> 01:52:19,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm definitely pulling in from what the conversations are happening in the art world in terms of higher ed and these are the conversations we're having every single day in terms of how AI is implemented in policy in the classroom in higher education.

1051
01:52:20,421 --> 01:52:25,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the part of bias and critical thinking should be checked for accuracy, bias, and misinformation.

1052
01:52:26,225 --> 01:52:37,815
[SPEAKER_14]: For me, it's at this point, what's the point then in terms of taking a shortcut to summarize these things and then have to go back and still check them to make sure they're factual and to make sure that they are appropriate?

1053
01:52:37,875 --> 01:52:39,356
[SPEAKER_14]: And then who is doing that checking?

1054
01:52:39,376 --> 01:52:44,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think my colleagues behind me have some opinions about that in terms of what then

1055
01:52:47,314 --> 01:52:48,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we would like to hear from them.

1056
01:52:48,656 --> 01:52:52,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have anything that you wanted to amend about this policy?

1057
01:52:52,258 --> 01:53:01,846
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually, in opposition of the policy, I think that we shouldn't be, it is my personal opinion that we really shouldn't be implementing this into the curriculum in terms of its usage.

1058
01:53:01,966 --> 01:53:02,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that

1059
01:53:03,828 --> 01:53:20,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Being aware, especially in terms of literacy when we look at political and also national literacy around what is generative AI what is real and what is not I think is a very scary thing it is approaching very quickly in terms of we look at AI models that are generated from last year until this year.

1060
01:53:21,663 --> 01:53:28,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sort of more nitpicking this in terms of that my amendment would be to only have a literacy aspect to it.

1061
01:53:28,206 --> 01:53:37,231
[SPEAKER_14]: And the only times that we use this is to teach about what generative AI is, but it is not my welcoming to incorporate this into the curriculum in terms of as a tool.

1062
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:46,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand its benefits, but I personally do not have a positive outlook on generative AI and the future that it has in terms of where it will be going.

1063
01:53:46,856 --> 01:53:48,257
[SPEAKER_14]: So to that, I defer.

1064
01:53:49,201 --> 01:53:50,362
[SPEAKER_14]: to my colleague next to me.

1065
01:53:50,642 --> 01:53:53,485
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not even my job, but that is my job.

1066
01:53:53,645 --> 01:53:54,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm unclear.

1067
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:56,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you making a motion or are you not making a motion at this time?

1068
01:53:56,968 --> 01:53:58,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, at this time, there is no motion.

1069
01:53:58,990 --> 01:53:59,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1070
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:00,411
[SPEAKER_14]: These are just comments and questions.

1071
01:54:00,691 --> 01:54:00,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1072
01:54:01,092 --> 01:54:01,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1073
01:54:03,994 --> 01:54:05,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I see we have a new colleague joining us.

1074
01:54:07,978 --> 01:54:09,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we have some specific

1075
01:54:10,901 --> 01:54:18,006
[SPEAKER_16]: issues with the wording present within the current student handbook in result in regards to generative AI.

1076
01:54:18,566 --> 01:54:30,475
[SPEAKER_16]: This is more specific concerns, but under bias and critical thinking, all AI generated content should be checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and politically and potentially negative content.

1077
01:54:31,055 --> 01:54:37,640
[SPEAKER_16]: And under citations, a record of prompts used in generative AI should be kept along with the output from the AI tool used.

1078
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:41,422
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, who is doing this work?

1079
01:54:42,263 --> 01:54:43,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is keeping this record?

1080
01:54:43,784 --> 01:54:45,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is responsible for ensuring this record is kept?

1081
01:54:46,366 --> 01:54:48,807
[SPEAKER_16]: What is the punishment in case this record is not kept?

1082
01:54:49,908 --> 01:54:55,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Secondly, does this apply to participate to preparation for assignments, as is mentioned elsewhere in the document, or

1083
01:54:57,273 --> 01:55:00,738
[SPEAKER_16]: simply to the creation of content for the assignments themselves.

1084
01:55:00,758 --> 01:55:02,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this is generally not clear.

1085
01:55:04,457 --> 01:55:11,382
[SPEAKER_16]: The student handbook itself places particular emphasis on OpenAI's chat GPT over other generative AI models.

1086
01:55:11,402 --> 01:55:13,003
[SPEAKER_16]: We believe that this is overly specific.

1087
01:55:14,604 --> 01:55:16,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I stop you?

1088
01:55:16,385 --> 01:55:22,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we do this one at a time, just so that if there are answers, we can not forget what the answer is before we get to the next thing.

1089
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:26,492
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the first question, can you just tell us your first question again?

1090
01:55:26,512 --> 01:55:29,034
[SPEAKER_08]: It was about bias and critical thinking.

1091
01:55:29,394 --> 01:55:42,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so under both the bias and critical thinking and citation sections, records are meant to be kept either of prompts or ensuring that they are checked for accuracy, bias, misinformation, and potentially negative content.

1092
01:55:43,529 --> 01:55:45,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Our question here is who is responsible for this work?

1093
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:50,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is responsible for ensuring that this list has been created?

1094
01:55:51,657 --> 01:55:55,718
[SPEAKER_16]: And what are the repercussions should this work not be done?

1095
01:55:56,298 --> 01:56:05,741
[SPEAKER_16]: And does this apply to only the creation of material for assignments themselves or preparation for tests, as mentioned, at other points throughout the document?

1096
01:56:07,061 --> 01:56:07,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1097
01:56:08,542 --> 01:56:09,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeldt, did you have an answer?

1098
01:56:11,082 --> 01:56:14,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was developed by committee, but I believe

1099
01:56:17,492 --> 01:56:22,895
[SPEAKER_04]: The intention on who is keeping these records is the person completing the assignment.

1100
01:56:24,096 --> 01:56:33,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the prompts list is only for the assignments work that is turned in to say this is the sourcing for the content that I'm providing.

1101
01:56:34,221 --> 01:56:40,485
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my understanding of what the teachers on the committee were thinking with this language.

1102
01:56:41,706 --> 01:56:42,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo?

1103
01:56:44,609 --> 01:56:46,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, it does depend on which tools you're using.

1104
01:56:46,852 --> 01:56:55,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, I use AI all day, every day as a software developer, but, you know, the prompts that I make and the answers that I get

1105
01:56:57,302 --> 01:57:01,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I can look at them going back as far as I want.

1106
01:57:02,425 --> 01:57:03,326
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't go away.

1107
01:57:03,346 --> 01:57:13,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, if you're just using a free web version of something, you probably don't get all those features, which is why using the approved list would be very important.

1108
01:57:14,852 --> 01:57:21,376
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I'm not familiar with all the tools I use, the tools I use, which everybody knows there are many tools every day.

1109
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,597
[SPEAKER_15]: There seems to be another tool.

1110
01:57:23,157 --> 01:57:31,721
[SPEAKER_15]: but using a tool for which you do not get an audit history of what you're doing seems like an absolute no-go.

1111
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:40,245
[SPEAKER_15]: As I read this policy, if you open a tool and it doesn't let you see what you asked it and what the answer was three weeks ago,

1112
01:57:41,835 --> 01:57:53,790
[SPEAKER_15]: You shouldn't be using that tool, because you can't comply with the policy that says here's you when you go to turn in the paper, unless you copied it down at that moment, which is also, you know,

1113
01:57:54,918 --> 01:57:56,339
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not how people do work.

1114
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:06,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you're not gonna ask a question or make this paragraph better and then go off and write some gigantic audit log of your own.

1115
01:58:06,808 --> 01:58:08,450
[SPEAKER_15]: That is totally unreasonable.

1116
01:58:09,731 --> 01:58:17,297
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're using a tool that's keeping track of it, then it becomes, it's still a heavy lift.

1117
01:58:17,717 --> 01:58:20,580
[SPEAKER_15]: The question is, is it a heavier lift than just doing it all without

1118
01:58:21,597 --> 01:58:25,739
[SPEAKER_15]: generative AI, and I suppose it depends what it is you're doing.

1119
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:39,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say that in most cases, I mean, I am wildly more productive as a software developer using generative AI than going off and learning an entire new whatever.

1120
01:58:40,967 --> 01:58:42,528
[SPEAKER_15]: When I only need a little tiny thing.

1121
01:58:44,109 --> 01:58:48,732
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so to me that's the answer.

1122
01:58:48,752 --> 01:59:01,220
[SPEAKER_15]: But I obviously was not part of this committee, but I think that, you know, if you read something at the library and you don't write down the reference, and then you have a great memory and you write down exactly what you read.

1123
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:06,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Sent word for word, but don't put any, you don't remember what book it was.

1124
01:59:07,634 --> 01:59:11,197
[SPEAKER_15]: It still counts as academic dishonesty, right?

1125
01:59:11,557 --> 01:59:23,586
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to think this is actually less work than some of that other stuff that we used to have to do in the olden days, card catalogs and all that good stuff.

1126
01:59:23,867 --> 01:59:27,369
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really aging myself, but that's how I interpret it.

1127
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:32,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Now this is the policy, like policy is not,

1128
01:59:33,741 --> 01:59:35,902
[SPEAKER_15]: most of the time is not implementation.

1129
01:59:36,062 --> 01:59:44,264
[SPEAKER_15]: So the gory details of how it gets done, like if there's 10 tools that are approved, the answer is probably different for every tool.

1130
01:59:45,584 --> 01:59:53,226
[SPEAKER_15]: So our policy is not going to be for this specific tool, make sure you click this after you do a question and you get your answer.

1131
01:59:53,346 --> 01:59:59,987
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just not, that's an option for policy, but it becomes incredibly brittle.

1132
02:00:00,267 --> 02:00:02,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're constantly modifying policy

1133
02:00:03,343 --> 02:00:19,567
[SPEAKER_04]: every week when there's a new AI tool so that's how I interpret this to answer your question and I will add I back in this language so it's all use of Jenny I for schoolwork must be recorded and shared with teachers such as with a transcript of prompts and responses.

1134
02:00:20,027 --> 02:00:31,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So the policy is written to give teachers some flexibility in explaining what their expectations are and to say, this is how I want you to be citing things.

1135
02:00:31,559 --> 02:00:38,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't require that list of prompts, but the teacher, this is an example of something that a teacher might request.

1136
02:00:39,167 --> 02:00:48,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher might say, I want a disclosure of AI to say, I use this tool in my introduction, or I use this in my research to create an outline, but I don't need the specific prompt.

1137
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:52,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the such as is actually important here in that language.

1138
02:00:52,831 --> 02:00:55,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that addresses the concern.

1139
02:00:56,533 --> 02:01:08,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I might from the chair, this policy lays out that students are responsible for this and teachers are responsible for setting the parameters by which it will be used in their classrooms.

1140
02:01:08,756 --> 02:01:25,520
[SPEAKER_08]: So just like any assignment that you get, your teacher is going to tell you what they expect from the assignment, how to cite things, whether you type it or you send it to them in the mail, like all of those things come from your teacher on an assignment by assignment basis.

1141
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is not.

1142
02:01:27,021 --> 02:01:29,023
[SPEAKER_08]: asking anybody to do anything different than that.

1143
02:01:29,043 --> 02:01:37,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It is asking teachers to clearly outline that to you all, but it is asking you as a student to adhere to the use of the tool.

1144
02:01:37,554 --> 02:01:44,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So from a bias perspective, this policy is asking you to do it and it is asking teachers to do it and be clear about it.

1145
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:52,575
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that is a very helpful explanation of the intent behind the message present within the document.

1146
02:01:53,376 --> 02:01:58,802
[SPEAKER_16]: We're simply requesting that within the document itself, this intent is better expressed.

1147
02:02:02,145 --> 02:02:02,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1148
02:02:03,166 --> 02:02:05,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't, as for Mr. Hsu, I

1149
02:02:10,508 --> 02:02:16,731
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that it's pertinent to discuss exactly which models are allowed at this moment, given that they change so frequently.

1150
02:02:17,832 --> 02:02:32,619
[SPEAKER_16]: But on your point in increased productivity, I think it's a common concern here shared by the board members that there's a difference between AI allowing you to do something faster and you actually understanding the process in which you do that.

1151
02:02:35,885 --> 02:02:39,232
[SPEAKER_16]: As for the rest of the document, yeah.

1152
02:02:44,513 --> 02:02:44,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

1153
02:02:44,693 --> 02:02:45,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that.

1154
02:02:45,474 --> 02:02:45,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1155
02:02:46,595 --> 02:02:46,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1156
02:02:48,236 --> 02:02:53,720
[SPEAKER_16]: The document, we believe that the document is overly specific in reference to particularly OpenAI's Chachapiti.

1157
02:02:54,360 --> 02:03:08,831
[SPEAKER_16]: While it remains the most commonly used AI model in terms of user base at the moment, we recognize that the landscape is rapidly changing and believe that more general knowledge would be, general wording would be helpful in this regard.

1158
02:03:09,571 --> 02:03:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I can speak to that if you'd like.

1159
02:03:11,732 --> 02:03:20,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's in the definition section, because a lot of people use chat GPT interchangeably with generative AI.

1160
02:03:20,956 --> 02:03:23,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was to specify that it is a specific tool.

1161
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:27,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not the list of approved resources.

1162
02:03:27,639 --> 02:03:31,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a definition of clarifying language.

1163
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:39,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that that might be the case in that particular section, but it is mentioned throughout the document at other points, including differences in citation.

1164
02:03:40,892 --> 02:03:44,793
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't have any other examples written down, but I believe that there was another one.

1165
02:03:44,873 --> 02:03:55,076
[SPEAKER_16]: So I might be wrong, but I don't believe that that is restricted only to the section you're referencing.

1166
02:03:55,116 --> 02:03:59,017
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, it is important to define those terms.

1167
02:03:59,457 --> 02:03:59,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1168
02:04:08,402 --> 02:04:24,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, like my colleague, sorry, board member here said, there are vastly different security profiles that constantly change for different models.

1169
02:04:24,874 --> 02:04:33,059
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we would also like to, again, second the importance of regulating the use of specific models within the school system.

1170
02:04:35,381 --> 02:04:42,006
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, DeepSeek, which is owned by a Chinese company, may have different policies than OpenAI.

1171
02:04:42,086 --> 02:04:45,769
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, that is a concern we would like to second.

1172
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:53,174
[SPEAKER_16]: In terms of environmental impact, we recognize, again, that these models have significant energy requirements.

1173
02:04:54,695 --> 02:05:00,380
[SPEAKER_16]: However, there is a general trend that these companies are turning to cleaner sources of energy we've seen.

1174
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:08,324
[SPEAKER_16]: two purchases of and construction of nuclear power plants for the running of AI data centers.

1175
02:05:09,464 --> 02:05:14,387
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a trend that is not exclusive to the use of fossil fuels.

1176
02:05:15,768 --> 02:05:26,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And then again, I wanna second the concern for cognitive decline as the result of over-reliance on these models.

1177
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:30,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1178
02:05:32,151 --> 02:05:33,651
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quite a lot for your first meeting.

1179
02:05:33,711 --> 02:05:41,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

1180
02:05:42,395 --> 02:05:46,897
[SPEAKER_04]: If this passes its first reading, we will have a second reading.

1181
02:05:47,037 --> 02:05:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to take the request to explicitly call out energy requirements as a separate thing from general ethics.

1182
02:05:56,281 --> 02:05:56,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's

1183
02:05:57,881 --> 02:05:59,062
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

1184
02:05:59,082 --> 02:06:05,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cognitive decline is a really important thing.

1185
02:06:06,705 --> 02:06:18,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's embedded in the critical thinking, but I think maybe an understanding the impact of AI is maybe part of the literacy component of it.

1186
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:23,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we can look at the policy with that in mind.

1187
02:06:23,272 --> 02:06:24,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to say something

1188
02:06:25,137 --> 02:06:25,337
[SPEAKER_04]: else?

1189
02:06:25,577 --> 02:06:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is.

1190
02:06:26,638 --> 02:06:33,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I will note that I did add the phrase developmentally appropriate in front of technology use.

1191
02:06:34,761 --> 02:06:39,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think in a future meeting, I may bring that to the technology responsible use policy.

1192
02:06:39,663 --> 02:06:46,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that was part of the idea here in terms of what's happening to our brains as we use these tools.

1193
02:06:47,287 --> 02:06:49,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's that research is

1194
02:06:50,533 --> 02:06:56,807
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out fast and furious, and to member on top was a point very alarmingly so.

1195
02:06:58,434 --> 02:07:00,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, although this is a very new topic.

1196
02:07:01,096 --> 02:07:04,779
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just, again, would like to exercise caution in that regard.

1197
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,622
[SPEAKER_16]: And then one last point, which I forgot.

1198
02:07:08,202 --> 02:07:11,705
[SPEAKER_16]: The student handbook refers to generative AI as Gen AI.

1199
02:07:11,725 --> 02:07:17,530
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a minor nitpick, which is fine, but it doesn't make clear that it's an abbreviation.

1200
02:07:18,091 --> 02:07:19,832
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's just slightly problematic.

1201
02:07:21,514 --> 02:07:22,454
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a huge deal.

1202
02:07:22,915 --> 02:07:23,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1203
02:07:23,598 --> 02:07:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we put it in the first mention, but if we didn't, that can certainly be fixed.

1204
02:07:27,461 --> 02:07:30,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Just gen.ai or any other.

1205
02:07:33,306 --> 02:07:34,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Making it more clear than ever.

1206
02:07:36,770 --> 02:07:56,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I could recap on the policy, I think I've heard a request to make clear that it is both student and teacher responsibility to check for bias, critical thinking and citations.

1207
02:07:57,836 --> 02:08:11,687
[SPEAKER_08]: that we clarify the use of the phrase ethical use and that we reference not just critical thinking but also the

1208
02:08:15,289 --> 02:08:18,291
[SPEAKER_08]: potential cognitive decline that is associated.

1209
02:08:18,311 --> 02:08:23,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the three changes potentially that I saw.

1210
02:08:23,713 --> 02:08:25,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And the environmental impact.

1211
02:08:25,194 --> 02:08:26,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And the environmental impact.

1212
02:08:27,935 --> 02:08:29,936
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to recap that.

1213
02:08:29,996 --> 02:08:30,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1214
02:08:33,252 --> 02:08:33,892
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I can't.

1215
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:39,775
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's OK.

1216
02:08:39,835 --> 02:08:44,757
[SPEAKER_08]: So potential updates would be reference to cognitive decline.

1217
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:57,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Like direct reference that it is the expectation of both students and teachers to check for bias and citation.

1218
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:00,045
[SPEAKER_08]: The environmental impact.

1219
02:09:02,226 --> 02:09:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And.

1220
02:09:04,648 --> 02:09:07,309
[SPEAKER_08]: We said the clarification of ethical is that.

1221
02:09:07,389 --> 02:09:12,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And clarification of the word ethical to include environmental impact.

1222
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:21,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the three things that I'm hearing in the room that might warrant an amendment.

1223
02:09:22,912 --> 02:09:28,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we also add security concerns in the selection of appropriate models for use in classrooms?

1224
02:09:29,757 --> 02:09:33,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you say more about what you're thinking about?

1225
02:09:33,501 --> 02:09:37,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, certain models have different policies when it comes to disclosure of user data.

1226
02:09:38,205 --> 02:09:49,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And as these are students and minors that are interacting with these models, it's important that in the selection of appropriate models, we keep in mind the security concerns.

1227
02:09:52,796 --> 02:09:58,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I believe that that is actually covered because it does talk about our data security practices.

1228
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:05,044
[SPEAKER_08]: So any tool that would be approved would have to be compliant in that space.

1229
02:10:05,264 --> 02:10:06,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it could not be approved.

1230
02:10:07,886 --> 02:10:08,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also right.

1231
02:10:08,787 --> 02:10:10,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the related policies.

1232
02:10:10,548 --> 02:10:12,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the access to electronic media.

1233
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:20,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely a or the Internet acceptable use and software.

1234
02:10:20,074 --> 02:10:21,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all covered in there.

1235
02:10:29,058 --> 02:10:33,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to approve the first reading with amendment?

1236
02:10:40,645 --> 02:10:44,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve the first reading as amended by member Rousseau.

1237
02:10:47,089 --> 02:10:47,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

1238
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:51,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by member Branley.

1239
02:10:52,133 --> 02:10:53,334
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I believe that was the mayor.

1240
02:10:53,694 --> 02:10:54,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

1241
02:10:55,115 --> 02:10:56,316
[SPEAKER_08]: The voice came from over there.

1242
02:10:59,537 --> 02:11:00,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Mayor Longo Kern.

1243
02:11:02,539 --> 02:11:03,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

1244
02:11:11,364 --> 02:11:11,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Brantley.

1245
02:11:12,645 --> 02:11:13,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

1246
02:11:13,666 --> 02:11:13,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1247
02:11:14,126 --> 02:11:14,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ntapa.

1248
02:11:14,726 --> 02:11:16,467
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1249
02:11:16,487 --> 02:11:17,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Olopade.

1250
02:11:17,528 --> 02:11:17,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1251
02:11:18,008 --> 02:11:18,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Reinfeldt.

1252
02:11:18,889 --> 02:11:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1253
02:11:19,689 --> 02:11:20,810
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, Mayor Longo Kern.

1254
02:11:21,543 --> 02:11:21,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1255
02:11:23,084 --> 02:11:25,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1256
02:11:26,306 --> 02:11:27,347
[SPEAKER_08]: First reading is approved.

1257
02:11:31,608 --> 02:11:32,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we there.

1258
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:33,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sorry.

1259
02:11:34,151 --> 02:11:34,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair.

1260
02:11:34,971 --> 02:11:48,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think I'm not sure all the students necessarily know the whole process for policy approval but we have a second reading at the next meeting, or a following meeting, we can't get it that quickly.

1261
02:11:48,863 --> 02:11:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Time.

1262
02:11:50,325 --> 02:11:53,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, so it may not be right away but so the second reading will be.

1263
02:11:55,587 --> 02:12:02,210
[SPEAKER_15]: there'll be edits, and then we can either approve it or send it to another meeting for further edits.

1264
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:05,231
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, of course, we can always just vote it down.

1265
02:12:05,491 --> 02:12:08,032
[SPEAKER_15]: But just wanted you all to be aware.

1266
02:12:08,672 --> 02:12:08,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1267
02:12:13,174 --> 02:12:17,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to take the handbooks off the table?

1268
02:12:19,961 --> 02:12:27,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to take the handbooks off the table by member and tapa there a second, seconded by member Reinfeld roll call, please.

1269
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Bramley.

1270
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:38,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1271
02:12:38,650 --> 02:12:39,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Memogram.

1272
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:39,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1273
02:12:39,751 --> 02:12:40,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Member and tapa.

1274
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:41,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, my role of honey.

1275
02:12:41,732 --> 02:12:42,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1276
02:12:42,152 --> 02:12:42,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Memorandum.

1277
02:12:43,153 --> 02:12:43,913
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, never.

1278
02:12:43,933 --> 02:12:44,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, Maryland.

1279
02:12:44,773 --> 02:12:45,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1280
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:49,062
[SPEAKER_08]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1281
02:12:49,622 --> 02:12:54,406
[SPEAKER_08]: We will cycle back to the superintendent's recommendation to approve handbooks.

1282
02:12:56,148 --> 02:12:57,169
[SPEAKER_08]: The floor is yours again.

1283
02:12:57,249 --> 02:13:02,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we may have a question online that has to do with the start of school.

1284
02:13:03,395 --> 02:13:08,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're done with your update about the handbooks, perhaps you can answer that question.

1285
02:13:08,259 --> 02:13:11,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just going to give one moment.

1286
02:13:15,257 --> 02:13:15,397
[SPEAKER_19]: great.

1287
02:13:15,437 --> 02:13:15,797
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1288
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:17,939
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr Pippa Sully.

1289
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:22,882
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's two more sections as previously stated that are updates to the handbook.

1290
02:13:23,642 --> 02:13:25,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, this one is on.

1291
02:13:27,505 --> 02:13:28,365
[SPEAKER_19]: June 27th.

1292
02:13:28,825 --> 02:13:31,727
[SPEAKER_19]: The U. S Supreme Court issued a decision.

1293
02:13:31,747 --> 02:13:44,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Um in Mahmood versus Taylor, which is requiring school districts nationwide to provide parents and caregivers the opportunity to review instructional content in advance if they request.

1294
02:13:44,845 --> 02:13:54,148
[SPEAKER_19]: to allow students to be excused or receive curriculum accommodations if it conflicts with their sincerely held religious beliefs.

1295
02:13:54,948 --> 02:14:06,792
[SPEAKER_19]: So it is important to note that curriculum decisions still remain under the authority of public schools and that it does not alter our instructional standards or our program of studies.

1296
02:14:07,472 --> 02:14:22,228
[SPEAKER_19]: But what it does is just affirm that upon request materials can be provided to parents and caregivers so that they can review and request reasonable accommodations for their religious objections.

1297
02:14:22,588 --> 02:14:28,635
[SPEAKER_19]: So what that there is on the next slide language that we are adding into our handbooks.

1298
02:14:29,175 --> 02:14:37,080
[SPEAKER_19]: so that we are consistent with the Massachusetts Regulation 603 CMR 26.05 Section 1.

1299
02:14:37,941 --> 02:14:51,590
[SPEAKER_19]: The Medford Public Schools, through its curricula and materials, encourages respect for the human and civil rights of all individuals, regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.

1300
02:14:52,271 --> 02:14:57,934
[SPEAKER_19]: And in accordance with district guidelines, families may request information from building principals

1301
02:14:58,935 --> 02:15:03,099
[SPEAKER_19]: on available accommodations related to curriculum content.

1302
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:10,125
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we are encouraging here is our charge, our collective charge this year is about belonging.

1303
02:15:10,565 --> 02:15:16,711
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is for every single student, every single staff member, every single family member, every single community member.

1304
02:15:17,411 --> 02:15:24,297
[SPEAKER_19]: And so what we really want to ensure is that we are prioritizing conversation and communication.

1305
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:40,633
[SPEAKER_19]: So if there is a caregiver that has concern over any curriculum related materials, they need to reach out to the building principal who will engage in dialogue with the caregiver regarding the scope and sequence and what those curricular materials may be.

1306
02:15:42,175 --> 02:15:51,683
[SPEAKER_19]: And on a district level that those building principals may reach out to Dr. Kim Talbot, who was our assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

1307
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:59,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo, did you have a question about this topic before we move on?

1308
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:00,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.

1309
02:16:00,171 --> 02:16:00,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1310
02:16:01,771 --> 02:16:02,391
[SPEAKER_15]: The floor is yours.

1311
02:16:02,711 --> 02:16:03,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1312
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:08,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to be clear that accommodations does not mean alternative education.

1313
02:16:08,912 --> 02:16:09,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1314
02:16:10,052 --> 02:16:11,813
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't provide two educations here.

1315
02:16:13,553 --> 02:16:22,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So when a student opts out, they will simply be missing out on their education or the education that we had planned.

1316
02:16:22,995 --> 02:16:24,915
[SPEAKER_15]: They will not be getting an alternative.

1317
02:16:24,975 --> 02:16:25,315
[SPEAKER_15]: They will

1318
02:16:26,204 --> 02:16:45,659
[SPEAKER_15]: whether that's not being class or, you know, it depends of course on the class and the grade level and all that other, we're not sending a kindergartner to sit in the hall, but, or maybe I don't know what we're doing, but I just want folks to understand that that does not mean that every parent can decide they wanna have a separate education for their child.

1319
02:16:46,020 --> 02:16:49,002
[SPEAKER_15]: They can decide that their kid will not get some education.

1320
02:16:51,004 --> 02:16:51,884
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering about,

1321
02:16:54,379 --> 02:17:01,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Parental review of curriculum is, have we gone down the path of what does it mean for review?

1322
02:17:02,209 --> 02:17:12,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if I have a high school, if I didn't finish high school and my child is in AP physics and I wanna know what the curriculum is.

1323
02:17:13,133 --> 02:17:15,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we obligated to hand the curriculum over?

1324
02:17:15,914 --> 02:17:25,739
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm assuming, of course, probably inappropriately, but perhaps the parents will not be capable of knowing what the hell they're reading or looking at.

1325
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:30,922
[SPEAKER_15]: What is our obligation to help them understand what the curriculum is?

1326
02:17:30,942 --> 02:17:35,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when I started on school committee, I was like, let's see our sex education curriculum.

1327
02:17:35,524 --> 02:17:37,645
[SPEAKER_15]: And I went in and I got it and it was a binder.

1328
02:17:37,665 --> 02:17:39,967
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like a thousand pages long or more.

1329
02:17:39,987 --> 02:17:42,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it was multiple binders like this.

1330
02:17:44,154 --> 02:17:50,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was quite the slap in the face for somebody who doesn't have an education background.

1331
02:17:50,599 --> 02:17:56,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I say, let me see the curriculum, that's not quite as simple a request as I thought.

1332
02:17:58,224 --> 02:18:06,130
[SPEAKER_15]: So are we saying we will, and I realize this maybe hasn't happened yet, and maybe we haven't worked it out.

1333
02:18:06,658 --> 02:18:13,522
[SPEAKER_15]: but are we handing over, and by the way, when I was handed those curriculums, I wasn't like, those are licensed copies.

1334
02:18:13,622 --> 02:18:20,426
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't take them home because like, they were not, like we had a certain number, they belong to the district.

1335
02:18:22,047 --> 02:18:29,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we sending parents home with curriculum and being like, well, here you go, or are we helping them understand what's in there?

1336
02:18:30,672 --> 02:18:36,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that's the case, that seems like a very large,

1337
02:18:37,492 --> 02:18:41,874
[SPEAKER_15]: amount of effort on our part.

1338
02:18:42,534 --> 02:18:59,460
[SPEAKER_15]: And I realize that this is new, and maybe there isn't an answer, but I'm worried that we're going to be accused of burying parents who are wanting to perhaps opt their kids out of certain things.

1339
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:06,262
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm worried about the teaching staff because all of our curriculum is not like

1340
02:19:06,891 --> 02:19:08,111
[SPEAKER_15]: off the shelf curriculum.

1341
02:19:08,611 --> 02:19:20,775
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like there's like a, you know, a lot of our curriculum is because we've been improving and getting it, you know, modernized, but not all of our curriculum is here's the, you know, here's the documents.

1342
02:19:22,495 --> 02:19:29,477
[SPEAKER_15]: So what happens to teachers who teach a class that has no specific curriculum, that they've made it up themselves?

1343
02:19:30,797 --> 02:19:32,778
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know we have classes like that in high school.

1344
02:19:34,918 --> 02:19:38,621
[SPEAKER_15]: do they have, and I keep asking questions and don't let you answer, but I'm just very worried.

1345
02:19:38,641 --> 02:19:40,682
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to remember them all.

1346
02:19:40,762 --> 02:19:46,387
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll stop talking, but this whole thing is freaking me out, as I'm sure it's freaking you out.

1347
02:19:46,747 --> 02:19:50,049
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want, I'll just do one final thing.

1348
02:19:50,230 --> 02:19:55,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope we're going to keep track of this very carefully, so we understand what it costs us.

1349
02:19:56,835 --> 02:19:57,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1350
02:19:58,836 --> 02:19:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. DeLuzzi?

1351
02:19:59,937 --> 02:20:00,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1352
02:20:00,417 --> 02:20:07,860
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think the biggest, as I previously mentioned, but the biggest piece that I want to say is that this requires conversation.

1353
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:18,783
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is not a request that can be made through email or through just one phone call.

1354
02:20:18,923 --> 02:20:25,546
[SPEAKER_19]: This needs to be a conversation that building leaders are engaging in with caregivers.

1355
02:20:27,099 --> 02:20:37,108
[SPEAKER_19]: It would require the caregivers to have a review of like the scope and sequence, so they can see maybe content that is coming up.

1356
02:20:37,989 --> 02:20:42,732
[SPEAKER_19]: It is not something where it's an individual lesson per se but I think.

1357
02:20:43,553 --> 02:20:55,682
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that Dr. Talbot is working on with directors is making sure that we have scope and sequence available to caregivers so that they can engage in that conversation.

1358
02:20:56,242 --> 02:20:58,263
[SPEAKER_19]: We are recording requests.

1359
02:20:58,904 --> 02:21:02,606
[SPEAKER_19]: We are making sure that we're documenting our efforts of outreach

1360
02:21:03,587 --> 02:21:13,092
[SPEAKER_19]: and working with caregivers so that we can understand and have an internal path as to what was requested and how we came about those decisions.

1361
02:21:13,772 --> 02:21:22,457
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is true that the Supreme Court ruling did not rule that school systems are obligated to provide alternative

1362
02:21:24,438 --> 02:21:41,630
[SPEAKER_19]: materials, lessons, activities for students, but a lot of I think that that also speaks to why the conversation is so important to have with caregivers and what that might mean for the student.

1363
02:21:42,090 --> 02:21:42,611
[SPEAKER_19]: So in like

1364
02:21:44,685 --> 02:21:54,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, there is no judgment here, but I also want to make sure that the conversations are like what this looks like for the student and the impact that that has for the student.

1365
02:21:56,494 --> 02:22:02,636
[SPEAKER_19]: and what that means in terms of what their experience in that class will be.

1366
02:22:02,656 --> 02:22:08,118
[SPEAKER_19]: And so making sure that parents know that it's a conversation.

1367
02:22:08,338 --> 02:22:17,322
[SPEAKER_19]: The other piece is that this is about religiously held beliefs and content that may

1368
02:22:20,014 --> 02:22:21,394
[SPEAKER_19]: they may find objectionable.

1369
02:22:21,494 --> 02:22:33,542
[SPEAKER_19]: And that also requires conversation to make sure we're getting at the root as to how and why does this particular content go against your religiously held beliefs.

1370
02:22:33,783 --> 02:22:37,005
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's also a matter of conversation that needs to be had.

1371
02:22:37,025 --> 02:22:40,067
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope I answered your questions.

1372
02:22:42,648 --> 02:22:43,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo.

1373
02:22:46,962 --> 02:22:47,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1374
02:22:48,443 --> 02:23:03,332
[SPEAKER_15]: When you said it, the impact on the student, I think I'm reminded of our work on discipline that shows that when a student is out and they come back, every other student is negatively impacted by the need to bring that student up to speed.

1375
02:23:05,834 --> 02:23:09,496
[SPEAKER_15]: When a student is missing and they come back, they didn't get what they needed yesterday.

1376
02:23:09,816 --> 02:23:12,458
[SPEAKER_15]: For whatever reason, the teacher does not have

1377
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:16,682
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, a bifurcation of curricula for every single student.

1378
02:23:17,202 --> 02:23:29,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So the student that comes back the next day having missed the content, it's like research has really solved all this, negatively impacts every other student in the class.

1379
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:36,354
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that's one of the reasons we should be incredibly careful about taking kids out of classes for discipline.

1380
02:23:36,834 --> 02:23:41,517
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that I would just also say that we should include that in our conversations,

1381
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:46,752
[SPEAKER_15]: it isn't just that kid who might be removed because of this.

1382
02:23:47,233 --> 02:24:05,663
[SPEAKER_15]: In math and science where every single day is building on the previous day, I was never really an English person, so maybe in the humanities as well, but little is taught that is never referenced again.

1383
02:24:06,343 --> 02:24:09,625
[SPEAKER_15]: So deciding you don't want your student to receive some content

1384
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:15,582
[SPEAKER_15]: there's not a lot of classes where that's the one time it's ever discussed.

1385
02:24:15,922 --> 02:24:21,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, I'm glad you're starting with conversations.

1386
02:24:21,966 --> 02:24:26,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that I hopefully can we can reduce this to a very small number.

1387
02:24:26,449 --> 02:24:26,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1388
02:24:27,049 --> 02:24:27,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1389
02:24:27,830 --> 02:24:28,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rheingold.

1390
02:24:30,969 --> 02:24:49,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping you could comment just on what the expectations or requirements are for teachers in terms of posting syllabus having the curriculum night and I know we also in some cases do information sessions about potentially sensitive content, I know we did that when that when we.

1391
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:55,124
[SPEAKER_04]: in fifth grade when the puberty unit comes up, that is available as a resource.

1392
02:24:56,025 --> 02:25:01,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've, I think, talked previously about listing what curricula are being used.

1393
02:25:01,049 --> 02:25:07,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I know DESE has it on their site, but putting it on our website and saying this is the curriculum we use for math and for science.

1394
02:25:08,374 --> 02:25:11,616
[SPEAKER_04]: As Member Russo mentioned, you can't just hand over a curriculum.

1395
02:25:12,897 --> 02:25:21,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very protected, but what are the expectations for educators to make that information available proactively?

1396
02:25:21,483 --> 02:25:22,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for that.

1397
02:25:22,084 --> 02:25:33,231
[SPEAKER_19]: That's actually part of the ongoing conversations that we're having right now to make sure that things are kind of housed in one location and it makes it easier for reference and for review.

1398
02:25:33,251 --> 02:25:37,634
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of teachers use Google Classroom and it

1399
02:25:38,054 --> 02:25:58,952
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a landing page for caregivers and for students to be able to go right there and see what the syllabi, or the resources, or the content is and so us encouraging and making sure that that is still happening so that it's accessible to caregivers, especially at the secondary level.

1400
02:25:59,993 --> 02:26:01,093
[SPEAKER_19]: is the expectation.

1401
02:26:01,113 --> 02:26:04,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a mandate, but it is an expectation.

1402
02:26:04,695 --> 02:26:06,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it explicit or implicit?

1403
02:26:08,096 --> 02:26:08,716
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of both.

1404
02:26:08,996 --> 02:26:14,838
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just going to say, I know that's not answering your question, but that's pretty much how I would like to answer that question.

1405
02:26:15,838 --> 02:26:20,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it is, I mean, this was something that happened over the summer.

1406
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:22,621
[SPEAKER_19]: And so this is the work that

1407
02:26:23,917 --> 02:26:30,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Talbot is doing with directors and school leaders, and they are doing with educators.

1408
02:26:30,902 --> 02:26:34,124
[SPEAKER_19]: So that has been the expectation at the secondary level.

1409
02:26:34,164 --> 02:26:39,428
[SPEAKER_19]: That is still the expectation as we work through what this looks like as we move forward.

1410
02:26:39,848 --> 02:26:41,890
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, it's completely different for elementary.

1411
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:52,778
[SPEAKER_19]: And so additionally, that kind of chain of command is if once teachers receive any sort of outreach or request from caregivers, they immediately go to their

1412
02:26:54,049 --> 02:26:54,470
[SPEAKER_19]: principle.

1413
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:55,491
Right.

1414
02:26:55,511 --> 02:26:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know sometimes I sign a syllabus for my child.

1415
02:26:58,553 --> 02:26:59,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I don't.

1416
02:27:00,915 --> 02:27:03,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And different things are available at different curriculum nights.

1417
02:27:03,076 --> 02:27:05,979
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've always had that information up front.

1418
02:27:06,339 --> 02:27:06,799
[SPEAKER_08]: So great.

1419
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:08,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1420
02:27:11,163 --> 02:27:14,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I think our students have something they would like to share.

1421
02:27:14,305 --> 02:27:14,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right?

1422
02:27:15,246 --> 02:27:15,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1423
02:27:16,767 --> 02:27:18,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So hold on one second.

1424
02:27:18,588 --> 02:27:19,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your mic on red?

1425
02:27:20,010 --> 02:27:20,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1426
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:20,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1427
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:26,132
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main things is that it's opening up the conversation.

1428
02:27:26,272 --> 02:27:29,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the questions that we had is, who is having this conversation?

1429
02:27:29,314 --> 02:27:31,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they go to the building principal, yes.

1430
02:27:31,796 --> 02:27:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: But is, first of all, the building principal having the conversation with the parent?

1431
02:27:37,459 --> 02:27:37,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1432
02:27:38,019 --> 02:27:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1433
02:27:38,179 --> 02:27:43,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes to the accommodations, are they the ones determining the accommodations on a building level?

1434
02:27:43,863 --> 02:27:48,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that overall, there's a list of accommodations that are acceptable?

1435
02:27:49,683 --> 02:27:50,523
[SPEAKER_19]: There's not a list.

1436
02:27:50,643 --> 02:27:57,907
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a case by case basis because it really depends on the specific needs of the family as well as what the content is.

1437
02:27:57,927 --> 02:28:00,308
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why it really needs to be a discussion.

1438
02:28:00,828 --> 02:28:19,316
[SPEAKER_19]: So the conversations are with the building principal and the caregivers, the parents, and then the building principal has conversations with the teachers to make sure that when it comes down to the student level, both the teacher and the caregiver are able to make sure that that communication is aligned.

1439
02:28:20,610 --> 02:28:20,670
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1440
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:24,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will be case by case on what the accommodations are.

1441
02:28:24,553 --> 02:28:24,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1442
02:28:26,454 --> 02:28:36,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is, this is mostly for high school level, but is the student going to be involved in this discussion at all?

1443
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:42,644
[SPEAKER_02]: If they, for some reason, disagree with their parent, is there going to be a way to determine if that is a disagreement in there?

1444
02:28:42,664 --> 02:28:44,825
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a great question.

1445
02:28:45,366 --> 02:28:46,366
[SPEAKER_19]: That is a great question.

1446
02:28:46,446 --> 02:28:48,147
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm really glad you raised it.

1447
02:28:49,210 --> 02:28:57,973
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, again, I would say that's why we need to have the conversation with the caregiver and why I did mention the impact on the student.

1448
02:28:59,193 --> 02:29:12,677
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wanna be careful that I don't answer you by necessarily saying yes always all the time, but that would be the goal for sure.

1449
02:29:14,925 --> 02:29:17,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is the student going to be made aware of the conversation?

1450
02:29:17,867 --> 02:29:19,969
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% included in the conversation.

1451
02:29:19,989 --> 02:29:20,710
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1452
02:29:26,034 --> 02:29:26,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

1453
02:29:28,056 --> 02:29:28,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

1454
02:29:28,736 --> 02:29:29,357
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1455
02:29:30,017 --> 02:29:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeldt.

1456
02:29:33,383 --> 02:29:43,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Christine's question raised another point, which is what kind of supports are available for the teachers to have these conversations in the moment?

1457
02:29:43,472 --> 02:29:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes it's something that comes up kind of unexpectedly if we've encountered it as we're reading or so facilitating the conversations in the moment in the classroom as well, I think is a really important piece here.

1458
02:30:03,723 --> 02:30:08,226
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, I would say that that's why right now it's resting with the building principal.

1459
02:30:08,966 --> 02:30:17,972
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if there is an accommodation made the principal is having conversations if it's it let's say if we're sticking with the high school level that conversation is had.

1460
02:30:19,059 --> 02:30:30,628
[SPEAKER_19]: with all the teachers that that student has on their caseload, but it may not be that there's an accommodation in every class.

1461
02:30:30,828 --> 02:30:40,235
[SPEAKER_19]: So the support to teachers is coming from the building principal, and the building principal is getting support from Dr. Talbot.

1462
02:30:40,935 --> 02:30:44,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And so there's definitely a chain, a hierarchy here, but

1463
02:30:44,938 --> 02:30:51,300
[SPEAKER_19]: we also need to make sure that that conversation flow is happening from Dr. Talbot to the principals to the educators.

1464
02:30:52,340 --> 02:31:02,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so yes, I think that's the core of it, is making sure that this is being discussed in a department meeting or a building meeting, particularly since it's new.

1465
02:31:02,942 --> 02:31:05,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know educators want support in how to

1466
02:31:06,671 --> 02:31:09,874
[SPEAKER_19]: To respond has already had some meetings with principals.

1467
02:31:10,634 --> 02:31:15,458
[SPEAKER_19]: There's lots of ongoing one on one conversations, but there's also group conversations happening.

1468
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:17,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1469
02:31:21,022 --> 02:31:21,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Brantley.

1470
02:31:21,683 --> 02:31:23,524
[SPEAKER_09]: In my head.

1471
02:31:24,677 --> 02:31:37,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is gonna get really tricky as time goes on because I think maybe a discussion with the principal in one building with a parent is gonna be different maybe than a principal in another building with a parent just based on what the parent's needs are.

1472
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:46,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, I feel this tornado happening of social media.

1473
02:31:47,922 --> 02:31:52,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is what happened here and this was our situation here and every case is gonna be case by case.

1474
02:31:53,556 --> 02:31:59,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just feel like this is going to really open up a door to a lot of stormy waters.

1475
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:07,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everybody has the right to obviously be able to make the decision for their child.

1476
02:32:07,085 --> 02:32:14,590
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think even as she said, moving forward as your older children, how do we protect a student?

1477
02:32:17,498 --> 02:32:21,380
[SPEAKER_09]: from being, you know, chastised or, you know, like, I mean, where are we drawing the line here?

1478
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:28,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, this is really opening up a broad, a broad purview that we're really can't control.

1479
02:32:28,664 --> 02:32:35,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this is like, the more I'm hearing about this, I'm like, oh gee, this is gonna be tricky.

1480
02:32:36,028 --> 02:32:36,849
[SPEAKER_09]: This is gonna be tricky.

1481
02:32:37,549 --> 02:32:44,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's as easy as just saying like, okay, you don't sit in math during this lesson and you can go for a walk.

1482
02:32:45,976 --> 02:32:52,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say for appropriate, like, I mean, like you said, sorry, not to trip you, but like, even like kindergarten, we won't let you go in the hall.

1483
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:55,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, we'll be like, what is, what is going to be the plan?

1484
02:32:55,482 --> 02:32:57,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, this is such a broad.

1485
02:32:57,203 --> 02:32:57,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1486
02:32:59,224 --> 02:33:01,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Really broad.

1487
02:33:02,827 --> 02:33:11,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, and first and foremost, I would say that like ever since COVID the adaptability that education has had to have every year of

1488
02:33:14,162 --> 02:33:35,893
[SPEAKER_19]: building as we're going here, and last year with a lot of the way national decisions were made, I just think that this has been the nature of education for the past couple of years, which is why the conversation and the nature of the request is really the priority and the critical part.

1489
02:33:36,834 --> 02:33:40,256
[SPEAKER_19]: I just can't say that enough because

1490
02:33:41,961 --> 02:33:56,528
[SPEAKER_19]: The chain, the communication chain of teachers going to principals and principals going to Dr. Talbot is what is making sure that there's not only like the level of support but the alignment, and it also depends on

1491
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:06,124
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's high school, maybe there are experiences that they've already had that are going to be part of the conversation.

1492
02:34:08,145 --> 02:34:22,612
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why there's no way to answer this other than making sure we have conversations about why the request is coming in, what the nature of the request is, what the impact will be, and then trying to figure out

1493
02:34:24,174 --> 02:34:26,515
[SPEAKER_19]: what the accommodation needs to be, if any.

1494
02:34:27,315 --> 02:34:34,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe sometimes it's just the conversation that needs to be had, and there isn't an accommodation that's necessary because you had the conversation.

1495
02:34:34,437 --> 02:34:42,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that our principals and our staff, along with Dr. Talbot, are really being supported in all of this.

1496
02:34:42,279 --> 02:34:46,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Because at the end of the day, as I always say, it's about the kids at the end of the day and supporting their families.

1497
02:34:46,801 --> 02:34:50,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really going to have to be individual and discussion-based.

1498
02:34:51,972 --> 02:34:56,993
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would say for all of you, I would just highly ask that you respect that chain of communication.

1499
02:34:57,073 --> 02:35:03,514
[SPEAKER_19]: And just, you know, if caregivers are coming to you, then you need to put them back to the principal.

1500
02:35:04,294 --> 02:35:05,894
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's where the conversation starts.

1501
02:35:15,256 --> 02:35:19,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have one more handbook change to discuss.

1502
02:35:21,312 --> 02:35:21,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Galluzzi.

1503
02:35:23,033 --> 02:35:30,436
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last one is just updating the arrival and dismissal times, which is pretty easy.

1504
02:35:30,516 --> 02:35:34,858
[SPEAKER_19]: It has been highlighted a lot in the Friday memos.

1505
02:35:35,418 --> 02:35:37,459
[SPEAKER_19]: It is reflected on our website.

1506
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:49,325
[SPEAKER_19]: It is here in this lovely chart, but each individual school has also just updated the change in either or both arrival and dismissal times across the district.

1507
02:35:51,773 --> 02:35:52,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1508
02:35:52,054 --> 02:35:55,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have somebody who has had their hand up online for quite some time.

1509
02:35:56,757 --> 02:35:59,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Will, do you think you can unmute our guest?

1510
02:36:00,601 --> 02:36:06,285
[SPEAKER_08]: While you do that, members of the public are welcome to speak for up to three minutes on a topic.

1511
02:36:06,566 --> 02:36:08,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you could please give us your name and address for the record.

1512
02:36:14,392 --> 02:36:14,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1513
02:36:16,694 --> 02:36:16,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1514
02:36:16,974 --> 02:36:17,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we can hear you.

1515
02:36:17,675 --> 02:36:18,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, hi.

1516
02:36:20,433 --> 02:36:26,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, I was calling about safety concern at the Roberts Junior High School.

1517
02:36:26,116 --> 02:36:27,717
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Constantine Lombardakis.

1518
02:36:28,477 --> 02:36:30,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 19 Joyce Road in Medford.

1519
02:36:30,338 --> 02:36:32,599
[SPEAKER_11]: My son's a student at the Roberts Elementary.

1520
02:36:34,921 --> 02:36:40,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed on Park Street there's about four or five cross crossing guards.

1521
02:36:41,084 --> 02:36:43,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's flashing lights and crosswalks.

1522
02:36:44,546 --> 02:36:48,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And everything school signs, but there's absolutely nothing on

1523
02:36:49,567 --> 02:36:54,591
[SPEAKER_11]: on Court Street at the main entrance on 35, at 35 Court Street.

1524
02:36:55,231 --> 02:36:58,153
[SPEAKER_11]: No signs, no speed limit signs, no nothing.

1525
02:36:58,293 --> 02:37:04,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the entrance that they use for the special needs students that enter the building.

1526
02:37:04,698 --> 02:37:18,168
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to see some sort of control there, whether it be a crosswalk on Court Street and some signs that say school and a speed limit sign,

1527
02:37:19,082 --> 02:37:30,126
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe some flashing lights, some cones, but crossing guards would be good to have in front of the building, because that's where the special needs students go in.

1528
02:37:30,246 --> 02:37:42,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've noticed that cars go speeding on that street, and also I've noticed kids slipping out of parents' hands when they're being brought into school.

1529
02:37:43,792 --> 02:37:48,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And I talked to the sergeant in charge of traffic,

1530
02:37:49,672 --> 02:37:56,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I also reached out to the special ed department, and I also called the mayor's office last Friday.

1531
02:37:56,618 --> 02:38:01,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that's something you would be able to do there, but it would be appreciated.

1532
02:38:01,462 --> 02:38:07,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just concerned because my son enters the building there, and it's unsafe for the students.

1533
02:38:08,147 --> 02:38:12,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that be something that the school committee could do as far as getting

1534
02:38:15,799 --> 02:38:19,622
[SPEAKER_11]: some crossing guards and some kind of controls on that street.

1535
02:38:19,642 --> 02:38:23,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1536
02:38:24,587 --> 02:38:25,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, thank you for the question.

1537
02:38:27,209 --> 02:38:32,353
[SPEAKER_08]: In general, a lot of those safety improvements that you're talking about would come from city resources.

1538
02:38:32,473 --> 02:38:48,346
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we can do and I'm going to do is ask the superintendent to be in contact with the chief of police so that if there are short term measures like a crossing guard, that we can have that conversation because that would have

1539
02:38:48,931 --> 02:38:51,993
[SPEAKER_08]: that would happen under the guidance of the police chief.

1540
02:38:52,833 --> 02:39:06,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can ask the superintendent to do that, and then also talk with the building leader and some of our municipal staff about the broader safety questions that you're raising.

1541
02:39:06,181 --> 02:39:08,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for bringing those to our attention.

1542
02:39:08,422 --> 02:39:15,586
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, because I watched a garbage truck speed by there last week, and it was unnerving.

1543
02:39:17,665 --> 02:39:22,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to bring my son to the front door and it's just not good.

1544
02:39:24,247 --> 02:39:26,288
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very dangerous over there.

1545
02:39:27,728 --> 02:39:28,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Something's going to happen.

1546
02:39:28,689 --> 02:39:29,829
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be good.

1547
02:39:32,190 --> 02:39:41,053
[SPEAKER_11]: God forbid if anything happens, it would be good to put something there just to keep the kids safe.

1548
02:39:44,837 --> 02:39:46,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Superintendent, did you have something you wanted to add?

1549
02:39:46,998 --> 02:39:51,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. DeSimone, is it at both arrival and dismissal that you have concerns or just one?

1550
02:39:53,881 --> 02:40:01,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, my son takes the bus home, but I bring him there in the morning and people are off and going to work.

1551
02:40:02,324 --> 02:40:05,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So they use that street to bypass Park Street.

1552
02:40:05,566 --> 02:40:07,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So they speed up there to get over towards

1553
02:40:10,830 --> 02:40:16,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Forest Street and Lawrence Road just to cut through the traffic in Method Square.

1554
02:40:16,615 --> 02:40:27,804
[SPEAKER_11]: So that street becomes a note for people that are trying to avoid the Method Square traffic and head towards Lawrence Road and towards that direction.

1555
02:40:27,864 --> 02:40:38,232
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see a lot of cars speeding down that street trying to get out of the school traffic on the Elm Street.

1556
02:40:39,645 --> 02:40:40,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, that's very helpful.

1557
02:40:42,145 --> 02:40:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you and thank you for your patience.

1558
02:40:45,086 --> 02:40:52,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We've waylaid the agenda here, so appreciate you hanging in with us and the superintendent will reach out.

1559
02:40:52,367 --> 02:40:54,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

1560
02:40:54,348 --> 02:41:02,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair too, I know that Todd Blake, our traffic director and Sergeant Rogers have been in discussions in the last few days and are looking at this.

1561
02:41:03,029 --> 02:41:05,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke with the sergeant last week.

1562
02:41:07,634 --> 02:41:10,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was just updating the committee as well.

1563
02:41:11,177 --> 02:41:11,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1564
02:41:12,037 --> 02:41:13,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, let me interrupt.

1565
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:15,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, they're in discussions.

1566
02:41:15,620 --> 02:41:19,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the area is too, I have got an update today.

1567
02:41:19,784 --> 02:41:27,870
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no room for a crosswalk, but they're looking into the area and potential plans with you on drop off for your child.

1568
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:29,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll definitely stay on top of this.

1569
02:41:31,213 --> 02:41:32,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.

1570
02:41:32,073 --> 02:41:32,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1571
02:41:32,794 --> 02:41:33,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for listening.

1572
02:41:33,935 --> 02:41:35,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, school committee, I appreciate that.

1573
02:41:37,371 --> 02:41:38,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your patience.

1574
02:41:39,433 --> 02:41:39,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

1575
02:41:40,854 --> 02:41:41,434
[SPEAKER_11]: You too, thank you.

1576
02:41:45,097 --> 02:41:46,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the approval of the handbooks?

1577
02:41:49,021 --> 02:41:49,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ntapa.

1578
02:41:52,123 --> 02:42:03,933
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make a motion to sever the AI policy from the handbook as we are currently discussing a lot of the AI possibilities in another policy and I'm afraid that they will

1579
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:09,332
[SPEAKER_14]: clash with one another in terms of development we have with the second reading of the policy.

1580
02:42:11,373 --> 02:42:16,636
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is to sever the AI policy from the handbook approval.

1581
02:42:16,796 --> 02:42:20,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Is your motion also to otherwise move approval?

1582
02:42:21,738 --> 02:42:25,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, move for approval, but sever the AI policy.

1583
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1584
02:42:26,741 --> 02:42:33,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Member Ntapa to move approval of the handbooks with the exception of the AI policy, which will be on hold for now.

1585
02:42:36,915 --> 02:42:38,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Member Brantley.

1586
02:42:41,437 --> 02:42:42,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau?

1587
02:42:42,798 --> 02:42:46,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so the handbooks will not get published then, correct?

1588
02:42:50,301 --> 02:42:56,324
[SPEAKER_19]: So the handbooks are available on school websites and Medford Public Schools website.

1589
02:42:56,825 --> 02:43:02,888
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say the distinction right now is that the MPS AI guidance tool

1590
02:43:04,063 --> 02:43:12,248
[SPEAKER_19]: is listed in the handbooks, not as a policy, but as the guidance for caregivers and students to reference.

1591
02:43:14,169 --> 02:43:16,010
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe that is the distinction right now.

1592
02:43:17,731 --> 02:43:18,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1593
02:43:18,392 --> 02:43:26,677
[SPEAKER_15]: And that just as soon as you said that, I remembered that, you know, until a school committee actually has a policy, you have full policy authority.

1594
02:43:27,984 --> 02:43:33,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the absence of us adopting an AI policy means you set AI policy.

1595
02:43:33,648 --> 02:43:42,653
[SPEAKER_15]: You literally can say, this is our policy until we adopt a policy or, well, that's just the way it works.

1596
02:43:42,954 --> 02:43:43,214
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

1597
02:43:47,456 --> 02:43:52,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just maybe just say that that document as created by the committee was guidance.

1598
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,601
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's what's in the handbook right now.

1599
02:43:55,461 --> 02:43:56,582
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that it's,

1600
02:43:57,227 --> 02:44:03,631
[SPEAKER_19]: important to make sure that caregivers and students are aware of what the guidance is.

1601
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:08,374
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we proceed with the reading of the policy.

1602
02:44:15,219 --> 02:44:20,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So the motion on the floor is to approve the handbooks

1603
02:44:22,496 --> 02:44:26,638
[SPEAKER_08]: with the exception of the AI component of the handbook.

1604
02:44:26,998 --> 02:44:27,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

1605
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:31,660
[SPEAKER_08]: By member Ntapa, seconded by member Branley.

1606
02:44:35,161 --> 02:44:35,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you call the roll?

1607
02:44:38,703 --> 02:44:39,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Branley?

1608
02:44:39,223 --> 02:44:39,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1609
02:44:40,404 --> 02:44:40,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham?

1610
02:44:41,324 --> 02:44:41,524
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1611
02:44:42,264 --> 02:44:42,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ntapa?

1612
02:44:43,085 --> 02:44:43,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1613
02:44:44,025 --> 02:44:44,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Olapode?

1614
02:44:44,926 --> 02:44:45,146
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1615
02:44:45,846 --> 02:44:46,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Rheinfeld?

1616
02:44:47,327 --> 02:44:47,547
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1617
02:44:48,307 --> 02:44:49,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Rousseau?

1618
02:44:49,107 --> 02:44:49,368
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1619
02:44:49,608 --> 02:44:50,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Longo Kern?

1620
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1621
02:44:55,461 --> 02:45:07,285
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do wish the AI would figure out how to interpret member Mayor Lungo Kern, because what it says is just a horrible, it gets all this wrong.

1622
02:45:10,747 --> 02:45:16,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So three in the affirmative, four in the negative, motion does not pass.

1623
02:45:17,029 --> 02:45:18,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there another motion on the floor?

1624
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:21,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve the handbooks.

1625
02:45:21,838 --> 02:45:24,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve the handbooks by member Rousseau.

1626
02:45:24,859 --> 02:45:25,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

1627
02:45:26,239 --> 02:45:26,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1628
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by member LaPotte.

1629
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:30,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

1630
02:45:39,043 --> 02:45:39,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Brandley?

1631
02:45:39,883 --> 02:45:40,043
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1632
02:45:41,244 --> 02:45:41,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham?

1633
02:45:41,984 --> 02:45:42,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1634
02:45:43,444 --> 02:45:44,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ntapa?

1635
02:45:44,345 --> 02:45:44,505
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1636
02:45:45,405 --> 02:45:46,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Member LaPotte?

1637
02:45:46,885 --> 02:45:47,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1638
02:45:47,726 --> 02:45:48,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Rheinfeld?

1639
02:45:49,203 --> 02:45:49,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1640
02:45:50,185 --> 02:45:51,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Russo, yes.

1641
02:45:51,488 --> 02:45:52,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Longo, current.

1642
02:45:52,771 --> 02:45:53,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1643
02:45:54,114 --> 02:45:56,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

1644
02:45:56,118 --> 02:45:57,320
[SPEAKER_08]: The handbooks are approved.

1645
02:45:57,561 --> 02:45:58,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Five in the affirmative.

1646
02:45:58,283 --> 02:45:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: No, five, two.

1647
02:46:00,191 --> 02:46:01,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Five, two, sorry, sorry.

1648
02:46:01,512 --> 02:46:03,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1649
02:46:03,955 --> 02:46:05,196
[SPEAKER_08]: The handbooks are approved.

1650
02:46:06,056 --> 02:46:11,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I will also just add that I think part of what just happened is we approved handbooks.

1651
02:46:11,341 --> 02:46:13,463
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never done that before on the floor.

1652
02:46:14,243 --> 02:46:17,826
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is a job that we should be doing every year.

1653
02:46:18,026 --> 02:46:23,871
[SPEAKER_08]: And it previously amidst many, many requests to do so has never come forward to us.

1654
02:46:24,432 --> 02:46:25,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're,

1655
02:46:26,033 --> 02:46:32,341
[SPEAKER_08]: a little out of order which is hence the urgency of some of the work to get these handbooks approved because school is in session.

1656
02:46:32,501 --> 02:46:37,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally we would be doing this long before school starts and I hope that we will chart a better path next year.

1657
02:46:39,710 --> 02:46:41,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau, please be brief.

1658
02:46:41,632 --> 02:46:42,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be brief.

1659
02:46:42,713 --> 02:46:45,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to remind the superintendent not to

1660
02:46:46,088 --> 02:46:50,809
[SPEAKER_15]: need to necessarily that we did adopt a handbook review and approval schedule last year.

1661
02:46:51,529 --> 02:46:55,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this hopefully can be the beginning of us following that process.

1662
02:46:55,470 --> 02:47:06,973
[SPEAKER_15]: So these approved policies should be, somebody should create a copy and we should go through the process we approved so that we do have them approved in plenty of time.

1663
02:47:07,334 --> 02:47:11,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also like to make a motion to take 2025-30 out of order.

1664
02:47:13,628 --> 02:47:25,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to take 2025 dash 30 out of order by member Rousseau, seconded by our professionals, seconded by member Reinfeldt roll call, please.

1665
02:47:26,659 --> 02:47:27,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Bramley.

1666
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:28,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember Graham.

1667
02:47:28,981 --> 02:47:29,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm running top.

1668
02:47:29,901 --> 02:47:31,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember all about it.

1669
02:47:31,283 --> 02:47:31,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1670
02:47:31,803 --> 02:47:34,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember I felt member so yes Marilyn go current.

1671
02:47:35,106 --> 02:47:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1672
02:47:36,859 --> 02:47:38,539
[SPEAKER_08]: seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1673
02:47:38,919 --> 02:47:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: We will take item 2025-30 out of order.

1674
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:56,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Offered by me, whereas the school committee recently reached a four-year agreement with the Medford Paraprofessionals Union that introduced a schedule that provides additional hours to the district beyond the school day for select paras at the elementary and high school levels.

1675
02:47:57,244 --> 02:47:59,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas MPS signed a new bus contract in the spring.

1676
02:48:00,665 --> 02:48:06,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas bus supervision is an ongoing area of need across the district at various points during the year.

1677
02:48:07,166 --> 02:48:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, be it resolved that the superintendent will provide a report at the next meeting to discuss plans to ensure the safety of students on our buses and respond to areas of need at the next regularly scheduled meeting.

1678
02:48:20,489 --> 02:48:33,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was a motion that I put forward because one of the central things that we have been asked about as we have talked about the override funds in particular is enhanced supervision on our buses.

1679
02:48:33,712 --> 02:48:36,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there are some parents in the audience who would like to speak.

1680
02:48:37,373 --> 02:48:44,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you would not mind stepping forward to the podium, we would love to hear from you.

1681
02:48:44,896 --> 02:48:46,416
[SPEAKER_08]: And we apologize for the delay.

1682
02:48:48,477 --> 02:48:50,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Your name and address for the record.

1683
02:48:50,498 --> 02:48:53,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just need to wait for a red light to come on on your thing there.

1684
02:48:54,979 --> 02:48:55,279
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1685
02:48:55,599 --> 02:48:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Patricia Cherry, 20 Wellesley Street, Medford.

1686
02:48:58,628 --> 02:49:01,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just kind of wanted to get an update.

1687
02:49:01,570 --> 02:49:03,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, Jenny, thank you so much for reaching out to us.

1688
02:49:05,053 --> 02:49:07,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do appreciate that.

1689
02:49:07,355 --> 02:49:10,158
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to get an update on what this was going to look like.

1690
02:49:11,475 --> 02:49:13,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we came to you with some asks last year.

1691
02:49:14,977 --> 02:49:16,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Best buddies programs going great.

1692
02:49:16,618 --> 02:49:17,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1693
02:49:18,979 --> 02:49:28,004
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I've had some feedback about the buses and the Paris and the safety on the buses already and we're only two weeks into school.

1694
02:49:29,205 --> 02:49:34,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could just kind of give us what you're thinking or what

1695
02:49:36,310 --> 02:49:42,495
[SPEAKER_03]: what you have plans to go forward with, what this is gonna look like.

1696
02:49:45,858 --> 02:49:47,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely, thank you very much.

1697
02:49:48,160 --> 02:49:55,846
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now what we're doing is having some internal conversations based on what this resolution said by member Graham.

1698
02:49:56,707 --> 02:49:59,549
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had lots of conversations internally around need.

1699
02:50:01,363 --> 02:50:06,348
[SPEAKER_19]: and making sure where the coverage, where we have to schedule the coverage.

1700
02:50:08,130 --> 02:50:10,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, Ms.

1701
02:50:10,312 --> 02:50:23,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Bowen has been, Director Bowen has been working with school leaders on the schedule as reflected in this resolution based on the new CBA for the paraprofessionals where

1702
02:50:24,325 --> 02:50:38,832
[SPEAKER_19]: looking at the individual schedules at each school so that we can create assignments for bus monitors, especially starting with the prioritized areas first.

1703
02:50:39,132 --> 02:50:51,398
[SPEAKER_19]: We also did look into what it would mean for the company, the bus company that we have the contract with, to be able to supply that, which is

1704
02:50:52,537 --> 02:50:54,758
[SPEAKER_19]: an astronomical cost.

1705
02:50:55,459 --> 02:51:12,329
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is where we've between the flexibility that we have with some of the schedules of our staff members, as well as maybe the potential need for stipend depositions, we are now creating the schedules at each school.

1706
02:51:14,190 --> 02:51:23,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure because I don't want this to be, we've kind of noticed that we're seeing more door-to-door this year.

1707
02:51:25,214 --> 02:51:25,974
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you mean by that?

1708
02:51:27,294 --> 02:51:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: More offers for kids to take alternative vans.

1709
02:51:30,895 --> 02:51:30,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1710
02:51:31,215 --> 02:51:31,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1711
02:51:33,861 --> 02:51:51,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just hoping that that's not the answer, taking our kids off the other buses and putting them on vans that some kids are now in the city of Medford on for an hour and some change on the way just to get home.

1712
02:51:53,030 --> 02:51:55,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I'm a little bit concerned that we are.

1713
02:51:57,956 --> 02:52:03,398
[SPEAKER_19]: That has not been part of the conversation, just to put that right out there and to clarify.

1714
02:52:03,458 --> 02:52:14,002
[SPEAKER_19]: No, right now it's just once the CBA passed, it's looking at what the schedules are at each school so that we can create the coverage that's needed at each school.

1715
02:52:16,063 --> 02:52:18,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1716
02:52:18,744 --> 02:52:21,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have other things you would like to

1717
02:52:23,122 --> 02:52:32,345
[SPEAKER_08]: infuse into the conversation so that when the report comes back at our next meeting, it can anticipate some of the other questions that you have about this coverage.

1718
02:52:32,425 --> 02:52:35,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was what I was- Regarding the paras and the buses.

1719
02:52:37,827 --> 02:52:50,712
[SPEAKER_03]: The buses, that was my biggest concern, is that kids are getting on buses at 2.30 in the afternoon, say from the high school, and then they're on the bus going to a middle school to pick up other kids.

1720
02:52:51,986 --> 02:53:00,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're, you know, and all because we now have larger amounts of kids on the vans.

1721
02:53:02,538 --> 02:53:09,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So kids that were taking, you know, the buses, but the other buses back and forth to school.

1722
02:53:13,288 --> 02:53:22,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just concerned that I want to make sure that we're not taking those kids off rather than getting them a safety person on the bus.

1723
02:53:22,757 --> 02:53:31,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not taking them off that bus that they're in inclusion with other kids and putting them on an already overcrowded van to solve the problem.

1724
02:53:32,162 --> 02:53:33,123
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very helpful context.

1725
02:53:33,163 --> 02:53:33,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1726
02:53:33,743 --> 02:53:34,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1727
02:53:34,964 --> 02:53:37,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's for the buses.

1728
02:53:37,286 --> 02:53:43,970
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the power is, we're still moving forward with them doing the professional development days with you guys.

1729
02:53:44,531 --> 02:53:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I really have on that.

1730
02:53:47,473 --> 02:53:47,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1731
02:53:47,893 --> 02:53:48,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1732
02:53:49,734 --> 02:53:53,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to approve or questions from the committee?

1733
02:53:56,148 --> 02:54:04,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by member, member, sorry, member Ntapa.

1734
02:54:04,896 --> 02:54:06,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw him first, I heard you first.

1735
02:54:07,638 --> 02:54:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain can't do them both right now.

1736
02:54:11,722 --> 02:54:12,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1737
02:54:14,644 --> 02:54:15,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

1738
02:54:18,710 --> 02:54:22,171
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing, though, and we can save it for another meeting, because I know it's late.

1739
02:54:22,331 --> 02:54:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: The school inclusion specialist, is that job still on the books?

1740
02:54:27,272 --> 02:54:32,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was there, and then we looked, and we haven't seen it yet for this school year.

1741
02:54:32,693 --> 02:54:35,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Has the position been filled?

1742
02:54:38,174 --> 02:54:39,474
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get back to you.

1743
02:54:39,514 --> 02:54:39,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1744
02:54:41,274 --> 02:54:41,514
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1745
02:54:41,554 --> 02:54:44,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be great if somebody could get back to us, because I think we have some other

1746
02:54:45,730 --> 02:54:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: issues that really would be helpful with.

1747
02:54:49,331 --> 02:54:49,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1748
02:54:49,951 --> 02:54:50,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

1749
02:54:50,252 --> 02:54:50,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1750
02:54:50,792 --> 02:54:52,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for your patience.

1751
02:54:55,053 --> 02:54:56,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo, roll call, please.

1752
02:55:00,495 --> 02:55:01,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Just sick of hearing my voice yet?

1753
02:55:02,035 --> 02:55:02,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1754
02:55:03,856 --> 02:55:04,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't answer that.

1755
02:55:04,536 --> 02:55:05,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Branley.

1756
02:55:05,436 --> 02:55:05,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1757
02:55:06,237 --> 02:55:06,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham.

1758
02:55:09,053 --> 02:55:09,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1759
02:55:09,454 --> 02:55:09,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1760
02:55:10,776 --> 02:55:12,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, as I hope you approve it.

1761
02:55:12,599 --> 02:55:12,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1762
02:55:12,819 --> 02:55:13,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Member.

1763
02:55:13,660 --> 02:55:14,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1764
02:55:14,542 --> 02:55:14,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Member.

1765
02:55:15,583 --> 02:55:15,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1766
02:55:16,164 --> 02:55:17,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Member.

1767
02:55:18,188 --> 02:55:19,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1768
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:20,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1769
02:55:21,873 --> 02:55:24,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven any affirmative zero negative motion passes.

1770
02:55:26,415 --> 02:55:28,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we still have a ways to go here, folks.

1771
02:55:28,837 --> 02:55:41,143
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to take number seven, which is new business, we have an MSBA update, I'm going to try to give you a lightning update, so that we don't have to

1772
02:55:43,782 --> 02:55:44,683
[SPEAKER_08]: here for too long.

1773
02:55:46,164 --> 02:56:05,041
[SPEAKER_08]: On Thursday of this week and then again on the 7th of October, Dr. Galluzzi, the mayor and I will be attending the designer selection panel with 10 colleagues from the MSBA and out of those two meetings will come a decision about who our designer will be and we will execute the contract in the month of October.

1774
02:56:05,822 --> 02:56:11,024
[SPEAKER_08]: With that designer on board, they will do two things that are sort of broadly called the feasibility study.

1775
02:56:11,764 --> 02:56:19,827
[SPEAKER_08]: One is they will prepare for a January submission where we talk about, essentially, what is our goal and what are we trying to do?

1776
02:56:19,948 --> 02:56:22,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So it includes things like, what is the educational program?

1777
02:56:22,949 --> 02:56:24,049
[SPEAKER_08]: What is our space summary?

1778
02:56:24,129 --> 02:56:26,270
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the existing conditions of the building?

1779
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:30,352
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we trying to accomplish with this bill?

1780
02:56:30,532 --> 02:56:31,932
[SPEAKER_08]: That is January 2026.

1781
02:56:34,173 --> 02:56:38,219
[SPEAKER_08]: In June of 2026, we will do the second half of the feasibility study.

1782
02:56:40,652 --> 02:56:48,879
[SPEAKER_08]: which will answer the question of what would a repair look like that is required by the MSBA?

1783
02:56:49,439 --> 02:56:51,321
[SPEAKER_08]: What would an ad reno look like?

1784
02:56:51,481 --> 02:56:53,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And what would a new building look like?

1785
02:56:53,283 --> 02:56:56,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Those three choices are required by the MSBA.

1786
02:56:56,726 --> 02:57:05,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And those answers will be part of the report that we are targeting to the MSBA in June of 2026.

1787
02:57:08,854 --> 02:57:23,985
[SPEAKER_08]: From there, we will then go into the sort of heavier design where we will be picking the actual systems that go into the building based on the preferred design, either repair, ad reno, or new.

1788
02:57:25,145 --> 02:57:36,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Based on that, we'll start what they call schematic design, which is where we will look at the actual systems and the details and all of the nitty gritty that bring that box to life in a school building.

1789
02:57:38,014 --> 02:57:47,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We will, that's where we will onboard the construction manager more than likely, who will work alongside us as we do schematic design.

1790
02:57:47,416 --> 02:57:57,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And that process for schematic design will provide a scope and budget submission to the MSBA as well as ultimately a budget agreement.

1791
02:57:59,759 --> 02:58:17,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Our plan for schematic design submission is January 2027 with board approval in April of 2027 and a vote to authorize the project to move forward presumably by debt exclusion in May of 2027.

1792
02:58:19,332 --> 02:58:35,123
[SPEAKER_08]: That may spring vote will require approval by the building committee, it will come here, it will require a two thirds vote at the council and the agreement of the mayor to put those things on the ballot for decision by the taxpayers.

1793
02:58:36,523 --> 02:58:46,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And then shovels can go in the ground once the project is greenlighted by the taxpayers and the funding sources are secured in collaboration with MSBA and the public.

1794
02:58:47,829 --> 02:58:52,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So between now and June of 2027, there is a lot to do.

1795
02:58:52,370 --> 02:58:57,431
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to give you that update because the most exciting part is we get to start the feasibility study very soon.

1796
02:58:58,031 --> 02:58:59,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the question people are asking.

1797
02:59:00,132 --> 02:59:00,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to build new?

1798
02:59:01,072 --> 02:59:02,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it going to go?

1799
02:59:02,192 --> 02:59:03,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to keep the pool?

1800
02:59:04,193 --> 02:59:06,773
[SPEAKER_08]: All of those questions get answered in feasibility.

1801
02:59:06,793 --> 02:59:09,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So between now and June of next year, we will have those answers.

1802
02:59:09,854 --> 02:59:12,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we will begin moving forward based on a particular design.

1803
02:59:14,435 --> 02:59:14,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions?

1804
02:59:17,529 --> 02:59:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeld.

1805
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You answered my question about what is required of city council may or school committee, particularly with the mind to there's an election going on and who we elect is going to affect this project.

1806
02:59:28,824 --> 02:59:31,628
[SPEAKER_04]: My other question is when are the community conversations happening.

1807
02:59:32,462 --> 02:59:47,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Once the designer is onboarded, they will lay out a schedule for all of that community input, which will be sort of many layers and phases, including time with educators, time with RCTE, time with the public, info sessions, all of those things.

1808
02:59:47,055 --> 02:59:51,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of that will start once that team is onboarded.

1809
02:59:51,179 --> 02:59:56,524
[SPEAKER_08]: We have four proposals, all very qualified designers.

1810
02:59:57,124 --> 02:59:57,824
[SPEAKER_08]: to work with us.

1811
02:59:59,105 --> 03:00:02,467
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will know who that is at the beginning of October, and then we'll execute an agreement.

1812
03:00:02,967 --> 03:00:15,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it will really be a question of timing in terms of do we start those kinds of engagement conversations before Thanksgiving, between Thanksgiving and the winter break, or something else.

1813
03:00:15,913 --> 03:00:21,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a conversation that the building committee will have with the designer and the OPM so that

1814
03:00:21,576 --> 03:00:23,497
[SPEAKER_08]: we can keep on this tight timeline.

1815
03:00:23,997 --> 03:00:27,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We are advancing some of the work due in January already, so that work is ongoing.

1816
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:41,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But the OPM feels good that our timeline can be met and will be met by whoever is selected at the designer selection panel on the 7th of October.

1817
03:00:42,171 --> 03:00:43,532
[SPEAKER_08]: this year of this year.

1818
03:00:43,552 --> 03:00:44,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1819
03:00:44,973 --> 03:00:47,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there's so the first meeting is this week.

1820
03:00:48,236 --> 03:00:56,062
[SPEAKER_08]: It is sort of a roundtable like review of all of the proposals and then specific vendors will be invited back on the seventh.

1821
03:00:56,723 --> 03:01:04,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that meeting, they'll be invited to answer some specific questions and provide a presentation and then the panel of 16 will vote.

1822
03:01:04,992 --> 03:01:05,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1823
03:01:06,073 --> 03:01:14,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to motion that this committee hear from the final designer about their thoughts or via the building committee.

1824
03:01:14,417 --> 03:01:25,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was going to put a date on that, but now I'm not, I think perhaps before the feasibility study would make sense sometime between October 7th and the feasibility study.

1825
03:01:25,983 --> 03:01:29,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And I defer to the building committee members to say what that,

1826
03:01:30,125 --> 03:01:38,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a should be so the motion is to hear from the chosen designer at a school committee meeting upcoming as they commence their work, yes.

1827
03:01:40,134 --> 03:01:42,976

1851
03:02:53,416 --> 03:03:00,998

1852
03:03:01,058 --> 03:03:07,680

1876
03:04:32,635 --> 03:04:48,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas the district's recently developed instructional vision and capital plan do not include information about the ongoing operational activities of the district or measures of accountability and whereas the district had to engage in components of strategic planning for advancement of the feasibility study including

1877
03:04:49,152 --> 03:05:12,281

[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas the feasibility study is in progress and will include significant community input,

1879

[SPEAKER_08]: and the creation of an educational plan for pre-K and grades nine through 12 programming.

[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas members of the MPS community have the right and responsibility to provide input into the direction and leadership of the needs of the district for all grades.

1881

[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas the school committee desires to make a data informed approach to appointing a superintendent on July 1st, 2026.

1883
03:05:50,923 --> 03:05:58,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that this process will include significant stakeholder input to inform the plans content and the hiring and evaluation of the permanent superintendent in Medford.

1884
03:05:59,533 --> 03:06:15,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Such input could include community surveys, a public hearing or special meeting of the Medford School Committee, focus groups with district leadership, union members, and students, and or open comment period to be discussed as part of the subcommittee meeting described herein.

1885
03:06:15,820 --> 03:06:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: This meeting shall occur no later than is needed to present proposed planning process at the regular school committee meeting on October 20th, 2025.

1886
03:06:22,683 --> 03:06:23,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeldt.

1887
03:06:34,072 --> 03:06:35,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we, um.

1888
03:06:37,053 --> 03:06:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that our district needs a strategic plan.

1889
03:06:39,113 --> 03:06:51,937
[SPEAKER_04]: This resolution is written the way it is to frame kind of why we are where we are in the strategic planning process and to lay out that plan, recognizing that there is currently an interim leader, an interim person in the

1890
03:06:52,938 --> 03:07:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent position is currently interim and so the strategic planning subcommittee by definition defines a lot of the strategic planning and so the idea here is that the

1891
03:07:05,043 --> 03:07:19,653
[SPEAKER_04]: My vision here is that the strategic planning committee, that the school committee will be leading the vision setting, and then a superintendent, once appointed, will do the how we get there component of the planning.

1892
03:07:20,153 --> 03:07:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the thought here.

1893
03:07:21,174 --> 03:07:24,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But what does that process look like, given all of the community meetings that

1894
03:07:25,096 --> 03:07:32,378
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to be having anyway all of the content that has already been developed that is in service of a strategic plan.

1895
03:07:33,318 --> 03:07:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this resolution is here because it's time to start the process and we have completed a lot of these other components that will feed into it and I think it's time to synthesize it.

1896
03:07:45,521 --> 03:07:52,063
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's my recap very quickly knowing that it's late but happy to questions, comments, etc.

1897
03:07:52,563 --> 03:07:53,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau?

[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we've got one more folks.

1917
03:08:32,574 --> 03:08:40,757
[SPEAKER_08]: 2025-31 offered by me, whereas an interim superintendent was appointed on December 11th, 2024 to serve in the leadership role from January 17th, 2025 through June 30th, 2026.

1918
03:08:48,447 --> 03:08:53,310
[SPEAKER_08]: yes, sorry, with immediate needs to stabilize the district in transition.

1919
03:08:53,930 --> 03:09:01,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas the MCHSBC eligibility period union negotiations and the expansion of the school day at all levels became an immediate priority.

1920
03:09:02,176 --> 03:09:06,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And whereas the school committee is required to evaluate the superintendent- Motion to waive the reading.

1921
03:09:07,539 --> 03:09:10,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to waive the reading by member- So long.

1922
03:09:11,121 --> 03:09:11,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

1923
03:09:14,443 --> 03:09:16,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by member Ntapa.

1924
03:09:16,284 --> 03:09:16,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

1925
03:09:28,850 --> 03:09:30,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1926
03:09:30,610 --> 03:09:31,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1927
03:09:31,450 --> 03:09:31,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1928
03:09:40,355 --> 03:09:44,236
[SPEAKER_08]: seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion to waive the reading passes.

1929
03:09:44,496 --> 03:09:47,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will just give a quick introduction to what's here.

1930
03:09:48,738 --> 03:09:54,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau and I are the only ones who have ever gone through a superintendent evaluation process.

1931
03:09:54,539 --> 03:09:57,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So the goal of this was to do two things.

1932
03:09:58,041 --> 03:10:02,462
[SPEAKER_08]: One is to give us a timeline for doing that because we are somewhat off cycle.

1933
03:10:02,862 --> 03:10:05,483
[SPEAKER_08]: These things typically happen in May or June for the school year.

1934
03:10:06,584 --> 03:10:22,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But we want to make sure that we are evaluating the superintendent at the one year mark as important input to our coming decisions about the superintendent, the permanent appointment of a superintendent on July one, that Jesse does also require

1935
03:10:23,541 --> 03:10:27,484
[SPEAKER_08]: that you set goals and then you measure progress against those goals.

1936
03:10:28,184 --> 03:10:36,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of where we are in the process, this asks that we will use DESE's goals for evaluating new superintendents.

1937
03:10:37,791 --> 03:10:46,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also identifies the focus indicators on which I am proposing that we evaluate the superintendents.

1938
03:10:46,236 --> 03:10:46,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are many

1939
03:10:48,177 --> 03:10:55,022
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many focused indicators on the evaluation and school committees are instructed to pick one or two per category.

1940
03:10:55,662 --> 03:11:02,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So the resolution lists the recommendation that I made around the one or two from each category.

1941
03:11:02,867 --> 03:11:13,715
[SPEAKER_08]: There are four standards, but it also, for your reference, lists all the rest of the focus indicators that are possibly ones that we would use.

1942
03:11:14,635 --> 03:11:27,899
[SPEAKER_08]: and it does ask that the superintendent provide herself evaluation by the end of the calendar year this year, and that the superintendent's evaluation committee lead the process so that we are having this conversation by the end of January.

1943
03:11:28,720 --> 03:11:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: In a nutshell.

1944
03:11:31,240 --> 03:11:32,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to take any questions.

1945
03:11:34,141 --> 03:11:34,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Russo.

1946
03:11:35,222 --> 03:11:36,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1947
03:11:37,923 --> 03:11:41,464
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the questions I have is for the focus indicators,

1948
03:11:43,654 --> 03:11:50,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the superintendent find that the list, those selected by member Graham in this resolution are acceptable?

1949
03:11:53,579 --> 03:11:54,420
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think about those?

1950
03:11:56,841 --> 03:11:57,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Melissi.

1951
03:11:58,222 --> 03:11:58,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1952
03:11:58,822 --> 03:12:00,543
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if I was expecting that question.

1953
03:12:01,744 --> 03:12:04,786
[SPEAKER_19]: I did review, of course, when the agenda was posted.

1954
03:12:05,346 --> 03:12:12,550
[SPEAKER_19]: It's work that's ongoing and that I am engaged in doing, and I find them completely appropriate.

1955
03:12:13,546 --> 03:12:13,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1956
03:12:13,907 --> 03:12:20,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought they were appropriate as well, but I figured I should ask you in case you had thoughts on changing any of them.

1957
03:12:21,678 --> 03:12:22,440
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I do not.

1958
03:12:22,480 --> 03:12:22,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1959
03:12:27,587 --> 03:12:28,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Olopade?

1960
03:12:29,335 --> 03:12:29,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1961
03:12:30,575 --> 03:12:40,619
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a question, I think, for both the chair and I think member Russo, just as a clarifying question, as you both have had prior experience, I know that you mentioned that DESE has their own valuating criteria.

1962
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:47,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we allowed to incorporate our own criteria or things that we believe as Medford specific district would benefit from having?

1963
03:12:48,362 --> 03:12:54,525
[SPEAKER_13]: That may also just be what you listed out as the prior experience, but I wanted to know, is that also been incorporated into this?

1964
03:12:56,063 --> 03:12:56,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I can answer that.

1965
03:12:56,924 --> 03:13:05,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a typical cycle, the entire process starts with a goal setting where the superintendent says, this is what I think my goal should be.

1966
03:13:05,707 --> 03:13:06,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And we say, yes, we agree.

1967
03:13:06,888 --> 03:13:08,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the Medford specific piece.

1968
03:13:08,929 --> 03:13:13,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at that time, we also say, and these indicators are the things that will

1969
03:13:13,971 --> 03:13:15,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, tell us that these goals are being met.

1970
03:13:15,992 --> 03:13:18,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what you would do in a typical process.

1971
03:13:18,734 --> 03:13:20,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we did not do that.

1972
03:13:20,836 --> 03:13:33,864
[SPEAKER_08]: My proposal here is that we use the Jesse's rubric essentially for new superintendents in terms of what they should be doing in their first year, so that we're not deciding in October to on goals.

1973
03:13:34,304 --> 03:13:36,947
[SPEAKER_08]: and then we're going to evaluate them basically in December.

1974
03:13:37,067 --> 03:13:46,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So the idea behind that shift was because we did not do the formal goal setting when she started for all the reasons that the resolution lays out.

1975
03:13:47,278 --> 03:13:52,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is like a one-time kind of difference in the process.

1976
03:13:52,944 --> 03:13:53,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1977
03:13:55,407 --> 03:13:56,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeldt.

1978
03:13:57,047 --> 03:14:08,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm hoping you can clarify, maybe for people watching and people new to the process, what is the role of community input into this evaluation process?

1979
03:14:09,272 --> 03:14:09,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1980
03:14:10,793 --> 03:14:15,294
[SPEAKER_08]: The role of community input can be any number of things.

1981
03:14:16,115 --> 03:14:20,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the evaluation subcommittee meets, they may choose to

1982
03:14:21,837 --> 03:14:24,118
[SPEAKER_08]: work with the superintendent to identify something like that.

1983
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:30,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Her evaluation the superintendent's reflection on her own performance.

1984
03:14:30,601 --> 03:14:40,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens in this meeting, it is a matter of public record, the public is welcome to come speak for three minutes on any topic on our agenda so that stands and we can be really explicit about that.

1985
03:14:41,146 --> 03:14:43,948
[SPEAKER_08]: If we want to be, I think it's sort of a general standing rule but

1986
03:14:44,388 --> 03:14:50,812
[SPEAKER_08]: given where we are at in this process, that could be something that we want to take some extra care to describe.

1987
03:14:51,732 --> 03:15:02,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the committee goes through a process where we all individually evaluate based on the rubric, and then that gets aggregated to a single

1988
03:15:03,876 --> 03:15:08,099
[SPEAKER_08]: evaluation and that comes before this committee and then this committee has to accept that.

1989
03:15:08,139 --> 03:15:13,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is another opportunity for community input that is built into the process.

1990
03:15:13,824 --> 03:15:20,509
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the evaluation subcommittee wants to do something different, I think we are able to do those things if we want to.

1991
03:15:22,210 --> 03:15:22,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1992
03:15:23,051 --> 03:15:23,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

1993
03:15:24,252 --> 03:15:24,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brantley.

1994
03:15:24,913 --> 03:15:32,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I just looked at the website knowing that I'm on that superintendent evaluation

1995
03:15:33,748 --> 03:15:40,231
[SPEAKER_09]: member Olapati as the chair, but it says his name twice on our website instead of a third member.

1996
03:15:40,272 --> 03:15:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So who, I'm assuming it's either.

1997
03:15:42,613 --> 03:15:43,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually member Ntapa.

1998
03:15:44,334 --> 03:15:45,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Ntapa, okay, perfect.

1999
03:15:45,774 --> 03:15:55,039
[SPEAKER_08]: But member Rousseau and I have done this before and we do have templates and we'll make sure that member Olapati has what he needs to do this.

2000
03:15:55,119 --> 03:15:55,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

2001
03:15:55,800 --> 03:15:59,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I had just asked Will if he could update the webpage.

2002
03:15:59,882 --> 03:15:59,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2003
03:16:00,745 --> 03:16:01,145
[SPEAKER_09]: with that.

2004
03:16:01,446 --> 03:16:02,526
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably doing it right now.

2005
03:16:03,907 --> 03:16:04,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We had that talk earlier.

2006
03:16:04,788 --> 03:16:05,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I can send you an email.

2007
03:16:05,989 --> 03:16:06,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it.

2008
03:16:06,389 --> 03:16:12,694
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we could just, since I'm on this and I had already asked him if we could just update the voting and non-voting members on the MSBA process.

2009
03:16:12,734 --> 03:16:13,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Those aren't updated also.

2010
03:16:13,854 --> 03:16:15,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could just add that to the website.

2011
03:16:15,776 --> 03:16:16,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2012
03:16:16,256 --> 03:16:16,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2013
03:16:18,858 --> 03:16:19,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?

2014
03:16:20,019 --> 03:16:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau.

2015
03:16:21,220 --> 03:16:21,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2016
03:16:23,381 --> 03:16:24,222
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor also was

2017
03:16:24,878 --> 03:16:26,839
[SPEAKER_15]: a person who has done evaluations too.

2018
03:16:27,059 --> 03:16:27,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2019
03:16:27,640 --> 03:16:28,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2020
03:16:28,300 --> 03:16:29,040
[SPEAKER_15]: She's not in front of us.

2021
03:16:29,080 --> 03:16:31,522
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's, I did want to point that out.

2022
03:16:31,602 --> 03:16:33,002
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, I do have templates.

2023
03:16:33,082 --> 03:16:34,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a template man.

2024
03:16:34,143 --> 03:16:37,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of, yes.

2025
03:16:37,905 --> 03:16:53,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think it's important to, you know, one of the things you'll discover doing an evaluation is that, you know, in literally no other setting, probably on the planet, you are evaluating in public on TV.

2026
03:16:55,129 --> 03:17:04,536
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is a very, when you have constructive criticism or just criticism, it's a very uncomfortable thing to do.

2027
03:17:06,517 --> 03:17:14,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully we won't have much, but it is a very, I do wish the legislature had found another way to do this.

2028
03:17:16,945 --> 03:17:17,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they working?

2029
03:17:17,586 --> 03:17:18,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

2030
03:17:24,438 --> 03:17:24,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good.

2031
03:17:26,419 --> 03:17:26,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good.

2032
03:17:28,961 --> 03:17:30,061
[SPEAKER_15]: For the time being, right.

2033
03:17:31,182 --> 03:17:35,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't still think it's beneficial for the superintendent being evaluated.

2034
03:17:35,284 --> 03:17:36,525
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not beneficial for us.

2035
03:17:36,585 --> 03:17:43,148
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a beneficial for the students if we're pulling our punches and, you know, and it's just not good.

2036
03:17:43,889 --> 03:17:49,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I also will say that our individual evaluations that we provide that gets

2037
03:17:50,253 --> 03:17:52,955
[SPEAKER_15]: combined, those are actually discoverable as well.

2038
03:17:53,455 --> 03:17:55,397
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, public record not discoverable.

2039
03:17:56,357 --> 03:18:03,462
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, just that'll be included in the instructions that you get, because I have a template for that too.

2040
03:18:05,664 --> 03:18:07,125
[SPEAKER_15]: So that nobody gets confused.

2041
03:18:07,145 --> 03:18:09,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it is, it is confusing.

2042
03:18:09,286 --> 03:18:14,190
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you've done any evaluation of anybody in your life, it will have never been like this before.

2043
03:18:14,390 --> 03:18:15,451
[SPEAKER_08]: So certainly not.

2044
03:18:16,491 --> 03:18:17,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ntapa.

2045
03:18:20,540 --> 03:18:21,941
[SPEAKER_14]: No further comment, motion to approve.

2046
03:18:25,884 --> 03:18:26,245
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

2047
03:18:26,585 --> 03:18:29,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve by Member Ntapa, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

2048
03:18:30,488 --> 03:18:31,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?

03:18:33,110 --> 03:18:33,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Please call the roll.

2050
03:18:35,812 --> 03:18:36,533

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2064
03:18:48,662 --> 03:18:49,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

2065
03:18:50,821 --> 03:18:53,182
[SPEAKER_08]: There are happily no reports requested tonight.

2066
03:18:53,202 --> 03:18:55,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you probably all share my excitement on that.

2067
03:18:57,124 --> 03:18:58,544
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have one condolence though.

2068
03:18:58,985 --> 03:19:10,610
[SPEAKER_08]: The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Patricia Ford, sister of Michael Ford, Medford High School custodian, and sister-in-law to recently retired administrative assistant, Mary Ann Ford.

2069
03:19:11,110 --> 03:19:17,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Pat was also a dedicated Medford public school teacher for more than 35 years, specializing in Title I special education.

2070
03:19:17,993 --> 03:19:20,294
[SPEAKER_08]: May we all please rise for a moment of silence.

2071
03:19:38,367 --> 03:19:45,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Our next regular meeting is on October 6th at Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

2072
03:19:46,551 --> 03:19:53,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, it's the day before the DSP meeting, so we will not have an answer to who was selected until the meeting on the 20th.

2073
03:19:53,514 --> 03:19:55,675
[SPEAKER_08]: But please join us on the 6th.

2074
03:19:56,435 --> 03:19:58,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a motion to adjourn?
