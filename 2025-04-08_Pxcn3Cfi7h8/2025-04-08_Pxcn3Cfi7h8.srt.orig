1
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:51,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Test one, two.

2
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:00,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam, can you hear me?

3
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can.

4
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:15,583
[SPEAKER_10]: You can.

5
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can.

6
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:17,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

7
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:22,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm checking my audio because I am on a different Zoom today.

8
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

9
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:17,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

10
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:38,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

11
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,124
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the whole April 8 2025.

12
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:57,270
[SPEAKER_08]: This meeting will take place at 5.30pm in the city council chamber second floor Medford City Hall, 85 George B has to drive Medford ma and via zoom.

13
00:23:58,531 --> 00:23:59,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

14
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan present.

15
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:12,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Seng.

16
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:14,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Seng is running late.

17
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,335
[SPEAKER_05]: President Behrs also said he's running late.

18
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

19
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:18,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

20
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:21,142
[SPEAKER_08]: That is five present, two running late.

21
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting is called to order.

22
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:38,177
[SPEAKER_08]: The action discussion items for this evening is resolution 25048 offered by myself, a resolution to meet on parking department surveillance report, the Green Line Extension parking zone, and parking ordinance updates.

23
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,919
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go in, I think, that order, and we'll see how much we can get through tonight, hopefully all of it.

24
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:49,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And if not, we'll schedule a follow-up committee of the whole expeditiously to get to whatever we don't get to tonight.

25
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, Councilor Scarpale.

26
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:02,046
[SPEAKER_04]: The request that I had for the parking department as well.

27
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:07,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some concerns and I think that I put it in a resolution weeks ago.

28
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:14,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they not in the proper format or because we had some questions.

29
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:15,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not

30
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:18,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I apologize.

31
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:19,292
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the request?

32
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:36,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know we talked about the G parking, which is on there, but we also talked about policies and procedures that were in question that I wanted to ask the new director, meaning the especially the fact that I've received so many phone calls in regards to the appeals process.

33
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:41,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I think that's probably I know there's more, but I think those are the two that

34
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a lot of calls and emails about that, get some clarification.

35
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

36
00:25:47,282 --> 00:25:47,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

37
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:55,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm I apologize that it wasn't listed on the action discussion items I think the intent was that we could ask those of the parking director while he's here for the GLX update.

38
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:56,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

39
00:25:56,964 --> 00:25:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

40
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:01,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll go in that order.

41
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:07,638
[SPEAKER_08]: First to the review of the parking department surveillance impact reports and use policy.

42
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:13,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So as a quick overview, these are parts of reporting requirements that are mandated.

43
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:22,021
[SPEAKER_08]: under the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was ordained in 2023.

44
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:34,545
[SPEAKER_08]: All city departments that use surveillance technology must complete certain reporting requirements, they must have an impact report for the surveillance technology that they use, they must have a use policy,

45
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:40,818
[SPEAKER_08]: for the surveillance technology that they use, and this must be annually reviewed and approved by the City Council.

46
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:45,449
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also an annual report submitted by the city agency that's using the surveillance technology.

47
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: and an annual report that is compiled by the city council that kind of compiles all of this information into one publicly accessible report.

48
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:57,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the first time that we're having the parking department before us.

49
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,572
[SPEAKER_08]: They have one surveillance technology in use, I believe.

50
00:27:02,632 --> 00:27:08,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for being here to present and thank you for the timely application of the impact report and use policy.

51
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:13,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilors had this in their packets to review before this meeting.

52
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to invite up parking director

53
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:26,660
[SPEAKER_08]: MacDermott, to give a brief overview of anything that you'd like to say, Jermaine, to the use policy, the impact report, the technology that we're talking about are the automatic license plate readers.

54
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:38,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you could give an overview, you know, just you don't have to read word for word from the report, but just an overview of what these are, how they pertain to like what the surveillance element is, why the parking department uses them.

55
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:40,745
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be helpful to kick off the discussion.

56
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:41,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

57
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:53,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, City President Collins and members of the City Council.

58
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:57,498
[SPEAKER_09]: But for formality sake, I'd like to introduce Sarah McDermott, our parking director.

59
00:27:57,798 --> 00:27:59,099
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been with us since December of 2024.

60
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:09,242
[SPEAKER_09]: She's done an excellent job and pleased to have this opportunity to introduce her to this council, though some of you have had the opportunity to meet her informally.

61
00:28:09,402 --> 00:28:09,782
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

62
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:13,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

63
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:15,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having me.

64
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to discuss this technology with all of you.

65
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:29,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, we have two vehicles equipped with license plate recognition technology that is used to enforce parking regulations in the city of Medford.

66
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:34,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It does so by reading the plate.

67
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:43,887
[SPEAKER_07]: The cameras are designed to read text primarily, so it will read the plate and every plate that is stored in the system.

68
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:47,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a permitless city, so we don't give a physical permit.

69
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:54,512
[SPEAKER_07]: The permits that the citizens purchase are tied to their license plate, and this technology reads that plate

70
00:28:55,172 --> 00:29:02,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And that in combination with GPS coordinates determines whether a vehicle is parked legally in the city or not.

71
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:15,586
[SPEAKER_07]: It also will, there are several areas that are no parking or regulated as a tow zone, restricted in another way, and it will also recognize a vehicle parked in violation of those rules as well.

72
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:19,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the primary function of the technology.

73
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:22,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you very much.

74
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any initial questions from councilors?

75
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:34,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, would you mind also giving an overview of the impact report that you supplied to the council?

76
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the headlines.

77
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

78
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:38,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

79
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had to remember which was which.

80
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:43,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

81
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:44,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand.

82
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:48,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I already went over that part.

83
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:56,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So the primary function of it, I just explained, but the reason we use this technology, there are a couple of main reasons.

84
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,112
[SPEAKER_07]: One is the safety of our officers.

85
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:05,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we have five total full-time parking control specialists, one of which is the foreman.

86
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:11,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of those full-time staff work in the evenings after it gets dark.

87
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:12,763
[SPEAKER_07]: One works 4 p.m.

88
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:13,643
[SPEAKER_07]: to 12 a.m.

89
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: One works 3 a.m.

90
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:15,025
[SPEAKER_07]: to 11 a.m.

91
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:34,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And those folks are on the street on their own and enforcing rules that often cause conflict with people who disagree with receiving a citation, having the license plate recognition vehicles in place allows the officers to more safely enforce the parking rules.

92
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:44,236
[SPEAKER_07]: and it allows them to stay in their vehicle, complete the ticket, and only be out of their vehicle to place the ticket on a vehicle.

93
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:56,379
[SPEAKER_07]: The use of the LPR system is for the whole city of Bedford, but primarily right now it's only used on permitted streets.

94
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:02,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason we have to go down a street in the LPR vehicle is to enforce parking regulations for that street.

95
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:12,973
[SPEAKER_07]: The cost of the LPR system in total to be paid over the course of three years, according to the original quote, is $145,547.09.

96
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:17,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we began using it in early July of 2024, the citations generated by the LPR system

97
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:41,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't put the total in there, but it's above $70,000 that's already been recovered in revenue specifically from the LPR enforcement.

98
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:51,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe there are any adverse effects impacting civil rights or civil liberties with the use of this product.

99
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It's designed to identify license plates.

100
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

101
00:31:56,926 --> 00:31:58,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes still photos.

102
00:31:58,607 --> 00:31:59,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take video.

103
00:32:01,874 --> 00:32:14,841
[SPEAKER_07]: people, faces caught in the background of an image inadvertently are blurred automatically by G-Techno, or sorry, by Semsen, who's the creator of the technology.

104
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:18,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Their software automatically blurs any images of faces.

105
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,225
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no,

106
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:35,334
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no retention of data outside of the scope of what the city requires for public record maintenance, so we can set that the data to be stored or.

107
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:39,436
[SPEAKER_07]: You know dumped at any any given in terms of that.

108
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:45,219
[SPEAKER_07]: For non citation related data, it might be a different scope, but that I haven't.

109
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably the same, but whatever we need to retain, we retain only for that time.

110
00:32:52,572 --> 00:33:03,015
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, the Medford Police Department has zero access to any of the data collected from the license plate recognition vehicles.

111
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:06,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had it set up so that

112
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:19,571
[SPEAKER_07]: The users from the Denver Police Department who have system administrative credentials because they need to create logins and edit logins and delete old users, they previously had access to the information.

113
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:25,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Though after I spoke to both traffic sergeants, they weren't aware they had access to the information until I told them.

114
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And subsequently, that's been removed.

115
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:33,940
[SPEAKER_07]: So they still have all their same access to the database and what they need to do to perform their duties.

116
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:40,144
[SPEAKER_07]: without having access to any data captured by the license plate recognition cameras.

117
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:45,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you and I appreciate that.

118
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:56,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this is kind of the the intent of the city working together to put these kind of safeguards around surveillance technology so that we can make sure that there's a structure for exactly that kind of checking and rigor which is to say

119
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:06,354
[SPEAKER_08]: any access to surveillance data or surveillance technology that does not have to exist, should not exist, because it makes us all a little less safe and less cyber secure in the city.

120
00:34:07,274 --> 00:34:08,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So appreciate that.

121
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:14,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll keep an eye out for questions from my, oh, I see one question from Councilor Callahan.

122
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:15,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Go again, Councilor Callahan.

123
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:21,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you and I apologize person and don't want anybody else to get what I have.

124
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:26,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a cold, but my question is about whether there.

125
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, is any agreement with the company that provides this information or provides this technology, um, in the contract or, uh, with.

126
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:48,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Any partner of theirs, any 3rd party that any information from that is captured by Medford cameras would go to anyone aside from Medford.

127
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,337
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, no, they do not.

128
00:34:53,027 --> 00:35:02,812
[SPEAKER_07]: they do not share the data collected by the city of Medford with any other entities, and nor have I heard of them being subpoenaed or having that information requested of them.

129
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:14,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Any information that the public or another company would want, I mean, well, the public would come through us and we would go through the standard process of providing public information.

130
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as our data being captured and given to other entities, that's not something that

131
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,507
[SPEAKER_07]: GTECNA or SENS.

132
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:29,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So SENSEN created the license plate recognition cameras and the technology, the software that powers it.

133
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:35,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is integrated with GTECNA, who is our parking management company.

134
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:40,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So those two companies together collect and store the data.

135
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:46,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And as the data is collected by SENSEN's technology and transferred to GTECNA, it's encrypted.

136
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:50,050
[SPEAKER_07]: So it remains secure while it's transferred into GTECNA's database.

137
00:35:51,273 --> 00:36:00,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, and to follow that up with, so it sounds like SenseN and GTEC, if I've got those correct, at some point, each of them has the data.

138
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:03,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if SenseN deletes the data once it is transferred?

139
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you know if GTEC has any access to the data?

140
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:18,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Both have said, I have emails from GTECNA and from SENCEN saying that data not related to a parking citation is dumped after 30 days.

141
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:24,576
[SPEAKER_07]: But that, like I said before, we might have to update with them and have them keep this information longer.

142
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:33,824
[SPEAKER_07]: When I look in my database, which is called Command Center, where all of this data is stored and where I can access it,

143
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:44,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I see every hit that the cameras have collected since its inception in July.

144
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So we still have all the information available for the public.

145
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:55,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not stored by GTECNA or CENCEN, but we still could provide it to a citizen who was interested in it.

146
00:36:58,146 --> 00:36:58,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

147
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:05,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you for that answer I appreciate that and great to know that this has already been at least raised to sense energy techno.

148
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:14,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I know for myself and this brings up a question that I was going to kind of the question around the longevity of this data both locally and with G techna and sense and.

149
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:32,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be useful in the use policy to have some language that specifies like a concrete sunlighting date for the data, whether it is stored locally, and some clarity around the municipal records retention schedules.

150
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that those are citywide, but I think that people are generally familiar with

151
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:37,855
[SPEAKER_08]: what that actually dictates.

152
00:37:37,915 --> 00:37:43,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be a helpful amendment to the use policy to see that specified how long this data is being stored.

153
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I can understand that it needs to be stored for some amount of time in case somebody wants to make an appeal, which they should be able to do, of course.

154
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:55,507
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it'd be helpful to have some concrete language about for how long is it remaining.

155
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

156
00:37:57,768 --> 00:37:59,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a fair request.

157
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can update that very soon.

158
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

159
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:30,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And according, and kind of going along with that, sorry, looking back at my notes here, I think that it would also, it sounds like the information that we've received from CENCEN and GTECNA so far is that there's no indication that they have any agreements with other entities to use the data that is transferred back to them in any kind of way, which is great to hear.

160
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:31,880
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'd like to assume.

161
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be helpful to have that, some language around that and like,

162
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:39,827
[SPEAKER_08]: even if it's an annual confirmation of that in our contract with them written into the use policy.

163
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:48,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is in a lot of cases with surveillance data and surveillance technology, you know, it's kind of the concentric circles of it all.

164
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:50,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just, is it secure here?

165
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:52,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it secure with the people who have access to it?

166
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:57,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it secure with the people who created the software that allows us to get this data in the first place?

167
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:04,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that could be kind of a related amendment in the use policy, just that we're confirming with the people who enable the surveillance technology that it is also,

168
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:11,592
[SPEAKER_08]: not being transferred, not being sold, not being shared, and like a very specific sunlight date on their end as well.

169
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:13,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be very valuable.

170
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:14,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

171
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:15,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

172
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no other further questions from councillors at this time.

173
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had one other.

174
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:33,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me pull up the section of the, this is on the, still on the use policy.

175
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:47,184
[SPEAKER_08]: For number six, you mentioned, and you spoke to this at this time, the parking department is not seeking to share access of the technology or the data with any other agency, department, bureau, division, or unit.

176
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:48,305
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

177
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:48,965
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

178
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:54,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be helpful just to shore up that language to make it a declaration of this is something that will not happen.

179
00:39:55,295 --> 00:40:03,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only are we not intending for it to happen right now, this is something that we are not allowing within the parameters of this technology's use, would be a helpful amendment.

180
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:04,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

181
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:08,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

182
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:23,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions, comments, concerns, compliments from other councilors on the parking department's impact report or use policy?

183
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

184
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:45,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just caught along to few hopefully quick amendments to the records retention, some confirmations there and a quick amendment to the use policy section six to state affirmatively, you know, the switch from no intent to share access to will not share access.

185
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:56,276
[SPEAKER_08]: If that can be updated and then submitted back to the council next week to be included in our annual surveillance reporting, that would be great.

186
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:58,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's doable.

187
00:40:59,175 --> 00:40:59,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

188
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:00,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

189
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:07,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any public comment on this item before we proceed to the next item on our agenda?

190
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:09,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, come on up.

191
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:14,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director.

192
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:17,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Ingber, 9 Traper Street in Bedford.

193
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, for the opportunity to speak.

194
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Ms.

195
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:26,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Nazarian and Ms.

196
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,783
[SPEAKER_00]: for your good work on this.

197
00:41:30,503 --> 00:41:55,589
[SPEAKER_00]: From a civil rights and civil liberties perspective, this technology and this policy is pretty close to striking exactly the balance that we're looking for, of accomplishing, gaining the efficiency that you need in order to do parking enforcement well, while protecting the civil liberties

198
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:57,791
[SPEAKER_00]: people in our city.

199
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,092
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking for.

200
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:05,993
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we were looking for when we pushed for the CTOPS ordinance.

201
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:09,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad to see that happening here.

202
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:24,698
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I just want to do one little educational thing piece and make some minor comments, which were pretty much laid out by Vice President Collins.

203
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:49,944
[SPEAKER_00]: The educational piece is that even when you don't capture data about human beings, when you're not taking pictures of people's faces or you're erasing those from your data collection, the tracking of vehicles can be used to track people and has been used to track people.

204
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:52,285
[SPEAKER_00]: So even without

205
00:42:53,769 --> 00:43:00,434
[SPEAKER_00]: what would appear to be personal data that does pose a potential civil liberties threat.

206
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:06,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think that you address it well by saying this is only to be used for parking enforcement.

207
00:43:06,518 --> 00:43:09,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what would concern us.

208
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:13,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's the little technical pieces.

209
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:18,146
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the retention policy, which I think you're going to address.

210
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:20,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear to me

211
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:29,268
[SPEAKER_00]: why, when there's no citation involved, you would need to retain that information at all.

212
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:37,094
[SPEAKER_00]: It would seem that it should be deleted that very night.

213
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:47,723
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to GITECNA and their affiliate organization, I think, as was stated, you need to have a contractual provision with them to make sure that

214
00:43:51,014 --> 00:43:59,101
[SPEAKER_00]: the data in any way that neither you nor we want them to be using it for.

215
00:44:00,782 --> 00:44:08,369
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the amendment to Section 6 that Vice President Collins pointed out.

216
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that, I would say good work.

217
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:13,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

218
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:15,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Barry.

219
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:24,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any additional public comment on this item?

220
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:26,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Collins.

221
00:44:26,553 --> 00:44:30,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing I'd like to add to the conversation for purposes of information is

222
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ingber's question as far as why the data has to be retained if it's not pertaining to a ticket.

223
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:43,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be mistaken about this and I think we probably need to confirm with council.

224
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But once a public record is created within the city, it is a record.

225
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:56,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it is required to be maintained under the Massachusetts Municipal Retention Schedule.

226
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:57,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have

227
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:06,218
[SPEAKER_09]: ability to expedite the deletion of that data.

228
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:10,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have a legal requirement to maintain that data.

229
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we will look into that and we will follow through.

230
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

231
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:14,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

232
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:15,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

233
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:24,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel free to approach the podium.

234
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:28,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess.

235
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:30,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Barry Ingram, 9 Draper Street.

236
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say why it is important.

237
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:57,317
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a public record, then any member of the public can request that information, then any member of the public can utilize that to track people so that if you're taking pictures in front of a dispensary or in front of a medical establishment or in front of

238
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:09,955
[SPEAKER_00]: a mosque or in front of a church, then people can start to use that data in ways that we would not want them to use.

239
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:16,598
[SPEAKER_00]: A public record is available to bad actors as well as to people looking for their own personal private information.

240
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:22,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that context.

241
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:28,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you all.

242
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no additional public comment on this item.

243
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:38,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, councillors, Nina, Sarah, members of the committee for the review of these documents.

244
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:43,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for, again, for your thoroughness and timeliness with this very first submission.

245
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:48,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it, especially you being, well, not really that new to the department, but appreciate it anyway.

246
00:46:52,098 --> 00:46:53,099
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving right along.

247
00:46:53,459 --> 00:47:02,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Our second topic is updates about the Green Line Extension parking program and other related questions about the parking program.

248
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:04,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know you've prepared an overview.

249
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:15,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Please feel free to give us an overview of the GLX program, how it's been going so far, whatever you think is germane to the topic, and then we can entertain questions from counselors.

250
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:16,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

251
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:27,124
[SPEAKER_07]: An hour or so ago I reviewed my inbox the prior directors inbox and the parking public email account for.

252
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Complaints specific to the g-zone.

253
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:31,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I searched the g-zone.

254
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:46,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I searched glx zone And I the only one I found was from its early inception It was a citizen concerned about his visitor passes and whether this would impact His dead-end street filling with cars and being unable to use his visitor pass.

255
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there was one other formal complaint

256
00:47:50,815 --> 00:48:06,542
[SPEAKER_07]: that Jim Silva, the special projects manager who helped get the G-Zone started, he mentioned during the February 25 traffic commission meeting that he had only been informed of one formal complaint.

257
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:18,207
[SPEAKER_07]: According to him, I know that's hearsay, but he also stated that there was some complaints on social media, but nothing that had come through in a formal fashion.

258
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:20,768
[SPEAKER_07]: specific to the G zone.

259
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:33,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So, having been here just for the end of the, you know, the trial period and then it's the decision in February by the traffic commission to make the G zone permanent.

260
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:39,961
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what I know about concerns related to the G zone.

261
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:44,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally think that zoned parking is the way to go.

262
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:51,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be the whole city because I know not every part of Medford needs zoned parking.

263
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:55,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Not every part of Medford needs parking permits according to its citizens.

264
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:03,434
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the areas adjacent to the train stations, the new Green Line extension,

265
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's beneficial.

266
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:20,963
[SPEAKER_07]: The other benefit that we recently, not discovered, but that came to light is when we've been working with engineering to ensure that when they have a street project and cars are displaced, that they don't receive a ticket.

267
00:49:21,723 --> 00:49:30,265
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, on Willis Avenue, there's a large project underway to replace water lines, I believe it's something that's going to displace vehicles.

268
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:34,146
[SPEAKER_07]: All of Willis Avenue and the side streets that are impacted,

269
00:49:35,247 --> 00:49:45,606
[SPEAKER_07]: If that was a zone, then those vehicles could park anywhere in the zone and not have to worry about whether they were going to get a ticket and the contractors and engineering and my department wouldn't have to.

270
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:54,493
[SPEAKER_07]: try and communicate, hey, you park on this street, now you have to park on this one during this project, because some people might not want to park on that street.

271
00:49:54,573 --> 00:50:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they were in a zoned area, it would benefit them when there's a project underway that would displace their normal parking area.

272
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another benefit recently.

273
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:11,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an argument I made at the Traffic Commission meeting in February in favor of making the G Zone.

274
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:14,808
[SPEAKER_08]: long term.

275
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:15,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

276
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:32,058
[SPEAKER_08]: And just super briefly, we don't have a lot of attendees and chambers are on Zoom this evening, but just in case there are folks watching online who are kind of new to this issue, could you just in like a snapshot explain the goals of the G-Zone parking program and just in general the geographic area that it sits over?

277
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:32,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

278
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:36,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So the G-Zone is in the southern part of Medford.

279
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It is

280
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:43,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Um it runs along a long Main Street but excludes Main Street.

281
00:50:43,254 --> 00:50:44,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Main Street is a border.

282
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:45,555
[SPEAKER_07]: George Street is a border.

283
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:50,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and the the south side, the border along Broadway that borders Somerville.

284
00:50:50,638 --> 00:50:55,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the the rough borders of the G zone and every street within that zone is included.

285
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:03,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and when you that when somebody who lives in the G zone purchases a parking permit, they can then park on any street on in the G

286
00:51:12,364 --> 00:51:30,744
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of prevent, I don't know, I don't know if it was to prevent people from parking there with the Green Line extension opening or if it was to ensure the people living in that area that regardless of if people come here and park to commute, you will have a place on your street.

287
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:36,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Having not been here for the original meetings regarding the G zone.

288
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:40,779
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my speculation as to why it was recommended in the first place.

289
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:54,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the thing that's scary and like you know project progress is great when it comes to public transportation so having those, I grew up on Winchester Street I heard about this ball squared green.

290
00:51:54,908 --> 00:52:05,913
[SPEAKER_07]: line stop since early 2000s and now that it's finally here it's an opportunity for people to commute not be single occupancy cars all these wonderful benefits, but it means that.

291
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:11,456
[SPEAKER_07]: People are more likely to come park in that neighborhood in order to commute on the train so.

292
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:19,371
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than, I mean, those streets were already, for the most part, permit parking, which is my understanding.

293
00:52:19,772 --> 00:52:23,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just allowing, you know, let's say I still lived on Winchester Street.

294
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:37,396
[SPEAKER_07]: If Winchester Street filled up with commuters in the early part of that GLX opening, I could then park on Morton Avenue or New Bern or somewhere else close to my residence, and it wouldn't impact me personally as much.

295
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:38,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

296
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:42,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my understanding of the goals of it.

297
00:52:43,013 --> 00:52:43,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

298
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:44,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

299
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,896
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a G-Zone resident, that matches my experience as well.

300
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:52,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli, we'll go to you for questions.

301
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:52,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

302
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

303
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:57,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here and welcome.

304
00:52:58,363 --> 00:53:09,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that prior to you, I think maybe hopefully your colleagues or City Hall informed you the relationship with the former department

305
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,019
[SPEAKER_04]: and the residents were very, very difficult.

306
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:19,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So complaints weren't going to your office because when other complaints went to that office, they just weren't heard.

307
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no faith there.

308
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:22,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that changes.

309
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:29,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So the calls that we received, I think the biggest concern and the biggest issue right now is a lack of information.

310
00:53:29,632 --> 00:53:30,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll give you one.

311
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:37,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The phone calls I received from people saying that we're selling parking spots, so people from outside the city of Medford

312
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,505
[SPEAKER_04]: can buy parking in Medford and take a method residents parking spot so they can take the green line.

313
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:47,987
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the things that have been floating out there, right?

314
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the report that this is still a pilot program, correct?

315
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one really knows that this was changed, right?

316
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:59,196
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a full time program now, and I think maybe just if we can, I would recommend

317
00:54:00,206 --> 00:54:18,253
[SPEAKER_04]: just a report or a press release or anything you could share with me with the council that to enlighten us how many people have taken advantage of this program and how it's benefiting people and where they're using these parking spots.

318
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:25,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that the calls that I got really did affect some residents that when they came home, there were cars that were parked there.

319
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,876
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not their neighbors, they're not their cars.

320
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:32,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And they understand that there's this new parking, but don't understand it.

321
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:46,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that not having an avenue where there was someone on the other line, because the feeling was, and believe me, I understand traffic and parking, I work very closely in municipality, I work with that traffic and parking department.

322
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand how difficult it is.

323
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a very volatile situation at times.

324
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:56,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we were hearing at times that even when the person on,

325
00:54:57,277 --> 00:55:08,789
[SPEAKER_04]: the residents and would call in, you would get negativity right off the bat, and it would become so, so combative that it really wasn't productive at all.

326
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:14,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when the cause that's some of the calls we that I received.

327
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:19,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's why I brought that up back some months ago about getting some information prior

328
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,793
[SPEAKER_04]: to it becoming a full-time program.

329
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think if there's any way that, you know, you could give us just a brief report, just give us an update on how many people have taken advantage of it, how many people purchased the parking, what are our benefits financially, how we benefit from it, you know, are people taking advantage of it, and

330
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: and then just informing them just the basic guidelines that this isn't free parking for people outside the city of Medford.

331
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:59,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like again, these are the things that unfortunately people didn't have the warm and fuzzies calling the former office because they just, it got right off the bat combative and it just got turned off very, very quickly.

332
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:01,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and don't get me wrong.

333
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:05,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I know nine out of 10 times the person calling is gonna have an attitude.

334
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

335
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're angry.

336
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:13,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it shouldn't shouldn't be on the person that's answering the phone.

337
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:14,039
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not fair.

338
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:23,282
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, at the same time, we are a service customer service based industry here and listening to those constituents, even when they are 1000% wrong.

339
00:56:23,323 --> 00:56:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very important.

340
00:56:24,263 --> 00:56:24,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that

341
00:56:25,024 --> 00:56:37,720
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we turn the corner and we meet a new director I'm pretty excited about starting off fresh and making sure that there's an avenue where residents have someone they can call and, in essence, get set straight.

342
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you can.

343
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:56,207
[SPEAKER_04]: through the chair if we can offer that as an amendment to to just share something with our residents that something's very simple that you know that maybe will alleviate phone calls to you where they council scott pelley a b and c said well here's the truth and send that off i think would be beneficial

344
00:56:57,093 --> 00:57:00,155
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so let me just address this first and foremost.

345
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not sell parking permits to any non-resident of the city of Medford.

346
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:07,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Clinton, Massachusetts.

347
00:57:08,479 --> 00:57:09,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the parking director.

348
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Could I buy a parking pass because I want to take the train?

349
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:12,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely not.

350
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:18,465
[SPEAKER_07]: The requirements to get a resident parking pass are your registration.

351
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:22,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Your vehicle must be garaged in the city of Medford on the street.

352
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:25,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You're purchasing your permit for us, whether it's the G zone or outside the G zone.

353
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:39,656
[SPEAKER_07]: and you need proof of residence, whether it's excise tax, other tax documents, utilities, vehicle registration itself, if you are also garage there and you live there.

354
00:57:39,676 --> 00:57:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: No permit outside are issued to anybody who does not live in Medford.

355
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:51,582
[SPEAKER_07]: These are annual permits, so every year we re-verify that data before we sell another permit.

356
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,629
[SPEAKER_07]: lisa smith, PB, Lupita D Montoya, PB – She, Her, Hers

357
00:58:14,948 --> 00:58:22,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't targeted for so I'm not going to pull one of my parking enforcement specialists from one area to immediately go there.

358
00:58:23,197 --> 00:58:33,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked the closest one to work it into their day, rather than because I don't want them to stop doing on one street to give you only have a few of them to correct.

359
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:45,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very often, I don't want to give a percentage or speculate but very often I email back that person or call them back and say hey that person actually does have a permit for your street.

360
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:51,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you know going forward, because perhaps someone new moved in they just got their past and some unfamiliar car so.

361
00:58:52,720 --> 00:59:03,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I say more often than not, it is an illegally parked car, but there are instances where somebody reports a vehicle and it is actually allowed to be in the area it's in.

362
00:59:04,491 --> 00:59:06,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something to keep in mind.

363
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I love listening to peoples.

364
00:59:11,697 --> 00:59:13,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It might sound crazy.

365
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in this industry since 2010.

366
00:59:15,842 --> 00:59:16,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it all.

367
00:59:17,364 --> 00:59:26,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I've spoken to and emailed with several constituents who I have heard have had frequent complaints or frequent issues and

368
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:35,422
[SPEAKER_07]: it's fulfilling when I can get them to understand maybe another perspective.

369
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:39,105
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people might not understand that we need meters.

370
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:50,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a woman asking about the meters at the library because the library doesn't have enough parking, from what I hear, for its clients, and I had to

371
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:53,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to explain, you know, it's not just the library.

372
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:59,423
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have other businesses, other businesses in Medford that need that short term parking so they can have customers as well.

373
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:00,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So

374
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:10,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoy taking those calls and getting those emails and trying to satisfy people who in the past haven't gotten the satisfaction that they're looking for.

375
01:00:11,229 --> 01:00:26,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I find that so often, and I believe I mentioned this during my interview process, that a lot of them just want to be heard and they don't necessarily need a problem solved per se, but they want to feel like somebody at least recognizes the issue.

376
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So I try and take time out of my day to do that for people.

377
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:32,189
[SPEAKER_07]: if they communicate with me directly.

378
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Could there be better communication by email from the rest of the staff?

379
01:00:38,971 --> 01:00:50,174
[SPEAKER_07]: That is something I can look into and address and see, maybe look at some prior, some past emails, see how the tone is, see if it's maybe a little cold, if we can warm it up and make people feel more heard.

380
01:00:51,054 --> 01:00:52,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's- I appreciate that.

381
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

382
01:00:53,134 --> 01:00:54,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll go a long way.

383
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said,

384
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:06,048
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I think you hit the nail on the head when you said a lot of times people just want to be listened to and then told, you know, thank you, but you're wrong and move on.

385
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:11,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that again, I think that that's important, but that's, I think for the G zone, I think you, you know,

386
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:34,224
[SPEAKER_04]: answering that question and publicly and although no one's really here and no one's on zoom but it'll be nice to get something that we can share with our constituents if they ask because again um people don't like to search people don't like to do their homework they just rather call and complain and have someone else do the homework so um so if that's possible that'd be a great assistance to at least myself.

387
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

388
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean any of any of the council members are welcome to reach out to me directly regarding parking, careful.

389
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

390
01:01:46,646 --> 01:01:46,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

391
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:59,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director I agree I think that I think will be worthwhile I there is some great information about the green line zone on the city website, it's been up there for a while and I think the counselors point to sound that it

392
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:09,055
[SPEAKER_08]: people like things to be really at their fingertips, and it has been a while since the G zone was piloted, since it was codified as permanent.

393
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:18,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, more information is always better to make sure that it reaches people here in this, you know, rather fragmented information environment that we have here in Medford.

394
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,842
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will say for myself, again, as a resident of the G zone, I really like it.

395
01:02:23,002 --> 01:02:24,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a huge improvement.

396
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:29,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not my job to proselytize for the zoned parking, but I find myself wanting to just because

397
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:30,912
[SPEAKER_08]: living in that neighborhood.

398
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:49,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a vast improvement and I think it would be helpful for there to be more readily available information about what are the reasons why this was instituted in the first place to help people understand the pros in addition to the changes or some of their perceived cons as we continue to get used to it.

399
01:02:50,343 --> 01:02:50,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

400
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:59,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a fair request and I think you're correct that the information on our website regarding the G-Zone needs updating and

401
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:06,809
[SPEAKER_07]: if nothing else, to say that it was made permanent by the Traffic Commission.

402
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is noted.

403
01:03:07,709 --> 01:03:11,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make sure to update that information for the public.

404
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:12,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

405
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:13,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

406
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:24,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any other questions or comments from Councilors on the G-Zone or other related parking enforcement?

407
01:03:29,645 --> 01:03:34,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, and none on Zoom, is there any public comment or questions about this topic?

408
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:42,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, thank you so much.

409
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate the overview.

410
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:54,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for your work in the parking department, an undersung but important department in our city.

411
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that acknowledgment.

412
01:03:57,905 --> 01:04:00,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, on to our last topic for the evening.

413
01:04:00,326 --> 01:04:02,467
[SPEAKER_08]: We are making good time.

414
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: This bodes well for the rest of our evening, knock on wood.

415
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:11,432
[SPEAKER_08]: The third topic is the proposed ordinance change.

416
01:04:13,593 --> 01:04:18,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me, sorry, I X'd out of my agenda, but I think had the information about that.

417
01:04:25,982 --> 01:04:42,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so this is a proposed amendment from the city administration regarding Chapter 78 Article 3 Division 2 Subsection 1 Section 78-173 pertaining to municipal employee and business parking in back of City Hall.

418
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:46,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to give an overview of the what and the why of this proposed amendment?

419
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:47,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

420
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:53,208
[SPEAKER_07]: This came up just since I began in December.

421
01:04:53,769 --> 01:05:03,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Shortly after I began in December, as you all may know, there was a discovery made in the commuter lot there between Clippership Drive and

422
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:28,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I-93, which may require some excavation in the future, which was concerning because that lot is used as an overflow lot for City Hall employees who may or may not find a space in the back of City Hall because the spaces are often used not just by City Hall visitors, but also both City Hall employees use it, City Hall visitors use it.

423
01:05:29,547 --> 01:05:34,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Legally, they're allowed to, but we also have people who go to Atrius Health on a regular basis.

424
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:41,709
[SPEAKER_07]: We have people who park there and hop on the 94 or the 96 bus and leave their vehicles there all day.

425
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:57,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So the concern is that with an overflow lot potentially being removed, that city hall employees may not have adequate space to park their vehicles, depending on how much space is removed from that lot.

426
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:14,131
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that was the beginning of the move to make the spaces behind City Hall for City Hall employees only, leaving the spaces out front for visitors.

427
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the lot up here is still available for now.

428
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:21,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And the lot where the buses pick up are also pay-to-park areas.

429
01:06:21,795 --> 01:06:22,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They're metered parking.

430
01:06:22,795 --> 01:06:26,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So those could also be used by visitors if they were willing to pay $1 for an hour or, you know,

431
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:31,085
[SPEAKER_07]: however long they need it.

432
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:36,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was what started it, I guess.

433
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:45,589
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm reading this correctly, this would be to repeal the use of one of these lots as the overflow lot.

434
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:57,192
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be to repeal the use of the lot behind City Hall, directly behind City Hall for municipal visitors and make the spaces for City Hall employees.

435
01:06:58,008 --> 01:07:20,799
[SPEAKER_07]: With the exception of the electric vehicle charging spaces, the handicap accessible spaces, and the veteran space, those would remain accessible to all who meet the requirements of those spaces, but any other regular space between Clippership, City Hall Mall, the lot behind that lot, and then

436
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:27,847
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall itself, those spaces would be for City Hall employees only during City Hall hours.

437
01:07:28,307 --> 01:07:34,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So outside of City Hall hours, they could still be used by visitors to Bedford Square.

438
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:36,631
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, thank you.

439
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:44,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And sorry, just to double confirm, the lot that's being repealed for visitor use.

440
01:07:46,055 --> 01:07:55,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the one directly abutting City Hall and back of us or is the one directly behind City Hall where the buses pick up behind City Hall is the next lot so that lot wouldn't change.

441
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:56,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's just.

442
01:07:57,182 --> 01:08:01,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the area immediately around City Hall in back is just for City Hall employees.

443
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:02,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

444
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:04,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And then visitors can park like the next lot over.

445
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Or in the front or in the front.

446
01:08:07,888 --> 01:08:08,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yes.

447
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:09,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

448
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I just, it's fine.

449
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I really need a diagram in front of me at all times.

450
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

451
01:08:17,284 --> 01:08:24,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be repealing the visitor parking during business hours provision, so it remains as only an overflow lot for municipal employees.

452
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:25,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

453
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:26,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

454
01:08:27,089 --> 01:08:31,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions or comments from my fellow councillors on this proposed change?

455
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:33,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

456
01:08:33,752 --> 01:08:36,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, my computer screen is not big enough.

457
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:38,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Councillor Lazaro.

458
01:08:40,235 --> 01:08:40,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

459
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:42,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, can you hear me?

460
01:08:43,116 --> 01:08:43,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

461
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

462
01:08:45,854 --> 01:08:56,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know how many City Hall employees are at City Hall on average during City Hall hours and how many parking spaces?

463
01:08:56,462 --> 01:08:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it correspond accurately?

464
01:08:58,823 --> 01:09:00,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the right amount of spaces?

465
01:09:03,687 --> 01:09:12,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the number of City Hall employees that regularly come to City Hall Monday through Friday, but there are, I think, 96 spaces.

466
01:09:13,102 --> 01:09:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: available in that lot, which may include the handicap accessible spaces, there are four or five, I think there's actually four.

467
01:09:24,265 --> 01:09:32,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So between 90 and 95 spaces that would be taken away from visitors if this were to be passed.

468
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:36,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it OK if I keep going, Vice President Collins?

469
01:09:36,992 --> 01:09:39,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

470
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hours are 8.30 to 4.30 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, 8.30 to 7.30 on Wednesday, and then 8.30 to 12.30 on Friday.

471
01:09:54,952 --> 01:09:59,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, so it would just be those hours only city hall employees.

472
01:10:01,802 --> 01:10:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other hours, it would be open parking.

473
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that I'm thinking about is there's another complicating factor, which is that often.

474
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:22,343
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses like the Chevalier uses the City Hall lot as their sort of like suggested municipal parking for people going to shows at night.

475
01:10:22,983 --> 01:10:34,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of a nice thing to have a municipal lot that doesn't really get policed.

476
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:37,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also sort of unheard of.

477
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:49,183
[SPEAKER_02]: To have a lot that's free that nobody pays money to park at so I understand why we wouldn't necessarily, you know, need to maintain that.

478
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:49,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

479
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:55,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

480
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling some hesitation in myself.

481
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:06,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I would be curious if we had the number of employees who are in City Hall.

482
01:11:06,086 --> 01:11:07,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Nina would know that.

483
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:08,368
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

484
01:11:08,808 --> 01:11:09,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Not off the top of your head, maybe.

485
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:11,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

486
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:13,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that information off the top of my head.

487
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:20,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking of potentially counting and potentially giving some sort of ballpark estimate, the number of employees we have in City Hall.

488
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:46,517
[SPEAKER_09]: The couple of things to say, as it pertains to your question, Councilor Lozaro, is we, just to, it's already been stated, but we do find that if an employee approaches the City Hall lot, let's say any time beyond the window of maybe 9.30 or 10 a.m., the lot is chock full.

489
01:11:47,338 --> 01:11:50,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that there are a number of, I can tell you,

490
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:58,155
[SPEAKER_09]: For my own viewing there's definitely one person who takes the 94 bus, I can describe the vehicle I don't think that's necessary here.

491
01:11:59,456 --> 01:12:02,397
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we can't enforce that right now.

492
01:12:02,897 --> 01:12:11,041
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't, you know, deter that individual whoever that may be from parking behind City Hall because we don't have any.

493
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,801
[SPEAKER_09]: traffic commission requirements that are in place.

494
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:23,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the part of this entire process, we realized that that didn't exist.

495
01:12:23,483 --> 01:12:28,905
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was kind of how we were approaching resolving that issue.

496
01:12:29,005 --> 01:12:36,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And then our parking director identified and came to realize that there was an ordinance that also spoke to the same issue.

497
01:12:40,752 --> 01:12:59,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, I guess, all I wanted to really mention here in all of this, because it's really something that creates an obstacle for employees as they're coming back from meetings at a different facility, or if they're coming in late for any reason, or have, you know, let's say we have a situation where someone's taking a half day and they're trying to come back.

498
01:13:00,118 --> 01:13:03,039
[SPEAKER_09]: It creates an obstacle into getting to work, truly.

499
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.

500
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:05,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

501
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.

502
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:07,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

503
01:13:09,545 --> 01:13:17,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And might I just add that since I began in December, I've had multiple City Hall employees ask me, when are we going to change the slot?

504
01:13:18,112 --> 01:13:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on with that?

505
01:13:19,173 --> 01:13:20,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard this was happening.

506
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's something that the employees want, not that that's necessarily a deciding factor, but it is something that I've heard quite a bit about from employees since I began.

507
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:34,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

508
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:36,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that overview.

509
01:13:36,921 --> 01:13:39,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is reasonable.

510
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:57,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we certainly have a lot of parking in the square very close to City Hall that people can also take advantage of I hope that decreases all over time, and as our transit system improves and you don't need to have quite so much parking surrounding City Hall but given that we now do I don't think that this is.

511
01:13:58,749 --> 01:14:00,950
[SPEAKER_08]: a bad change to make.

512
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:06,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I would request, I'm sure that this is, I'm absolutely positive this is a policy you've discussed already.

513
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:15,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be great to see a 30 day warning period before tickets are given out, just so that people can adjust their habits.

514
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing nods, so I see this as something you were already thinking about.

515
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:23,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're definitely going to communicate first,

516
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there will be at least 30 day communication, that's, that's reasonable.

517
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:42,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, in addition to that we wouldn't just on that 31st day go out and bang out a bunch of parking citations we would issue some warnings let people know the regulars could catch on like oh I can't get away with this anymore.

518
01:14:43,557 --> 01:14:49,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And then hopefully they would find another place to go without actually having to pay a fine if they receive a warning.

519
01:14:49,481 --> 01:15:00,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So the plan, I believe, I discussed with Steve, the communications director, to do two weeks of warnings after the initial communication, which I believe we were going to communicate for two weeks, but we can extend that.

520
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:01,548
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a problem.

521
01:15:02,909 --> 01:15:06,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, and then a couple of weeks of warnings before any actual tickets are written.

522
01:15:06,391 --> 01:15:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And I currently have every

523
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:15,048
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall employee who has submitted their registration to the parking department is entered as a city employee.

524
01:15:15,488 --> 01:15:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're all ready to go.

525
01:15:17,009 --> 01:15:19,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So our parking staff can identify who's who out there.

526
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:21,231
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

527
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:21,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

528
01:15:22,012 --> 01:15:23,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like the ducks are in a row on this.

529
01:15:24,673 --> 01:15:28,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any additional questions or comments from counselors on this proposed change?

530
01:15:32,477 --> 01:15:33,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

531
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for

532
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:39,447
[SPEAKER_08]: the overview.

533
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:48,179
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me just get organized here with the motions to come out of this meeting.

534
01:15:51,616 --> 01:16:09,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we will need a few emotion to receive and place on file, the impact report and use policy for the parking department, and that's of course this doesn't need to be in motion but that's what the expectation that the updated version will be coming this week ahead of the annual reporting deadline.

535
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:12,030
[SPEAKER_08]: A second motion to.

536
01:16:15,852 --> 01:16:24,594
[SPEAKER_08]: request more communication from the parking department and the city administration about the G zone parking program to distribute to residents.

537
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:26,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything you wanted to add to that Councilor Scarpelli?

538
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:34,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my colleagues like to second that.

539
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you so much.

540
01:16:36,316 --> 01:16:42,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think we could use a third motion to approve, to report out of committee.

541
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:45,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

542
01:16:45,256 --> 01:16:49,097
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the motion to let's finish the sentence report out of committee.

543
01:16:50,838 --> 01:17:01,301
[SPEAKER_08]: The proposed repeal of chapter 73, article three, division two, subsection one, section 78, one 73.

544
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:07,062
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let the clerk catch up and copy and paste from the agenda.

545
01:17:10,523 --> 01:17:12,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I will restate to you in just a sec.

546
01:17:37,405 --> 01:17:41,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so these three motions are all by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Seng.

547
01:17:43,129 --> 01:18:06,828
[SPEAKER_08]: They are to receive and place on file the parking department's impact report and use policy for ALPRs, to request more information and communications on the G-Zone parking program from the parking director and city administration, and to report out of committee the repeal of the ordinance.

548
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:12,745
[SPEAKER_08]: and I can send you this text if that's helpful, Mr. Clerk.

549
01:18:15,585 --> 01:18:16,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, will do.

550
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:21,466
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, on the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Hussain.

551
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:23,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

552
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:38,649
[SPEAKER_05]: On the first motion.

553
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:40,909
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Callahan.

554
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:41,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

555
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:43,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Councils are.

556
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:44,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

557
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,631
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lemon.

558
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:47,111
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a scrub Kelly.

559
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:47,411
Yes.

560
01:18:48,151 --> 01:18:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a saying, President bears.

561
01:18:50,512 --> 01:18:51,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President calls.

562
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:52,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

563
01:18:54,053 --> 01:18:57,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So seven here, seven in favor zero opposed motion passes.

564
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:02,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

565
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:16,903
[SPEAKER_04]: One other topic I know that I want to address this evening, maybe just as a starting point I know that the process we have and correct me if I'm wrong for appealing a ticket that the resident that would get the ticket would appeal in a certain amount of time.

566
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:20,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it would be ruled on.

567
01:19:20,809 --> 01:19:27,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if it's ruled not in their favor, then there's an option for them to go to the next level.

568
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:27,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

569
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:32,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would go to a state level where there's a higher fee.

570
01:19:33,683 --> 01:19:34,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that okay?

571
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:36,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, correct.

572
01:19:36,186 --> 01:19:43,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And generally, the fine that is implemented is significantly less than the court costs to take it to the next step.

573
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have yet, in my four months here, to see anybody go that route.

574
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:53,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate, personally, hate's a strong word.

575
01:19:54,568 --> 01:19:57,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't love having to tell them that that's their only recourse.

576
01:19:58,991 --> 01:20:01,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm happy to discuss this issue.

577
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:03,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to have some time to prepare and show what we have.

578
01:20:03,914 --> 01:20:04,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we do that?

579
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:07,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I can give you a quick rundown or answer your questions.

580
01:20:07,817 --> 01:20:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I think it'll be maybe just a discussion with the two of us.

581
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:21,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that because the, just so you know, and FDA, so the conversation I've been getting from residents is they feel like it's a trap that

582
01:20:22,521 --> 01:20:31,073
[SPEAKER_04]: There really isn't anybody listening when it comes time to appeal a ticket that, um, if they peel a ticket at noon at 1215, they're getting denied right away.

583
01:20:31,553 --> 01:20:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like, you know, not knowing who's doing the appeals process and stuff like that.

584
01:20:35,779 --> 01:20:39,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's, it's something that that's, I'm getting a lot of phone calls with that saying.

585
01:20:40,305 --> 01:20:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a ticket.

586
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why the reasoning when you know, is it true what they said?

587
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:46,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

588
01:20:46,169 --> 01:20:52,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you hear some of them do have a very quick turnaround, because it's obvious that the citation is valid.

589
01:20:52,954 --> 01:20:57,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And many cases, the person is pleading for sympathy.

590
01:20:57,217 --> 01:21:00,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I or I was just here one time.

591
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,660
[SPEAKER_07]: How come I don't get a warning?

592
01:21:02,082 --> 01:21:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: that kind of that kind of thing, which is not if we will review the citation, it doesn't take a very long time.

593
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:24,378
[SPEAKER_07]: We can make sure the plate is entered correctly, that the location is correct and that verify that it is a valid citation in a very quick manner, which then takes that off of the clerk's plates, which to answer another question, the parking clerks are responsible for the electronic appeals.

594
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:28,601
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody files an appeal in person or mails one in, then it goes to my desk.

595
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:30,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So we divide that duty.

596
01:21:31,544 --> 01:21:35,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Among the, I think it's, there are two of the clerks they handle it one of them.

597
01:21:35,487 --> 01:21:48,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Our part time clerk generally stays out of the appeals, so it's the two full time clerks and myself who make the decisions based on the evidence provided by the citizen, and I will say, Councilors barbelly very often.

598
01:21:49,656 --> 01:22:01,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in the four months I've been here, we get an appeal whether it's electronic or in person, and there's no evidence provided like let's say for example that I paid my meter, and I still got a ticket.

599
01:22:01,952 --> 01:22:07,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I file my appeal there's no attachment to show the receipt, and then we'll deny the appeal.

600
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:13,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they'll say, hey, well, here's my receipt, which should have gone on in the first place.

601
01:22:13,864 --> 01:22:14,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will honor that.

602
01:22:14,945 --> 01:22:15,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I will.

603
01:22:16,746 --> 01:22:18,888
[SPEAKER_07]: If I see that come in, OK.

604
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:20,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But next time, please provide this.

605
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:31,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there have been some issues with GTECNA that I have identified and resolved regarding uploads to the appeals.

606
01:22:31,177 --> 01:22:35,120
[SPEAKER_07]: If you upload an electronic

607
01:22:36,659 --> 01:23:03,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Image it usually shows you what you've uploaded in text, you know dot pdf As as it were as it were but that text was coming up white So people couldn't see if their attachment was there we've since fixed that I've gotten complaints in my time here about the website listed on the back of the ticket itself not working for everybody So I just reordered a whole new batch of paper with an updated website to make that process easier so I just

608
01:23:04,763 --> 01:23:09,044
[SPEAKER_07]: If there are issues that are legitimate, we will address them.

609
01:23:09,825 --> 01:23:17,067
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as I can tell the way we're processing the appeals is by the letter of the law for mass general law we get them.

610
01:23:17,627 --> 01:23:19,608
[SPEAKER_07]: We process them within 10 days we get them.

611
01:23:20,468 --> 01:23:23,669
[SPEAKER_07]: We give them 21 days, we accept up till that 21st day.

612
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:35,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Any and then even some I have overturned even after denial once evidence is presented, specifically because I knew there was an issue with uploading electronic documents.

613
01:23:35,563 --> 01:23:39,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I have no problem maintaining that.

614
01:23:40,617 --> 01:23:46,262
[SPEAKER_07]: policy of reviewing data after the fact, if it's a legitimate appeal.

615
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:50,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can, obviously I've asked for this months ago, it wasn't on the agenda.

616
01:23:50,466 --> 01:23:59,175
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, maybe I'll set something up for a 15 minute phone call or 10 minute phone call, just to touch base so I can give you specifics so you can understand what I'm saying.

617
01:23:59,555 --> 01:23:59,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

618
01:23:59,895 --> 01:24:04,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if I need more time to look into something after that call, by all means, I'm happy to do that.

619
01:24:04,179 --> 01:24:04,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

620
01:24:07,431 --> 01:24:08,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

621
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:11,473
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to President Behrs and then we'll circle back to our final two motions.

622
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:15,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Chair Collins.

623
01:24:16,194 --> 01:24:18,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to apologize to Councilor Scarpelli.

624
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:20,196
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my omission of putting this on the agenda.

625
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:26,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think a paper did go up at some point to the mayor's office that included the information.

626
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:29,459
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's on the agenda.

627
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:29,959
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on me.

628
01:24:30,019 --> 01:24:32,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it went up with records whenever you made that.

629
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:35,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

630
01:24:35,942 --> 01:24:36,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Behrs.

631
01:24:39,354 --> 01:24:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no further comments or hands on zoom.

632
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:46,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a couple other motions to vote through.

633
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:57,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So the second one is the request for more info and communications on G zone parking program from the parking director and city administration, Mr. Clark whenever you're ready please call the role.

634
01:25:05,987 --> 01:25:06,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazaro?

635
01:25:07,188 --> 01:25:07,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

636
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:08,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming?

637
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:08,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

638
01:25:09,489 --> 01:25:10,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

639
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:10,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

640
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:11,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Seng?

641
01:25:11,671 --> 01:25:11,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

642
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: President Behrs?

643
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:12,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

644
01:25:13,652 --> 01:25:14,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins?

645
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:15,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

646
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:17,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in favor, zero opposed.

647
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:18,395
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

648
01:25:18,915 --> 01:25:24,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the final motion to report out of committee, the ordinance repeal that we just discussed.

649
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:26,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever you're ready.

650
01:25:28,481 --> 01:25:29,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan?

651
01:25:29,802 --> 01:25:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

652
01:25:31,323 --> 01:25:32,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazaro?

653
01:25:32,504 --> 01:25:32,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

654
01:25:33,564 --> 01:25:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemming?

655
01:25:34,065 --> 01:25:34,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

656
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:38,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Seng, President Behrs, Vice President Collins.

657
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:43,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in favor, none opposed.

658
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:45,036
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

659
01:25:46,077 --> 01:25:47,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for, yep, go ahead.

660
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:50,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

661
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:51,499
[SPEAKER_09]: A procedural question.

662
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:57,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume that now that the repeal has been reported at a committee, it would go on the

663
01:25:58,579 --> 01:26:14,366
[SPEAKER_09]: April 29th meeting and considering the limited questions and concerns, is it fair to assume that probably representation wouldn't be required at that meeting or just trying to get a feel from the council?

664
01:26:14,526 --> 01:26:15,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's probably fair.

665
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:19,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to speak for other counselors.

666
01:26:19,948 --> 01:26:22,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I doubt that I will have further questions on the topic.

667
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:25,950
[SPEAKER_08]: If I do, I'll try to email them ahead of time and encourage other counselors to do so.

668
01:26:28,222 --> 01:26:29,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the best I got.

669
01:26:30,043 --> 01:26:30,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

670
01:26:30,604 --> 01:26:31,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

671
01:26:31,184 --> 01:26:31,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

672
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:32,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

673
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:33,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

674
01:26:33,226 --> 01:26:37,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for your presence with us for this multi-topic committee of the whole.

675
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate your time and all your hard work.

676
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:43,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

677
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:51,100
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by Councilor Singh to adjourn, seconded by President Behrs.

678
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:52,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.
