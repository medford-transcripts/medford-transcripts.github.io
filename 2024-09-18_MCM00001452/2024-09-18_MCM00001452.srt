1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: the public meeting of the city of medford liquor license commission for 9 18 2024 will come to order uh we have an agenda to follow and the first thing on the agenda is to review the minutes of the august 21st 2024 license commission meeting um

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I reviewed these myself is a couple of things.

3
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:42,351
[SPEAKER_07]: My number five carried over to this month's meeting.

4
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:46,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a note that was that one day application for deep cuts, correct?

5
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:48,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

6
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:50,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be reviewing that today.

7
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:50,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

8
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:59,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other question I had, I know there was a question whether we've received payment or not yet from Lifetime Gym.

9
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We did, yep.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We did, okay.

11
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

12
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, that looked good.

13
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:11,643
[SPEAKER_07]: My fellow commissioners, if you had a chance to review them, I'll also look to you guys.

14
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:19,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, I did number two regarding Blue Fuji.

15
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure if that was what we, it says the commission will have the liquor license on probation for one year.

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the language we used or did we say something to the effect that if there was another infraction within 12 years, within 12 months?

17
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:49,422
[SPEAKER_02]: No, from what I remember, we were doing a probation for all of them, from what I understood.

18
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, is that correct?

19
00:01:53,691 --> 00:02:01,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So from what I understood, we were doing probation for all of them for a year after the incidents, right?

20
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:01,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

21
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:07,400
[SPEAKER_07]: We followed the same penalty for it.

22
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:17,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we also added in a one-day suspension and abidance.

23
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:19,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

24
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:23,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they didn't show when they were supposed to.

25
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:35,873
[SPEAKER_07]: We can probably correct that and put that in there because that was just one level above what the other ones were.

26
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,293
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good catch, Alan.

27
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:37,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

28
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew there was something more to that.

29
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:44,255
[SPEAKER_05]: When I read that, it just didn't look complete.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

31
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:54,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've arranged just for information, we've arranged a meeting with Blue Fuji.

32
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:59,414
[SPEAKER_07]: We're still trying to finalize the date.

33
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:05,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wasn't convinced that they understood everything we had to say.

34
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:10,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there was a language barrier there for me last month.

35
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:13,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we just want to

36
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: get together with them with a translator so that we could let them know exactly what we were trying to tell them last month and have them acknowledge that they know what we said and they'll be able to comply, especially with the TIP certification and all that stuff.

37
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:41,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in the works and it's nothing we need a public meeting for.

38
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:46,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an interpretation because we've already made the decision.

39
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:52,150
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone through all of it.

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,150
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just we want to make sure they understand it.

41
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be anything new other than what we discussed at the meeting.

42
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's that's really about it that I have with the.

43
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Last month's meeting minutes, Ben, how about yourself?

44
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,131
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not at the last month's meeting.

45
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:12,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

46
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:13,998
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

47
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:14,499
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

48
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is good information for you.

49
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just re-read it all.

50
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:25,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that little tweak, I'm fine with the minutes.

51
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:33,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd motion to accept the minutes for the August 21st meeting and put them on public record.

52
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:35,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

53
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:37,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a second?

54
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll second it.

55
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:45,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

56
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're right there.

57
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second it.

58
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:50,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second it.

59
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,207
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

60
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

61
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

62
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,729
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

63
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none.

64
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,590
[SPEAKER_07]: The ayes have it.

65
00:04:58,851 --> 00:04:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passed.

66
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

67
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we get right down to business.

68
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,394
[SPEAKER_08]: We have

69
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:13,277
[SPEAKER_08]: On the agenda, Representative from Great American Bayhoe.

70
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:19,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have Brian or someone here?

71
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:27,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Bobby, I don't see Brian, but I did email him.

72
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:28,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Which Brian?

73
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:31,089
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not you, Brian.

74
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:38,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do we have a representative from Great American Beer Hall on the call?

75
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you said that he would be here, so I don't know.

76
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll just push him back, that's all.

77
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can do that.

78
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:53,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just shuffle my papers around a little bit.

79
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:55,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

80
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:57,335
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

81
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we want the other Brian from Event Dem.

82
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:02,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're out here, Brian.

83
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:05,493
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

84
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:06,333
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Brian?

85
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, crazy.

86
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: September is crazy.

87
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:10,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Good crazy.

88
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:11,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.

89
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:14,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

90
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about what's going on.

91
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:16,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

92
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's essentially it's a copy and paste of another one of our gaming nights that we've done here.

93
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:28,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game focused, but we do other board games and other things.

94
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:30,958
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's focused around NBA,

95
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,457
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA 2K, I think is what it's called.

96
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:41,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's a video game, Ming Night tournament, copy and paste of the other ones we've done before.

97
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

98
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:51,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, Brian, you always do a great job, never have any issues there.

99
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,793
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know all of your documents are in order, everything's good.

100
00:06:57,214 --> 00:07:02,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to mention to you, I'm not sure whether you're aware of it or not, but we do have a,

101
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,459
[SPEAKER_07]: a new online form for one day licenses.

102
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you can, it's easy to fill out online, sends right to Daria.

103
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:16,164
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, there's a couple of new questions on it about entertainment and things like that.

104
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:18,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can get on board with that, that'd be great.

105
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:19,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That's grand.

106
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:20,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

107
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:21,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

108
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,148
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be just trying to streamline a few things.

109
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:28,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but other than that, it all looked good for me.

110
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Alan, Ben,

111
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:36,983
[SPEAKER_15]: look good to me it's same as usual you guys yeah so i'm fine.

112
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I agree, Ben.

113
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:41,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Very straightforward.

114
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:49,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to remind Brian that we do have a maximum of 30 one-day licenses.

115
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So just keep that in mind.

116
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:57,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you're there, but you might be halfway there by now, I would think.

117
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that from January to December?

118
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,719
[SPEAKER_04]: The calendar year, yes.

119
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't anticipate us.

120
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Kidding it, but I mean, I do have an, I do have a counter on some.

121
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

122
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:14,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you do a fine job.

123
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's complete.

124
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have your insurance.

125
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We have your.

126
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the design, um.

127
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:21,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the layout.

128
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,455
[SPEAKER_05]: of the building, so I'm good with this.

129
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben, if you don't mind me jumping in, I'll motion to approve the one-day license for Friday, October 4th for Event Dam Incorporated.

130
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:44,327
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that motion, Commissioner.

131
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:46,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good with it.

132
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:47,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

133
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

134
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,690
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:53,971
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

139
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, motion passes.

140
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:03,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Jeff, Steve Cutts, you here?

141
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how are you?

142
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:08,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there we go.

143
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:10,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.

144
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:14,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay, Jeff, um, tell us a little bit about what's going on.

145
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:24,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we've been asked by the, uh, planning department to provide, uh, food and beer for the, uh, harvest your energy festival.

146
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our, our application for, for setting that up.

147
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:31,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

148
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:39,291
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, with that, there's, do you have a, let's think, I'm sorry, I'm a little, um,

149
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:55,011
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're looking for that I didn't see was the insurance binder, the drawing, and the festival location, and if there's going to be entertainment there or not.

150
00:09:58,194 --> 00:09:58,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

151
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, Jeff did forward it to me yesterday.

152
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't had the chance to send it to you guys yet.

153
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,841
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the picture on insurance.

154
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:09,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, awesome.

155
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:10,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to have all of it.

156
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't waste any time on it.

157
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:17,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff, from what I reviewed, everything looks fine.

158
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Daria has that, so I'm good with that.

159
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:22,879
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows what we need.

160
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,760
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you, Al and Ben?

161
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this the same as last year?

162
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:31,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you might have had it behind McGlynn or something.

163
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's where this one is.

164
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,349
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so that's it's the same location.

165
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:44,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess they're kind of like using this to kind of like celebrate the you know, the new like park and stuff that they did back there too.

166
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:47,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, trying to roll all that in together.

167
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, no, that's good.

168
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:49,935
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

169
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:51,696
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, I don't have any questions then.

170
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,397
[SPEAKER_15]: That was that sounded like, you know, a good event.

171
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:59,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty, you know, mild, safe event and didn't no concerns on my end.

172
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:03,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm, I'm fine with this.

173
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:04,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a reoccurring events.

174
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:05,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.

175
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:07,585
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

176
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:15,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you guys are good, if one of these would like to make a motion, Alan, would you like to show up?

177
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

178
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:25,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I motion to accept the one day license, uh, the deep cuts for the event taking place behind the McGlynn school.

179
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:29,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you say the date?

180
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:30,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh,

[SPEAKER_05]: Throw in the date.

00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:35,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Dario, put in the date.

00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:41,562
[SPEAKER_05]: 19th?

186
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_05]: We'll add the date, October 19th in there.

188
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:54,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:56,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

196
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

197
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_07]: You're all set.

199
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to go.

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, everybody.

202
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,800
[SPEAKER_06]: No rain.

203
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,600
[SPEAKER_06]: No rain.

204
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck, John.

205
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:10,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

206
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:10,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

207
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:11,982
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

208
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Next item on the agenda.

209
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:18,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Queen of Peace Parish.

210
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:24,585
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking for Emily Jones and maybe Elaine Rapucci.

211
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Speed dating with alcohol, you know.

212
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for Mary Queen's Parish.

213
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:38,445
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds a little funky.

214
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, my microphone was muted.

215
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:43,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

216
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:44,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me okay?

217
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:46,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I can now.

218
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:46,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

219
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:47,646
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

220
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:48,406
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

221
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, I'm here.

222
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:58,629
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to speak for both of them because the girl that is running the speed dating is a teacher and so she can't step away from her class right now.

223
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So I told her last night that I would do it for her.

224
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,471
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, that's fine.

225
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, tell us a little bit about what's going on.

226
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's in two separate locations.

227
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:08,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

228
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,133
[SPEAKER_07]: St.

229
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:10,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul and St.

230
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis kind of like share the parishes or

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so Mary Queen of Peace is both parishes, so St.

232
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:20,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis and St.

233
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:25,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph together under one nonprofit ID number and everything.

234
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,107
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I'll actually start with the fall festival.

235
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:33,769
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's on the 28th, September 28th, following 4 p.m.

236
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:34,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass.

237
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,230
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to be starting around 5.

238
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:40,173
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the same event that we've done for a very long time.

239
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:47,938
[SPEAKER_13]: But this year we wanted to add a small bar with some donated beer, wine.

240
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:53,081
[SPEAKER_13]: We had some, I think Tito's donated some vodka.

241
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:59,886
[SPEAKER_13]: So we wanted to have a little bar with just light drinks for the adults in the room because it is very kid friendly.

242
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:06,550
[SPEAKER_13]: There's activities upstairs in the gym, but downstairs a lot of the adults congregate together and spend time.

243
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,091
[SPEAKER_13]: So we wanted to do something nice for them.

244
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:16,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the bar will be located near the food, which will be in the cafeteria, which is downstairs.

245
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,503
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys have been in that space before, but there's like a kitchen in the back.

246
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,944
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the food will be right in front of there.

247
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the bar will be next to the food.

248
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:28,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's pretty much it.

249
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:31,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any other questions or things you're wondering about that event?

250
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a couple.

251
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:47,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a insurance binder for the evidence of insurance for young adults, group speed dating event.

252
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:52,539
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one at High Street.

253
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see one for the San Francisco location.

254
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

255
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have her, she has it.

256
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I might have forgotten to forward it to Daria, so let me do that today.

257
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:10,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and the other thing is I don't see any sketches.

258
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:14,889
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that, you know, we require, but... Did I not forward that to you, Daria?

259
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:15,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry if I didn't.

260
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,711
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought I did.

261
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:17,751
[SPEAKER_13]: My apologies.

262
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:22,375
[SPEAKER_15]: You did reference you have a sketch, so... Yeah, I know she did.

263
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:27,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I think because she gave it to me like two months ago, I may have forgotten to forward it to Daria.

264
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,602
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will forward you the sketch, yes.

265
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

266
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:33,703
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.

267
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, also, we're still talking about the Fellsway, right?

268
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:43,348
[SPEAKER_07]: St.

269
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:43,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis?

270
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:49,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So, fall festival is going to be on High Street at the St.

271
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:51,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph area.

272
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:51,952
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be 114, I think.

273
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,438
[SPEAKER_08]: 921, I thought.

274
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,361
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 928 isn't the festival of 28?

275
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:02,603
[SPEAKER_05]: The fall festival of 28?

276
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fall festival, yeah.

277
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:05,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about the address, 114.

278
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:05,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

279
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's 114 High Street.

280
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other question I had on that application with the hours of the event, you put down three, but the actual hours from what time to what time is what we- Are you looking at the fall festival one?

281
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I put down five to 10, I'm almost positive.

282
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at the-

283
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,050
[SPEAKER_07]: other one, I believe.

284
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the fall festival, you do have five to 10.

285
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:38,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

286
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:39,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

287
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,474
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't, I mean, I can't imagine it will go till 10.

288
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:51,618
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, I just put, you know, five to 10, just in case, typically, it usually runs between three to four hours is the typical runtime for our events.

289
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

290
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So the speed dating, what time is that starting?

291
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:02,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but me, um, whatever she put on the application, I'm sure is correct.

292
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:03,921
[SPEAKER_13]: So she didn't.

293
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody will have three, but I don't think it has an end time.

294
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:08,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

295
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:13,104
[SPEAKER_13]: He said that check-in is from five 30 to six.

296
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

297
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's three hours from six o'clock.

298
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:20,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

299
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:21,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

300
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:24,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So six to nine, basically five 30 to nine.

301
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:27,325
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

302
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:33,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the one that will be at the parish center at St.

303
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:34,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis?

304
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:35,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

305
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:36,854
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

306
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,636
[SPEAKER_13]: And it'll be in the cafeteria.

307
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And she forwarded a sketch.

308
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure you receive that, Daria.

309
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually don't have sketch this one.

310
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the liability as well as the certificate of exemption, but I don't have the sketch.

311
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so I have it, so I'll send it to you.

312
00:17:59,233 --> 00:17:59,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

313
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:02,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

314
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:04,518
[SPEAKER_13]: So speed dating sketch.

315
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then just to read you the other information from this event.

316
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,421
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have it, um, it'll just be canned drinks.

317
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're not like making anything.

318
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:21,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they're serving them an hour after the speed dating for people that just want to spend time and they're limiting participants to two drinks.

319
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:24,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're giving them two tickets when they get in.

320
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:29,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then they're checking IDs at the door and everyone should be checked in by six o'clock.

321
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and okay, I understand both of them.

322
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: My fellow commissioners, any questions on both?

323
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:53,031
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm good with both, but if, so we need two, one sketch and two liability or two sketches and one liability?

324
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,111
[SPEAKER_13]: And one liability.

325
00:18:54,151 --> 00:19:01,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you just double confirm with me that the insurance that you have on hand is for the speed dating?

326
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:05,049
[SPEAKER_13]: The date on beads 921.

327
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:06,250
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to double check.

328
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for 114 high street and it is.

329
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, at least to your date.

330
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:17,516
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's probably mine.

331
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:20,037
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably for the 28th.

332
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:21,418
[SPEAKER_13]: That's probably for the fall festival.

333
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:30,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I can double check with Laura at the church and just tell her to send me both and I'll just send you both.

334
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:38,230
[SPEAKER_13]: That way you have everything and then I'll send you both sketches, both insurances in one year.

335
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like you need both sketches and we'll have one insurance for a dating event, but not for the fall festival.

336
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's two sketches and one liability for 9-28.

337
00:19:54,112 --> 00:20:00,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this liability does say group speed dating event, so it's for that one.

338
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:01,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

339
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:06,541
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll send all that in one email just to make sure I got it all to you.

340
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:07,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

341
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:09,883
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ben, are you okay with this?

342
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:10,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm good.

343
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:11,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

344
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:12,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

345
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:22,612
[SPEAKER_07]: If one of you guys want to make a motion, we can either accept the both of them at once, or if you want to do it separate, that's up to you, whatever's easiest.

346
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I can just make sure.

347
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner, I can make 2 motions motions here.

348
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:31,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

349
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:32,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

350
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:39,840
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the 1st, 1 is I'll make a motion to accept the 1 day license for the September 21st.

355
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:08,721

361
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:38,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Located at St Joseph's on high street.

362
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:54,522
[SPEAKER_15]: as proposed here by Elaine, subject to us receiving the one-day license insurance and a sketch of the event.

00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:13,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Rappucci.

00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:17,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get those documents over as soon as Davria receives them.

375
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:19,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Fabulous.

376
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:19,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

377
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:20,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:22,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much.

[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great day.

381
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

382
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

383
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:34,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do we have a representative here from Tufts?

384
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:38,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see Eric.

385
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,025
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Eric, yeah.

386
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:42,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Eric.

387
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:49,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric Hamel, associate director of catering at Tufts University, along with Tamara Kenny, will be our manager of record.

388
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:56,818
[SPEAKER_03]: On behalf of the trustees of Tufts College, we're seeking two one-day licenses in October.

389
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,540
[SPEAKER_03]: First date is October 5th.

390
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:05,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It's titled University Senior Oktoberfest Events.

391
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:10,758
[SPEAKER_03]: We are scheduled to service an event from 4 to 7 p.m.

392
00:23:10,918 --> 00:23:19,961
[SPEAKER_03]: on the 5th, right in the middle of the campus, outside event in a fenced-in area exclusively for seniors.

393
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:24,043
[SPEAKER_03]: TUPD will be running, Tufts University Police will be running our security.

394
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:27,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sausage Guy will be providing food for this event.

395
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:32,974
[SPEAKER_03]: We are running a beer and wine bar with an Oktoberfest theme.

396
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We held this event last year.

397
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first of this, our second annual event.

398
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:38,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It went okay.

399
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:46,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we scheduled for 700 guests, students, and we only got about probably 400, so we lowered our bartender amounts here.

400
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,963
[SPEAKER_03]: All the bartenders will be ServSafe and TIPS certified, and we'll have a management onsite as well.

401
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:56,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

402
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,899
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's great.

403
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also are doing another event too, correct?

404
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:07,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

405
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:12,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the second event is scheduled for October 13th.

406
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to update the address.

407
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave you the wrong address.

408
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Location is going to be at our Joyce Cummings Center.

409
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:23,195
[SPEAKER_03]: which is located at 177 College Avenue.

410
00:24:23,736 --> 00:24:24,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a wedding.

411
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:31,841
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our staff members here, one of our directors of our music center, Jeff Rawich, and his fiancee.

412
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:35,423
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wedding scheduled from 6 to 9.30 PM.

413
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:36,984
[SPEAKER_03]: We expect 200 guests.

414
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:42,547
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be a full bar application that we're looking for.

415
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:44,848
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I share here?

416
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:47,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have, it's gonna be on Sunday night.

417
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: of October of Columbus Day weekend.

418
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:55,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So we expect very, we don't expect too many students to be on campus.

419
00:24:56,825 --> 00:25:00,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be happening in the atrium of the Joyce Cummings Center.

420
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:04,642
[SPEAKER_03]: one-hour cocktail party, and then they move into dinner.

421
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've submitted those diagrams.

422
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:10,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know if you need those blown up or any kind of square footage.

423
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:14,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed that information is not on the diagram.

424
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:18,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we'll have Tufts University Police will be our security for the event.

425
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:28,950
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have upwards to four bartenders working this event, and Tufts Catering is servicing all the food for the buffets, the reception, desserts.

426
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:39,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I had noticed on the sketch that you did a pretty nice job with it.

427
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:49,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did notice the, when you said the Cummings Center, that it was probably the one on College Ave, but glad you brought it back to our attention.

428
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:55,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a kid's drink station, but I don't see,

429
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Adult rank station, I guess.

430
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:03,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming by number 180, is that the table where it's going to be?

431
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:07,091
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, the bar is going to stay out on the atrium.

432
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that, there should be the atrium.

433
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have two diagrams for that.

434
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:13,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

435
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

436
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't read.

437
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:17,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

438
00:26:17,787 --> 00:26:18,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

439
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

440
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you referring to the wedding celebration or the October facade?

441
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:28,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one are you referring to?

442
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The wedding.

443
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:31,167
[SPEAKER_05]: The wedding.

444
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:31,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

445
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's 2 sketches there.

446
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,360
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 of them is just the atrium area.

447
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:53,305
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand now, it's going to be where the liquor is going to be served.

448
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:59,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other sketch is, I guess, inside now, where the wedding is actually going to be.

449
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:00,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, in the ballrooms.

450
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, 180, entertainment.

451
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:20,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there going to be entertainment at both or just 1?

452
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:24,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's DJ for both.

453
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:36,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just so you're aware, Daryl has got a new one day license online that you can just log on and we've changed a couple of questions in a minute.

454
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,380
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is asking for entertainment.

455
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,961
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only reason why I'm asking.

456
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:40,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

457
00:27:41,262 --> 00:27:45,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can just, if there's no entertainment, just NA or whatever.

458
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:46,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

459
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:52,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it just may streamline things a little bit.

460
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

461
00:27:55,315 --> 00:28:05,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to run that by you while Alan was looking over the plans there.

462
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:09,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Tufts, you always have your insurance on file and stuff with us, so you're good with that.

463
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,700
[SPEAKER_07]: We never have any issues with any events that you folks run.

464
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,541
[SPEAKER_07]: You do a real good job.

465
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:20,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I don't have a problem with it either.

466
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,958
[SPEAKER_07]: The 1 of my fellow commission is Alan.

467
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:23,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you had a chance to review it?

468
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I have I'm fine with both Ben.

469
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: How about yourself?

470
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to make a motion to.

471
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:34,722
[SPEAKER_15]: For each item yeah, please make the motion.

472
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:35,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no issues.

473
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:39,073
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's start with October 5th.

474
00:28:39,774 --> 00:29:02,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to approve the one-day license to be held on October 5th, Tufts University's senior Oktoberfest event, not to compete with the Medford Chamber Oktoberfest, to be held on October 5th between the hours of 4 to 7 p.m.

475
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:05,347
[SPEAKER_15]: I second that motion.

476
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:07,974
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

477
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

478
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,160
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

479
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:15,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, motion passes.

480
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:29,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then we have the one day license for October 13th, the wedding celebration for Tufts employee, which is very nice.

481
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a that Eric, that's a beautiful venue up there.

482
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,444
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cummins building brand new.

483
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to love that location for the hours of event at 6 to 930 PM.

484
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,029
[SPEAKER_05]: At Tufts University.

485
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sounds good.

486
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:48,825
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll second that.

487
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:50,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

488
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:52,008
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

489
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:53,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

490
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:53,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

491
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

492
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,611
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

493
00:29:57,072 --> 00:30:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, and the motion passes.

494
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:01,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

495
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:02,756
[SPEAKER_07]: You are well set.

496
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:03,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

497
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:04,618
[SPEAKER_03]: See you soon.

498
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck, Eric.

499
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:06,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

500
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, just one more one-day license for the chamber.

501
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:17,704
[SPEAKER_07]: For the chamber, that's correct.

502
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:21,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, hang on one second.

503
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Chamber, Tina Caruso, is Tina here?

504
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Tina, how are you?

505
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Good, how are you?

506
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:31,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, thank you.

507
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:35,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about what's going on, Tina?

508
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's an Oktoberfest and you can give us a little bit of information.

509
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:41,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

510
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:43,993
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been doing this for the past five years.

511
00:30:45,354 --> 00:31:08,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bunch of vendors from the city of Medford and a lot of nonprofits, a lot of for-profits, and we invite the rec, we invite the city, we invite food vendors, and also we have two bands playing.

512
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:17,372
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot of martial arts, dance schools, a lot of fun.

513
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:22,756
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the bands is a Hofstra band, so they play that wonderful German music.

514
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:25,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a beer garden, of course.

515
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:30,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, it's just a lot of fun.

516
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,925
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot of family entertainment.

517
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:40,919
[SPEAKER_14]: The fire station brings the smokehouse and people are just some people dress up and wear their, um,

518
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:47,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Liedenhosen and all of that fun stuff and just walk around and have a good time.

519
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:53,674
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a great time for the people to get together and see their neighbors and have conversations.

520
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:56,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, we get a lot of people.

521
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:58,197
[SPEAKER_14]: It started out as

522
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:01,059
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe a couple hundred here and there.

523
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:11,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really think it's grown to maybe a thousand or so passing through and coming from outside of Medford to see what's going on.

524
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:14,389
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a lot of good stuff.

525
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:20,054
[SPEAKER_14]: We've never had a problem and it's well contained, well maintained.

526
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:27,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were asking for a one day license and it's beer and wine.

527
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,579
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no hard alcohol.

528
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:31,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

529
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

530
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:34,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

531
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:39,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I went over it and the sketch as well.

532
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:43,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see the beer sales are going to be on River Street.

533
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that going to be the only station?

534
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there was a question, possibly two.

535
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:56,833
[SPEAKER_07]: But if that's the only one that I see, which is fine, it's very containable there.

536
00:32:57,773 --> 00:32:58,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

537
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:00,135
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is, it's only one.

538
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:01,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

539
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura, did that change?

540
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:11,502
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there is only one station, but since we have the two stages, we were having a flow.

541
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:16,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the entire enclosed area be for consumption.

542
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:18,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

543
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:22,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, everything looks good, Gary.

544
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:22,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that

545
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,803
[SPEAKER_08]: believe you have the insurance on file or is that something we need to get?

546
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:39,912
[SPEAKER_02]: For Chamber of Commerce, I think I would need one, just an updated one, and I know they're for a non-profit.

547
00:33:40,923 --> 00:33:59,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so if you can just get that over to Daria, we can, we'll see how Alan and Ben feel about this, and they can make a motion to grant the licenses contingent upon your insurance paper.

548
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's just quite, Tina, River Street, is it blocked off at both ends?

549
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:11,743
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is blocked off on the end of where Salem Street is so that the traffic cannot come down.

550
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:15,166
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

551
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:21,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And Riverside is blocked off where Metro and Citizens Bank are.

552
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:22,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

553
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other end near Harvard Vanguard.

554
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

555
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:27,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

556
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:29,874
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't have any questions.

557
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:31,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice event.

558
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:33,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope it doesn't rain October 5th.

559
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:37,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, not that I'm putting a crest on it or anything, but I'm good with it.

560
00:34:39,302 --> 00:34:40,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Quick questions.

561
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:43,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, does it have police support, police detail?

562
00:34:44,306 --> 00:34:45,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we do.

563
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:46,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we do.

564
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:47,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

565
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:48,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

566
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,210
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

567
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:55,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and then who is there a brewery doing the beer dispensing or.

568
00:34:56,897 --> 00:35:02,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford Brewing is doing this dispensing last year with their first year, and they did a great job.

569
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,224
[SPEAKER_15]: They seem to do a great job, so that's good to hear.

570
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:08,806
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have no other questions, then.

571
00:35:08,826 --> 00:35:10,747
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that sounds like a good event.

572
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:17,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I can make a motion, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.

573
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

574
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:19,974
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

575
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:28,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, so I'll make a motion to accept the one day license for October 5th, 24.

576
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:33,554
[SPEAKER_15]: This is for the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

577
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:43,738
[SPEAKER_15]: This is for the community event, the October Fest, with a rain date of 10-6, if Alan jinxed us.

578
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:53,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Hours of event, noon to six, and no further questions.

579
00:35:53,700 --> 00:36:00,845
[SPEAKER_15]: The event is as advertised as well as the plan that they've submitted to us.

580
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

581
00:36:04,888 --> 00:36:05,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I second the motion.

582
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

583
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,231
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

584
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

585
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:09,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

586
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,093
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

587
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:13,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

588
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion is passed.

589
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Tina, is this five years, three years?

590
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:20,105
[SPEAKER_05]: How many years is this?

591
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say this is our fifth or sixth year.

592
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:24,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

593
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

594
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was getting up there.

595
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:27,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

596
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

597
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:29,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck with it.

598
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:30,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Best of luck.

599
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Laura works her butt off, huh, Laura?

600
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,079
[SPEAKER_14]: We thank you guys all for your help.

601
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:36,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

602
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds good.

603
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, guys.

604
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:39,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job, ladies.

605
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:42,291
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go.

606
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to go this year.

607
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:46,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sounds fine.

608
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:48,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I do see.

609
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, are you there?

610
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:54,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here, can you hear me?

611
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:55,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can.

612
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:57,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I can.

613
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,019
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking for you earlier.

614
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,340
[SPEAKER_07]: We had you at the top of the list.

615
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,500
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

616
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I was honestly trapped in an elevator.

617
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Everett fired to get there and get me out.

618
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:10,962
[SPEAKER_10]: It was brutal.

619
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:12,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

620
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:14,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that real, Brian?

621
00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:17,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like my dog ate my homework?

622
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,211
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I wish.

623
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: It was brutal.

624
00:37:19,893 --> 00:37:22,255
[SPEAKER_10]: It was about 48 minutes.

625
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't funny.

626
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:29,241
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably one of the best excuses we've heard yet.

627
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad Daria's recording this.

628
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

629
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I can have him give me a call.

630
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I got connections over there.

631
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:39,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:40,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

633
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:45,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, basically tell us a little bit about what's been happening.

634
00:37:45,641 --> 00:38:00,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, you know, where you're at, you know, as far as the partial goes, and what stages you're at, as well as, you know, we'll talk about that first, and then we can talk about the entertainment license on a separate thing.

635
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:06,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, yeah, so as far as the partial goes, the street work is almost wrapped up for DOT.

636
00:38:08,248 --> 00:38:10,129
[SPEAKER_10]: But that really has not much to do with the building.

637
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,910
[SPEAKER_10]: The building is the elevator.

638
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,392
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're waiting for the elevator inspection by the state.

639
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:21,314
[SPEAKER_10]: We have paid the 2,500 to have it expedited, but I still don't have a date.

640
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:26,636
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as that happens, I will have final sign off from the commissioner.

641
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:30,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to think it's going to be the end of this month.

642
00:38:30,277 --> 00:38:32,378
[SPEAKER_10]: September 28th has been our goal the entire time.

643
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:37,034
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to hit that, I'd say 75% yes, 25% no.

644
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,757
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, then it's the week after that.

645
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:45,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know we're really, really close to getting the building all wrapped up as well as the street work.

646
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:49,425
[SPEAKER_10]: How it's been going, it's been great.

647
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:51,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the turnout from the city has been excellent.

648
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:53,969
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting bombarded with private requests.

649
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:55,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had wedding requests.

650
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:59,673
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had all sorts of people requesting just to have their Christmas parties there, weddings there.

651
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:02,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Really exciting, really fun to see.

652
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:06,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the smartest thing we did was get the private security company, Commonwealth Security.

653
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,850
[SPEAKER_10]: They check everyone at the door.

654
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,811
[SPEAKER_10]: So everyone's ID is checked.

655
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:14,052
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have a wristband or a stamp to get in to drink in there.

656
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:18,413
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been really nice seeing the turnout.

657
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:36,579
[SPEAKER_07]: That statement is 100% true because last night I was out with my daughter and the first time I drove by the place that I could find a parking space in there and we decided to go in for a refreshment and something to eat.

658
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,503
[SPEAKER_07]: The security asked me for an ID and I asked them back, do you need glasses, buddy?

659
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:47,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, no, our policy.

660
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sir.

661
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:50,908
[SPEAKER_07]: They show my ID, stamp my hand.

662
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:54,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tell you, I was very, very impressed by that, which was great.

663
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

664
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

665
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:55,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

666
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:56,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

667
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, everything was good.

668
00:39:58,512 --> 00:39:59,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm sorry.

669
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:00,854
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to interrupt you.

670
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:02,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just when you brought it up, I wanted to.

671
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:03,908
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

672
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

673
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:04,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

674
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

675
00:40:05,429 --> 00:40:05,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

676
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,850
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the smartest thing we did and they've been excellent.

677
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:10,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we really, it's really been happy crowds, a lot of families.

678
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:16,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so it will be nice to get the second floor open cause we are going to be 21 plus up there.

679
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:21,038
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just nice to kind of have adults enjoy a section and get away from the kids.

680
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:47,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Right right and now is that um something that's going to be in the near future or is it just the elevator because i noticed that you had an upstairs patio as well so everything everything else is ready to go the siding is all there i didn't want to put that up and have anyone go up there to think it's going to be okay to go up there as the building commissioner was like if there's anyone up here we're shutting you down so

681
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:55,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Until we get that elevator inspection sign off the 1 kind of unknown of the rest of this is that's when the other stuff is very easy.

682
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:56,849
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the stairs report.

683
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:58,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything else is really, really quick and easy.

684
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,835
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the 1 thing that I'm waiting on.

685
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:02,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

686
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:11,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, as we've told you before in the past, that if things progress, we would appreciate this coming monthly.

687
00:41:11,796 --> 00:41:12,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

688
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:13,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

689
00:41:13,477 --> 00:41:13,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

690
00:41:14,258 --> 00:41:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

691
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:23,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that way there, once we get to the final thing, full occupancy, we don't have to see it for another year.

692
00:41:24,244 --> 00:41:24,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

693
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:25,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

694
00:41:25,124 --> 00:41:25,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

695
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:25,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

696
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:26,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

697
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:36,421
[SPEAKER_07]: The okay, great that is all I wanted to touch base with you on you.

698
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:40,923
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys said the other commission is you have any questions for Brian at this point?

699
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,660
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I'm good.

700
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad it's progressing.

701
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:48,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear nothing but great stuff, Brian, about the place.

702
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:49,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

703
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:51,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised.

704
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:56,888
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice venue, so I'm not surprised that you're getting all sorts of fun requests.

705
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:57,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very good.

706
00:41:58,209 --> 00:41:58,789
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been awesome.

707
00:41:58,909 --> 00:41:59,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

708
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

709
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,332
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything the three of you wanted in the city.

710
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:03,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes.

711
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So, is it safe to say that we're in the stretch?

712
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:09,976
[SPEAKER_05]: You anticipate the elevated pass and inspection?

713
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

714
00:42:11,037 --> 00:42:14,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The next 10 days or 60 days?

715
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:14,659
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 days.

716
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:19,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can't imagine I'd be here at the end of October saying we're still in the same spot, but no, I do.

717
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:24,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I'm really hopeful for September 28th, but if it's not then, it's the weekend.

718
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:25,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the week after.

719
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:25,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

720
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:28,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all ready to go.

721
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,350
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just waiting for an inspector to inspect it.

722
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:33,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

723
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:33,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

724
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:34,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

725
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:35,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

726
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:35,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

727
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:35,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

728
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:36,873
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

729
00:42:37,393 --> 00:42:37,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, great.

730
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:38,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm I'm good.

731
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

732
00:42:39,114 --> 00:42:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the update.

733
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:40,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming.

734
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:40,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

735
00:42:41,014 --> 00:42:41,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

736
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:41,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

737
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben?

738
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,121
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the update sounds great to me.

739
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

740
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:51,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear nothing but good things about it as well, especially about the security.

741
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:54,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

742
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:57,824
[SPEAKER_15]: People mentioned that, and that sounds really good that you did that.

743
00:42:57,924 --> 00:42:59,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

744
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:00,425
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

745
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:05,407
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Mr. Commissioner, so it's just the entertainment license part here.

746
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this going to sort of cover things that are

747
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:20,698
[SPEAKER_15]: This will cover things that are yet to still be opened at the place, which Brian is just telling us about, which is like the second floor patio, etc., right?

748
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

749
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:31,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would imagine the entertainment, it's pretty much what you listed here, and that's pretty much what I saw.

750
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:40,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when I was in there last night, but obviously there were no stages and no performances or anything.

751
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:50,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Brian, if you could tell us a little bit about what you plan on doing with the performers, the patrons and the devices.

752
00:43:50,414 --> 00:43:51,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

753
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:57,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So Friday nights, we're looking at a DJ from 8 to 11.

754
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:04,664
[SPEAKER_10]: On Saturdays, we're looking at live music bands from 9 to 12 or 8 to 11.

755
00:44:05,985 --> 00:44:12,671
[SPEAKER_10]: During the day, we were actually thinking about more of like an acoustic during the day, but it's just we need the room.

756
00:44:12,811 --> 00:44:14,732
[SPEAKER_10]: It gets filled in there pretty quickly.

757
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:19,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's really what we're doing.

758
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:23,990
[SPEAKER_10]: We're showing the TVs, those two big screen TVs, Patriots games.

759
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,891
[SPEAKER_10]: We put the noise on for that.

760
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:27,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything else is just background music.

761
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:29,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

762
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:38,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, um, the performers and stuff like that, that's all going to be contained indoors, correct?

763
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:39,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

764
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:39,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Indoors.

765
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:40,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

766
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:40,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

767
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:47,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you said outside, I think just maybe some acoustical, uh, entertainment or whatever.

768
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we were, we were thinking about, I don't think we're going to do that.

769
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:53,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, just that the space too valuable as is.

770
00:44:55,274 --> 00:44:55,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

771
00:44:55,714 --> 00:44:56,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Up the room.

772
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:02,441
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and I noticed too that you had, what was it here?

773
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Total number of devices located on the premise 31.

774
00:45:08,224 --> 00:45:12,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You're counting each speaker and stuff.

775
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:15,628
[SPEAKER_07]: The sound system counts as one versus.

776
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:20,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, the only reason being is because they charge you for every 10, right?

777
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:23,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's got it for every 10.

778
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,010
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is.

779
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:27,134
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 100 bucks just in speakers.

780
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:30,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, why did you bring that up?

781
00:45:30,538 --> 00:45:34,964
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know the city needs the money, right?

782
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:35,344
[SPEAKER_07]: That area.

783
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:56,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, yeah, so yeah, it's just gonna be, from what I can read, it's just a regular, the $300, it's, you're not gonna be going crazy with all those devices, but yeah, I don't have an issue with it.

784
00:45:56,198 --> 00:46:03,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at the drawing, it was a little difficult for me to see it.

785
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:06,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've got a laser printer and I still couldn't make,

786
00:46:08,676 --> 00:46:18,159
[SPEAKER_07]: make out what some of the stuff was, but you stated that where it was outlined in black, that was the area that the stages and stuff were going to be.

787
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:27,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So being in there just last night, it looked very familiar to me and I could visualize what was going where.

788
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:33,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Up against that, yeah, the green wall all the way to the left underneath the TV.

789
00:46:33,484 --> 00:46:35,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do a better job of outlining it.

790
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was 1, right in the middle.

791
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:43,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It almost looks like where the main entrances that was we're not going to do that.

792
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're not doing any.

793
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:46,115
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

794
00:46:46,876 --> 00:46:47,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

795
00:46:48,216 --> 00:46:48,496
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

796
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:49,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

797
00:46:49,997 --> 00:46:51,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I, I, I don't have an issue with it.

798
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,800
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like, like, I had said, they.

799
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing a nice job over there.

800
00:46:58,422 --> 00:46:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very pleased.

801
00:47:01,222 --> 00:47:03,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, Ben, you have any questions on the end?

802
00:47:03,763 --> 00:47:04,303
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

803
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,244
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm good.

804
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:07,644
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that cleared it up for me.

805
00:47:07,704 --> 00:47:08,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

806
00:47:08,304 --> 00:47:08,704
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

807
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,445
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, awesome.

808
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you guys want to make a motion and we'll pass that entertainment license?

809
00:47:19,057 --> 00:47:21,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,725
[SPEAKER_15]: So, just just to clear it up, Mr. Mr. commissioner, we're going to do Mr. chair.

811
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:28,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

812
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:28,926
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do.

813
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:35,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, 1 entertainment performers patrons and then 1 devices.

814
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:40,876
[SPEAKER_07]: But that seems yeah, it should be 1 of each.

815
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:41,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

816
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:41,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

817
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

818
00:47:46,394 --> 00:48:08,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I'll make a motion to accept the application by Great American Beer Hall for the entertainment license for as they appear on this application here, all city

819
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Departments have signed off on this application here.

820
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:22,158
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are approving the entertainment as provided by Ryan and Great American Beer Hall.

821
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:32,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, for the three different, entertainment by performers, entertainment by patrons, and entertainment by devices.

822
00:48:34,698 --> 00:48:35,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

823
00:48:35,698 --> 00:48:35,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

824
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:36,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

825
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:37,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ben.

826
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:39,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I second that motion.

827
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

828
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:43,001
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

829
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:43,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

830
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:44,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

831
00:48:45,782 --> 00:48:46,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayes have it.

832
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,983
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

833
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:49,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none.

834
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:50,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayes have it.

835
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:52,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion's passed.

836
00:48:52,585 --> 00:48:53,465
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all set, Brian.

837
00:48:53,966 --> 00:48:54,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

838
00:48:54,486 --> 00:48:54,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

839
00:48:54,986 --> 00:48:57,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see you on the next one.

840
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:57,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

841
00:48:58,487 --> 00:48:58,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

842
00:48:59,448 --> 00:48:59,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

843
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:04,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next on the agenda.

844
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:06,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

845
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:16,713
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got EST 2024 TBA, the establishment.

846
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Matthew Greer here?

847
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:21,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

848
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:22,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, members of the commission.

849
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:23,916
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Sean Began.

850
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:26,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the attorney representing the LLC.

851
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:29,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Matthew Greer is also on with us as well.

852
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

853
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:32,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

854
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:41,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Either Sean or Matthew, you want to tell us a little something about what's going on and what your plans are?

855
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:41,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

856
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:42,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

857
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:53,316
[SPEAKER_11]: So essentially, Mr. Greer is going to be taking over the location that was formerly occupied by the Porch Restaurant, if your members are familiar where that is, over at 175 Rivers Edge.

858
00:49:55,161 --> 00:50:16,748
[SPEAKER_11]: That restaurant is closed and essentially Mr. Greer is stepping into what is a turnkey operation where the landlord now owns all the fixtures, equipment, and furniture within that space and Mr. Greer will be renting the space including all of the furniture, fixtures, equipment that are included therein.

859
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:23,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Greer has approximately two decades worth of restaurant experience.

860
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:27,661
[SPEAKER_11]: He's managed and operated restaurants throughout the North Shore.

861
00:50:28,082 --> 00:50:34,630
[SPEAKER_11]: He has another current restaurant in Chelmsford, which is a little bit larger occupancy than this one.

862
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,213
[SPEAKER_11]: although this one is pretty good size as well.

863
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:37,213
8,000.

864
00:50:37,253 --> 00:50:41,479
[SPEAKER_05]: 8,000.

865
00:50:37,774 --> 00:50:41,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It's larger than 8,000 when in Chelmsford?

866
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:42,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Attorney Began.

867
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:43,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

868
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:47,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if the Chelmsford restaurant is larger than 8,000, Matt.

869
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, if you could unmute, you can offer a

870
00:50:53,966 --> 00:50:54,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

871
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Matthew Brer.

872
00:50:58,028 --> 00:51:00,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I currently run the establishment restaurant in North Chelmsford.

873
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:03,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking to move into the space in Medford.

874
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,212
[SPEAKER_12]: The current footprint is about 15,000 square feet.

875
00:51:07,992 --> 00:51:13,895
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a large restaurant and then we offer four function rooms at our current location.

876
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:17,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

877
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

878
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:26,977
[SPEAKER_11]: This restaurant, the restaurant that Mr. Greer will be opening at The Porch, it's not going to be an entertainment venue like The Porch was.

879
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:32,361
[SPEAKER_11]: The Porch was a music venue with restaurant.

880
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,903
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not going to be that focused in that manner.

881
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:41,708
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be more of a traditional sit-down restaurant using the same footprint and using the same layout.

882
00:51:42,508 --> 00:51:48,374
[SPEAKER_11]: but it won't have the bands and things of that nature that the porch was focused on.

883
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:54,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is a great opportunity for Mr. Greer.

884
00:51:54,379 --> 00:52:10,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a good opportunity for the city of Medford to get what is now a vacant space reoccupied with someone who brings a couple decades worth of experience and who, based on past history, his track record, is going to be able to get this place running and operating as it should.

885
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:20,648
[SPEAKER_11]: have another venue in an area of Medford that doesn't have too many restaurants along that particular area.

886
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:26,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there are a lot of people living in the apartments over there who I'm sure would appreciate something like this.

887
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:33,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to be the same type of food there or is it what type of food they're going to be serving?

888
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:35,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, do you want to address the menu?

889
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:36,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

890
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:36,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure.

891
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,756
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be the same menu.

892
00:52:38,816 --> 00:52:43,178
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll roll out with the same menu we currently use in in North Chelmsford.

893
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:48,059
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's, you know, primary pizza, steak tips, haddock.

894
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:50,120
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's it's American fare.

895
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:56,405
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not like a barbecue place like the other one was, smoker and all that stuff.

896
00:52:56,926 --> 00:53:00,228
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you know, well, it's got a beautiful smoker in there.

897
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:02,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll we'll offer some smoked items.

898
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:06,712
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, it's it's a more broad menu.

899
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:15,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think in a in a footprint that big, I think that may have been one of the one of the downfalls there in terms that I took over.

900
00:53:15,398 --> 00:53:18,560
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just an Italian restaurant and they just couldn't fill the space with

901
00:53:20,938 --> 00:53:27,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that'll be our big advantage, is offering the menu that we offer.

902
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, Mr. Gray, you're right.

903
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:36,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, looking backwards, maybe they were very specific with Medford-style barbecue.

904
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they kind of limit themselves right at the beginning.

905
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Because how many times can you keep going back?

906
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:45,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right, right, right.

907
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:45,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

908
00:53:47,868 --> 00:53:51,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gone through the 108 pages.

909
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem with the tenants?

910
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:58,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I see everyone had been reached.

911
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:04,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Any problems getting the surrounding tenants to be okay with it?

912
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:05,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Any complaints on them?

913
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:06,876
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

914
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,297
[SPEAKER_11]: No objections from- No objections.

915
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:09,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

916
00:54:09,737 --> 00:54:09,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

917
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:29,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And just help me understand, I'm looking, I see the LLC established 2024 LLC, I see the managers, just kind of help me understand, is Laura Gerrick Cohen and Dawn Zanazzo, are they your sisters?

918
00:54:30,162 --> 00:54:30,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yep.

919
00:54:30,963 --> 00:54:31,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, all right.

920
00:54:31,623 --> 00:54:32,224
[SPEAKER_12]: You got it, yeah.

921
00:54:32,364 --> 00:54:33,525
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a family, family.

922
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:37,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Me and my two sisters decided to do this first venture in Chelmsford.

923
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:46,574
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually seven years ago we opened up yesterday in North Chelmsford and it's just been, you know, it's been a blast, hugely successful.

924
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:49,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's the three of us and my brother-in-law, Ron, is also on.

925
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:50,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And your brother-in-law.

926
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:51,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yep.

927
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:56,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I got a big team that's gonna help us out.

928
00:54:56,413 --> 00:55:03,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll be spending a lot of time in Medford, at least 40 hours a week, probably more to get this up and running.

929
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:04,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

930
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:06,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very impressed.

931
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:13,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Began's correct over 20 years in the industry.

932
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've seen it all.

933
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:20,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that you're in your mid-50s, you've probably seen everything imaginable.

934
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So I applaud your tenacity and staying with it.

935
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thank you for coming into that space because your attorney's correct.

936
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:32,102
[SPEAKER_05]: That when the court started,

937
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:35,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Fading, that was huge.

938
00:55:36,023 --> 00:55:39,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to step in there and give that whole area a shot?

939
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that the casino's up and running, as we know, everyone goes someplace first and then they go over to the casino.

940
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:57,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, as you get going, that'll be a pre-stop or a pre-casino stop at your establishment.

941
00:56:00,713 --> 00:56:07,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I just wanted to note that Mr. Greer's history of running restaurants, he hasn't had any disciplinary action in all those years.

942
00:56:07,737 --> 00:56:15,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the city's getting a very good restaurateur, a good business person.

943
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:17,623
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're absolutely right, Attorney Began.

944
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:25,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point to bring out, because we look back at it, and we saw no infractions, no brawls.

945
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:26,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is very good.

946
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,049
[SPEAKER_05]: You run a tight ship.

947
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:29,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos.

948
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, thank you.

949
00:56:31,617 --> 00:56:32,818
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just had a quick question.

950
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:36,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So the restaurant in Chelmsford, what is the restaurant you have in Chelmsford?

951
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:40,440
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called The Establishment.

952
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also The Establishment.

953
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And this will also be called The Establishment.

954
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:49,802
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be called The Establishment as well for advertising purposes and tying them together.

955
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:54,423
[SPEAKER_12]: And our website is eatestablishment.com if anybody wants to check it out.

956
00:56:54,463 --> 00:56:57,224
[SPEAKER_12]: There's photos and our full menu and everything on there.

957
00:56:57,977 --> 00:56:58,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, cool, cool.

958
00:56:59,738 --> 00:57:05,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And then just something I thought was interesting, I did go through this whole lease and everything.

959
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:16,103
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it looked like the lease was subject to getting the liquor license approved and that it would start or the lease would start four months after the liquor license was approved.

960
00:57:16,723 --> 00:57:17,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

961
00:57:19,584 --> 00:57:22,346
[SPEAKER_12]: their focus is getting a successful restaurant in there.

962
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And they really liked what I had to offer.

963
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,831
[SPEAKER_12]: So they made the lease very, very friendly for me.

964
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:30,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, yeah, yeah, great.

965
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:34,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you able to open it up even prior to that?

966
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:36,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what the- That's what I was gonna say, yeah.

967
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:38,298
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be able to get in there.

968
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:42,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just kind of an incentive to give him four months to kind of start up before rent payment.

969
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:43,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

970
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:47,485
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can start, but that was just a term in the lease.

971
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:56,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm sort of familiar with commercial leases where if there's a build-out or something that has to happen, they're going to give some free part of it or something like that.

972
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:56,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

973
00:57:56,693 --> 00:57:58,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Give them a little runway.

974
00:57:58,615 --> 00:57:58,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

975
00:57:58,895 --> 00:57:58,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

976
00:57:59,275 --> 00:57:59,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

977
00:57:59,536 --> 00:58:00,877
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a better way to say it.

978
00:58:01,017 --> 00:58:02,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I thought it was interesting.

979
00:58:02,098 --> 00:58:07,042
[SPEAKER_15]: So then the US Foods, is that an existing vendor you have a relationship with, US Foods?

980
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:07,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that sort of why that?

981
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:09,669
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

982
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:10,210
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

983
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:14,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Several months ago, I expanded the space in North Chelmsford.

984
00:58:14,094 --> 00:58:15,656
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had two function rooms.

985
00:58:15,736 --> 00:58:18,059
[SPEAKER_12]: We took over some, we're in a big mill building there.

986
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:19,801
[SPEAKER_12]: We took over some space there.

987
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: So now we have four function rooms.

988
00:58:22,684 --> 00:58:23,825
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do functions up to 150 people now.

989
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I did that, when I started that project, U.S.

990
00:58:31,484 --> 00:58:35,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Food did an agreement with me there to get the funding for there.

991
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:37,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been with U.S.

992
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:38,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Food for a long time.

993
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,996
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just got a great partnership.

994
00:58:42,036 --> 00:58:48,323
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically they gave me the funds to open up the restaurant with a commitment for purchases for three years.

995
00:58:48,323 --> 00:58:50,745
[SPEAKER_12]: years going forward with US Foods.

996
00:58:51,205 --> 00:58:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what we figured because you must have had a good track record with them for them to extend that line of credit.

997
00:58:57,008 --> 00:59:01,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And without any pledge of the license or anything like that.

998
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:09,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that speaks to your experience and your time in the industry.

999
00:59:09,456 --> 00:59:09,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1000
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:09,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1001
00:59:10,952 --> 00:59:16,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to ask him twice just to make sure it was a real thing.

1002
00:59:16,996 --> 00:59:21,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, more for them like they were, you know, the usual thing you see.

1003
00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:22,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, great.

1004
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1005
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:22,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1006
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:22,879
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um,

1007
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:35,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, I mean, I would just say I'm glad, I'm glad, you know, I'm glad a quality restaurant is going in there.

1008
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:38,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that space is more or less new, you know.

1009
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:41,622
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just built out right before COVID.

1010
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:49,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the builders who did it and, you know, it's a quality space and seems like a good opportunity.

1011
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:54,733
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, yeah, I was surprised that they, you know, a brand new place like that, they actually went out of business.

1012
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:55,854
[SPEAKER_15]: So I, you know,

1013
00:59:56,814 --> 01:00:24,428
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know more about that than we do oh yeah, and then one other thing was I was also good glad to see that there's like You know there's the there's the whole agreement between the condominium association, and you know and that and I'm just say Noise or anything like that and you know that's sort of a you just want to kind of abide by that with the condominium whatever their rules are about I Don't know No, I you know anything like that you're

1014
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:35,162
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past, some complaints from the porch had come to us, and I actually think that that was more between them and the condo than it was the liquor board.

1015
01:00:36,984 --> 01:00:43,771
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess I'm only saying that as a heads up, maybe, on any questions they ever have about noise.

1016
01:00:45,237 --> 01:00:46,358
[SPEAKER_15]: build a relationship with them.

1017
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:47,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1018
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:52,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the differences here is where the porters bring in bands, that's not going to be the issue here.

1019
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:52,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, good point.

1020
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:54,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1021
01:00:54,984 --> 01:01:04,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Greer is going to have TVs, he's got an audio system obviously, but it's going to be, I think, a tamer environment in terms of noise for the other unit owners.

1022
01:01:06,031 --> 01:01:13,697
[SPEAKER_11]: You're right, whatever the rules of the condo are is what all the unit owners have to abide by, but I don't think he's going to have any issue there.

1023
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:14,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1024
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1025
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:15,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1026
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:16,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1027
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:18,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1028
01:01:19,232 --> 01:01:20,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1029
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:27,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the package that was submitted to us, I don't think, was it the lease that wasn't signed?

1030
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the package that goes to the state will have signatures on all the contracts and everything, correct?

1031
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:38,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday, I emailed over to Daria the signed copy of the lease.

1032
01:01:38,846 --> 01:01:39,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1033
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:39,726
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have it.

1034
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,782
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, because some parties were traveling.

1035
01:01:43,822 --> 01:01:47,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't get it till I got to sign coffee.

1036
01:01:47,364 --> 01:01:49,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good catch.

1037
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:50,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1038
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:51,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1039
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:53,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, Mr. Chairman.

1040
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Same here.

1041
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:56,832
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1042
01:01:56,852 --> 01:01:57,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1043
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:58,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few questions.

1044
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the

1045
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:04,398
[SPEAKER_07]: The U.S.

1046
01:02:04,418 --> 01:02:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Foods gave you the $80,000 line of credit on page 4, number 8 and number 9.

1047
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:24,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Number eight, financial disclosure.

1048
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:31,989
[SPEAKER_07]: The question, source of financing, is the lender a licensee pursuant to MGL 138?

1049
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You did not check off yes or no.

1050
01:02:39,573 --> 01:02:41,955
[SPEAKER_07]: That needs to be checked off.

1051
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:48,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's just to make sure they don't hold the license in the state of Massachusetts.

1052
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:50,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'll check.

1053
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:55,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I can check that off and submit that page, resubmit that page.

1054
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:56,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1055
01:02:57,339 --> 01:03:02,046
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing on that same page, number nine, pledge information.

1056
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:05,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you seeking approval for a pledge?

1057
01:03:05,571 --> 01:03:06,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be checked.

1058
01:03:06,493 --> 01:03:07,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes or no.

1059
01:03:07,374 --> 01:03:08,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So please check.

1060
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:08,616
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1061
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:09,637
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no.

1062
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:18,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did those 2 page 10, I see number 11 made a note of management agreement.

1063
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you requesting approval user utilize a management company through a management agreement?

1064
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you are.

1065
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:26,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you manage your own property.

1066
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd have to check.

1067
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:28,863
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and that as well.

1068
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:29,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Please sure.

1069
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:44,221
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I saw was pages 73 through 79, which was exhibit A, B, and C. They don't show anything to me.

1070
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:48,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it looks like a bunch of lines.

1071
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:55,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing says if it's parking, if it's seeding, if it's...

1072
01:04:00,455 --> 01:04:01,917
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just drawings.

1073
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:18,433
[SPEAKER_07]: What I did see was on page 33, it shows me the layout of the restaurant, and I was familiar with it because I've patronized it a few times in the past, so I could figure it out.

1074
01:04:18,533 --> 01:04:20,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But on A, B, and C,

1075
01:04:23,378 --> 01:04:25,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

1076
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Those exhibits A, B, and C are A, B, and C of the lease agreement.

1077
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:42,730
[SPEAKER_11]: The plan, and I agree with you, they're not entirely helpful, but they were attached to the lease as it came over from the landlord, but the plan,

1078
01:04:45,382 --> 01:05:01,131
[SPEAKER_11]: that you referenced earlier that's on page 33 is a schematic of the layout which shows specifically where the seating is, where everything is within the restaurant and has all the capacity numbers that I think the commission needs.

1079
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:02,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1080
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:04,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I agree with you.

1081
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:08,930
[SPEAKER_11]: One of those exhibits, I think, was to show parking.

1082
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's like under the building packing.

1083
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:15,993
[SPEAKER_07]: That must be all the spaces, because there's a bunch of them.

1084
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:17,014
[SPEAKER_11]: A parking garage, yes.

1085
01:05:17,054 --> 01:05:17,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1086
01:05:18,274 --> 01:05:25,197
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was specific to the lease itself and not necessarily this application.

1087
01:05:25,998 --> 01:05:26,338
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1088
01:05:26,878 --> 01:05:28,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was page 79.

1089
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:50,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm familiar with the area and the building and I just wanted to, it was before it used to be known as 150 Rivers Edge, but I know they've changed things since they're up to 600 or even higher for numbers at Rivers Edge.

1090
01:05:50,131 --> 01:05:56,355
[SPEAKER_07]: But is there still parking available under the restaurant itself in that building?

1091
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:01,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, in terms of for, um.

1092
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:03,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Customers yes.

1093
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:04,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1094
01:06:04,595 --> 01:06:04,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1095
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:15,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just wondering, uh, because I, I did read something about parking, but I just want to make sure that was still available that they didn't close it off or anything for restaurant patrons.

1096
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were the only questions I had, but I did want to ask you about something else.

1097
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you sent in a last-minute file to Daria.

1098
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:42,209
[SPEAKER_07]: It was given to her yesterday, and I'm grateful that you did it because it needed the signatures with the lease agreement and everything else.

1099
01:06:43,445 --> 01:06:53,647
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I understand too, there was some additional postal receipts that came in and things like that.

1100
01:06:56,007 --> 01:07:10,630
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm going to suggest to my fellow commissioners is if either yourself as the attorney or the Mr. Greer can put everything

1101
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:22,325
[SPEAKER_07]: on an electronic file, a PDF or whatever, and scan everything and put it on the file and send it to Daria.

1102
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:30,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Daria can't keep pulling apart your files to try and insert stuff and take stuff out and everything else.

1103
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:39,493
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a final application with all of your signed leases and all of your little individual

1104
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:50,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Mail receipts all scheduled and all scanned in along with the hard copies you're required to submit and just send it to Daria.

1105
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:53,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can we can approve this.

1106
01:07:54,357 --> 01:08:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, not a problem with the contingency that we received those.

1107
01:08:02,268 --> 01:08:06,940
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that type of 5 electronic file, and I'd paper copy file.

1108
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, we can conditionally approve it.

1109
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:10,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that.

1110
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:21,381
[SPEAKER_07]: In Daria's defense, she doesn't have enough time in a day to do what we ask her to do, never mind putting everybody else's cut and paste and trying to do it for us.

1111
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:27,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to kind of streamline things, make things a little easier.

1112
01:08:28,206 --> 01:08:30,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an electronic file.

1113
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:31,448
[SPEAKER_07]: We have it.

1114
01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:32,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody can look at it.

1115
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:33,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1116
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:35,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, no problem.

1117
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,560
[SPEAKER_11]: We can have that by tomorrow morning.

1118
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,822
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a problem for my office at all.

1119
01:08:42,605 --> 01:08:50,833
[SPEAKER_11]: On the record, I just want to say Daria has been tremendously helpful in this process and extremely responsive if I've had a question or an inquiry.

1120
01:08:51,662 --> 01:09:04,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she is, and that's why we don't want to make her life and her job more difficult, because like I said, and you said, she's been extraordinary.

1121
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:11,074
[SPEAKER_07]: She does great work, and we just don't want to put any undue work on her back.

1122
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:11,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1123
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so, yeah, that'll be good.

1124
01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:19,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And if any commissioners would, uh, are okay with that and like, let me make a motion.

1125
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:23,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, we can additionally approve it.

1126
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:25,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, no, I, I motion to.

1127
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:44,715
[SPEAKER_05]: to approve and move forward with the new license request for establishment 2024 LLC conditioned upon a complete and organized package for the city's records and of course ABCC's review.

1128
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:46,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1129
01:09:47,457 --> 01:09:51,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And one question before I approve, I second that.

1130
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:56,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Chairman, there's the entertainment license also to go with this.

1131
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:58,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that something we'll separately talk about?

1132
01:09:59,014 --> 01:10:01,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we could do that separate if you like, Ben.

1133
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:02,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That way we don't.

1134
01:10:03,415 --> 01:10:07,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you want to tie it, that's fine too, but yeah.

1135
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:13,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, I have reviewed it and sort of like the last one we looked at, all the signatures are there and.

1136
01:10:14,892 --> 01:10:16,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I reviewed it too.

1137
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:17,014
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine with me.

1138
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:21,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you can tie it into both if you want to add that on to your motion, Alan.

1139
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:24,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, no, I'll amend my motion.

1140
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:37,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me add, I approve the entertainment requests for the three categories, I believe, for establishment 2024 LLC.

1141
01:10:45,002 --> 01:10:59,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and I second the motion both for the, uh, new license application and for the entertainment license application for establish, um, for the establishment, um, All righty.

1142
01:10:59,734 --> 01:11:00,575
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

1143
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:01,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1144
01:11:01,536 --> 01:11:03,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1145
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:03,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed.

1146
01:11:05,464 --> 01:11:06,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And seeing none, the ayes have it.

1147
01:11:07,326 --> 01:11:08,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

1148
01:11:09,508 --> 01:11:10,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an exciting project.

1149
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:13,332
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope to swing by soon.

1150
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all very much.

1151
01:11:15,895 --> 01:11:24,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to becoming part of a community in Medford and working with all the organizations in Medford, especially the youth organizations.

1152
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:25,265
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you very much.

1153
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:27,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

1154
01:11:28,127 --> 01:11:28,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

1155
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:28,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1156
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:29,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Last thing.

1157
01:11:29,788 --> 01:11:33,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'll just say we'll see more of each other as time goes.

1158
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:38,313
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you ever have questions, just being new, just please ask us.

1159
01:11:38,473 --> 01:11:41,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's always good.

1160
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:50,001
[SPEAKER_15]: You can always jump in on a meeting every month if there are questions or anything's coming up as just being new to this.

1161
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:51,222
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're here to help.

1162
01:11:51,802 --> 01:11:52,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1163
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:52,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

1164
01:11:54,133 --> 01:12:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, would Mr. Greer benefit from the compliance meeting coming up?

1165
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:04,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're more than welcome to come, Mr. Greer.

1166
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:15,248
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an annual ABCC compliance meeting for all licensees in the state of Massachusetts, but Medford does their own.

1167
01:12:16,089 --> 01:12:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Ralph Sacramone from the ABCCs, the executive director, he comes and brings

1168
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:34,277
[SPEAKER_07]: some people with them to basically explain the easy way to navigate through their site and what is expected of the licensees.

1169
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have the fire chief there.

1170
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:44,040
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll speak for five minutes about the fire inspection and the building commissioner for five minutes about the building inspection.

1171
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,684
[SPEAKER_07]: and all of that stuff, and it's about an hour, hour and a half.

1172
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:54,107
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having it on the 25th this month.

1173
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:55,088
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 a.m.

1174
01:12:55,108 --> 01:12:56,829
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 a.m., yeah.

1175
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:06,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a good, somewhat of a good time for restaurants, you know, to get them out of there by noon, 12.30, and you're all done, you know.

1176
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,637
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're more than welcome to come.

1177
01:13:07,657 --> 01:13:08,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be beneficial to you.

1178
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds perfect.

1179
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Grant, City Hall.

1180
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:12,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1181
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:13,321
[SPEAKER_05]: City Hall.

1182
01:13:14,398 --> 01:13:17,959
[SPEAKER_05]: or send your number two person, please do.

1183
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to be there myself.

1184
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

1185
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:21,401
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

1186
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1187
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:28,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Daria, you can send them out an invitation via email if you like.

1188
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:30,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Just add them to the list, if you can do that.

1189
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:32,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1190
01:13:32,525 --> 01:13:35,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The application, I think, has to have an email.

1191
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:39,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever that email is, I can- Yeah.

1192
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:39,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1193
01:13:39,868 --> 01:13:41,148
[SPEAKER_07]: The one on the application.

1194
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:41,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1195
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:42,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it.

1196
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:42,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1197
01:13:42,509 --> 01:13:42,869
[SPEAKER_07]: From that.

1198
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:44,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1199
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,981
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll send you an invitation out via email.

1200
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:48,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1201
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:49,663
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

1202
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:51,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1203
01:13:52,505 --> 01:13:53,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Blakowicz.

1204
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:54,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1205
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:55,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1206
01:13:56,048 --> 01:13:56,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1207
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:00,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1208
01:14:01,092 --> 01:14:02,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Lieutenant Blakowicz, are you there?

1209
01:14:08,388 --> 01:14:09,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you leave?

1210
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We made him wait a long time.

1211
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that he's still on it.

1212
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see him.

1213
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:18,352
[SPEAKER_02]: He's muted.

1214
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:19,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Officer Sadas and he's there.

1215
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1216
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:25,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And who else do we got?

1217
01:14:25,735 --> 01:14:26,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Officer Farrell?

1218
01:14:29,896 --> 01:14:30,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, there she is.

1219
01:14:32,983 --> 01:14:33,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, where were you there?

1220
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:38,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm here just trying to figure out how to navigate.

1221
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:40,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, not a problem.

1222
01:14:41,507 --> 01:14:43,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure you were there.

1223
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:51,272
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys happen to be, I think the last one on the agenda, um, save the best for last, I guess.

1224
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:52,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1225
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:55,554
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's see what we got.

1226
01:14:56,234 --> 01:14:56,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1227
01:15:01,008 --> 01:15:05,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do we have a representative from Paso del Benefica?

1228
01:15:08,518 --> 01:15:08,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that?

1229
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:09,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1230
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Good afternoon, how are you?

1231
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you guys hear me?

1232
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:13,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1233
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:14,707
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, great.

1234
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:15,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Good afternoon.

1235
01:15:18,274 --> 01:15:18,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1236
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:38,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, well, basically, the reason why, um, we have you in here, Mr. Korea is that, um, there was an incident that occurred, um, your establishment and, um, on a 27 and it was brought to our attention and, um, the police responded.

1237
01:15:39,805 --> 01:15:45,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, what we'll do is we'll have, um, Lieutenant Locker Woods and, um,

1238
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:48,890
[SPEAKER_07]: and the officers that responded.

1239
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:56,373
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna give them the opportunity to tell us what happened and comment on the police reports and stuff.

1240
01:15:57,274 --> 01:16:02,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'll have the opportunity to speak as well on your behalf.

1241
01:16:03,077 --> 01:16:07,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll just hash it around a little from there and see what happens.

1242
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:12,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Lieutenant Lockwoods, would you like to take over the meeting?

1243
01:16:12,723 --> 01:16:15,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm just going to, uh, give a hello and introduction.

1244
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:27,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Rory Lockowitz, a Lieutenant with the Medford police, um, office fashion did the primary focus, uh, in addition to the police report that was written.

1245
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:36,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and with him was officer Farrow, who is, um, for any translation and, uh, a second set of eyes.

1246
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,814
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just going to turn it over to officer Sebastian.

1247
01:16:39,754 --> 01:16:40,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, if that's okay.

1248
01:16:41,495 --> 01:16:41,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1249
01:16:44,094 --> 01:16:44,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1250
01:16:46,175 --> 01:16:51,356
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think my video, I'm able only to speak without video for some reason.

1251
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,377
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm on my iPhone.

1252
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:53,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize.

1253
01:16:54,557 --> 01:16:57,978
[SPEAKER_16]: But so the original incident was a fight.

1254
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:02,560
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not respond to the incident, but I was working that night.

1255
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:11,383
[SPEAKER_16]: I did review the report and it seemed to be due to an intoxicated patron and member.

1256
01:17:12,804 --> 01:17:21,570
[SPEAKER_16]: who was upset that another member was speaking to a spouse or a girlfriend, and then they engaged in a fight.

1257
01:17:24,151 --> 01:17:31,797
[SPEAKER_16]: I responded, I believe, on the 30th to do an inspection of the building and make sure they were in compliance.

1258
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:37,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Carrera and the other people in there were very receptive.

1259
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,901
[SPEAKER_16]: They were very open.

1260
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:45,803
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the first things they told me was that both club members have been banned.

1261
01:17:47,544 --> 01:17:56,387
[SPEAKER_16]: I spoke to them about a trespass to have it formally on record with not only them, but the police department, which would

1262
01:17:57,027 --> 01:18:05,697
[SPEAKER_16]: bring it to a point where if these guests return they will be arrested and you know in my opinion would prevent them from returning.

1263
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:11,725
[SPEAKER_16]: The restaurant when I entered had about 25 to 30 patrons.

1264
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:19,194
[SPEAKER_16]: None were overly intoxicated.

1265
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,554
[SPEAKER_16]: None were intoxicated.

1266
01:18:20,574 --> 01:18:23,815
[SPEAKER_16]: The noise level was within reason.

1267
01:18:23,835 --> 01:18:28,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And like I said, everyone was receptive to even a police officer coming in in uniform.

1268
01:18:29,937 --> 01:18:31,417
[SPEAKER_16]: All signs were posted.

1269
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:33,458
[SPEAKER_16]: All licenses were posted.

1270
01:18:33,478 --> 01:18:35,919
[SPEAKER_16]: A menu was posted.

1271
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:39,600
[SPEAKER_16]: The bartenders were all in compliance.

1272
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Officer Farrell was with me.

1273
01:18:44,528 --> 01:18:48,430
[SPEAKER_16]: to the fact that she's fluent in Portuguese.

1274
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:55,192
[SPEAKER_16]: We didn't need much translation, but they were very, like I said, open and receptive.

1275
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:57,193
[SPEAKER_16]: I went behind the bar, checked everything.

1276
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:02,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything was in compliance, very clean.

1277
01:19:03,555 --> 01:19:05,296
[SPEAKER_16]: The kitchen area was very clean.

1278
01:19:06,136 --> 01:19:09,218
[SPEAKER_16]: They walked me down to the stockroom area, showed me everything.

1279
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:11,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything was very neat and organized.

1280
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:16,381
[SPEAKER_16]: I was actually very surprised in how organized and clean everything was.

1281
01:19:17,522 --> 01:19:29,030
[SPEAKER_16]: They showed me their camera system, told me that Mr. Carrera has access to it, and there's another manager who has access to it.

1282
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:36,515
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have any cameras downstairs, but have everything upstairs in the establishment that shows all the rooms.

1283
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:54,502
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing that they didn't have that was on the checklist was an employee list, which I don't know how big of a deal that is, but they stated that they were going to have it with phone numbers and date of birth.

1284
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:59,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I just explained to them that it would be easy and it's required.

1285
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:10,954
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, it would make it easier for police if there is an incident to speak to somebody, if we have to follow up and them being able to tell us who was there and how we can get in contact with them.

1286
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:18,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And other than that, I mean, everything was good.

1287
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,082
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, yeah, that's all.

1288
01:20:26,445 --> 01:20:27,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, very good.

1289
01:20:27,586 --> 01:20:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks very much.

1290
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:35,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Officer Farah, do you have anything you'd like to say in regards to this matter?

1291
01:20:36,905 --> 01:20:39,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really do the inspection.

1292
01:20:39,265 --> 01:20:49,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there mostly for translation and I kind of just explained to them how the inspection was going to happen and they were very open to that.

1293
01:20:49,907 --> 01:20:56,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, Officer Sebastian took it over and he did the inspection and just stayed in front of the bar waiting.

1294
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was about pretty much like that.

1295
01:20:59,549 --> 01:21:02,109
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't respond to the day of the fight as well.

1296
01:21:02,789 --> 01:21:05,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was mostly there for the translation purposes.

1297
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:08,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1298
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:10,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1299
01:21:11,093 --> 01:21:12,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for commenting on it.

1300
01:21:15,176 --> 01:21:19,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Lieutenant, is there anything else you'd like to comment on?

1301
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:32,847
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems like the initial incident, there was a question of whether or not somebody was too intoxicated.

1302
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:36,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we have no way of knowing or proving

1303
01:21:37,273 --> 01:21:40,494
[SPEAKER_18]: how much was consumed on the premise on the day of the fight.

1304
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:52,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously a concern when you hear somebody was in a highly intoxicated state on the premise where they served after the fact.

1305
01:21:52,858 --> 01:21:57,739
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a concern but not something we're bringing before the commission saying that it did in fact happen.

1306
01:21:58,219 --> 01:22:00,340
[SPEAKER_18]: What we know did in fact happen was that there was a

1307
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:04,618
[SPEAKER_18]: a mutual assault and battery, you know, a fight that happened.

1308
01:22:05,438 --> 01:22:17,631
[SPEAKER_18]: And as officers Sebastian and Farrow said, since then, they took action and appear to have done everything they could to help prevent this in the future.

1309
01:22:21,114 --> 01:22:21,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1310
01:22:24,818 --> 01:22:24,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,

1311
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:31,623
[SPEAKER_07]: My fellow commissioners, do you have any questions or concerns about this incident?

1312
01:22:35,427 --> 01:22:39,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chair, I do, but I'd like to hear from Mr. Carrera here.

1313
01:22:41,398 --> 01:22:45,100
[SPEAKER_05]: what his take on it, but I do have some questions.

1314
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll circle back after Mr. Carrera speaks.

1315
01:22:48,882 --> 01:22:49,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point.

1316
01:22:49,282 --> 01:22:54,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I forgot to ask Mr. Carrera my apologies.

1317
01:22:55,305 --> 01:23:01,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Carrera, I'm sorry, would you like to comment on what you've heard so far or what might have happened that evening?

1318
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:05,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to thank the police officers for coming over.

1319
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:11,456
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, make sure everything that it was up to, like compliance with the city of Manfred and everything like that.

1320
01:23:12,176 --> 01:23:14,939
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that day on that was Tuesday, August 27th.

1321
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,560
[SPEAKER_17]: That's when it happened.

1322
01:23:17,721 --> 01:23:20,724
[SPEAKER_17]: We can control many things, but we can't control people's emotions.

1323
01:23:22,105 --> 01:23:23,086
[SPEAKER_17]: What did happen that day?

1324
01:23:23,106 --> 01:23:24,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was a discussion between

1325
01:23:26,808 --> 01:23:29,950
[SPEAKER_17]: One guy's talking to another person's girlfriend.

1326
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,551
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just childish things, but we can't control over that.

1327
01:23:34,352 --> 01:23:36,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Our bartenders are all tip certified.

1328
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:42,315
[SPEAKER_17]: So therefore, if they were intoxicated, they cut them off.

1329
01:23:42,355 --> 01:23:44,296
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I asked the bartender when I got there.

1330
01:23:44,356 --> 01:23:45,717
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, how much did you serve them?

1331
01:23:45,737 --> 01:23:50,479
[SPEAKER_17]: She's like, I served them enough that when I cut them off, it was over.

1332
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:53,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I told him, what did they drink?

1333
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,601
[SPEAKER_17]: She said one drink.

1334
01:23:55,588 --> 01:24:00,630
[SPEAKER_17]: three beers, the other one drink, I think it was like a shot and a beer and that was it.

1335
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,611
[SPEAKER_17]: And I cut them off because the bar was about to close that night.

1336
01:24:04,631 --> 01:24:11,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just happened to happen as we're about to close because the person's girlfriend is actually our cook.

1337
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:35,817
[SPEAKER_17]: um she was like she was just leaving her shift going home and the other person approached her and started talking to him the other the other person did not like him talking to his girlfriend and so therefore they got into an altercation over over that i mean as they say they were extremely drunk i i don't think they were because like i said like our bartenders are tip certified

1338
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:43,222
[SPEAKER_17]: if they think that the person is too intoxicated to a certain point, like three beers, that should be like the cutoff line for them.

1339
01:24:43,762 --> 01:24:45,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Because one of them wasn't very big.

1340
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:48,686
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's just like stuff like that.

1341
01:24:48,786 --> 01:24:52,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't control over people's emotions.

1342
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:57,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, both members are banned for life from the club.

1343
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:07,359
[SPEAKER_17]: The cook did quit because she didn't feel comfortable being there because of what happened.

1344
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:13,021
[SPEAKER_17]: And that the only means that she had to go home is with her boyfriend.

1345
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:19,965
[SPEAKER_17]: So therefore, I told her that he cannot be in the premises while picking her up.

1346
01:25:20,645 --> 01:25:23,046
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, if that's going to be a problem, then I'm just going to have to quit.

1347
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,767
[SPEAKER_17]: And she left last week.

1348
01:25:27,472 --> 01:25:30,114
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I got to say about this scenario.

1349
01:25:32,716 --> 01:25:36,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to hear about the troubles that you're going through there.

1350
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:42,583
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's move on.

1351
01:25:42,623 --> 01:25:43,924
[SPEAKER_07]: We can discuss.

1352
01:25:44,284 --> 01:25:45,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, you said you'd like to speak.

1353
01:25:46,297 --> 01:25:50,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, Mr. Carrera, I appreciate the, you're absolutely right.

1354
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't control people's emotions.

1355
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe when I read through the police report, it said the individual fled.

1356
01:25:58,584 --> 01:26:03,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious, I've heard from the officers that there is no log

1357
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:09,551
[SPEAKER_05]: of employees with names and contact numbers and information.

1358
01:26:09,611 --> 01:26:22,341
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the last time we spoke with you, we made it clear that clubs are required to have a book, and members are supposed to sign in.

1359
01:26:22,682 --> 01:26:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're bringing in guests, they're supposed to be signing in the guests.

1360
01:26:26,545 --> 01:26:31,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I said, where I read in the police report that the individual fled,

1361
01:26:32,049 --> 01:26:34,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know who the individual that fled was?

1362
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm certain Dean should have been in the book.

1363
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:39,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but both of them are members.

1364
01:26:39,413 --> 01:26:42,134
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, they're newly members, so we do have information on them.

1365
01:26:42,814 --> 01:26:45,776
[SPEAKER_17]: We have the contacts, we have all the names and stuff like that.

1366
01:26:45,816 --> 01:26:51,338
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that needs to be pulled up, I can give that to the police officer or anything like that that is needed.

1367
01:26:52,219 --> 01:26:54,120
[SPEAKER_17]: The person that left, that fled,

1368
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:56,235
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know why he fled.

1369
01:26:56,796 --> 01:27:01,898
[SPEAKER_17]: He may be having problems with the law or something like that.

1370
01:27:01,918 --> 01:27:02,778
[SPEAKER_17]: I have no idea.

1371
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:05,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know people's background.

1372
01:27:05,839 --> 01:27:09,961
[SPEAKER_17]: I only know their names and when they're made part of being a member.

1373
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:14,123
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's the only information they give me is their name and their phone number.

1374
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:23,086
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of them don't like giving their licenses because they don't want people to do mischievous things with it.

1375
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:23,947
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why.

1376
01:27:24,867 --> 01:27:28,270
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't get much information on them, but we do have their names and their phone numbers.

1377
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:33,434
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that needs to be given to somebody, I will gladly get that information out.

1378
01:27:33,454 --> 01:27:35,636
[SPEAKER_17]: They were both new members, obviously.

1379
01:27:36,297 --> 01:27:47,386
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, like when they send a piece of paper saying to become a member, one of the things that says there is any altercations, fights or discriminations, like anything that's

1380
01:27:48,415 --> 01:27:53,397
[SPEAKER_17]: like affecting the environment, the environment around us, it's an automatic ban.

1381
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:55,378
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no like six months suspension.

1382
01:27:55,398 --> 01:27:56,998
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not one month suspension.

1383
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:59,739
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an automatic ban because we can always get members again.

1384
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:04,261
[SPEAKER_17]: And people that do that in their establishment, we do not like tolerate.

1385
01:28:04,361 --> 01:28:12,344
[SPEAKER_17]: So the dead sign a piece of paper saying that whatever happens in there, if they do whatever it says there on the piece of paper, they're automatically banned from the club for life.

1386
01:28:12,684 --> 01:28:13,785
[SPEAKER_17]: And the thing is, we keep these,

1387
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:21,289
[SPEAKER_17]: and a record because we do like a meeting every year of the people that's been banned from the club.

1388
01:28:21,349 --> 01:28:22,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of them have passed away.

1389
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:27,574
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have to clear those out because they no longer want us.

1390
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:33,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is a list of all the people that have been banned through the years to that club because they keep information of it.

1391
01:28:34,658 --> 01:28:36,759
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of them have pictures, some of them don't.

1392
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:41,821
[SPEAKER_17]: But like I said, these two individuals, they're fairly new, so we knew who they were.

1393
01:28:42,161 --> 01:28:44,382
[SPEAKER_17]: And like I said, they've been banned.

1394
01:28:44,602 --> 01:28:45,783
[SPEAKER_17]: They're no longer part of the club.

1395
01:28:46,023 --> 01:28:47,203
[SPEAKER_17]: They're no longer members.

1396
01:28:48,104 --> 01:28:55,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And if people start defending them or trying to say, why are you guys banning them, that person will get banned as well.

1397
01:28:55,767 --> 01:29:01,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we don't tolerate defending people that just make a ruckus for no reason.

1398
01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:03,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what else to say.

1399
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:05,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, no.

1400
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:09,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Carrera, you kind of cut off all my other questions.

1401
01:29:11,065 --> 01:29:18,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was curious about that too, what the penalty was for the establishment.

1402
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:20,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there some type of event going on?

1403
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:21,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a soccer game?

1404
01:29:22,374 --> 01:29:24,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it just a normal night?

1405
01:29:25,137 --> 01:29:26,057
[SPEAKER_17]: It was just a normal night.

1406
01:29:26,077 --> 01:29:28,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I left there two hours prior.

1407
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,725
[SPEAKER_17]: And I spoke with the bartender, I was like, listen, there's not many people here.

1408
01:29:33,865 --> 01:29:35,267
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's the club.

1409
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:35,687
[SPEAKER_17]: It does.

1410
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:40,132
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a set time for the club, but the club usually doesn't stay open until that time.

1411
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:41,514
[SPEAKER_17]: That's that's written down.

1412
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:45,979
[SPEAKER_17]: It's basically like on if the members show up there a certain time.

1413
01:29:46,880 --> 01:30:11,125
[SPEAKER_17]: like just say that if there's three members like left on the club and it's seven o'clock it's just pretty much like just cut them off and close the bar there is no reason to stay open until 10 with nobody in there right so what happened was that night i think was somebody's birthday and they were like he was going back to his country so it was there was a little more people than usual so what i told was like uh try to close the bar by like

1414
01:30:12,005 --> 01:30:14,048
[SPEAKER_17]: 10 o'clock, like don't pass that time.

1415
01:30:14,068 --> 01:30:17,833
[SPEAKER_17]: And she's like, Oh, they'll probably be out of here by by like nine o'clock.

1416
01:30:17,953 --> 01:30:21,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's when the altercation happened was around like nine o'clock.

1417
01:30:22,019 --> 01:30:26,685
[SPEAKER_17]: As the bartender, I mean, as the cook was leaving, that's when the altercation happened.

1418
01:30:26,705 --> 01:30:26,806
[SPEAKER_17]: So

1419
01:30:28,418 --> 01:30:30,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, I can't control people's emotions.

1420
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:31,579
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish I could.

1421
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:35,640
[SPEAKER_17]: If I was there, it would probably be a different scenario.

1422
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:49,823
[SPEAKER_17]: People did not step in because, like I said, they don't want to get involved, which is a shame because there was one of our people from our committee there that couldn't separate them, but he did nothing.

1423
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:52,864
[SPEAKER_17]: So that made me a little bit upset.

1424
01:30:53,104 --> 01:30:55,565
[SPEAKER_17]: And I spoke with him, and he said he was sorry.

1425
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:05,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I told them just next time make sure you try not to start stuff like that because it's childish.

1426
01:31:07,293 --> 01:31:07,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1427
01:31:09,476 --> 01:31:11,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.

1428
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:40,155
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the only question I had actually, I was just sort of curious, my ignorance might be why, but just on the police report is actually that Officer Sebastian wrote, it says at the end of it said, just the suggestion, it was saying that probable cause for an illegality to wit, is that anything that we need to sort of be,

1429
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Paying attention to, I mean, as far as the liquor board, or is that sort of.

1430
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:52,366
[SPEAKER_15]: More about the, I don't know the individuals who are involved in that officers Sebastian.

1431
01:31:54,847 --> 01:31:58,529
[SPEAKER_16]: I just didn't understand that part so that's just.

1432
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,911
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a term saying that, like.

1433
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:12,924
[SPEAKER_16]: There's probable cause to believe that they allowed an illegality to happen on their property or that a crime did occur on their property, which is the assault and battery.

1434
01:32:14,866 --> 01:32:19,149
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not something that's saying like they're going to be charged with a crime or anything like that.

1435
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:26,995
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just saying that there was there's enough probable cause to say that, you know, a crime did occur on their property.

1436
01:32:27,035 --> 01:32:27,476
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

1437
01:32:28,657 --> 01:32:28,697
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1438
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:34,132
[SPEAKER_18]: That's sort of the hook that brings us together to discuss this matter right now.

1439
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:35,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1440
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:41,356
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I kind of understood it that way because like it really did seem like they're complying with everything.

1441
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:43,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And I saw that that was what I was just confused about.

1442
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:44,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1443
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:50,062
[SPEAKER_18]: The choice of file charges in court or not is kind of irrelevant to this hearing.

1444
01:32:50,402 --> 01:32:50,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1445
01:32:50,843 --> 01:32:51,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1446
01:32:52,143 --> 01:32:57,387
[SPEAKER_18]: As I have in the past, I'll forward over a report as I did with a different incident at a different establishment.

1447
01:32:58,113 --> 01:33:03,634
[SPEAKER_18]: where there was really no cause to say any legality was permitted.

1448
01:33:04,794 --> 01:33:09,635
[SPEAKER_18]: So just please take this and put it in their file that it exists.

1449
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:17,897
[SPEAKER_18]: We know for sure a place in the property today.

1450
01:33:18,637 --> 01:33:19,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the event occurred.

1451
01:33:20,057 --> 01:33:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: We know perhaps too many adult beverages in a short period of time.

1452
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:30,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chairman, what are your thoughts on this one?

1453
01:33:30,762 --> 01:33:39,107
[SPEAKER_05]: This is clearly kind of an infraction to the point where it turned into a fight.

1454
01:33:40,408 --> 01:33:49,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is completely different from the last time Mr. Carrera was with us, but what are your thoughts on that, Mr. Chairman?

1455
01:33:51,525 --> 01:34:00,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, Mr. Carrera stated a few things in the club's defense, which I agree with.

1456
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:07,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure we all agree with that you can't control anybody's tempers or behavior.

1457
01:34:08,129 --> 01:34:15,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to me losing a cook and a couple of members is pretty much punishment enough.

1458
01:34:17,872 --> 01:34:21,134
[SPEAKER_07]: especially today, is it's tough to replace.

1459
01:34:21,174 --> 01:34:31,540
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, what I would like to ask Mr. Carrera is, you are still the club manager, correct?

1460
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1461
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1462
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:38,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And is Mr. Jose Figueredo?

1463
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:40,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Figueredo is the president.

1464
01:34:40,945 --> 01:34:41,825
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the president.

1465
01:34:41,845 --> 01:34:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1466
01:34:42,225 --> 01:34:42,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1467
01:34:49,692 --> 01:35:08,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking over your application that we had on file and you are listed as the manager and Mr. Fugitio is club clerk, but we'll call club clerk the president.

1468
01:35:10,598 --> 01:35:22,363
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that was very impressive to me when I first read the report was that he responded to the scene and immediately shut down the establishment, which I thought was a very good move.

1469
01:35:25,165 --> 01:35:31,268
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was going to ask you to do was do another

1470
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:37,806
[SPEAKER_07]: another application, but I see there's no need, because he's the club president.

1471
01:35:38,106 --> 01:35:38,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1472
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:45,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And our records are accurate, so there's no need to do that.

1473
01:35:45,592 --> 01:35:54,300
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to save you $200 to $400 right there, because that's what it would have cost you to create a new application.

1474
01:35:56,561 --> 01:36:05,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I would ask you to do is just read over the rules and regulations of private clubs for the city of Medford.

1475
01:36:06,008 --> 01:36:10,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Daria can send you a copy of that via email or whatever.

1476
01:36:10,571 --> 01:36:12,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

1477
01:36:13,713 --> 01:36:15,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Brush yourself up on it.

1478
01:36:15,754 --> 01:36:17,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're aware of everything.

1479
01:36:17,575 --> 01:36:19,475
[SPEAKER_07]: The guest book, all that stuff.

1480
01:36:20,696 --> 01:36:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a list of all the club members handy.

1481
01:36:23,957 --> 01:36:29,740
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be displayed, but if someone should come in, like Lieutenant Lockowitz or Officer Sebastian,

1482
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:35,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And they ask for it, which you did have everything correct.

1483
01:36:36,044 --> 01:36:37,926
[SPEAKER_07]: You had your licenses posted.

1484
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:41,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You had, you know, information and stuff for them.

1485
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:46,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So just review it and make sure that you're compliant.

1486
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:50,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, like I said, I feel bad enough for you now.

1487
01:36:50,576 --> 01:36:52,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not easy with private clubs.

1488
01:36:52,798 --> 01:36:54,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of a struggling thing.

1489
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:59,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel as though personally that

1490
01:37:00,393 --> 01:37:01,993
[SPEAKER_07]: We can let this one slide by.

1491
01:37:02,013 --> 01:37:12,056
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been doing good since we had that last incident with the food and running a restaurant type of thing.

1492
01:37:12,136 --> 01:37:15,197
[SPEAKER_07]: But you didn't know, and that's how you learn.

1493
01:37:15,277 --> 01:37:23,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just had one- I just wanted to point out about the chairman and the discussion.

1494
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:31,423
[SPEAKER_05]: One question out of curiosity, I remember several years ago, there was an altercation, I think, at the Legion.

1495
01:37:32,544 --> 01:37:36,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was one of those, you can't control people's emotions, I get that.

1496
01:37:37,726 --> 01:37:45,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But they took what really saved their butt, so to speak, was they followed the proper procedures.

1497
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:51,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the only question I have, Mr. Carrera, is did you

1498
01:37:53,663 --> 01:38:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: or someone there called 911 or did one of your patrons, how did the police get involved in this altercation?

1499
01:38:03,928 --> 01:38:16,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the bartender is a woman, so she felt helpless, so she called 911 to come and take over the situation because she can't go there and separate them or do anything.

1500
01:38:17,035 --> 01:38:21,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of your staff initiated the call?

1501
01:38:21,297 --> 01:38:21,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1502
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:23,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1503
01:38:24,533 --> 01:38:25,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's another plus.

1504
01:38:26,254 --> 01:38:26,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1505
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:31,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's important that, you know, it wasn't swept under the table.

1506
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:35,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as the, everyone left, they decided to call.

1507
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1508
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:44,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Ben, would you like to comment on this as well?

1509
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:51,731
[SPEAKER_07]: have been made.

1510
01:38:52,331 --> 01:38:54,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for a second there.

1511
01:38:54,392 --> 01:39:01,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, is there anybody else present that wants to speak either in favor or against this matter?

1512
01:39:04,754 --> 01:39:04,914
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1513
01:39:05,334 --> 01:39:05,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1514
01:39:06,634 --> 01:39:08,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Officer Lockowitz.

1515
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:18,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else from the P. D. No, I'm I'm satisfied with the outcome, you know, documenting, discussing and it seems like corrective actions have already been taken.

1516
01:39:18,497 --> 01:39:19,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1517
01:39:21,593 --> 01:39:26,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, I don't have an issue with.

1518
01:39:27,956 --> 01:39:36,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing like I said, what we just discussed that there's been punishment served already enough by losing a couple of members in a book.

1519
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:41,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel as though that's that's more than applicable.

1520
01:39:43,585 --> 01:39:46,206
[SPEAKER_07]: if you feel the same way, Mr. Commissioner.

1521
01:39:46,726 --> 01:39:51,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben, would you care to comment on any of this before we wrap it up?

1522
01:39:52,688 --> 01:39:58,470
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think everything you said is good, Bobby.

1523
01:39:58,611 --> 01:40:03,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any further action is needed from us.

1524
01:40:03,692 --> 01:40:05,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's all been cleared up.

1525
01:40:08,615 --> 01:40:09,576
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion.

1526
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:11,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

1527
01:40:11,076 --> 01:40:30,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we'll take this incident, put it in the jacket, in the file cabinet, and if we start seeing a trend as the months and the years go on, then we'll take a little more, not punitive, but we'll take the necessary action.

1528
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:33,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

1529
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:38,163
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've seen clubs deal with it way worse, so.

1530
01:40:40,263 --> 01:40:43,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think you guys dealt with it.

1531
01:40:45,464 --> 01:40:49,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so should we make a motion or are we just good?

1532
01:40:50,285 --> 01:40:57,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we'd make a motion to like file the disposition as a warning and keep the report on file.

1533
01:40:58,742 --> 01:40:59,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1534
01:41:00,342 --> 01:41:01,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good advice.

1535
01:41:01,523 --> 01:41:07,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to enter the information on file.

1536
01:41:07,344 --> 01:41:09,165
[SPEAKER_05]: We're aware of what happened.

1537
01:41:10,305 --> 01:41:11,866
[SPEAKER_05]: We've properly discussed it.

1538
01:41:11,926 --> 01:41:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Carrera has taken the necessary steps, and as a result, there has been some residual effect as a result of the event.

1539
01:41:19,868 --> 01:41:27,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's just put it on file, and hopefully we'll never have to revisit another incident at the establishment.

1540
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,260
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I hope.

1541
01:41:31,542 --> 01:41:32,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben, you want to second that?

1542
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:34,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second that motion.

1543
01:41:35,325 --> 01:41:35,705
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

1544
01:41:36,246 --> 01:41:37,046
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1545
01:41:37,527 --> 01:41:37,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1546
01:41:39,328 --> 01:41:40,129
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1547
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

1548
01:41:43,891 --> 01:41:44,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion's passed.

1549
01:41:45,212 --> 01:41:46,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Garrett, you're all set.

1550
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very sorry again for your troubles.

1551
01:41:50,456 --> 01:41:54,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep running a good tight ship like you do, and we won't have any issues.

1552
01:41:54,559 --> 01:41:56,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be afraid to call if there are any issues.

1553
01:41:56,761 --> 01:41:57,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I always do my best.

1554
01:41:58,603 --> 01:41:59,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a teachable moment.

1555
01:41:59,604 --> 01:42:04,709
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know what went wrong, and you'll make sure, as I said, from listening to you, you said you won't.

1556
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:11,777
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll take, hopefully your other members will take the necessary steps to prevent something from escalating like that again.

1557
01:42:11,797 --> 01:42:12,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1558
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:13,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1559
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

1560
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,061
[SPEAKER_17]: I will.

1561
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:18,284
[SPEAKER_17]: I will see you guys on the 25th.

1562
01:42:18,304 --> 01:42:18,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Take care.

1563
01:42:23,097 --> 01:42:23,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford Police.

1564
01:42:23,797 --> 01:42:24,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for coming.

1565
01:42:25,078 --> 01:42:25,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.

1566
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:27,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you'd like to comment on?

1567
01:42:27,599 --> 01:42:28,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you good?

1568
01:42:30,021 --> 01:42:30,601
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're good.

1569
01:42:31,161 --> 01:42:36,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Officer Farrell and Sebastian are both good for the day, and I don't have anything further.

1570
01:42:36,324 --> 01:42:37,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you, gentlemen?

1571
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1572
01:42:40,386 --> 01:42:42,107
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I think we're good.

1573
01:42:42,127 --> 01:42:42,747
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, thank you.

1574
01:42:42,767 --> 01:42:43,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks again.

1575
01:42:44,008 --> 01:42:45,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

1576
01:42:45,169 --> 01:42:45,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, guys.

1577
01:42:48,752 --> 01:42:55,435
[SPEAKER_18]: I got two reports I'll be forwarding to you, both from the Great American Beer Hall.

1578
01:42:56,356 --> 01:43:05,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute, why didn't you tell us that before?

1579
01:43:07,341 --> 01:43:09,583
[SPEAKER_18]: One I happen to be in the building for.

1580
01:43:12,284 --> 01:43:13,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Officially or unofficially?

1581
01:43:15,385 --> 01:43:18,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Unofficially, I was in there with half a dozen dispatchers.

1582
01:43:19,488 --> 01:43:20,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1583
01:43:21,249 --> 01:43:24,552
[SPEAKER_18]: But neither one of them were overly concerning.

1584
01:43:25,572 --> 01:43:26,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1585
01:43:27,054 --> 01:43:34,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a feeling we're going to probably, they're going to be a frequent flyer because of the enormity of people in there.

1586
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:37,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so enormous that things are bound to happen.

1587
01:43:38,182 --> 01:43:39,943
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so big that things happen.

1588
01:43:41,444 --> 01:43:43,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I drive by at night, the place is packed.

1589
01:43:44,617 --> 01:43:44,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yup.

1590
01:43:44,857 --> 01:43:47,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mystic Ave is packed with cars.

1591
01:43:47,779 --> 01:43:49,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Hancock Ave is packed with cars.

1592
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,382
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, you can't even get in that joint.

1593
01:43:53,723 --> 01:43:56,124
[SPEAKER_18]: People come down Mystic Avenue at night.

1594
01:43:56,184 --> 01:44:01,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1595
01:44:01,647 --> 01:44:02,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I get to jump off.

1596
01:44:02,928 --> 01:44:05,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I will, I got to do some finishing touches and then forward them off.

1597
01:44:07,271 --> 01:44:08,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that's all I got.

1598
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:09,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1599
01:44:09,932 --> 01:44:11,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be looking forward to your reports.

1600
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:12,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

1601
01:44:16,677 --> 01:44:17,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you guys.

1602
01:44:17,838 --> 01:44:18,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1603
01:44:18,579 --> 01:44:19,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Take care.

1604
01:44:19,399 --> 01:44:20,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

1605
01:44:22,442 --> 01:44:27,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good job.

1606
01:44:27,286 --> 01:44:28,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1607
01:44:28,507 --> 01:44:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1608
01:44:30,228 --> 01:44:34,552
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we, it was quite a meeting almost 2 hours, but, um.

1609
01:44:35,813 --> 01:44:48,799
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, you know, I was a little peed off when I got that email from you earlier that what they did expecting you to do all that work and we got to set something up.

1610
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:58,304
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that this is how this stuff needs to be submitted from this point forward, because you can't be expected to edit their documents and everything else.

1611
01:44:58,444 --> 01:45:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You should get 1 packet and that should be it.

1612
01:45:02,126 --> 01:45:12,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I, I would yeah, I get it probably should have said something to them too, but I'm just like, I can't when it's a big package like that.

1613
01:45:12,658 --> 01:45:13,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to.

1614
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I 1st, have to deal with and.

1615
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so big, I can't scan it all in, you know what I mean?

1616
01:45:19,915 --> 01:45:24,680
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to do it little by little, and then it's just like taking them apart again.

1617
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:31,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like, it ends up, I just wanted to let you know, this is why I don't have it yet, because I just haven't had the time to do it.

1618
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:36,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're saying you have to scan all those little individual mailings?

1619
01:45:37,012 --> 01:45:39,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's like this.

1620
01:45:40,394 --> 01:45:41,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this.

1621
01:45:41,755 --> 01:45:43,376
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it, it's stapled.

1622
01:45:44,056 --> 01:45:45,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't go through the printer.

1623
01:45:45,477 --> 01:45:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets stuck.

1624
01:45:46,497 --> 01:45:47,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm doing one at a time.

1625
01:45:48,198 --> 01:45:49,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've got to handle it twice.

1626
01:45:49,539 --> 01:45:52,140
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to make a copy of it and then scan it.

1627
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got to put it together in a package.

1628
01:45:54,922 --> 01:45:55,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1629
01:45:55,343 --> 01:45:58,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like I know they probably just didn't think about that.

1630
01:45:58,107 --> 01:46:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to come off as, you know, rude or not wanting to do.

1631
01:46:01,252 --> 01:46:03,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it ends up being a lot.

1632
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:06,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just don't have between what I need to do.

1633
01:46:06,721 --> 01:46:07,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have that time.

1634
01:46:08,804 --> 01:46:10,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1635
01:46:10,845 --> 01:46:12,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a lot of stuff to do.

1636
01:46:13,865 --> 01:46:18,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we just try and do our best and try and get as much done as we can.

1637
01:46:19,627 --> 01:46:35,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everything went very well today considering, but I don't think we really have anything going on that's in limbo other than the meeting that's next week, I believe.

1638
01:46:36,392 --> 01:46:37,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Next Wednesday, yes.

1639
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:54,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, you know, you were able to send out another email to the department head, seeing if any of them wanted to do like a five minute talk about what's to expect, what the licensee should, what they expect of the licensee.

1640
01:46:56,163 --> 01:47:02,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was planning to do that today, because I had to reach out to a few department heads just for a different reason.

1641
01:47:03,264 --> 01:47:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I'm going to be asking that today.

1642
01:47:06,485 --> 01:47:06,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think

1643
01:47:07,845 --> 01:47:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody got back to me besides police chief.

1644
01:47:13,931 --> 01:47:15,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I got to ask him next time I see him.

1645
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was talking to Ralph and he said that might be a good idea.

1646
01:47:21,624 --> 01:47:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: He says to do, because now the licensees know what the department heads expect.

1647
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:30,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it comes time for renewal, it's a lot easier.

1648
01:47:30,434 --> 01:47:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it would be helpful information, but everybody else is able to come.

1649
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:37,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's I'm happy about that.

1650
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:37,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to ask.

1651
01:47:38,703 --> 01:47:47,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, but I don't think, um, I don't think it would be a problem because I know I, I send the request to, um, Lieutenant Lockovitz to, to have him attend.

1652
01:47:49,391 --> 01:47:49,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1653
01:47:50,152 --> 01:47:50,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1654
01:47:50,492 --> 01:47:55,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't, I don't really know if there's too much for the chief to really.

1655
01:47:55,636 --> 01:48:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why sometimes, that's why sometimes I, um, ask Lieutenant Lockovitz versus the chief, but I think I've asked them both.

1656
01:48:06,547 --> 01:48:07,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Rory speak last year?

1657
01:48:08,108 --> 01:48:08,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?

1658
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:09,669
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.

1659
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:11,330
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a really good job.

1660
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why I wanted him to be here again.

1661
01:48:14,471 --> 01:48:16,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be nice if they could do that, if he could.

1662
01:48:17,113 --> 01:48:26,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It was him and Penny last year, so both of them did a really good job, because they touched on the tips, and then the over-serving, and then all of that good stuff.

1663
01:48:26,278 --> 01:48:30,820
[SPEAKER_07]: You said they invited out Sophie Greenblum.

1664
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:37,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she said that she will be attending, yeah.

1665
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:52,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm sure Rory and the two officers, Smith and Sebastian, you know, with their part of our team, they should make sure they get an email at least informing of them if they'd like to attend, you know?

1666
01:48:53,136 --> 01:48:53,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

1667
01:48:54,836 --> 01:49:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually will forward to Lieutenant Lockovitz, and then I think he forwards it to the officers, yeah.

1668
01:49:03,098 --> 01:49:13,622
[SPEAKER_05]: cool yeah mr chair i know we're getting close to two hours but um my question um should we be concerned about d1 soccer or not

1669
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good point.

1670
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:21,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, I, I feel as this, this is a 100% police matter.

1671
01:49:22,072 --> 01:49:28,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's disturbing the peace, it's, um, trash in the parks, it's doing all of that.

1672
01:49:28,693 --> 01:49:31,494
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, we've, that's way out of our lane.

1673
01:49:31,514 --> 01:49:34,435
[SPEAKER_07]: What's in our lane is issuing a license.

1674
01:49:35,355 --> 01:49:44,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe, I looked through my records, the last license to be issued to them was for the 15th, which was when that whole melee occurred.

1675
01:49:45,598 --> 01:49:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's up to the city to deny these people for rent in OML if they don't.

1676
01:49:54,812 --> 01:49:57,293
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do we give them the ultimatum?

1677
01:49:57,413 --> 01:49:58,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to start now?

1678
01:49:58,633 --> 01:50:12,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, listen, obviously, if client, your attendees are getting hammered every time they go there, and the party's going long after the games, and it's not for the game anymore, it's just to have a big gathering.

1679
01:50:12,299 --> 01:50:17,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can deny them a license.

1680
01:50:17,941 --> 01:50:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm wondering if you're right.

1681
01:50:19,961 --> 01:50:21,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be a good question for Ralph.

1682
01:50:21,662 --> 01:50:22,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1683
01:50:22,443 --> 01:50:23,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it starts with us.

1684
01:50:24,867 --> 01:50:33,020
[SPEAKER_05]: If we say no, this dude can have the event there and if they want to sneak drinks out in the parking lot, will they do it at their own risk?

1685
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's got nothing to do with us.

1686
01:50:35,521 --> 01:50:49,492
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you know, I'd like to just run it by Ralph even on the 25th privately just to make sure we're not putting the city out there in discrimination or something.

1687
01:50:49,512 --> 01:50:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what's the matter?

1688
01:50:51,213 --> 01:50:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't like black soccer players or Spanish soccer, whatever.

1689
01:50:55,316 --> 01:50:56,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know.

1690
01:50:56,517 --> 01:50:57,978
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

1691
01:50:58,939 --> 01:51:02,282
[SPEAKER_05]: We see the residual effect from those events there.

1692
01:51:03,142 --> 01:51:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the first thing, you know, honestly, the first thing that came into my mind was the one at the Pats game.

1693
01:51:13,126 --> 01:51:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy stole, he was so drunk from tailgating and partying, he stole the car out of the parking lot and the state police chased him and he went the wrong way and he killed somebody coming the other way.

1694
01:51:26,031 --> 01:51:26,731
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't start to.

1695
01:51:26,771 --> 01:51:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't start to.

1696
01:51:29,287 --> 01:51:29,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1697
01:51:29,747 --> 01:51:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1698
01:51:30,227 --> 01:51:33,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, well, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

1699
01:51:34,709 --> 01:51:34,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1700
01:51:35,169 --> 01:51:35,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1701
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:37,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're going to be applying anymore.

1702
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:49,695
[SPEAKER_07]: They share anyways, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1703
01:51:50,918 --> 01:51:56,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the allowing that event to happen, that should sort of isn't our thing.

1704
01:51:56,382 --> 01:51:57,123
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more like.

1705
01:51:57,784 --> 01:52:00,466
[SPEAKER_15]: City has to decide, do they want to, you know.

1706
01:52:00,486 --> 01:52:03,368
[SPEAKER_15]: 2000 person event somewhere 1st.

1707
01:52:03,828 --> 01:52:10,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, and then issue the conditions around the event, like, you've got to have way more parking control.

1708
01:52:10,254 --> 01:52:11,315
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to have a plan.

1709
01:52:11,355 --> 01:52:12,035
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to have more.

1710
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:19,006
[SPEAKER_15]: security, you know, and then it can come to us and we can say, yeah, we'll give liquor or not.

1711
01:52:19,046 --> 01:52:21,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel like that's proper.

1712
01:52:21,549 --> 01:52:24,553
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just throwing a little gasoline on the fire.

1713
01:52:24,673 --> 01:52:25,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1714
01:52:25,494 --> 01:52:26,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1715
01:52:27,296 --> 01:52:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: It's.

1716
01:52:27,797 --> 01:52:29,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, why?

1717
01:52:31,121 --> 01:52:31,321
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1718
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:32,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Gasoline on the fire.

1719
01:52:32,443 --> 01:52:33,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the liquor part?

1720
01:52:33,938 --> 01:52:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1721
01:52:34,658 --> 01:52:36,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I mean of an unorganized event.

1722
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:42,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you can hear me, but of an unorganized event, liquor adds to it as a problem.

1723
01:52:42,163 --> 01:52:53,129
[SPEAKER_15]: But an organized event that has everything in order, I mean, sure, you know, the city's okay with it, but this one doesn't seem organized whatsoever.

1724
01:52:53,989 --> 01:52:57,131
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and they've got to get tons more security.

1725
01:52:57,932 --> 01:53:05,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Once the parking lot fills up, they got to have parking attendance, you know, over to the McGlynn to the Andrews.

1726
01:53:07,098 --> 01:53:17,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can't direct them over to where the Meadow Glen might used to be because that's private property, but it's just an event that big, it's got to tell you the city cannot handle it.

1727
01:53:17,943 --> 01:53:25,307
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the capacity for cars and something that large.

1728
01:53:26,107 --> 01:53:28,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't think they do too.

1729
01:53:28,649 --> 01:53:35,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they don't realize how big that event is because they certainly don't have the proper staffing,

1730
01:53:36,253 --> 01:53:38,916
[SPEAKER_05]: or equipment to handle that large of a crowd.

1731
01:53:38,976 --> 01:53:46,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said, every year, if it keeps growing, I mean, it wasn't that big when they first started having the event at Hormel.

1732
01:53:46,763 --> 01:53:49,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It is evolved or it's grown into something much larger.

1733
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:51,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

1734
01:53:52,569 --> 01:54:00,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we should look into all aspects of it and just, you know, I don't feel comfortable issuing.

1735
01:54:00,716 --> 01:54:00,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

1736
01:54:02,518 --> 01:54:04,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Issuing them a one day license.

1737
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:08,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't feel comfortable doing that anymore after seeing what's happened constantly at first.

1738
01:54:09,485 --> 01:54:21,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's something that the cities, you know, that parks and recreation department, you know, had an argument with the guys or the organization or something, but you can see it's just over and over and over again.

1739
01:54:21,497 --> 01:54:24,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you get police reports stating that's unsafe, it's a public.

1740
01:54:26,042 --> 01:54:30,263
[SPEAKER_07]: public issue, public hazard issue, public safety issue is a word, I'm sorry.

1741
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:33,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, we can't have that.

1742
01:54:33,764 --> 01:54:35,964
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't have a public safety issue in the city.

1743
01:54:37,005 --> 01:54:39,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just gonna put the city out there liability wise.

1744
01:54:39,705 --> 01:54:48,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we get the okay from Ralph that we don't have to issue the one day licenses, we'll discuss it.

1745
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:49,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we all feel the same way,

1746
01:54:51,649 --> 01:54:57,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no more licenses for them if the city wants to give them permission to use the pack.

1747
01:54:58,233 --> 01:55:00,115
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got nothing to do with us.

1748
01:55:00,435 --> 01:55:00,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1749
01:55:00,835 --> 01:55:01,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1750
01:55:02,136 --> 01:55:03,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

1751
01:55:04,693 --> 01:55:06,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way I feel.

1752
01:55:06,554 --> 01:55:10,816
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel?

1753
01:55:11,436 --> 01:55:12,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the same way.

1754
01:55:13,757 --> 01:55:17,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I don't think they realize how big the event is.

1755
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:23,021
[SPEAKER_05]: If all of a sudden they start telling us, oh, we have 150 people that are going to be

1756
01:55:23,761 --> 01:55:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: work in the event and we're, you know, all right, we'll entertain, you know, what they're going to do to keep the whole thing in check.

1757
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:36,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

1758
01:55:37,353 --> 01:55:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be next year, right?

1759
01:55:38,794 --> 01:55:41,056
