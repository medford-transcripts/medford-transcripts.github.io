    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=0.211">the</a>  public meeting of the city of medford liquor license commission for 9 18 2024 will come to order uh we have an agenda to follow and the first thing on the agenda is to review the minutes of the august 21st 2024 license commission meeting um <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=29.0">I</a>  reviewed these myself is a couple of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=37.347">My</a>  number five carried over to this month's meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=42.411">I</a>  made a note that was that one day application for deep cuts, correct?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=47.855">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=48.296">We're</a>  going to be reviewing that today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=50.717">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=52.138">And</a>  the other question I had, I know there was a question whether we've received payment or not yet from Lifetime Gym. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=59.78">We</a>  did, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=60.92">We</a>  did, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=62.441">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=64.081">Other</a>  than that, that looked good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=66.662">My</a>  fellow commissioners, if you had a chance to review them, I'll also look to you guys.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=73.703">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I did number two regarding Blue Fuji. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=81.857">I</a>  wasn't sure if that was what we, it says the commission will have the liquor license on probation for one year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=89.839">Was</a>  that the language we used or did we say something to the effect that if there was another infraction within 12 years, within 12 months?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=102.521">No,</a>  from what I remember, we were doing a probation for all of them, from what I understood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=111.73">Bobby,</a>  is that correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=113.691">So</a>  from what I understood, we were doing probation for all of them for a year after the incidents, right?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=121.456">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=122.217">We</a>  followed the same penalty for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=129.481">I</a>  believe we also added in a one-day suspension and abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=139.469">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=140.249">Because</a>  they didn't show when they were supposed to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=146.251">We</a>  can probably correct that and put that in there because that was just one level above what the other ones were. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=156.033">That's</a>  a good catch, Alan.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=157.613">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=158.093">I</a>  knew there was something more to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=161.154">When</a>  I read that, it just didn't look complete.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=165.25">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=167.371">And</a>  we've arranged just for information, we've arranged a meeting with Blue Fuji. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=175.573">We're</a>  still trying to finalize the date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=180.155">But</a>  I wasn't convinced that they understood everything we had to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=185.676">And</a>  I know there was a language barrier there for me last month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=191.218">And</a>  so we just want to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=194.919">get</a>  together with them with a translator so that we could let them know exactly what we were trying to tell them last month and have them acknowledge that they know what we said and they'll be able to comply, especially with the TIP certification and all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=217.545">That's</a>  in the works and it's nothing we need a public meeting for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=222.106">It's</a>  just an interpretation because we've already made the decision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=226.107">We've</a>  gone through all of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=232.19">It's</a>  just we want to make sure they understand it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=234.75">It's</a>  not going to be anything new other than what we discussed at the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=241.783">So,</a>  that's that's really about it that I have with the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=247.327">Last</a>  month's meeting minutes, Ben, how about yourself?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=250.21">I</a>  was not at the last month's meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=252.151">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=253.578">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=254.118">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=254.579">So</a>  this is good information for you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=257.881">I'm</a>  just re-read it all.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=261.143">Other</a>  than that little tweak, I'm fine with the minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=265.385">I'd</a>  motion to accept the minutes for the August 21st meeting and put them on public record.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=275.412">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=276.572">Do</a>  we have a second?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=283.004">Yeah,</a>  I'll second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=285.605">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=286.385">Oh,</a>  you're right there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=287.726">I'll</a>  second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=289.746">I'll</a>  second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=290.587">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=291.987">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=293.168">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=294.829">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=295.969">Hearing</a>  and seeing none. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=297.63">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=298.851">Motion</a>  passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=300.951">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=302.932">Why</a>  don't we get right down to business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=305.193">We</a>  have <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=308.133">On</a>  the agenda, Representative from Great American Bayhoe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=313.297">Do</a>  we have Brian or someone here?</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=365.033">How</a>  about that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=365.553">How</a>  you doing, Brian? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=367.093">Ah,</a>  crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=367.914">September</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=370.134">Good</a>  crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=370.574">Yeah,</a>  it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=372.634">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=374.355">Tell</a>  us a little bit about what's going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=376.775">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=377.575">So</a>  it's essentially it's a copy and paste of another one of our gaming nights that we've done here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=384.017">Video</a>  game focused, but we do other board games and other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=388.997">This</a>  one's focused around NBA, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=393.816">NBA</a>  2K, I think is what it's called. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=395.537">So,</a>  yeah, it's a video game, Ming Night tournament, copy and paste of the other ones we've done before.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=401.962">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=404.904">Yeah,</a>  I mean, Brian, you always do a great job, never have any issues there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=412.93">You</a>  know, I know all of your documents are in order, everything's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=417.214">I</a>  just wanted to mention to you, I'm not sure whether you're aware of it or not, but we do have a, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=424.058">a</a>  new online form for one day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=427.039">Um,</a>  you can, it's easy to fill out online, sends right to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=431.942">And,</a>  um, there's a couple of new questions on it about entertainment and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=436.244">So</a>  if you can get on board with that, that'd be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=439.226">That's</a>  grand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=439.786">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=441.026">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=441.407">It'll</a>  be just trying to streamline a few things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=444.748">Um,</a>  but other than that, it all looked good for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=448.47">Um,</a>  Alan, Ben,</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=480.518">Is</a>  that from January to December? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=483.299">The</a>  calendar year, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=485.339">Yeah,</a>  I don't anticipate us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=487.9">Kidding</a>  it, but I mean, I do have an, I do have a counter on some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=491.605">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1112.055">Okay,</a>  and okay, I understand both of them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1119.501">My</a>  fellow commissioners, any questions on both?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1122.903">No,</a>  I'm good with both, but if, so we need two, one sketch and two liability or two sketches and one liability?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001706_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1133.251">And</a>  one liability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1134.151">Can</a>  you just double confirm with me that the insurance that you have on hand is for the speed dating? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1142.488">The</a>  date on beads 921. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1145.329">I</a>  just want to double check.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1147.25">It's</a>  for 114 high street and it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1153.594">Yes,</a>  at least to your date.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001706_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1156.195">So</a>  that's probably mine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1157.576">That's</a>  probably for the 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1160.157">That's</a>  probably for the fall festival. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1165.885">I</a>  can double check with Laura at the church and just tell her to send me both and I'll just send you both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1171.167">That</a>  way you have everything and then I'll send you both sketches, both insurances in one year.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1179.03">Yeah,</a>  it looks like you need both sketches and we'll have one insurance for a dating event, but not for the fall festival. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1186.894">So</a>  I think it's two sketches and one liability for 9-28.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1194.112">Yeah,</a>  this liability does say group speed dating event, so it's for that one.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001706_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1200.877">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1201.517">So</a>  I'll send all that in one email just to make sure I got it all to you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1207.501">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1208.142">And</a>  Ben, are you okay with this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1210.343">Yeah,</a>  I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1211.544">I'm</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1211.824">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1212.905">If</a>  one of you guys want to make a motion, we can either accept the both of them at once, or if you want to do it separate, that's up to you, whatever's easiest.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1448.962">Okay,</a>  so the second event is scheduled for October 13th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1453.384">We</a>  have to update the address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1455.544">We</a>  gave you the wrong address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1457.505">Location</a>  is going to be at our Joyce Cummings Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1460.734">which</a>  is located at 177 College Avenue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1463.736">So</a>  we have a wedding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1465.297">One</a>  of our staff members here, one of our directors of our music center, Jeff Rawich, and his fiancee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1472.421">This</a>  is wedding scheduled from 6 to 9.30 PM. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1475.443">We</a>  expect 200 guests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1477.864">This</a>  will be a full bar application that we're looking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1483.988">What</a>  can I share here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1484.888">So</a>  we have, it's gonna be on Sunday night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1488.65">of</a>  October of Columbus Day weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1491.015">So</a>  we expect very, we don't expect too many students to be on campus. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1496.825">It's</a>  going to be happening in the atrium of the Joyce Cummings Center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1502.121">one-hour</a>  cocktail party, and then they move into dinner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1504.922">So</a>  we've submitted those diagrams. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1507.403">Let</a>  me know if you need those blown up or any kind of square footage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1510.564">I</a>  just noticed that information is not on the diagram. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1514.445">Again,</a>  we'll have Tufts University Police will be our security for the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1519.787">We'll</a>  have upwards to four bartenders working this event, and Tufts Catering is servicing all the food for the buffets, the reception, desserts.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1531.523">Okay,</a>  I had noticed on the sketch that you did a pretty nice job with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1539.889">And</a>  I did notice the, when you said the Cummings Center, that it was probably the one on College Ave, but glad you brought it back to our attention. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1549.075">I</a>  see a kid's drink station, but I don't see, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1557.54">Adult</a>  rank station, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1559.182">I'm</a>  assuming by number 180, is that the table where it's going to be?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1565.029">No,</a>  actually, the bar is going to stay out on the atrium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1567.131">So</a>  on that, there should be the atrium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1570.836">You</a>  should have two diagrams for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1573.058">Yes,</a>  I do.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1574.28">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1575.301">I</a>  couldn't read. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1577.026">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1577.787">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1581.332">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1582.414">Are</a>  you referring to the wedding celebration or the October facade? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1587.161">Which</a>  one are you referring to?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1588.543">The</a>  wedding.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1590.767">The</a>  wedding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1591.367">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1601.556">Yeah,</a>  there's 2 sketches there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1603.958">1</a>  of them is just the atrium area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1608.341">From</a>  what I understand now, it's going to be where the liquor is going to be served. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1614.906">And</a>  the other sketch is, I guess, inside now, where the wedding is actually going to be.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1619.889">Right,</a>  in the ballrooms.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1643.065">I</a>  believe it's DJ for both.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1645.609">Okay,</a>  just so you're aware, Daryl has got a new one day license online that you can just log on and we've changed a couple of questions in a minute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1656.678">One</a>  of them is asking for entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1658.42">That's</a>  the only reason why I'm asking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1660.301">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1661.262">So</a>  if you can just, if there's no entertainment, just NA or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1665.886">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1668.893">Yeah,</a>  it just may streamline things a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1673.655">Okay,</a>  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1675.315">I</a>  just wanted to run that by you while Alan was looking over the plans there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1685.318">I</a>  know Tufts, you always have your insurance on file and stuff with us, so you're good with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1690.639">We</a>  never have any issues with any events that you folks run. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1694.54">You</a>  do a real good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1696.757">So,</a>  I mean, I don't have a problem with it either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1700.058">The</a>  1 of my fellow commission is Alan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1701.998">Have</a>  you had a chance to review it?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1840.991">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1841.872">We've</a>  been doing this for the past five years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1845.354">It's</a>  a bunch of vendors from the city of Medford and a lot of nonprofits, a lot of for-profits, and we invite the rec, we invite the city, we invite food vendors, and also we have two bands playing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1869.206">We</a>  have a lot of martial arts, dance schools, a lot of fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1878.212">One</a>  of the bands is a Hofstra band, so they play that wonderful German music. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1883.536">And</a>  we have a beer garden, of course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1887.399">And,</a>  um, it's just a lot of fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1890.263">It's</a>  a lot of family entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1891.965">The</a>  fire station brings the smokehouse and people are just some people dress up and wear their, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1902.068">Liedenhosen</a>  and all of that fun stuff and just walk around and have a good time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1907.451">But</a>  it's a great time for the people to get together and see their neighbors and have conversations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1913.734">And</a>  honestly, we get a lot of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1917.076">It</a>  started out as <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1918.697">maybe</a>  a couple hundred here and there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1921.479">And</a>  I really think it's grown to maybe a thousand or so passing through and coming from outside of Medford to see what's going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1932.068">So</a>  it's a lot of good stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1934.429">We've</a>  never had a problem and it's well contained, well maintained. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1941.075">And</a>  we were asking for a one day license and it's beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1948.778">There's</a>  no hard alcohol.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1951.6">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1952.28">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1954.181">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1954.621">Yeah,</a>  I went over it and the sketch as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1960.244">I</a>  do see the beer sales are going to be on River Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1964.046">Is</a>  that going to be the only station? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1966.267">I</a>  know there was a question, possibly two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1970.349">But</a>  if that's the only one that I see, which is fine, it's very containable there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1977.773">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1978.614">And</a>  that is, it's only one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1980.155">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[XXXXXX00105_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1982.116">Laura,</a>  did that change? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1983.937">No,</a>  there is only one station, but since we have the two stages, we were having a flow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1992.182">Yeah,</a>  the entire enclosed area be for consumption.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=1998.306">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2000.488">Yeah,</a>  everything looks good, Gary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2002.509">I</a>  know that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2005.52">believe</a>  you have the insurance on file or is that something we need to get?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2012.205">For</a>  Chamber of Commerce, I think I would need one, just an updated one, and I know they're for a non-profit.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2020.923">Yeah,</a>  so if you can just get that over to Daria, we can, we'll see how Alan and Ben feel about this, and they can make a motion to grant the licenses contingent upon your insurance paper.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2039.03">Yeah,</a>  it's just quite, Tina, River Street, is it blocked off at both ends?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2044.615">So</a>  it is blocked off on the end of where Salem Street is so that the traffic cannot come down.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2051.763">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2056.468">And</a>  Riverside is blocked off where Metro and Citizens Bank are.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2062.053">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2062.974">And</a>  the other end near Harvard Vanguard.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2066.118">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2067.292">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2068.273">No,</a>  I don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2069.954">It's</a>  a nice event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2071.315">I</a>  just hope it doesn't rain October 5th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2073.897">I'm</a>  not, not that I'm putting a crest on it or anything, but I'm good with it.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2079.302">Quick</a>  questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2080.823">Um,</a>  does it have police support, police detail?</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2084.306">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2086.047">Yes,</a>  we do.</p>

    <p>[MjGBHu28DvM_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2096.897">Medford</a>  Brewing is doing this dispensing last year with their first year, and they did a great job.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2103.362">They</a>  seem to do a great job, so that's good to hear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2106.824">So</a>  I have no other questions, then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2108.826">I</a>  think that sounds like a good event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2112.488">I</a>  can make a motion, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2119.033">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2217.779">We</a>  were looking for you earlier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2219.039">We</a>  had you at the top of the list.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2221.88">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2222.52">I</a>  was honestly trapped in an elevator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2227.762">Everett</a>  fired to get there and get me out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2230.222">It</a>  was brutal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2231.703">Oh,</a>  wow.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2233.667">Is</a>  that real, Brian? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2235.028">Is</a>  that like my dog ate my homework?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2237.33">No,</a>  I wish. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2238.551">It</a>  was brutal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2239.893">It</a>  was about 48 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2242.495">It</a>  wasn't funny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2243.876">That's</a>  probably one of the best excuses we've heard yet.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2249.541">I'm</a>  glad Daria's recording this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2258.249">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2260.33">Anyways.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2261.898">Yes,</a>  basically tell us a little bit about what's been happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2265.641">Brian,</a>  you know, where you're at, you know, as far as the partial goes, and what stages you're at, as well as, you know, we'll talk about that first, and then we can talk about the entertainment license on a separate thing.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2281.054">Sure,</a>  yeah, so as far as the partial goes, the street work is almost wrapped up for DOT. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2288.248">But</a>  that really has not much to do with the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2290.229">The</a>  building is the elevator. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2293.21">So</a>  we're waiting for the elevator inspection by the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2296.552">We</a>  have paid the 2,500 to have it expedited, but I still don't have a date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2302.814">So</a>  as soon as that happens, I will have final sign off from the commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2307.396">I</a>  would like to think it's going to be the end of this month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2310.277">September</a>  28th has been our goal the entire time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2313.491">If</a>  we're going to hit that, I'd say 75% yes, 25% no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2318.555">If</a>  not, then it's the week after that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2320.837">So</a>  I know we're really, really close to getting the building all wrapped up as well as the street work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2326.923">How</a>  it's been going, it's been great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2329.445">I</a>  mean, the turnout from the city has been excellent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2331.907">We're</a>  getting bombarded with private requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2333.989">We've</a>  had wedding requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2335.11">We've</a>  had all sorts of people requesting just to have their Christmas parties there, weddings there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2340.828">Really</a>  exciting, really fun to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2342.288">I</a>  think the smartest thing we did was get the private security company, Commonwealth Security. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2346.81">They</a>  check everyone at the door. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2348.11">So</a>  everyone's ID is checked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2349.831">You</a>  have to have a wristband or a stamp to get in to drink in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2354.092">So</a>  it's been really nice seeing the turnout.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2359.23">That</a>  statement is 100% true because last night I was out with my daughter and the first time I drove by the place that I could find a parking space in there and we decided to go in for a refreshment and something to eat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2376.94">The</a>  security asked me for an ID and I asked them back, do you need glasses, buddy? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2383.643">And</a>  he says, no, our policy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2387.245">Sorry,</a>  sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2388.526">They</a>  show my ID, stamp my hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2390.968">And</a>  I tell you, I was very, very impressed by that, which was great.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2394.21">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2394.89">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2395.35">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2395.891">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2396.951">And</a>  like I said, everything was good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2398.512">So</a>  yeah, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2399.733">I</a>  didn't mean to interrupt you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2400.874">It's</a>  just when you brought it up, I wanted to.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2403.468">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2403.948">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2404.429">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2404.969">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2405.429">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2405.649">That</a>  was the smartest thing we did and they've been excellent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2408.171">Um,</a>  we really, it's really been happy crowds, a lot of families. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2411.893">Um,</a>  so it will be nice to get the second floor open cause we are going to be 21 plus up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2416.195">It's</a>  just nice to kind of have adults enjoy a section and get away from the kids.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2421.916">Right</a>  right and now is that um something that's going to be in the near future or is it just the elevator because i noticed that you had an upstairs patio as well so everything everything else is ready to go the siding is all there i didn't want to put that up and have anyone go up there to think it's going to be okay to go up there as the building commissioner was like if there's anyone up here we're shutting you down so</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2448.278">Until</a>  we get that elevator inspection sign off the 1 kind of unknown of the rest of this is that's when the other stuff is very easy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2455.768">We've</a>  got the stairs report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2456.909">Everything</a>  else is really, really quick and easy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2458.992">That's</a>  the 1 thing that I'm waiting on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2462.531">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2464.132">Well,</a>  you know, as we've told you before in the past, that if things progress, we would appreciate this coming monthly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2471.796">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2472.977">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2473.477">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2474.258">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2474.718">And</a>  in that way there, once we get to the final thing, full occupancy, we don't have to see it for another year.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2484.244">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2484.664">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2485.124">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2485.584">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2485.965">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2487.377">The</a>  okay, great that is all I wanted to touch base with you on you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2497.341">You</a>  guys said the other commission is you have any questions for Brian at this point?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2502.679">No,</a>  no, I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2503.68">I'm</a>  glad it's progressing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2506.201">I</a>  hear nothing but great stuff, Brian, about the place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2508.503">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2509.584">I'm</a>  not surprised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2511.165">It's</a>  a nice venue, so I'm not surprised that you're getting all sorts of fun requests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2516.948">That's</a>  very good.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2518.209">It's</a>  been awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2518.909">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2519.15">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2519.37">It's</a>  everything the three of you wanted in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2522.412">So,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2524.813">So,</a>  is it safe to say that we're in the stretch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2527.455">You</a>  anticipate the elevated pass and inspection? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2530.637">I</a>  do.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2531.037">The</a>  next 10 days or 60 days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2534.279">30</a>  days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2534.679">I</a>  mean, I can't imagine I'd be here at the end of October saying we're still in the same spot, but no, I do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2540.102">Again,</a>  I'm really hopeful for September 28th, but if it's not then, it's the weekend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2544.725">It's</a>  the week after. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2545.346">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2547.909">So</a>  that's all ready to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2549.029">You're</a>  just waiting for an inspector to inspect it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2552.231">Yes,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2553.451">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2554.192">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2554.832">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2555.132">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2555.552">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2556.593">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2557.393">Now,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2557.953">I'm</a>  I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2558.713">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2559.114">Thank</a>  you for the update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2560.074">Thank</a>  you for coming.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2560.814">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2561.014">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2561.415">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2563.8">Ben?</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2564.68">No,</a>  the update sounds great to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2567.841">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2568.381">I</a>  hear nothing but good things about it as well, especially about the security. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2572.363">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2574.323">People</a>  mentioned that, and that sounds really good that you did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2577.924">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2580.285">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2580.445">No,</a>  Mr. Commissioner, so it's just the entertainment license part here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2587.587">Is</a>  this going to sort of cover things that are <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2590.929">This</a>  will cover things that are yet to still be opened at the place, which Brian is just telling us about, which is like the second floor patio, etc., right?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2601.94">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2602.7">Well,</a>  I would imagine the entertainment, it's pretty much what you listed here, and that's pretty much what I saw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2614.167">I</a>  mean, when I was in there last night, but obviously there were no stages and no performances or anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2620.81">So,</a>  Brian, if you could tell us a little bit about what you plan on doing with the performers, the patrons and the devices. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2630.414">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2632.975">So</a>  Friday nights, we're looking at a DJ from 8 to 11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2638.359">On</a>  Saturdays, we're looking at live music bands from 9 to 12 or 8 to 11. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2645.985">During</a>  the day, we were actually thinking about more of like an acoustic during the day, but it's just we need the room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2652.811">It</a>  gets filled in there pretty quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2656.546">And</a>  so that's really what we're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2659.568">We're</a>  showing the TVs, those two big screen TVs, Patriots games. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2664.13">We</a>  put the noise on for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2666.511">Everything</a>  else is just background music.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2669.013">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2670.642">Um,</a>  and then, um, the performers and stuff like that, that's all going to be contained indoors, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2678.986">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2679.386">Indoors.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2679.866">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2680.207">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2681.907">And</a>  it's, you said outside, I think just maybe some acoustical, uh, entertainment or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2688.13">Yeah,</a>  we were, we were thinking about, I don't think we're going to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2691.232">Uh,</a>  just that the space too valuable as is.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2695.274">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2695.714">Up</a>  the room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2697.698">All</a>  right, and I noticed too that you had, what was it here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2705.122">Total</a>  number of devices located on the premise 31. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2708.224">You're</a>  counting each speaker and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2713.206">The</a>  sound system counts as one versus. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2717.362">Well,</a>  no, the only reason being is because they charge you for every 10, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2721.287">So</a>  it's got it for every 10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2723.53">So</a>  it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2724.07">That's</a>  100 bucks just in speakers.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2728.396">Mr.</a>  Chairman, why did you bring that up?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2730.538">You</a>  know, I know the city needs the money, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2734.984">That</a>  area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2737.668">But</a>  anyways, yeah, so yeah, it's just gonna be, from what I can read, it's just a regular, the $300, it's, you're not gonna be going crazy with all those devices, but yeah, I don't have an issue with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2756.198">I</a>  looked at the drawing, it was a little difficult for me to see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2763.362">I</a>  mean, I've got a laser printer and I still couldn't make, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2768.676">make</a>  out what some of the stuff was, but you stated that where it was outlined in black, that was the area that the stages and stuff were going to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2778.239">So</a>  being in there just last night, it looked very familiar to me and I could visualize what was going where.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2789.663">Up</a>  against that, yeah, the green wall all the way to the left underneath the TV. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2793.484">I</a>  can do a better job of outlining it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2796.69">And</a>  then there was 1, right in the middle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2798.531">It</a>  almost looks like where the main entrances that was we're not going to do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2803.914">Yeah,</a>  we're not doing any. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2805.595">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2806.876">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2808.216">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2809.677">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2809.997">I</a>  mean, I, I, I don't have an issue with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2813.079">You</a>  know, like, like, I had said, they. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2816.441">You're</a>  doing a nice job over there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2818.422">I'm</a>  very pleased. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2821.222">Alan,</a>  Ben, you have any questions on the end? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2823.763">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2824.783">No,</a>  I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2826.264">No,</a>  that cleared it up for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2827.704">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2828.304">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2829.785">All</a>  right, awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2830.645">Why</a>  don't you guys want to make a motion and we'll pass that entertainment license?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2839.057">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2841.92">So,</a>  just just to clear it up, Mr. Mr. commissioner, we're going to do Mr. chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2847.785">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2848.265">We're</a>  going to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2850.447">Yeah,</a>  1 entertainment performers patrons and then 1 devices.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2857.113">But</a>  that seems yeah, it should be 1 of each.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2860.976">I</a>  think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2861.737">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2861.937">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2866.394">Okay,</a>  so I'll make a motion to accept the application by Great American Beer Hall for the entertainment license for as they appear on this application here, all city <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2890.515">Departments</a>  have signed off on this application here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2893.596">And</a>  we are approving the entertainment as provided by Ryan and Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2905.718">Yeah,</a>  for the three different, entertainment by performers, entertainment by patrons, and entertainment by devices.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2914.698">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2915.698">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2916.339">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2916.799">Thank</a>  you, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2918.459">I</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2920.7">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2937.047">Take</a>  care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2938.487">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2939.448">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2942.068">Okay,</a>  next on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2945.589">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2949.691">We've</a>  got EST 2024 TBA, the establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2957.493">Is</a>  Matthew Greer here?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2960.294">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2961.295">Good</a>  morning, members of the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2962.955">My</a>  name is Sean Began. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2963.936">I'm</a>  the attorney representing the LLC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2966.537">Matthew</a>  Greer is also on with us as well.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2970.378">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2971.722">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2974.424">Either</a>  Sean or Matthew, you want to tell us a little something about what's going on and what your plans are?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2981.628">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2981.949">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2982.789">So</a>  essentially, Mr. Greer is going to be taking over the location that was formerly occupied by the Porch Restaurant, if your members are familiar where that is, over at 175 Rivers Edge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=2995.161">That</a>  restaurant is closed and essentially Mr. Greer is stepping into what is a turnkey operation where the landlord now owns all the fixtures, equipment, and furniture within that space and Mr. Greer will be renting the space including all of the furniture, fixtures, equipment that are included therein. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3018.009">Mr.</a>  Greer has approximately two decades worth of restaurant experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3023.476">He's</a>  managed and operated restaurants throughout the North Shore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3028.082">He</a>  has another current restaurant in Chelmsford, which is a little bit larger occupancy than this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3035.491">although</a>  this one is pretty good size as well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3037.253">8,000.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3037.774">It's</a>  larger than 8,000 when in Chelmsford? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3041.799">I'm</a>  sorry, Attorney Began.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3043.161">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3044.382">I'm</a>  not sure if the Chelmsford restaurant is larger than 8,000, Matt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3049.088">Matt,</a>  if you could unmute, you can offer a</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3053.966">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3054.426">Hi,</a>  my name is Matthew Brer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3058.028">I</a>  currently run the establishment restaurant in North Chelmsford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3060.809">I'm</a>  looking to move into the space in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3063.31">The</a>  current footprint is about 15,000 square feet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3067.992">We</a>  have a large restaurant and then we offer four function rooms at our current location.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3076.069">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3077.27">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3078.131">This</a>  restaurant, the restaurant that Mr. Greer will be opening at The Porch, it's not going to be an entertainment venue like The Porch was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3087.717">The</a>  Porch was a music venue with restaurant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3092.721">This</a>  is not going to be that focused in that manner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3094.943">This</a>  is going to be more of a traditional sit-down restaurant using the same footprint and using the same layout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3102.508">but</a>  it won't have the bands and things of that nature that the porch was focused on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3111.278">I</a>  think this is a great opportunity for Mr. Greer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3114.379">I</a>  think it's a good opportunity for the city of Medford to get what is now a vacant space reoccupied with someone who brings a couple decades worth of experience and who, based on past history, his track record, is going to be able to get this place running and operating as it should. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3134.384">have</a>  another venue in an area of Medford that doesn't have too many restaurants along that particular area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3141.068">And</a>  I know there are a lot of people living in the apartments over there who I'm sure would appreciate something like this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3148.553">Is</a>  it going to be the same type of food there or is it what type of food they're going to be serving? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3153.955">Matt,</a>  do you want to address the menu?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3155.815">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3156.316">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3156.856">It'll</a>  be the same menu. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3158.816">We'll</a>  roll out with the same menu we currently use in in North Chelmsford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3163.738">But</a>  it's, you know, primary pizza, steak tips, haddock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3168.339">It's</a>  it's it's American fare.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3171.342">So</a>  it's not like a barbecue place like the other one was, smoker and all that stuff.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3176.926">No,</a>  you know, well, it's got a beautiful smoker in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3180.288">So</a>  we'll we'll offer some smoked items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3184.11">But</a>  no, it's it's a more broad menu. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3186.832">And</a>  I think in a in a footprint that big, I think that may have been one of the one of the downfalls there in terms that I took over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3195.398">It</a>  was just an Italian restaurant and they just couldn't fill the space with <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3200.938">So</a>  I think that'll be our big advantage, is offering the menu that we offer.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3208.16">Yeah,</a>  you know, Mr. Gray, you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3209.62">Now,</a>  looking backwards, maybe they were very specific with Medford-style barbecue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3217.163">So</a>  maybe they kind of limit themselves right at the beginning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3221.284">Because</a>  how many times can you keep going back?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3224.285">Right,</a>  right, right, right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3225.485">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3227.868">I've</a>  gone through the 108 pages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3232.11">No</a>  problem with the tenants? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3235.191">I</a>  guess I see everyone had been reached. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3238.993">Any</a>  problems getting the surrounding tenants to be okay with it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3244.695">Any</a>  complaints on them?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3246.295">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3247.376">No</a>  objections from- No objections.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3249.317">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3249.737">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3251.058">And</a>  just help me understand, I'm looking, I see the LLC established 2024 LLC, I see the managers, just kind of help me understand, is Laura Gerrick Cohen and Dawn Zanazzo, are they your sisters?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3270.162">Yes,</a>  yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3270.963">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3271.623">You</a>  got it, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3272.364">It's</a>  a family, family. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3273.565">Me</a>  and my two sisters decided to do this first venture in Chelmsford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3278.188">It</a>  was actually seven years ago we opened up yesterday in North Chelmsford and it's just been, you know, it's been a blast, hugely successful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3286.634">So</a>  yeah, it's the three of us and my brother-in-law, Ron, is also on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3289.837">And</a>  your brother-in-law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3290.978">Yes,</a>  yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3293.029">And</a>  so I got a big team that's gonna help us out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3296.413">So</a>  I'll be spending a lot of time in Medford, at least 40 hours a week, probably more to get this up and running.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3304.195">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3305.275">I'm</a>  very impressed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3307.536">Attorney</a>  Began's correct over 20 years in the industry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3313.977">So</a>  you've seen it all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3315.278">And</a>  now that you're in your mid-50s, you've probably seen everything imaginable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3321.039">So</a>  I applaud your tenacity and staying with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3325.66">And</a>  we thank you for coming into that space because your attorney's correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3330.681">That</a>  when the court started, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3333.562">Fading,</a>  that was huge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3336.023">Who's</a>  going to step in there and give that whole area a shot? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3339.565">Now</a>  that the casino's up and running, as we know, everyone goes someplace first and then they go over to the casino. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3350.45">Hopefully,</a>  as you get going, that'll be a pre-stop or a pre-casino stop at your establishment.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3360.713">Yeah,</a>  and I just wanted to note that Mr. Greer's history of running restaurants, he hasn't had any disciplinary action in all those years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3367.737">So</a>  I think the city's getting a very good restaurateur, a good business person.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3375.902">No,</a>  you're absolutely right, Attorney Began. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3377.643">That's</a>  a good point to bring out, because we look back at it, and we saw no infractions, no brawls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3385.728">So</a>  this is very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3386.948">You</a>  run a tight ship. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3388.949">Kudos.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3390.137">Thank</a>  you, thank you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3391.617">So</a>  I just had a quick question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3392.838">So</a>  the restaurant in Chelmsford, what is the restaurant you have in Chelmsford?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3399.339">It's</a>  called The Establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3400.46">It's</a>  also The Establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3401.8">And</a>  this will also be called The Establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3403.58">This</a>  will be called The Establishment as well for advertising purposes and tying them together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3409.862">And</a>  our website is eatestablishment.com if anybody wants to check it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3414.463">There's</a>  photos and our full menu and everything on there.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3417.977">Yeah,</a>  cool, cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3419.738">And</a>  then just something I thought was interesting, I did go through this whole lease and everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3425.58">And</a>  so it looked like the lease was subject to getting the liquor license approved and that it would start or the lease would start four months after the liquor license was approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3436.723">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3439.584">their</a>  focus is getting a successful restaurant in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3442.767">And</a>  they really liked what I had to offer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3444.608">So</a>  they made the lease very, very friendly for me.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3449.392">Okay,</a>  yeah, yeah, great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3451.133">Were</a>  you able to open it up even prior to that?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3454.495">Is</a>  that what the- That's what I was gonna say, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3456.657">He'll</a>  be able to get in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3458.378">It's</a>  just kind of an incentive to give him four months to kind of start up before rent payment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3462.901">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3464.603">So</a>  you can start, but that was just a term in the lease. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3467.525">I</a>  mean, I'm sort of familiar with commercial leases where if there's a build-out or something that has to happen, they're going to give some free part of it or something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3476.353">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3476.693">Give</a>  them a little runway.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3478.615">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3478.895">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3479.275">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3479.536">That's</a>  a better way to say it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3481.017">And</a>  then I thought it was interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3482.098">So</a>  then the US Foods, is that an existing vendor you have a relationship with, US Foods? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3487.082">Is</a>  that sort of why that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3489.369">It</a>  is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3489.689">It</a>  is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3490.61">Several</a>  months ago, I expanded the space in North Chelmsford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3494.094">So</a>  we had two function rooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3495.736">We</a>  took over some, we're in a big mill building there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3498.399">We</a>  took over some space there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3499.861">So</a>  now we have four function rooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3502.684">We</a>  can do functions up to 150 people now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3507.2">So</a>  when I did that, when I started that project, U.S. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3511.484">Food</a>  did an agreement with me there to get the funding for there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3515.969">And</a>  I've been with U.S. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3517.811">Food</a>  for a long time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3518.973">So</a>  we just got a great partnership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3522.036">So</a>  basically they gave me the funds to open up the restaurant with a commitment for purchases for three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3528.323">years</a>  going forward with US Foods.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3531.205">That's</a>  kind of what we figured because you must have had a good track record with them for them to extend that line of credit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3537.008">And</a>  without any pledge of the license or anything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3541.371">So</a>  again, that speaks to your experience and your time in the industry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3549.456">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3549.676">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3550.952">I</a>  had to ask him twice just to make sure it was a real thing.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3556.996">Yeah,</a>  more for them like they were, you know, the usual thing you see.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3561.879">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3562.239">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3562.339">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3562.559">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3570.292">Well,</a>  no, I mean, I would just say I'm glad, I'm glad, you know, I'm glad a quality restaurant is going in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3575.516">I</a>  mean, that space is more or less new, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3578.179">It</a>  was just built out right before COVID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3583.483">I</a>  know the builders who did it and, you know, it's a quality space and seems like a good opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3589.848">And</a>  yeah, yeah, I was surprised that they, you know, a brand new place like that, they actually went out of business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3594.793">So</a>  I, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3596.814">But</a>  you know more about that than we do oh yeah, and then one other thing was I was also good glad to see that there's like You know there's the there's the whole agreement between the condominium association, and you know and that and I'm just say Noise or anything like that and you know that's sort of a you just want to kind of abide by that with the condominium whatever their rules are about I Don't know No, I you know anything like that you're <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3625.913">In</a>  the past, some complaints from the porch had come to us, and I actually think that that was more between them and the condo than it was the liquor board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3636.984">So</a>  I guess I'm only saying that as a heads up, maybe, on any questions they ever have about noise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3645.237">build</a>  a relationship with them.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3646.938">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3647.298">I</a>  think one of the differences here is where the porters bring in bands, that's not going to be the issue here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3652.162">Yeah,</a>  good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3654.003">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3654.984">Mr.</a>  Greer is going to have TVs, he's got an audio system obviously, but it's going to be, I think, a tamer environment in terms of noise for the other unit owners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3666.031">You're</a>  right, whatever the rules of the condo are is what all the unit owners have to abide by, but I don't think he's going to have any issue there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3674.389">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3675.05">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3675.69">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3676.09">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3677.031">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3679.232">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3680.253">Now,</a>  the package that was submitted to us, I don't think, was it the lease that wasn't signed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3687.658">I'm</a>  sure the package that goes to the state will have signatures on all the contracts and everything, correct?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3693.782">Yesterday,</a>  I emailed over to Daria the signed copy of the lease. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3698.846">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3699.066">We</a>  do have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3701.84">uh,</a>  because some parties were traveling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3703.822">I</a>  couldn't get it till I got to sign coffee.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3707.364">Yeah,</a>  good catch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3709.866">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3711.467">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3712.869">I'm</a>  good, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3714.69">Same</a>  here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3716.551">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3716.852">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3717.252">I</a>  have a few questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3718.813">Um,</a>  the <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3723.658">The</a>  U.S. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3724.418">Foods</a>  gave you the $80,000 line of credit on page 4, number 8 and number 9. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3742.378">Number</a>  eight, financial disclosure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3745.542">The</a>  question, source of financing, is the lender a licensee pursuant to MGL 138? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3752.85">You</a>  did not check off yes or no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3759.573">That</a>  needs to be checked off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3763.936">I</a>  believe it's just to make sure they don't hold the license in the state of Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3769.861">Yeah,</a>  I'll check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3771.502">I</a>  can check that off and submit that page, resubmit that page.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3776.317">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3777.339">The</a>  other thing on that same page, number nine, pledge information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3783.288">Are</a>  you seeking approval for a pledge? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3785.571">It's</a>  got to be checked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3786.493">Yes</a>  or no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3787.374">So</a>  please check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3788.456">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3789.297">That's</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3791.7">And</a>  we did those 2 page 10, I see number 11 made a note of management agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3798.429">Are</a>  you requesting approval user utilize a management company through a management agreement? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3804.177">I</a>  don't think you are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3805.178">I</a>  think you manage your own property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3807.0">So</a>  you'd have to check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3807.981">No,</a>  and that as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3808.923">Please</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3813.275">The</a>  other thing I saw was pages 73 through 79, which was exhibit A, B, and C. They don't show anything to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3825.482">I</a>  mean, it looks like a bunch of lines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3828.704">Nothing</a>  says if it's parking, if it's seeding, if it's... <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3840.455">They're</a>  just drawings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3844.359">What</a>  I did see was on page 33, it shows me the layout of the restaurant, and I was familiar with it because I've patronized it a few times in the past, so I could figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3858.533">But</a>  on A, B, and C, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3863.378">I</a>  don't know, I couldn't make heads or tails of it.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3866.66">Those</a>  exhibits A, B, and C are A, B, and C of the lease agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3871.723">The</a>  plan, and I agree with you, they're not entirely helpful, but they were attached to the lease as it came over from the landlord, but the plan, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3885.382">that</a>  you referenced earlier that's on page 33 is a schematic of the layout which shows specifically where the seating is, where everything is within the restaurant and has all the capacity numbers that I think the commission needs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3901.932">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3903.528">Yeah,</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3905.589">One</a>  of those exhibits, I think, was to show parking.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3910.691">I</a>  think that's like under the building packing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3913.432">That</a>  must be all the spaces, because there's a bunch of them.</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3916.013">A</a>  parking garage, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3917.054">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3918.274">But</a>  that was specific to the lease itself and not necessarily this application.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3925.998">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3926.878">And</a>  I think it was page 79. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3931.7">I'm</a>  familiar with the area and the building and I just wanted to, it was before it used to be known as 150 Rivers Edge, but I know they've changed things since they're up to 600 or even higher for numbers at Rivers Edge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3950.131">But</a>  is there still parking available under the restaurant itself in that building?</p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3959.092">Uh,</a>  in terms of for, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3961.754">Customers</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3964.015">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3964.595">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3965.096">I</a>  was just wondering, uh, because I, I did read something about parking, but I just want to make sure that was still available that they didn't close it off or anything for restaurant patrons. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3977.722">Those</a>  were the only questions I had, but I did want to ask you about something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3985.744">I</a>  know you sent in a last-minute file to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=3991.386">It</a>  was given to her yesterday, and I'm grateful that you did it because it needed the signatures with the lease agreement and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4003.445">But</a>  from what I understand too, there was some additional postal receipts that came in and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4016.007">What</a>  I'm going to suggest to my fellow commissioners is if either yourself as the attorney or the Mr. Greer can put everything <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4032.04">on</a>  an electronic file, a PDF or whatever, and scan everything and put it on the file and send it to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4042.345">Because</a>  Daria can't keep pulling apart your files to try and insert stuff and take stuff out and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4050.309">We</a>  need a final application with all of your signed leases and all of your little individual <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4061.181">Mail</a>  receipts all scheduled and all scanned in along with the hard copies you're required to submit and just send it to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4070.613">So</a>  we can we can approve this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4074.357">You</a>  know, not a problem with the contingency that we received those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4082.268">You</a>  know, that type of 5 electronic file, and I'd paper copy file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4086.98">So,</a>  I mean, we can conditionally approve it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4089.887">It's</a>  just that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4092.774">In</a>  Daria's defense, she doesn't have enough time in a day to do what we ask her to do, never mind putting everybody else's cut and paste and trying to do it for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4103.982">So</a>  we just want to kind of streamline things, make things a little easier. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4108.206">And</a>  it's an electronic file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4110.988">We</a>  have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4111.668">Everybody</a>  can look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4113.37">Perfect.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sean Beagan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4114.557">Yep,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4115.458">We</a>  can have that by tomorrow morning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4117.68">That's</a>  not a problem for my office at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4122.605">On</a>  the record, I just want to say Daria has been tremendously helpful in this process and extremely responsive if I've had a question or an inquiry.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4131.662">Yeah,</a>  she is, and that's why we don't want to make her life and her job more difficult, because like I said, and you said, she's been extraordinary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4144.47">She</a>  does great work, and we just don't want to put any undue work on her back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4151.114">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4153.26">Uh,</a>  so, yeah, that'll be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4154.402">And</a>  if any commissioners would, uh, are okay with that and like, let me make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4160.011">Yeah,</a>  no, we can additionally approve it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4163.998">Yeah,</a>  no, no, I, I motion to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4166.662">to</a>  approve and move forward with the new license request for establishment 2024 LLC conditioned upon a complete and organized package for the city's records and of course ABCC's review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4186.517">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4187.457">And</a>  one question before I approve, I second that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4192.472">Mr.</a>  Chairman, there's the entertainment license also to go with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4196.393">Is</a>  that something we'll separately talk about?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4199.014">Yeah,</a>  we could do that separate if you like, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4201.934">That</a>  way we don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4203.415">I</a>  mean, if you want to tie it, that's fine too, but yeah.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4207.135">Well,</a>  I mean, I have reviewed it and sort of like the last one we looked at, all the signatures are there and.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4214.892">Yeah,</a>  I reviewed it too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4216.413">It's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4217.494">Yeah,</a>  so you can tie it into both if you want to add that on to your motion, Alan.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4221.638">Yeah,</a>  yeah, no, I'll amend my motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4224.28">Let</a>  me add, I approve the entertainment requests for the three categories, I believe, for establishment 2024 LLC.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4245.002">Um,</a>  and I second the motion both for the, uh, new license application and for the entertainment license application for establish, um, for the establishment, um, All righty.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4259.734">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4261.236">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4261.536">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4263.377">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4265.464">And</a>  seeing none, the ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4267.326">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4439.851">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4441.092">Lieutenant</a>  Blakowicz, are you there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4448.388">Did</a>  you leave?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4452.45">We</a>  made him wait a long time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4454.57">I</a>  can see that he's still on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4456.411">Yeah,</a>  I can see him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4458.052">He's</a>  muted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4458.372">I</a>  see Officer Sadas and he's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4460.333">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4462.574">And</a>  who else do we got? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4465.735">Officer</a>  Farrell? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4469.896">Yep,</a>  there she is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4472.983">Uh,</a>  where were you there?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4474.304">Yeah,</a>  I'm here just trying to figure out how to navigate.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4478.266">Okay,</a>  not a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4481.507">I</a>  just want to make sure you were there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4483.148">If</a>  you guys happen to be, I think the last one on the agenda, um, save the best for last, I guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4492.412">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4494.413">All</a>  right, let's see what we got. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4496.234">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4501.008">Okay,</a>  do we have a representative from Paso del Benefica? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4508.518">Is</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4508.999">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4509.8">Good</a>  afternoon, how are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4511.302">Can</a>  you guys hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4513.365">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4514.166">All</a>  right, great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4514.727">Good</a>  afternoon.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4518.274">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4518.914">Um,</a>  well, basically, the reason why, um, we have you in here, Mr. Korea is that, um, there was an incident that occurred, um, your establishment and, um, on a 27 and it was brought to our attention and, um, the police responded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4539.805">And,</a>  um, what we'll do is we'll have, um, Lieutenant Locker Woods and, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4546.989">and</a>  the officers that responded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4550.05">We're</a>  gonna give them the opportunity to tell us what happened and comment on the police reports and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4557.274">And</a>  then you'll have the opportunity to speak as well on your behalf. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4563.077">And</a>  we'll just hash it around a little from there and see what happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4568.979">Lieutenant</a>  Lockwoods, would you like to take over the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4572.723">Yeah,</a>  I'm just going to, uh, give a hello and introduction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4575.924">Rory</a>  Lockowitz, a Lieutenant with the Medford police, um, office fashion did the primary focus, uh, in addition to the police report that was written. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4587.449">Um,</a>  and with him was officer Farrow, who is, um, for any translation and, uh, a second set of eyes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4596.693">So</a>  I'm just going to turn it over to officer Sebastian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4599.754">Uh,</a>  if that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4601.495">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4604.094">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4606.175">So</a>  I think my video, I'm able only to speak without video for some reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4611.416">I'm</a>  on my iPhone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4612.477">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4614.557">But</a>  so the original incident was a fight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4618.199">I</a>  did not respond to the incident, but I was working that night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4623.86">I</a>  did review the report and it seemed to be due to an intoxicated patron and member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4632.804">who</a>  was upset that another member was speaking to a spouse or a girlfriend, and then they engaged in a fight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4644.151">I</a>  responded, I believe, on the 30th to do an inspection of the building and make sure they were in compliance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4653.699">Mr.</a>  Carrera and the other people in there were very receptive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4657.94">They</a>  were very open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4660.601">One</a>  of the first things they told me was that both club members have been banned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4667.544">I</a>  spoke to them about a trespass to have it formally on record with not only them, but the police department, which would <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4677.027">bring</a>  it to a point where if these guests return they will be arrested and you know in my opinion would prevent them from returning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4687.54">The</a>  restaurant when I entered had about 25 to 30 patrons. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4697.013">None</a>  were overly intoxicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4699.394">None</a>  were intoxicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4700.574">The</a>  noise level was within reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4703.835">And</a>  like I said, everyone was receptive to even a police officer coming in in uniform. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4709.937">All</a>  signs were posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4712.158">All</a>  licenses were posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4713.478">A</a>  menu was posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4715.939">The</a>  bartenders were all in compliance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4720.74">Officer</a>  Farrell was with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4724.528">to</a>  the fact that she's fluent in Portuguese. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4729.65">We</a>  didn't need much translation, but they were very, like I said, open and receptive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4735.212">I</a>  went behind the bar, checked everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4737.733">Everything</a>  was in compliance, very clean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4743.555">The</a>  kitchen area was very clean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4746.136">They</a>  walked me down to the stockroom area, showed me everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4749.658">Everything</a>  was very neat and organized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4752.979">I</a>  was actually very surprised in how organized and clean everything was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4757.522">They</a>  showed me their camera system, told me that Mr. Carrera has access to it, and there's another manager who has access to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4769.931">They</a>  don't have any cameras downstairs, but have everything upstairs in the establishment that shows all the rooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4780.851">The</a>  only thing that they didn't have that was on the checklist was an employee list, which I don't know how big of a deal that is, but they stated that they were going to have it with phone numbers and date of birth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4795.263">I</a>  just explained to them that it would be easy and it's required. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4800.607">you</a>  know, it would make it easier for police if there is an incident to speak to somebody, if we have to follow up and them being able to tell us who was there and how we can get in contact with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4813.576">And</a>  other than that, I mean, everything was good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4818.6">I</a>  mean, yeah, that's all.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4826.445">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4827.586">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4829.69">Um,</a>  Officer Farah, do you have anything you'd like to say in regards to this matter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4836.905">So</a>  I didn't really do the inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4839.265">I</a>  was there mostly for translation and I kind of just explained to them how the inspection was going to happen and they were very open to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4849.907">And</a>  from there, Officer Sebastian took it over and he did the inspection and just stayed in front of the bar waiting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4857.148">So</a>  that was about pretty much like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4859.549">I</a>  didn't respond to the day of the fight as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4862.789">So</a>  I was mostly there for the translation purposes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4868.171">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4869.932">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4871.093">Thank</a>  you for commenting on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4875.176">Lieutenant,</a>  is there anything else you'd like to comment on?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4886.483">It</a>  seems like the initial incident, there was a question of whether or not somebody was too intoxicated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4892.887">Of</a>  course, we have no way of knowing or proving <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4897.273">how</a>  much was consumed on the premise on the day of the fight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4905.315">Obviously</a>  a concern when you hear somebody was in a highly intoxicated state on the premise where they served after the fact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4912.858">It's</a>  a concern but not something we're bringing before the commission saying that it did in fact happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4918.219">What</a>  we know did in fact happen was that there was a <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4921.134">a</a>  mutual assault and battery, you know, a fight that happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4925.438">And</a>  as officers Sebastian and Farrow said, since then, they took action and appear to have done everything they could to help prevent this in the future.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4941.114">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4944.818">Well,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4947.098">My</a>  fellow commissioners, do you have any questions or concerns about this incident?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4955.427">Mr.</a>  Chair, I do, but I'd like to hear from Mr. Carrera here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4961.398">what</a>  his take on it, but I do have some questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4965.16">Maybe</a>  I'll circle back after Mr. Carrera speaks.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4968.882">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4969.282">I'm</a>  sorry, I forgot to ask Mr. Carrera my apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4975.305">Mr.</a>  Carrera, I'm sorry, would you like to comment on what you've heard so far or what might have happened that evening?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4982.709">I</a>  would like to thank the police officers for coming over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4985.731">I</a>  mean, make sure everything that it was up to, like compliance with the city of Manfred and everything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4992.176">It's</a>  just that day on that was Tuesday, August 27th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4995.82">That's</a>  when it happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=4997.721">We</a>  can control many things, but we can't control people's emotions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5002.105">What</a>  did happen that day? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5003.106">I</a>  think it was a discussion between <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5006.808">One</a>  guy's talking to another person's girlfriend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5010.77">It's</a>  just childish things, but we can't control over that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5014.352">Our</a>  bartenders are all tip certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5016.833">So</a>  therefore, if they were intoxicated, they cut them off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5022.355">That's</a>  what I asked the bartender when I got there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5024.356">It's</a>  like, how much did you serve them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5025.737">She's</a>  like, I served them enough that when I cut them off, it was over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5031.739">I</a>  told him, what did they drink? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5033.8">She</a>  said one drink. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5035.588">three</a>  beers, the other one drink, I think it was like a shot and a beer and that was it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5041.19">And</a>  I cut them off because the bar was about to close that night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5044.631">And</a>  it just happened to happen as we're about to close because the person's girlfriend is actually our cook. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5053.074">um</a>  she was like she was just leaving her shift going home and the other person approached her and started talking to him the other the other person did not like him talking to his girlfriend and so therefore they got into an altercation over over that i mean as they say they were extremely drunk i i don't think they were because like i said like our bartenders are tip certified <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5076.537">if</a>  they think that the person is too intoxicated to a certain point, like three beers, that should be like the cutoff line for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5083.762">Because</a>  one of them wasn't very big. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5085.784">I</a>  mean, it's just like stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5088.786">I</a>  can't control over people's emotions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5092.949">Like</a>  I said, both members are banned for life from the club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5099.595">The</a>  cook did quit because she didn't feel comfortable being there because of what happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5107.819">And</a>  that the only means that she had to go home is with her boyfriend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5113.241">So</a>  therefore, I told her that he cannot be in the premises while picking her up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5120.645">And</a>  she said, if that's going to be a problem, then I'm just going to have to quit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5123.166">And</a>  she left last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5127.472">That's</a>  all I got to say about this scenario.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5132.716">I'm</a>  sorry to hear about the troubles that you're going through there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5138.46">All</a>  right, well, let's move on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5142.623">We</a>  can discuss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5144.284">Alan,</a>  you said you'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5146.297">Yeah,</a>  no, Mr. Carrera, I appreciate the, you're absolutely right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5150.179">You</a>  can't control people's emotions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5153.641">I</a>  believe when I read through the police report, it said the individual fled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5158.584">I'm</a>  curious, I've heard from the officers that there is no log <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5164.827">of</a>  employees with names and contact numbers and information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5169.611">But</a>  I think the last time we spoke with you, we made it clear that clubs are required to have a book, and members are supposed to sign in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5182.682">And</a>  if they're bringing in guests, they're supposed to be signing in the guests. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5186.545">So</a>  as I said, where I read in the police report that the individual fled, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5192.049">Do</a>  you know who the individual that fled was? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5194.27">Because</a>  I'm certain Dean should have been in the book.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5197.232">I'm</a>  sorry to interrupt you, but both of them are members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5199.413">I</a>  mean, they're newly members, so we do have information on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5202.814">We</a>  have the contacts, we have all the names and stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5205.816">So</a>  if that needs to be pulled up, I can give that to the police officer or anything like that that is needed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5212.219">The</a>  person that left, that fled, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5215.195">I</a>  don't know why he fled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5216.796">He</a>  may be having problems with the law or something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5221.918">I</a>  have no idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5222.798">I</a>  don't know people's background. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5225.839">I</a>  only know their names and when they're made part of being a member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5230.241">I</a>  mean, that's the only information they give me is their name and their phone number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5235.163">Most</a>  of them don't like giving their licenses because they don't want people to do mischievous things with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5243.306">So</a>  that's why. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5244.867">We</a>  don't get much information on them, but we do have their names and their phone numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5248.31">So</a>  if that needs to be given to somebody, I will gladly get that information out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5253.454">They</a>  were both new members, obviously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5256.297">And</a>  like I said, like when they send a piece of paper saying to become a member, one of the things that says there is any altercations, fights or discriminations, like anything that's <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5268.415">like</a>  affecting the environment, the environment around us, it's an automatic ban. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5273.517">There</a>  is no like six months suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5275.398">There's</a>  not one month suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5277.398">It's</a>  an automatic ban because we can always get members again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5280.48">And</a>  people that do that in their establishment, we do not like tolerate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5284.361">So</a>  the dead sign a piece of paper saying that whatever happens in there, if they do whatever it says there on the piece of paper, they're automatically banned from the club for life. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5292.684">And</a>  the thing is, we keep these, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5294.665">and</a>  a record because we do like a meeting every year of the people that's been banned from the club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5301.349">Most</a>  of them have passed away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5302.67">So</a>  we have to clear those out because they no longer want us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5307.834">So</a>  there is a list of all the people that have been banned through the years to that club because they keep information of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5314.658">And</a>  some of them have pictures, some of them don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5317.039">But</a>  like I said, these two individuals, they're fairly new, so we knew who they were. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5322.161">And</a>  like I said, they've been banned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5324.602">They're</a>  no longer part of the club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5326.023">They're</a>  no longer members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5328.104">And</a>  if people start defending them or trying to say, why are you guys banning them, that person will get banned as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5335.767">Because</a>  we don't tolerate defending people that just make a ruckus for no reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5341.634">I</a>  don't know what else to say.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5343.636">Yeah,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5345.358">Mr.</a>  Carrera, you kind of cut off all my other questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5351.065">Because</a>  I was curious about that too, what the penalty was for the establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5358.331">Was</a>  there some type of event going on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5360.853">Was</a>  there a soccer game? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5362.374">Or</a>  was it just a normal night?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5365.137">It</a>  was just a normal night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5366.077">Like</a>  I said, I left there two hours prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5369.56">And</a>  I spoke with the bartender, I was like, listen, there's not many people here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5373.865">So</a>  it's the club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5375.407">It</a>  does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5376.428">There's</a>  a set time for the club, but the club usually doesn't stay open until that time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5380.172">That's</a>  that's written down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5382.215">It's</a>  basically like on if the members show up there a certain time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5386.88">like</a>  just say that if there's three members like left on the club and it's seven o'clock it's just pretty much like just cut them off and close the bar there is no reason to stay open until 10 with nobody in there right so what happened was that night i think was somebody's birthday and they were like he was going back to his country so it was there was a little more people than usual so what i told was like uh try to close the bar by like <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5412.005">10</a>  o'clock, like don't pass that time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5414.068">And</a>  she's like, Oh, they'll probably be out of here by by like nine o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5417.953">And</a>  that's when the altercation happened was around like nine o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5422.019">As</a>  the bartender, I mean, as the cook was leaving, that's when the altercation happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5426.705">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5428.418">Like</a>  I said, I can't control people's emotions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5430.939">I</a>  wish I could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5431.719">If</a>  I was there, it would probably be a different scenario. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5437.26">People</a>  did not step in because, like I said, they don't want to get involved, which is a shame because there was one of our people from our committee there that couldn't separate them, but he did nothing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5450.784">So</a>  that made me a little bit upset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5453.104">And</a>  I spoke with him, and he said he was sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5456.96">I</a>  told them just next time make sure you try not to start stuff like that because it's childish.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5467.293">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5469.476">I</a>  don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5473.693">You</a>  know, the only question I had actually, I was just sort of curious, my ignorance might be why, but just on the police report is actually that Officer Sebastian wrote, it says at the end of it said, just the suggestion, it was saying that probable cause for an illegality to wit, is that anything that we need to sort of be, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5501.5">Paying</a>  attention to, I mean, as far as the liquor board, or is that sort of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5506.583">More</a>  about the, I don't know the individuals who are involved in that officers Sebastian.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5514.847">I</a>  just didn't understand that part so that's just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5520.07">It's</a>  just a term saying that, like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5522.556">There's</a>  probable cause to believe that they allowed an illegality to happen on their property or that a crime did occur on their property, which is the assault and battery. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5534.866">It's</a>  not something that's saying like they're going to be charged with a crime or anything like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5539.169">It's</a>  just saying that there was there's enough probable cause to say that, you know, a crime did occur on their property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5547.035">That's</a>  all.</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5548.657">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5550.309">That's</a>  sort of the hook that brings us together to discuss this matter right now.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5555.572">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5556.093">I</a>  think I kind of understood it that way because like it really did seem like they're complying with everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5561.396">And</a>  I saw that that was what I was just confused about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5564.238">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5564.719">The</a>  choice of file charges in court or not is kind of irrelevant to this hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5570.402">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5570.843">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5572.143">As</a>  I have in the past, I'll forward over a report as I did with a different incident at a different establishment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5578.113">where</a>  there was really no cause to say any legality was permitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5584.794">So</a>  just please take this and put it in their file that it exists. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5592.596">We</a>  know for sure a place in the property today.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5598.637">We</a>  know the event occurred. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5600.057">We</a>  know perhaps too many adult beverages in a short period of time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5607.82">Mr.</a>  Chairman, what are your thoughts on this one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5610.762">This</a>  is clearly kind of an infraction to the point where it turned into a fight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5620.408">I</a>  know this is completely different from the last time Mr. Carrera was with us, but what are your thoughts on that, Mr. Chairman?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5631.525">Well,</a>  I mean, Mr. Carrera stated a few things in the club's defense, which I agree with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5640.467">And</a>  I'm sure we all agree with that you can't control anybody's tempers or behavior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5648.129">It</a>  seems to me losing a cook and a couple of members is pretty much punishment enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5657.872">especially</a>  today, is it's tough to replace. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5661.174">So,</a>  I mean, what I would like to ask Mr. Carrera is, you are still the club manager, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5671.72">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5672.8">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5673.941">And</a>  is Mr. Jose Figueredo? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5678.683">Figueredo</a>  is the president. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5680.945">He's</a>  the president. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5681.845">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5682.225">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5689.692">I</a>  was looking over your application that we had on file and you are listed as the manager and Mr. Fugitio is club clerk, but we'll call club clerk the president. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5710.598">The</a>  thing that was very impressive to me when I first read the report was that he responded to the scene and immediately shut down the establishment, which I thought was a very good move. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5725.165">What</a>  I was going to ask you to do was do another <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5732.461">another</a>  application, but I see there's no need, because he's the club president. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5738.106">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5739.427">And</a>  our records are accurate, so there's no need to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5745.592">That's</a>  going to save you $200 to $400 right there, because that's what it would have cost you to create a new application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5756.561">The</a>  only thing I would ask you to do is just read over the rules and regulations of private clubs for the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5766.008">Daria</a>  can send you a copy of that via email or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5770.571">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5773.713">Brush</a>  yourself up on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5775.754">Make</a>  sure you're aware of everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5777.575">The</a>  guest book, all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5780.696">Have</a>  a list of all the club members handy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5783.957">It</a>  doesn't have to be displayed, but if someone should come in, like Lieutenant Lockowitz or Officer Sebastian, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5791.581">And</a>  they ask for it, which you did have everything correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5796.044">You</a>  had your licenses posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5798.026">You</a>  had, you know, information and stuff for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5802.47">So</a>  just review it and make sure that you're compliant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5806.733">And,</a>  you know, like I said, I feel bad enough for you now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5810.576">And</a>  it's not easy with private clubs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5812.798">You</a>  know, it's kind of a struggling thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5814.72">And</a>  I feel as though personally that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5820.393">We</a>  can let this one slide by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5822.013">You</a>  guys have been doing good since we had that last incident with the food and running a restaurant type of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5832.136">But</a>  you didn't know, and that's how you learn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5835.277">Mr.</a>  Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just had one- I just wanted to point out about the chairman and the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5844.4">One</a>  question out of curiosity, I remember several years ago, there was an altercation, I think, at the Legion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5852.544">And</a>  it was one of those, you can't control people's emotions, I get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5857.726">But</a>  they took what really saved their butt, so to speak, was they followed the proper procedures. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5866.629">So</a>  I guess the only question I have, Mr. Carrera, is did you <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5873.663">or</a>  someone there called 911 or did one of your patrons, how did the police get involved in this altercation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5883.928">Because</a>  the bartender is a woman, so she felt helpless, so she called 911 to come and take over the situation because she can't go there and separate them or do anything.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5897.035">So</a>  one of your staff initiated the call? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5901.297">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5903.512">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5904.533">So</a>  that's, that's another plus.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5906.254">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5906.634">That's,</a>  that's important that, you know, it wasn't swept under the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5911.957">And</a>  then as the, everyone left, they decided to call.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5916.3">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5921.123">Um,</a>  Ben, would you like to comment on this as well? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5930.931">have</a>  been made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5932.331">Yeah,</a>  for a second there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5934.392">Um,</a>  is there anybody else present that wants to speak either in favor or against this matter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5944.754">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5945.334">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5946.634">Uh,</a>  Officer Lockowitz.</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5948.575">Anything</a>  else from the P. D. No, I'm I'm satisfied with the outcome, you know, documenting, discussing and it seems like corrective actions have already been taken.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5958.497">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5961.593">Okay,</a>  well, I don't have an issue with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5967.956">Doing</a>  like I said, what we just discussed that there's been punishment served already enough by losing a couple of members in a book. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5977.662">I</a>  feel as though that's that's more than applicable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5983.585">if</a>  you feel the same way, Mr. Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5986.726">Ben,</a>  would you care to comment on any of this before we wrap it up?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5992.688">No,</a>  I think everything you said is good, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=5998.611">I</a>  don't think any further action is needed from us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6003.692">I</a>  think it's all been cleared up.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6008.615">My</a>  opinion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6010.296">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6011.076">I</a>  mean, we'll take this incident, put it in the jacket, in the file cabinet, and if we start seeing a trend as the months and the years go on, then we'll take a little more, not punitive, but we'll take the necessary action.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6032.782">Yeah,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6034.062">I</a>  think we've seen clubs deal with it way worse, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6040.263">So</a>  I think you guys dealt with it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6045.464">Okay,</a>  so should we make a motion or are we just good?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6050.285">I</a>  think we'd make a motion to like file the disposition as a warning and keep the report on file.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6058.742">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6060.342">That's</a>  good advice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6061.523">I</a>  motion to enter the information on file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6067.344">We're</a>  aware of what happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6070.305">We've</a>  properly discussed it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6071.926">Mr.</a>  Carrera has taken the necessary steps, and as a result, there has been some residual effect as a result of the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6079.868">So</a>  let's just put it on file, and hopefully we'll never have to revisit another incident at the establishment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6088.7">That's</a>  what I hope.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6091.542">Ben,</a>  you want to second that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6093.624">I'll</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6095.325">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6096.246">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6097.527">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6099.328">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6101.75">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6103.891">Motion's</a>  passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6105.212">Mr.</a>  Garrett, you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6106.934">I'm</a>  very sorry again for your troubles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6110.456">Keep</a>  running a good tight ship like you do, and we won't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6114.559">Don't</a>  be afraid to call if there are any issues.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6116.761">I</a>  always do my best. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6118.603">It's</a>  a teachable moment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6119.604">You'll</a>  know what went wrong, and you'll make sure, as I said, from listening to you, you said you won't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6125.19">You'll</a>  take, hopefully your other members will take the necessary steps to prevent something from escalating like that again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6131.797">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6133.119">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6133.92">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6134.72">I</a>  will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6135.261">I</a>  will see you guys on the 25th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6138.304">Take</a>  care.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6143.097">Medford</a>  Police. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6143.797">Thank</a>  you very much for coming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6145.078">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6146.159">Anything</a>  else you'd like to comment on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6147.599">Are</a>  you good?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6150.021">I</a>  think we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6151.161">I</a>  know Officer Farrell and Sebastian are both good for the day, and I don't have anything further. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6156.324">Do</a>  you, gentlemen?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6159.065">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6160.386">No,</a>  I think we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6162.127">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6162.767">Thanks</a>  again.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6164.008">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6165.169">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6168.752">I</a>  got two reports I'll be forwarding to you, both from the Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6176.356">Wait</a>  a minute, why didn't you tell us that before? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6187.341">One</a>  I happen to be in the building for.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6192.284">Officially</a>  or unofficially?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6195.385">Unofficially,</a>  I was in there with half a dozen dispatchers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6199.488">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6201.249">But</a>  neither one of them were overly concerning.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6205.572">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6207.054">I've</a>  got a feeling we're going to probably, they're going to be a frequent flyer because of the enormity of people in there.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6214.119">It's</a>  just so enormous that things are bound to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6218.182">It's</a>  so big that things happen.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6221.444">Every</a>  time I drive by at night, the place is packed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6224.617">Yup.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6224.857">And</a>  Mystic Ave is packed with cars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6227.779">Hancock</a>  Ave is packed with cars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6229.8">It's</a>  just like, you can't even get in that joint.</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6233.723">People</a>  come down Mystic Avenue at night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6236.184">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6241.647">I</a>  get to jump off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6242.928">I</a>  will, I got to do some finishing touches and then forward them off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6247.271">Um,</a>  that's all I got.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6249.452">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6249.932">We'll</a>  be looking forward to your reports.</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6251.954">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6256.677">Thank</a>  you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6257.838">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6258.579">Take</a>  care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6259.399">Bye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6262.442">Okay,</a>  good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6267.286">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6268.507">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6270.228">You</a>  know, we, it was quite a meeting almost 2 hours, but, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6275.813">There's,</a>  you know, I was a little peed off when I got that email from you earlier that what they did expecting you to do all that work and we got to set something up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6289.5">You</a>  know, that this is how this stuff needs to be submitted from this point forward, because you can't be expected to edit their documents and everything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6298.444">You</a>  should get 1 packet and that should be it.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6302.126">So,</a>  I, I would yeah, I get it probably should have said something to them too, but I'm just like, I can't when it's a big package like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6312.658">It's</a>  really hard to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6314.66">I</a>  1st, have to deal with and. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6317.312">Because</a>  it's so big, I can't scan it all in, you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6319.915">So</a>  I have to do it little by little, and then it's just like taking them apart again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6324.76">So</a>  it's just like, it ends up, I just wanted to let you know, this is why I don't have it yet, because I just haven't had the time to do it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6333.77">And</a>  you're saying you have to scan all those little individual mailings?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6337.012">Yeah,</a>  because it's like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6340.394">It's</a>  like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6341.755">If</a>  you look at it, it's stapled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6344.056">So</a>  you can't go through the printer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6345.477">It</a>  gets stuck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6346.497">So</a>  I'm doing one at a time.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6348.198">Yeah,</a>  you've got to handle it twice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6349.539">You've</a>  got to make a copy of it and then scan it.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6352.701">And</a>  then I've got to put it together in a package. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6354.922">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6355.343">So</a>  it's just like I know they probably just didn't think about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6358.107">I</a>  didn't want to come off as, you know, rude or not wanting to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6361.252">It's</a>  just it ends up being a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6363.375">And</a>  I just don't have between what I need to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6366.721">I</a>  just don't have that time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6368.804">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6370.845">It's</a>  just a lot of stuff to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6373.865">Hey,</a>  we just try and do our best and try and get as much done as we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6379.627">I</a>  think everything went very well today considering, but I don't think we really have anything going on that's in limbo other than the meeting that's next week, I believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6396.392">Next</a>  Wednesday, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6397.94">Yeah,</a>  so, you know, you were able to send out another email to the department head, seeing if any of them wanted to do like a five minute talk about what's to expect, what the licensee should, what they expect of the licensee.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6416.163">Yes,</a>  I was planning to do that today, because I had to reach out to a few department heads just for a different reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6423.264">But</a>  yes, I'm going to be asking that today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6426.485">And</a>  I think <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6427.845">Everybody</a>  got back to me besides police chief. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6433.931">Okay,</a>  I got to ask him next time I see him.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6436.719">Yeah,</a>  I was talking to Ralph and he said that might be a good idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6441.624">He</a>  says to do, because now the licensees know what the department heads expect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6447.211">And</a>  when it comes time for renewal, it's a lot easier.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6450.434">Yeah,</a>  I think it would be helpful information, but everybody else is able to come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6455.54">So</a>  that's I'm happy about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6457.242">I</a>  just got to ask. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6458.703">Chief,</a>  but I don't think, um, I don't think it would be a problem because I know I, I send the request to, um, Lieutenant Lockovitz to, to have him attend.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6469.391">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6470.152">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6470.492">And</a>  I don't, I don't really know if there's too much for the chief to really.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6475.636">That's</a>  why sometimes, that's why sometimes I, um, ask Lieutenant Lockovitz versus the chief, but I think I've asked them both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6486.547">Did</a>  Rory speak last year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6488.108">Do</a>  you remember? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6489.349">He</a>  did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6489.949">He</a>  did a really good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6491.37">Yeah,</a>  that's why I wanted him to be here again.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6494.471">It'd</a>  be nice if they could do that, if he could.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6497.113">It</a>  was him and Penny last year, so both of them did a really good job, because they touched on the tips, and then the over-serving, and then all of that good stuff.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6506.278">You</a>  said they invited out Sophie Greenblum.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6514.651">Yes,</a>  she said that she will be attending, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6518.172">And</a>  then I'm sure Rory and the two officers, Smith and Sebastian, you know, with their part of our team, they should make sure they get an email at least informing of them if they'd like to attend, you know?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6533.136">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6534.836">I</a>  usually will forward to Lieutenant Lockovitz, and then I think he forwards it to the officers, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6543.098">cool</a>  yeah mr chair i know we're getting close to two hours but um my question um should we be concerned about d1 soccer or not</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6555.05">Yeah,</a>  good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6556.73">Um,</a>  you know, I, I feel as this, this is a 100% police matter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6562.072">Um,</a>  it's disturbing the peace, it's, um, trash in the parks, it's doing all of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6568.693">And</a>  I mean, we've, that's way out of our lane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6571.514">What's</a>  in our lane is issuing a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6575.355">And</a>  I believe, I looked through my records, the last license to be issued to them was for the 15th, which was when that whole melee occurred. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6585.598">So,</a>  you know, it's up to the city to deny these people for rent in OML if they don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6594.812">I</a>  mean, do we give them the ultimatum? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6597.413">Do</a>  you want to start now? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6598.633">Hey,</a>  listen, obviously, if client, your attendees are getting hammered every time they go there, and the party's going long after the games, and it's not for the game anymore, it's just to have a big gathering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6612.299">I</a>  think we can deny them a license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6617.941">Yeah,</a>  I'm wondering if you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6619.961">Might</a>  be a good question for Ralph.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6621.662">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6622.443">I</a>  wonder if it starts with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6624.867">If</a>  we say no, this dude can have the event there and if they want to sneak drinks out in the parking lot, will they do it at their own risk?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6633.88">Yeah,</a>  it's got nothing to do with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6635.521">But</a>  then again, you know, I'd like to just run it by Ralph even on the 25th privately just to make sure we're not putting the city out there in discrimination or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6649.512">You</a>  know, what's the matter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6651.213">You</a>  don't like black soccer players or Spanish soccer, whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6655.316">It's,</a>  you know.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6656.517">No,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6658.939">We</a>  see the residual effect from those events there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6663.142">And,</a>  you know, the first thing, you know, honestly, the first thing that came into my mind was the one at the Pats game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6673.126">The</a>  guy stole, he was so drunk from tailgating and partying, he stole the car out of the parking lot and the state police chased him and he went the wrong way and he killed somebody coming the other way.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6686.031">He</a>  didn't start to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6686.771">He</a>  didn't start to.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6689.287">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6689.747">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6690.227">Well,</a>  well, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6694.709">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6695.169">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6695.409">I</a>  don't think they're going to be applying anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6697.47">They</a>  share anyways, but no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6710.918">Because</a>  the allowing that event to happen, that should sort of isn't our thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6716.382">It's</a>  more like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6717.784">City</a>  has to decide, do they want to, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6720.486">2000</a>  person event somewhere 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6723.828">Then,</a>  and then issue the conditions around the event, like, you've got to have way more parking control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6730.254">You've</a>  got to have a plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6731.355">You've</a>  got to have more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6733.88">security,</a>  you know, and then it can come to us and we can say, yeah, we'll give liquor or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6739.046">And</a>  I feel like that's proper.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6741.549">It's</a>  just throwing a little gasoline on the fire. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6744.673">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6745.494">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6747.296">It's.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6747.797">Oh,</a>  wait, why? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6751.121">What?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6751.542">Gasoline</a>  on the fire.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6752.443">Oh,</a>  the liquor part?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6753.938">Yeah,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6754.658">Oh,</a>  I mean of an unorganized event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6756.96">I</a>  don't know if you can hear me, but of an unorganized event, liquor adds to it as a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6762.163">But</a>  an organized event that has everything in order, I mean, sure, you know, the city's okay with it, but this one doesn't seem organized whatsoever.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6773.989">No,</a>  and they've got to get tons more security. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6777.932">Once</a>  the parking lot fills up, they got to have parking attendance, you know, over to the McGlynn to the Andrews. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6787.098">I</a>  mean, you can't direct them over to where the Meadow Glen might used to be because that's private property, but it's just an event that big, it's got to tell you the city cannot handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6797.943">We</a>  don't have the capacity for cars and something that large.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6806.107">Honestly,</a>  I don't think they do too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6808.649">I</a>  think they don't realize how big that event is because they certainly don't have the proper staffing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6816.253">or</a>  equipment to handle that large of a crowd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6818.976">And</a>  as I said, every year, if it keeps growing, I mean, it wasn't that big when they first started having the event at Hormel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6826.763">It</a>  is evolved or it's grown into something much larger.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6830.447">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6832.569">So</a>  I think we should look into all aspects of it and just, you know, I don't feel comfortable issuing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6840.716">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6842.518">Issuing</a>  them a one day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6844.26">I</a>  don't feel comfortable doing that anymore after seeing what's happened constantly at first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6849.485">Maybe</a>  it's something that the cities, you know, that parks and recreation department, you know, had an argument with the guys or the organization or something, but you can see it's just over and over and over again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6861.497">And</a>  when you get police reports stating that's unsafe, it's a public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6866.042">public</a>  issue, public hazard issue, public safety issue is a word, I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6871.323">It's</a>  just, we can't have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6873.764">We</a>  can't have a public safety issue in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6877.005">It's</a>  just gonna put the city out there liability wise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6879.705">And</a>  if we get the okay from Ralph that we don't have to issue the one day licenses, we'll discuss it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6888.548">And</a>  if we all feel the same way, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6891.649">Hey,</a>  no more licenses for them if the city wants to give them permission to use the pack. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6898.233">That's</a>  got nothing to do with us.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6900.435">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6900.835">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6902.136">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6904.693">That's</a>  the way I feel.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6906.554">How</a>  do you feel? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6911.436">I</a>  feel the same way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6913.757">Like</a>  I said, I don't think they realize how big the event is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6918.159">If</a>  all of a sudden they start telling us, oh, we have 150 people that are going to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6923.761">work</a>  in the event and we're, you know, all right, we'll entertain, you know, what they're going to do to keep the whole thing in check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6933.75">But</a>  like I said, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6937.353">It'll</a>  be next year, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6938.794">Because</a>  the season's practically done.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6942.117">Yeah,</a>  I think it's done for us this year anyways over here.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6945.38">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6947.341">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6948.402">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6948.662">So</a>  do I motion to adjourn?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6951.207">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6952.108">I</a>  motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6953.189">It's</a>  a good meeting and good to see you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6955.671">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6956.772">All</a>  those in favor.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6961.496">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6963.637">Thanks</a>  for all the work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6964.458">Everybody</a>  Daria.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6966.139">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6966.38">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6967.12">Bye</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6967.581">Have</a>  a good one.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6968.101">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6968.862">Ciao.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6969.602">See</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6970.383">We're</a>  going to write the mayor a letter to recommend you for raise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6976.382">I</a>  make a motion to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-09-18-24&start=6977.644">Bye</a>  guys.</p>
