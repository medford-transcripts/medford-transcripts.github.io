1
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:10,069
Democratic City Committee is not feeling well, so he couldn't come here today to do the welcoming.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:21,700
We were blessed to have the treasurer of the Medford City Democratic Party, Mr. Bruce Cooley, who will give the welcoming.

3
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,376
Good evening, everyone, and thank you all for coming and for those of you who are watching on TV.

4
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:41,158
On behalf of Paul Donato, I would like to welcome you to tonight's City Council Candidates Night.

5
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:47,479
And I'd also like to thank Henry Milleron, the Ward 6 Chair, for organizing this event this evening.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,300
Thank you, Henry.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,621
Thank you, Bruce.

8
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,962
And now we have my co-moderator, Julia

9
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:02,412
Novia, who will walk us to a salute to the flag.

10
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:18,265
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,087
Thank you.

12
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:20,407
Thank you.

13
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,611
Before coming here, we

14
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:42,156
All the candidates were instructed via email and letters to go directly to room 207, where in 207 we conducted a lottery drawing.

15
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:50,377
The lottery drawing is what established the sequence, because we get 14 of them, okay?

16
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:55,598
So we decided each of them will have five minutes, and they will speak on the podium.

17
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:05,007
So the purpose of this forum is to give each candidate an opportunity to address policy issues that are vital to our city's future.

18
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,570
There won't be any interactive.

19
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:32,472
Ah, there we go.

20
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,252
Thank you, Henry.

21
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,034
I was missing from over there.

22
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:36,715
Is that better?

23
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:38,076
Sorry.

24
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:38,857
Start over.

25
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:49,065
So we didn't get enough questions from the community to do more of like a debate Q&A forum, so we instead opted to allow each candidate to make a prepared statement.

26
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:54,649
So the purpose is to give them an opportunity to address a variety of issues that are vital to our city's future.

27
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:15,834
We gave a list of issues to all the candidates for them to address, including, this is a very long list, I don't think I need to read them all, but community planning, city growth, parking, education, charter school, opioid crisis, inclusion, school system, land use, infrastructure, environmental sustainability, public safety, economic development, et cetera, et cetera, budget, taxes, et cetera.

28
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:20,757
So we gave them a list of issues, probably can't cover all that in five minutes, but we'll see which issues they choose to cover.

29
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,477
and how they address them.

30
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:27,884
So we want to know what actions you will take if elected in these areas to enhance the quality of life for the people of Medford.

31
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,249
Thank you, Julia.

32
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:40,060
We strongly believe it is important, if not crucial, as we, the citizens of this great city of Medford, I can call it great, I live here.

33
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:49,234
participate in the election process in a meaningful way, and this is the reason we choose to conduct those events, the forum.

34
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:55,779
It is not good enough to just go in the booth and select a candidate whose name we recognize.

35
00:03:56,619 --> 00:04:06,187
We must and need to make such decisions based upon the candidate's qualification, records of community and public service in their statement.

36
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,882
Addressing issues, you heard some of them.

37
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:14,283
We will never have all the issues lined up, but we can do it.

38
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,744
The vote that we cast as citizens are important.

39
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:22,285
In most cases, we will spend the next two years complaining about it.

40
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:32,047
We will spend the next two years coming here every Tuesday night cursing them out because we didn't have an interaction with them.

41
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:35,748
So therefore, we have an opportunity here.

42
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:40,110
Each candidate will have the same amount of time.

43
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,372
There's no division, no preference here.

44
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:46,415
We will have five minutes each to make a statement.

45
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:54,521
And the statement you can pay attention to was that candidate address my issue or not.

46
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,004
I believe this is a great opportunity for the candidate.

47
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:03,187
I believe it's a great opportunity for the citizen of Medford.

48
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,771
So I think this was explained to the candidates already, but just so the audience knows, we're going to have a timekeeper system.

49
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:20,773
So as Henry already said, each candidate will have five minutes to give their statement.

50
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:25,474
When they have 20 seconds left, if they use their full time, they will be given a 20-second warning.

51
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:32,475
Chris, if you want to show, one of our timekeepers here will hold up a little yellow warning sign, like red, yellow, green.

52
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:40,621
And then when their five minutes is up, and Henry will also say out loud they have 20 seconds, and then when their time is up, Chris will hold up the red to let them know their time is up.

53
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:53,272
And he'll probably let you finish your sentence if you are mid-sentence, but if you are starting to go over, the moderator, co-moderator, my co-moderator Henry has the right to cut off the microphone when your time is up, just to keep the timeline strictly enforced.

54
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:59,647
One thing I will to the audience, I will say, please hold your applause.

55
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:09,116
Try not to applaud a candidate while they're talking because if we had to go through it for each of the 14, that will take more than we wanted to.

56
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:14,921
But I will reserve after he or she make a statement, you have the right to applaud, okay?

57
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:22,527
And the next candidate, whether your number is up, wait until we announce you so you can go towards the podium.

58
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:26,070
That way we get things done in an orderly fashion.

59
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,031
Thank you.

60
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:32,615
With that said, now you're going to introduce the candidates.

61
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,210
Introduce them all.

62
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,171
One by one.

63
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:37,392
As your name is called, stand up.

64
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:46,899
I know we know each other, but at least it is formally an introduction from us to the audience, from us to the one that's at home watching.

65
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:55,304
Because remember, this is being broadcast live on Comcast channel 22 and Verizon channel 43.

66
00:06:55,804 --> 00:07:01,348
So when my co-moderator call your name, please stand up, wave, and sit down.

67
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:02,549
That's easy.

68
00:07:03,414 --> 00:07:06,236
And I'll call them in the order that they just chose in the lottery.

69
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,416
I have the order here.

70
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:09,517
So first up will be Adam Knight.

71
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:13,720
Natalie Breen.

72
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:17,642
Ann Marie Cuno.

73
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:21,544
Curtis Tooden.

74
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:24,966
Michael Marks.

75
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,008
Brianna Lungocone.

76
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:32,450
Frederick DelaRusso.

77
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:52,191
Robert Cappucci, George Sacco, John Falco, Remo Scarfo, George Scarpelli, Richard Caraviello.

78
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,014
I think that was it.

79
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,436
Did I miss anybody?

80
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:57,656
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:58,217
Oh, you missed one.

82
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:58,877
Did I skip one?

83
00:07:58,917 --> 00:07:59,217
You missed one.

84
00:07:59,237 --> 00:07:59,658
Who did I miss?

85
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,042
Oh my goodness, sorry, Cheryl.

86
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,223
Cheryl, what did you get?

87
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:05,804
They're not in order, so sorry about that.

88
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:06,924
I thought I was with somebody.

89
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,704
That's what I said.

90
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,145
Sorry.

91
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,125
All right.

92
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,125
Thank you, Julia.

93
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,767
So you know why she left you out, Cheryl?

94
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,847
Because you're too close to Scarbelli.

95
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:19,268
That's his usual seat.

96
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:20,148
All right.

97
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:28,151
With that said, Councilor Adam Knight, who chosen to be first, you get five minutes, sir.

98
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,599
First out of the gate.

99
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,440
Thank you, Henry.

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,900
Thank you to the organizers for this event.

101
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,261
I really appreciate the opportunity to get up here and speak to you.

102
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:38,682
My name is Adam Knight.

103
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:40,983
I'm a candidate for reelection to the Medford city council.

104
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,724
I'm number four in your ballot.

105
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,624
And I'd ask for your consideration on November 7th.

106
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:47,345
Um, a little bit about myself.

107
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:52,167
I reside in West Medford with my wife, Alison and our sons, Ryan and Brendan, uh, Ryan's three and Brendan's one.

108
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,949
I'm a product of the Medford public schools graduating from MHS in 1996.

109
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:00,471
I then went on to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from Merrimack college.

110
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,516
and a master's degree in public administration from Suffolk University.

111
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:19,864
I have nearly 20 years' experience working in government, first for the late State Senator Charlie Shannon as his Director of Constituent Services, then as an organizer, a field representative, and a contract negotiator in the labor movement, and now as an arbitrator with the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development.

112
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:28,508
It's through these experiences that I've had the opportunity to work on many initiatives that have made a difference in our community, items like marriage equality,

113
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:36,971
affordable health care, the long-term leasing of our skating rinks, Flint and La Conte, the school building assistance program, and the Greenland extension, just to name a few.

114
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:50,617
And I think it's safe to say that in a city that has a $166 million operating budget and a council that's made $13 million worth of appropriations in the past two years, that qualifications and experience do matter.

115
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:56,127
I'm very grateful to have earned your trust and to have had the opportunity to serve as your city councilor for the past four years.

116
00:09:56,607 --> 00:10:00,853
And since my election, I've always embraced the philosophy that results are more important than rhetoric.

117
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,271
and this has been a very successful council that's produced a number of results.

118
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:13,233
From a legislative standpoint, I've worked with my colleagues to implement changes to our city ordinances that benefits our quality of life and improves the operation of government.

119
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:23,836
Successfully fighting for measures that have reformed the vehicle for higher ordinance to better protect consumers, increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products in the community to protect our public health,

120
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:33,038
the implementation of a university accountability ordinance to safeguard our neighborhoods, and the wage theft ordinance to ensure proper distribution of tax dollars to public contractors.

121
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,679
From a financial standpoint, the city's on solid ground.

122
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,500
For the first time in recent memory, the city's passed a unanimous budget.

123
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:49,864
We have suitable reserves and an A++ bond rating, allowing us to borrow at low rates, and a capital plan allowing us flexibility to meet our demands and spending needs.

124
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,645
Today, our streets are safer.

125
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:57,467
We've reduced the speed limit on city streets to 25 miles an hour.

126
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,750
We've created and funded positions in the budget to combat addiction.

127
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,333
We've purchased 12 new police cars and critical equipment for our fire department.

128
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:13,000
But most importantly, we've appropriated $2 million for the design of a new police station and have a commitment to deliver new police and fire headquarter buildings by the year 2020.

129
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,522
This is a commitment that I will not forget.

130
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:18,104
We have great schools.

131
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,927
Great schools open a world of opportunity for both our kids and our community.

132
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,077
and I'm committed as a parent and as a city councilor to that end.

133
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:36,124
In the past term, we've opened a new media center and a full service culinary arts program at MHS, expanded course offerings, implemented before school programs, and have the lowest class sizes in the region.

134
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:43,689
In the next term, I'll work with the school committee to further expand and strengthen our opportunities for our youngsters and to deliver a new public library to the city of Medford.

135
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,331
The strong infrastructure is the backbone of our community.

136
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:52,094
We need responsive public works to provide the basic but essential services that we rely on every day.

137
00:11:53,188 --> 00:12:03,411
I've made a commitment to that end, improving service delivery with the funding of 12 new pieces of equipment for our DPW, securing over $2 million for water mains to bolster our light abatement programs.

138
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:13,013
In the next term, I'll push to build upon this progress by fighting for increased staffing levels, improving maintenance and upkeep of our sidewalks and roadways, and improvements to our transportation infrastructure.

139
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:19,855
Vibrant downtowns add to our economic stability and greatly contribute to the overall success of our community.

140
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:39,529
We're making great progress addressing this priority through initiatives that help make our business district thrive, like the public-private partnership to bring headline acts to Chevalier Auditorium, the construction of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, the Riverside Plaza, and the Clippership Connector to generate foot traffic in our square, and most importantly, the master plan for the revitalization of Medford Square.

141
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,892
Next term, I'll work with the stakeholders in our business district to ensure that we put that plan to use.

142
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,555
I'm proud of the accomplishments that we've made just by working together.

143
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:54,244
We've made safe streets, great schools, strong infrastructure, and vibrant downtowns our top priorities because these are the key to a strong quality of life.

144
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,426
But there is more work to be done, and I would like to be a part of this work.

145
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:06,732
I believe I have the qualifications, the experience, and the knowledge of the issues to continue to make a positive impact on our community, and I'm asking you for the opportunity to continue to serve.

146
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:07,872
My name's Adam Knight.

147
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,334
I'm number four on the ballot, and I thank you very much for listening.

148
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,335
I'd appreciate your support on November 7th.

149
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:13,076
Thank you very much.

150
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,238
Thank you, Council Knight.

151
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:22,926
Natalie Breen.

152
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:28,790
Hi, everyone.

153
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,151
Hello.

154
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:35,874
My name's Natalie Breen, and I am running for Medford City Council.

155
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm 24 years old, a lifelong Medford resident, and a very proud graduate of Medford Public Schools, having attended the Forest Park, the Andrews, the McGlynn, and Medford High class of 2010.

156
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:54,707
I graduated from Suffolk University in 2013 with a degree in marketing, and I now work in commercial real estate and development.

157
00:13:55,768 --> 00:14:02,274
I am also an appointed member of Medford's Commission for Persons with Disabilities, making sure the city is accessible for all.

158
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:06,678
And I am also a first-time candidate for public office.

159
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:16,183
My brother, Patrick, is a bagger at Stop and Shop and a graduate of Medford Public Schools as well, as well as volunteering at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

160
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:21,027
My mom, Karen Breen, has been a nurse for the Medford public school system for 20 years.

161
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:28,973
And my father is on the board for the Riverside Yacht Club here in Medford, as well as a former Medford youth girls softball coach.

162
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:33,096
I can assure you I would be a much better city counselor than I was a softball player.

163
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:34,197
I was very, very bad.

164
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:36,679
My dad actually had to make a position for me so I could play.

165
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:39,400
But that's a little bit about me.

166
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,000
So why am I running?

167
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,561
It's pretty simple.

168
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,581
I love Medford.

169
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:44,542
I love this city.

170
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:45,402
I grew up here.

171
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,343
I plan to stay here for a long time.

172
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:48,863
I would love to raise a family here.

173
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,944
I'm very personally invested in bringing Medford to the next level.

174
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,385
I want Medford to be the best it can be.

175
00:14:55,645 --> 00:15:03,108
I'm a firm believer that you can't be what you can't see, and I think we really need a young female voice on the council to speak for people in our city.

176
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,256
I think I can bring a lot of energy and new ideas.

177
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:11,999
And I grew up surrounded by people who have dedicated their lives to public service and helping others.

178
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,721
My uncles are firefighters, my mother's a nurse, and I just feel this is my way to contribute back to the community.

179
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:23,784
And while I have no past political experience, this is actually a good thing.

180
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:27,865
It means I have no notion of how things have to be done or things have to be done a certain way.

181
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,566
I can think outside the box.

182
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:31,387
I offer a fresh new perspective.

183
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:36,561
What's great about Medford is we have all the resources to bring Medford to the next level.

184
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:37,682
Everything's here.

185
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:40,664
We just need people to roll up their sleeves and make it happen.

186
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:45,087
And when I say resources, what I'm referring to is the Mystic.

187
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,428
It's flowing through our downtown.

188
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:47,749
We're not making use of that.

189
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,372
We have access to Boston by bus, train, car.

190
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,533
We're so close to one of the most vibrant cities.

191
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:58,657
We have one of the biggest national educational institutions in Tufts right here in Medford.

192
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,442
We could use them a lot more, create a stronger partnership with them.

193
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:03,964
We have the Fells.

194
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:05,745
We have countless historic buildings.

195
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:18,394
We have the Chevalier Theater, which I think is going to bring a lot of energy to the square, which desperately needs it, as well as the Brooks Estates, which is a passion project of mine and I think could be a really great revenue generator for the city.

196
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:20,724
So everything's here.

197
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,385
We just really need to put it together and make it happen.

198
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:32,308
But areas that are at the top of my priority list, based on what I've talked to people about walking around the city, is one, our infrastructure.

199
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,769
I think that's the bare basic.

200
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,930
I've heard a lot about roads, about sidewalks.

201
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,150
I think everybody can agree.

202
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,493
So we definitely need to start there, making sure our roads are safe and accessible for pedestrians, cyclists, vehicle traffic.

203
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,334
in making sure we are improving and maintaining our streets on a regular and reliable schedule.

204
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:56,037
It means when a contractor comes in to do work for the city, we're making sure they leave the street better than when they found it.

205
00:16:57,052 --> 00:17:00,253
Next, public safety, so our police officers and our firefighters.

206
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,934
They're understaffed, which will become more of a problem as Medford continues to grow.

207
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:10,555
I'm sure everyone's aware of how much development is going on and how many people will be coming into the city.

208
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:15,055
They lack resources, and they're working in subpar conditions.

209
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:22,797
I can say as a female, what the female officers have at the Medford Police Station is an atrocity to me, and I think it needs to be fixed now.

210
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,344
We need to stand up for people who put their lives on the line every day for us, for sure.

211
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:31,088
And we cannot cut corners when it comes to public safety.

212
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:31,849
It's a must.

213
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:33,170
There's no questions about that.

214
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,803
Also community access, so making sure the city government is accessible and transparent.

215
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:45,565
A lot of feedback I got when walking around the city is that people didn't know about something until it was already happening or maybe after it happened.

216
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:56,669
And while we all love our Barry calls, I think we could do a lot more in terms of communicating with the residents and the constituents of the city and making sure that departments are collaborating with each other.

217
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,750
I think there's a lot of untapped potential there if we joined forces.

218
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:12,630
Also a charter review so our charter has not been reviewed in 30 years I think any document that has been around for 30 years is well worth taking a look at regardless of 20 seconds.

219
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:27,397
Yep and Development so making sure we are thinking of develop development responsibly So these are some things I plan to bring to City Council and ideas that I have and I hope that on November 7th You guys come out and cast one of your seven votes for me.

220
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:27,937
Thank you.

221
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:27,977
I

222
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,162
Thank you Natalie.

223
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,635
I thank Anne-Marie Cuneo.

224
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:39,336
You're next.

225
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,911
Good evening, everyone.

226
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,773
Thank you to the Democratic Board Committee and to all of you for coming here this evening.

227
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,434
My name is Ann Marie Cuno.

228
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:07,038
I graduated and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in foreign languages and in criminal justice.

229
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:14,523
As a lifelong resident of Medford, along with my husband, Michael, we were married after graduation, and we've been married for 30 years.

230
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:23,790
We have four sons, and they have all graduated from the Medford public school system, pursuing their careers and education, continuing on their road to success.

231
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:41,503
I've been on the Medford School Committee for the past 12 years and served as president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, a position which allowed me the opportunity to work on state and national levels, continuing to represent Medford on discussions of important issues.

232
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,604
Why am I seeking city council?

233
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:49,967
For the same reason I ran for school committee, to make constructive changes and a positive difference.

234
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:56,306
During my tenure of the Meffitt School Committee, I introduced changes and presented fresh ideas.

235
00:19:56,887 --> 00:20:01,656
Collectively passed many successful programs along with my committee colleagues.

236
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:12,908
We approved and implemented changes ranging from technology to building upgrades and educational programs, some utilizing state and federal grants to underwrite the cost.

237
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:23,897
I have worked and collaborated with local, state, and federal elected officials, appointed to the state local government committee with both Governors Patrick and Governor Baker,

238
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:26,358
Advocated in Washington, D.C.

239
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:39,725
for the Massachusetts Federal Relations Network Delegation, meeting with members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican alike, while always having time to meet with our students, parents and teachers and administrators.

240
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:49,751
Replying honestly to all and keeping true to myself, building consensus along the way, and at times agreeing to disagree.

241
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:53,533
As a city councilor, I will bring the same positive changes.

242
00:20:54,356 --> 00:21:06,800
We as elected officials need to make the correct, non-partisan decisions on the issues, not based on the party line or a special group, but based on what is beneficial for our city.

243
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,261
We have a master plan, but now it is time to implement it.

244
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:15,163
There is a lot of discussions about the revitalization of Method Square.

245
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:21,845
The talk needs to stop, and we need to make it a reality.

246
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:23,495
in this community.

247
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:36,078
We need to take pride in our city by starting with cleanup for all retail squares, such as off hours, trash removal in the retail areas, upgrade the lighting to be brighter and more inviting.

248
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:44,680
With Chevalier Theatre partnering with Professional Management Company, we have a window of opportunity to make the heart of our city, Meffitt Square, more appealing.

249
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:54,178
welcoming upscale stores, art galleries, restaurants, adding affordable housing, a proper city parking facility, and maybe even a movie theater.

250
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:03,622
Our neighborhoods also need attention, not only the streets and the sidewalks, but proper planning in our zoning to keep our city a community.

251
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:06,543
Comprehensive plan to repair our streets,

252
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:11,965
All the city streets, we need to hold contractors to a higher standard.

253
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:16,067
They need to return our streets to safe and passable ways.

254
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:18,368
Anything less is not acceptable.

255
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:27,552
Making our city into the vibrant, exciting and upcoming city it can and it will become, just as the ones around us.

256
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:37,646
We need to incorporate the appeal of our city to all ages, including our children, by giving them an opportunity to want to return to an affordable and vibrant community.

257
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,310
Let me ask, what has changed?

258
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:43,194
The amount of land in the square has not shrunk.

259
00:22:44,242 --> 00:22:47,123
Our family and community values have not vanished.

260
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:56,085
I am aware we do not have the amount of land space that other cities have, but with a comprehensive plan, we have enough space to get to the next level.

261
00:22:56,885 --> 00:23:01,267
By doing so, the other jewels of our city will also benefit, such as Haines Square,

262
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:08,919
West Medford, the Hillside, Wellington, Glenwood, in all our entire city.

263
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:16,061
Revisit the parking issue, making it sensible for all, providing a more concise and transparent program.

264
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:17,701
We need to be realistic.

265
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:24,543
Under these circumstances, things will not change over at night, and it will take time, but it can be done.

266
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:32,625
We cannot afford for discussions to continue based on who to blame instead of going forward in a positive and a productive manner.

267
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:36,547
I am a candidate who votes on the issue, not a promise for the vote.

268
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:40,648
I am a proven candidate.

269
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:49,793
I have made changes, not just by talking, but by rolling up my sleeves and getting the work done, which in itself makes me a uniquely qualified candidate.

270
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:56,176
Continue bringing new ideas, integrity, hard work, and passion to the City Council.

271
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:58,677
It will positively impact our community.

272
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,238
I ask for your trust in me and your vote.

273
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:03,737
Number 10 on the Medford City ballot.

274
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:07,058
Thank you, Anne-Marie.

275
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,639
Curtis Tootin.

276
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,582
Hello, friends, honored guests, and all fellow Medford residents.

277
00:24:31,273 --> 00:24:34,175
My name is Curtis Tudin, and I am a candidate for Medford City Council.

278
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:42,421
As a lifelong resident of this wonderful city, with years of experience working and volunteering in our community, I know I deserve your vote this election season.

279
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:48,006
This is my first run for public office, but I have great confidence thanks to tremendous early support from residents.

280
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,367
Together, we have what it takes to win.

281
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,429
Frankly, we need a win right now.

282
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,371
People in our city are tired of the current political climate.

283
00:24:56,031 --> 00:25:00,195
Thankfully, Medford's November 7th election is a great opportunity for change.

284
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:06,712
Voters out there asking, why should I cast a vote, my most important civic responsibility, for a Curtis student?

285
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,394
Let me tell you, there are many reasons, all of them good.

286
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:14,178
First and foremost, I'm the best candidate in support of Medford's environment and public schools.

287
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:24,525
My campaign is based on the need to take action in response to climate change, and my career working for Medford Public Schools gave me an ideal perspective of the city's most important public service and largest budget item.

288
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:29,709
There are so many important steps our city can take to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change,

289
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,445
Unfortunately, our city council has lacked leadership.

290
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:42,793
After years of volunteer service and as current chairperson of Medford's Energy and Environment Committee, I know how to increase renewable energy use and save residents money on their electricity bill at the same time.

291
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:47,877
My first act as city councilor will be to help pass community energy aggregation in Medford.

292
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:50,559
It's one of many steps towards meeting our goals.

293
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:58,705
Others include fixing toxic gas leaks, planning for severe weather, expanding recycling services, supporting community gardens, and much more.

294
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:07,231
If elected, I promise to responsibly lead Medford through all the work that needs to be done, prioritizing sustainability and protecting natural resources.

295
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:10,932
Of course, the city's most important natural resource is our children.

296
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:13,853
We protect and empower them by supporting public schools.

297
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:18,995
Every day, thousands of students and their teachers do great things in Medford, but there is vast room for improvement.

298
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:24,317
The same can be said for all public services and infrastructure, from potholes to police and fire departments.

299
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:28,919
So if elected, I promise Medford will do more to meet the needs of its residents and workforce.

300
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:33,677
A resolution to the opiate addiction epidemic is one need currently not being met.

301
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:40,381
In 2016, there were over 64,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States, and Medford has suffered its share of tragedy.

302
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:47,165
It has also taken some steps to relieve the issue, most recently by appointing a recovery counselor and supporting Team Medford programs.

303
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:57,832
But we need to do more to end drug use stigmatization, implement additional prevention and intervention policy, and make sure there is funding available for innovative programs that address this public health crisis.

304
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:03,689
Overall, my campaign's commitment to running free of financial donations ensures my priorities are earnest.

305
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:10,311
By working together on municipal projects, we can achieve great things, but the key to success is not leaving anyone behind.

306
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:19,055
Many will only, Medford, excuse me, will only progress if all community members are involved, which is why social justice issues are a primary part of my campaign.

307
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:25,257
A clear next step is for Medford to become a sanctuary city and create policy that welcomes diversity and is free of fear.

308
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:32,300
Then, through the process of charter reform, our city can promote equity and work to end injustice, whatever form it may take.

309
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,181
Events like tonight get me excited for all the progress we can make together after election day.

310
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:41,502
Thanks to the Medford Democratic City Committee and all volunteers who helped bring us together.

311
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,643
And thanks to everyone watching the video.

312
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:47,203
Your participation in person and online makes our democracy stronger.

313
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:52,825
If elected, I promise to emphasize collaboration so all perspectives are represented in the political process.

314
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:56,667
I'm working hard for your vote, but I'll work even harder as your city councilor.

315
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:01,109
People will have unprecedented access to their local government with me as an elected official.

316
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,712
Whatever the issue, Medford residents can count on me to care, listen, and give voice to their cause.

317
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:19,697
For more information about my campaign, please call my phone at 781-572-7196, email me at curtis.tootin at gmail.com, visit votetootin2017.com, or find me on Facebook.

318
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,459
Most important, make sure to vote on November 7th, and remember,

319
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:29,659
A vote for Curtis Tudin is a vote for change at City Council, for a prosperous future, and local politics to be proud of.

320
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:31,679
In conclusion, Go Medford.

321
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,380
Vote Tudin.

322
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,280
Thank you very much.

323
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,300
Thank you, Curtis.

324
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:49,903
Council Marks, you're next.

325
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:52,103
Good evening.

326
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:58,169
When I first ran for office back some 16 years ago, my slogan was, time for a change.

327
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,932
Now I've updated my slogan to, experience counts.

328
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:07,616
Let me begin by saying what I hope all of you already know about me.

329
00:29:08,216 --> 00:29:08,957
I love this city.

330
00:29:09,297 --> 00:29:11,579
It has been the passion for as long as I can remember.

331
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:16,623
It is why I've devoted the better half of my adult life to public service here in Meffitt.

332
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,465
We are poised on the threshold of a new and exciting era.

333
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,427
A step forward, front and center,

334
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,559
reaching into the 21st century.

335
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,021
If you give me your support, your confidence, and your trust, we can soar.

336
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:36,784
We can make our city the envy of its neighbors, the pride of its citizens, a legacy of generations to come.

337
00:29:37,504 --> 00:29:39,665
Let's make Meffitt the miracle city on the Mystic.

338
00:29:40,825 --> 00:29:42,006
What are your ideas, you ask?

339
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,824
What have you accomplished?

340
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:45,925
What can we expect from Michael Marks?

341
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:47,685
All fair questions.

342
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:56,227
So let me give you a broad overview of my accomplishments and what you can expect from me over the next two years in both style and substance.

343
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:02,148
My agenda as your representative will be driven by you, the residents, and by public input.

344
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:03,928
It will be a collaboration.

345
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:07,029
My goal is to be both transparent and accessible.

346
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,172
As your city councilor, I have never shrunk from the big contentious issues.

347
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,873
I will continue to take them head on as I always have.

348
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:17,755
My message to the neighbors is this.

349
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,375
I am your voice.

350
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:20,916
I will continue to hear you.

351
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:23,537
You always have a friend in Michael Marks.

352
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:26,699
I will yield to no one in my support of the neighborhoods.

353
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:32,822
During the past 16 years as your city councilor, I have dedicated myself to doing the people's business.

354
00:30:33,577 --> 00:30:37,259
And to this end, I've worked tirelessly to be worthy of your trust.

355
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:46,825
Over that time, I've become experienced in a broad and expansive range of issues, and I would like to think I learned what makes Method heart beat.

356
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:55,430
The revitalization of Method Square is central to our success as a thriving community on a cusp of a new, innovative future.

357
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:59,253
Economic opportunities abound, but we must reach out for them.

358
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,155
Today, one of those opportunities exists in plain view.

359
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:06,556
three city-owned parcels of land on the eastern edge of Meffitt Square.

360
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:17,123
As your city councilor, I will encourage an invigorated Office of Community Development to take a more proactive role in attracting new investment and to charting the future of our community.

361
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:18,502
Seniors.

362
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,843
Seniors will always be on my radar.

363
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:25,045
We forged a connection many years ago while I was a novice city councilor.

364
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:34,889
And to this day, I actively support issues important to our seniors and will continue to marshal all the resources at my disposal to ensure that seniors always get a fair shot.

365
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:36,450
You guys can count on it.

366
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:48,896
As your city councilor, I proposed and want approval to reduce the speed limit citywide to 25 miles an hour to create Method's first raised crosswalk, improving pedestrian safety.

367
00:31:49,696 --> 00:31:56,358
I advocated for a complete review of our current zoning laws to encourage smart growth concepts and neighborhood protections.

368
00:31:57,138 --> 00:32:03,120
I proposed a resolution which resulted in an improved emergency preparedness procedures for Method public housing.

369
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:10,444
I supported the hiring of a traffic engineer to review public safety, traffic calming initiatives, and roadway improvements.

370
00:32:11,165 --> 00:32:18,149
As your city councilor, I will continue to support and offer suggestions to reduce the unrelenting airplane noise over our neighborhoods.

371
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:27,175
I offer the resolve which led to the home rule petition to create a charter review commission in order to review ways of improving how city government operates.

372
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:44,227
I also organized a group of residents and established the Meffitt Dog Park Committee, securing a private grant of $250,000 from the Stanton Foundation, and we are in the process right now behind the McGlynn School and Riverbend Park to build Meffitt's first dog park.

373
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:52,971
As your city council, I successfully led the charge to take back city ownership of the Hegner Center with the intent to create Meffitt's first art center.

374
00:32:53,943 --> 00:33:01,269
I sponsored resolutions to create temporary pop-up community space in our parks, business districts, and unrented storefronts.

375
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:08,534
I was the originator of the resolution to have solar panels installed in the DPW facility, reducing our carbon footprint.

376
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:19,242
As a daily public transportation user, I will continue to support programs to build and improve upon public transportation in Method, including public bike paths and walkway improvements.

377
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:22,525
I offer the resolution which created Method's rain barrel program,

378
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:25,386
to conserve and repurpose rain runoff water.

379
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:31,309
And now that you know who I am and where I plan to journey with you over the next couple of years, let me finish with these words.

380
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:34,590
I am and always have been motivated by a sense of duty.

381
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,031
20 seconds.

382
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:35,991
A summons to serve.

383
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:37,312
What can I do for my community?

384
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:42,394
And how can I improve the lives of my fellow citizens?

385
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:45,715
And yes, I have an obligation to the people of Meffitt to get it right.

386
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:50,878
I also would like to thank the Meffitt Firefighters Local 1032,

387
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:54,258
and the New England Laborers for their endorsement.

388
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,359
I thank you very much for your time tonight.

389
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,940
Thanks, Councilman.

390
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,023
Brianna Lungo-Kern.

391
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,307
Good evening, and thank you all for being here and listening.

392
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:19,589
My name is Brianna Lungo-Kern, and I am a candidate for re-election to the Medford City Council.

393
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,570
I was born and raised in Medford,

394
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,714
My parents are Edward and Susan Lungo, and my sister is Ariana Lungo.

395
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:27,154
I attended St.

396
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:29,614
Joseph's School, and I graduated from Medford High School in 1998.

397
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:33,355
I've been a member of the Massachusetts Bar since 2006.

398
00:34:35,395 --> 00:34:43,957
I opened a law practice in Wellington Circle, Medford, over eight years ago with my longtime friend, Kathleen Collins, called the Law Offices of Lungo, Kern, and Collins.

399
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:51,438
My husband of 10 years, David Kern, is the owner and operator of Boston Physical Therapy and Wellness on Mystic Ave in Medford.

400
00:34:52,453 --> 00:35:01,821
Dave and I are extremely lucky to have three great children and raise them in a city like Medford, Bailey, Calloway, and Cody.

401
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:09,447
When I first ran for the Medford City Council, I stated that one of the seven should be close to the youth, and now more than ever, that statement is true.

402
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:20,657
I have fought for and will continue to fight for low class size, for my children and yours, safer security measures within the schools, safer access to the schools,

403
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,624
and better management of the schools.

404
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:29,127
Medford needs a succession plan for our superintendent of schools, and we need to start a nationwide search now.

405
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:34,709
I, along with many parents, tried to push for this last year, but the votes were not there.

406
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:37,250
This needs to be a priority in Medford.

407
00:35:37,911 --> 00:35:40,492
It's time to bring our schools past the middle of the pack.

408
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:47,575
In the past, I've worked hard to help implement a girls' varsity hockey team, establish an affordable summer camp at Medford High School,

409
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:51,077
maintained funding for Medford's Park League program, and many others.

410
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:55,839
I've also worked hard and pushed for better maintenance of all our school and municipal buildings.

411
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:06,964
As chair of the Public Safety Committee, I helped make people aware of the deplorable conditions of the old DPW facility and was a positive vote to create a new one.

412
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:12,047
I've been vocal on the rundown conditions of the police department and the fire stations.

413
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,808
This past year, although in the minority,

414
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:20,392
I was extremely vocal in requesting that our fire headquarters be renovated at the same time as our police department.

415
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:30,540
I am never afraid to voice my opinions, ask the appropriate questions, and demand answers for what I believe is in the best interests of Medford.

416
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:44,872
Within the last few years on the Medford City Council, I have moved for, fought for, been vocal on, and supported charter review, filing suit against our Board of Appeals for approving 11 variances and allowing 500 unit development in our city,

417
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:52,855
without the proper traffic study, without the required parking spots, and then some, all of which would have crippled that neighborhood.

418
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:58,436
That helped set the tone in this city that our neighborhoods have to come first.

419
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:05,117
Our residents have to have a say and be included in what goes on development-wise in every area.

420
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:14,139
I have supported the Senior Citizen Work Program, the hiring of a recovery coach and substance coordinator to help combat the opiate crisis.

421
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:22,985
I am continuously requesting higher maintenance budget for our infrastructure, streets, sidewalks, parks, and municipal and school buildings.

422
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:27,368
These basic city services and maintenance should take precedence in our budget.

423
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:30,890
I helped eliminate the odd even parking ban during the winter months.

424
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,132
I moved for an 18-month demo delay to protect Meffitt's historic properties.

425
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,433
I've supported reducing the speed limit.

426
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:41,836
I've requested new radar guns and speed monitor signs to make our streets safer.

427
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:56,258
Air traffic noise awareness is a goal of mine, was a goal of mine, and after I spoke about it numerous times on the council floor, two wonderful representatives were appointed and are leading the charge in trying to get resolved and keep Medford educated.

428
00:37:56,898 --> 00:38:01,039
I'm advocating for and working on an ordinance to stop level three gas leaks.

429
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,120
I support an ordinance that holds universities accountable for students that live in Medford.

430
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,041
I've requested and will continue to request we hire a grant writer.

431
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,662
I will continue to fight for transparency in government

432
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:14,694
because I still believe it is lacking.

433
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:22,261
Finding out about a plan about a new police station from the press is wrong, and I will continue to fight for transparency.

434
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,664
If reelected, I will continue to be vocal and work on these issues.

435
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:32,730
I will continue to request funding to hire an outside company to help this Medford City Council update its zoning ordinances.

436
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,015
I will continue to request citizen advisory working groups and task forces to guide the city in future development.

437
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,162
If re-elected, I will continue to work hard to make a difference within the city of Medford.

438
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:48,504
I will continue to do my homework so that each and every vote I make is the right vote.

439
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:52,326
The vote that I believe will benefit the city of Medford and our citizens.

440
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:58,449
I promise that I will continue to be a leader and not a follower.

441
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,451
I will never be an automatic yes vote.

442
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:03,512
I will be an independent voice.

443
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,493
I thank you for the support you've given me so far, and I ask for your vote on November 7th.

444
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:09,034
Thank you.

445
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:31,130
Thank you to the Democratic Committee for giving us this opportunity to speak tonight.

446
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:36,657
It's a pleasure to be here, and it's been a pleasure and an honor to serve you, the people of Medford.

447
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:39,160
My name is Fred DelaRusso.

448
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,223
I'm a candidate for re-election to City Council.

449
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:44,685
I've served on the council for nearly 12 years now, six terms.

450
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,746
I'm in the end of my sixth term, up for reelection to a seventh.

451
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:51,968
I am part of a family that's lived in this community for four years.

452
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:55,490
I'm the fourth generation of my family to live in Medford.

453
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,712
I'm the third generation of my family to live in the same house.

454
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:04,675
I had to buy the house from my father, but it was the house that he had to buy from his father as well.

455
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,417
And I'm the third generation of my family to operate a business in Medford.

456
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:10,618
I love this city.

457
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:16,182
I've had a lot of opportunity in my life to do other things, but this is where I choose to be.

458
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:21,847
This is where I choose to serve, to live out my family's heritage of service in this community.

459
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,029
It's something that's shaped who I am as a person.

460
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,332
The only time I lived out of the city was the 12 years I was in religious life.

461
00:40:29,873 --> 00:40:35,497
And that experience too, both academically and spiritually, shaped who I am as a person as well.

462
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:37,919
And finally,

463
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:44,001
One of the things that shaped me is doing the work of being a city councilor and serving all of you.

464
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,122
It's been a good experience.

465
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,024
It's been challenging at times.

466
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,046
It's been disappointing at times.

467
00:40:52,587 --> 00:41:02,213
But at the end of it all, I'm glad I'm doing it and I want to continue to do it for all of you and for all of us because in that we grow and prosper together.

468
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,736
I've learned a lot over my years on the council.

469
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:12,320
And one of the greatest issues or lessons I've learned is that we only get things done by working together.

470
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:28,749
So I could rattle off to you a long list of things that I've accomplished in the 12 years that I've served on this council, and I've had a share in virtually all of them that have happened in this city, though there are some that I perhaps can't put my name to.

471
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:35,113
However, I've learned that nothing gets done here unless we're working together.

472
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:41,376
We work together by listening to the community, and I've done that throughout the years, and I continue to do that.

473
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:45,218
My opinion has changed on issues because of that.

474
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:52,541
I was a skeptic with the Green Line, and yet I've come along, and I see its benefit.

475
00:41:52,841 --> 00:42:03,806
I was concerned on how it will affect many of the neighbors, but I've worked hard and long on that with many of you, and I've come along on that, and I see its benefit.

476
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:19,590
I've established good relationships in this community among the greater business community because I'm a businessman, but also because I'm a city councilor, and I see how people who live here, work here, and invest in this community really make it a great place.

477
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:24,831
I've established great relationships with the people who work in this building.

478
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:31,232
That's how we get things done, by having solid, good, working relationships with people.

479
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,871
The people who work in this building are committed to you.

480
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,093
They are committed to you.

481
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,155
They don't come here because it's a great building to work in.

482
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:41,776
The bathrooms are terrible.

483
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:45,258
This ceiling was caving in until a couple weeks ago.

484
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,520
And the roof was leaking until a couple months ago.

485
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:49,621
It's fresh.

486
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:50,482
It's redone.

487
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,643
We still got a ways to go.

488
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,465
But people are committed to you.

489
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,287
The people in public safety are committed to you.

490
00:42:56,687 --> 00:43:10,119
I was not afraid to stand alone, to move forward on the bonding of money, to begin the process of the new police station, which has been a long-term goal of mine, which we'll finally see come through.

491
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:18,807
I've been honored to work with a group of people, one committee that sort of fizzled out in its momentum, through no fault of anybody, I think.

492
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,834
But, and then to work with the new Revive Committee that's working on Medford Square.

493
00:43:24,315 --> 00:43:27,898
This is gonna be the thing that we're on the cusp of moving on.

494
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:29,780
We're closer than ever before.

495
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,861
There's stuff underway.

496
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:32,683
We're building a new park in the square.

497
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:37,268
We have possibly a hotel that's going out right next door.

498
00:43:37,968 --> 00:43:39,470
And plans are being drawn for it.

499
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,253
And it's gonna be part of a revitalization

500
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:48,364
a renewed program for the revitalization of Medford Square.

501
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:51,965
I'm excited to be a part of that and I want to continue to work on that.

502
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:55,467
I've been an advocate for education and improving it.

503
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,007
It comes from my background as a Benedictine monk.

504
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:04,710
Who better to know the importance of having a new library in this community than someone that shared in that Benedictine tradition?

505
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,811
I'm enthusiastic for that.

506
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:07,972
20 seconds.

507
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:08,953
Thank you, Henry.

508
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:16,978
I'm enthused to be working towards improvements in all of our squares.

509
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,041
I'm also looking forward to continue to work on the budget.

510
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:27,366
You know, this year was in my 12 years on the City Council, this was the best budget that I had the opportunity to work on.

511
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:35,889
and I'm gonna work hard to give you a new budget, and I ask for your vote, November 7th, for Del Russo number three, two, on the ballot.

512
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:38,571
Thank you, Councilor Del Russo.

513
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:47,080
Robert Cappucci.

514
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:06,482
Thank you to the organizers for this event tonight, so that these candidates can come and bring our message to the city of Medford.

515
00:45:07,363 --> 00:45:08,223
I'm Robert Capucci.

516
00:45:08,363 --> 00:45:09,624
I'm 47 years old.

517
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:12,345
I'm the youngest of seven kids in my family.

518
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:14,646
I'm a lifelong Medford resident.

519
00:45:15,406 --> 00:45:18,768
I graduated from Franklin Pierce College in 1994.

520
00:45:18,828 --> 00:45:28,692
I went into teaching, and then after a few years of that, I joined the Army Reserves, and I currently work in electronics, making laser scalpels for a company up in Lexington.

521
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:32,000
I heard a lot of the candidates touch upon

522
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:42,706
The issues that were sent to us, the city committee here sent us actually 30 different topics to discuss with five minutes to talk.

523
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:45,808
So I chose five, and I'm going to just answer them directly.

524
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:49,531
The number one I chose was the opioid crisis.

525
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:54,494
I lost my best friend in 2003 to drug addiction.

526
00:45:55,374 --> 00:46:01,218
A couple weeks ago, at 46 years old, he had to bury a high school graduate, a classmate of mine.

527
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:08,383
It's the number one killer of people under 50 years old in America, and it needs to be addressed.

528
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:22,732
I think Medford should start leading the way in research and how many prescriptions are actually being given for opioids, to whom, for what purposes, and to investigate to our fullest to ensure every single prescription is right and proper.

529
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,254
I will continue to support and advocate

530
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:41,168
for worthwhile community programs like candlelight vigils, various drug addiction rehab facilities and groups, and other initiatives we have here in Medford such as Team Medford and the new drug officer recently appointed by the mayor's office.

531
00:46:41,669 --> 00:46:46,271
I'd also like to establish here in Medford a kind of a tough love approach.

532
00:46:46,767 --> 00:47:09,295
and send out coordinated, communicated messages to all the residents on a regular basis to get people to realize their problem and light a fire under their butts to get the help that they need so they stop dying and they can enjoy the holidays, child graduations, weddings, all the things that make this life worth living.

533
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:12,376
The Memphis City Council should start leading the way on this initiative.

534
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:16,018
The next topic I want to talk about is inclusion.

535
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:29,444
I think the best way we can be more inclusive of our diversity here in Medford is something that I've been calling for throughout my campaign and for years before.

536
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:41,356
and it was highlighted just last night in these chambers by the excellent speech of Dr. John Stirella of Metcalf Street in two words, term limits.

537
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:48,526
If we had a three-term term limit for the elected right now in Medford, there would be five open seats on this council.

538
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:51,747
for this city to take advantage of and run for.

539
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:53,928
There would be four seats on the school committee.

540
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,049
We'd have two new challenging candidates for mayor.

541
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:13,554
Nothing else would lead the way to include the diverse population we have in Medford so that we can hear from all different kinds of people to come up here and act, all different new ideas, new initiatives to include all of Medford in our wonderful city.

542
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:14,875
Parking.

543
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:18,596
I recently had a conversation with the manager of Carol's Restaurant.

544
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:24,336
We discussed something that was recently featured on a news program, Chronicle.

545
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:45,846
That report was called the Amazon effect, whereby mom-and-pop shops across Medford, across Massachusetts, across the country are getting walloped because more people can easily just go online and order from various, you know, internet services, and they're not being able to keep up with

546
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,607
these internet companies, the mom and pop shops.

547
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:54,698
So what cities and towns are doing to combat this and make our city squares more attractive is

548
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:57,946
Offer no-fee parking.

549
00:48:58,446 --> 00:49:01,708
I lead the way to get us out of the contract with Republic Parking.

550
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:03,990
We need to revitalize these city squares.

551
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,150
That's the best way to do it.

552
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:21,962
If we offer no-fee parking with strict two-hour limits so that we don't have that problem we used to have that's probably still going on on the outskirts of the city, we make sure that people that come here and park and leave their cars all day, after two hours, they're towed at their own expense.

553
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:24,604
Taxes.

554
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:31,819
I am actually for the city to collect more taxes and have more taxes in their coffers.

555
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,904
We need these funds for hiring more police, firefighters, teachers, teachers' aides, infrastructure repairs.

556
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:42,785
What I don't believe in... 20 seconds.

557
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:44,006
Oh, really?

558
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:44,847
That quick already?

559
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:45,487
Gee whiz.

560
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,142
Well, what I don't believe in is constantly raising the tax rate.

561
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:56,245
What I think is what we do is we create more taxpayers, and the way we do that is to cut taxes.

562
00:49:56,605 --> 00:50:02,589
With my last few seconds, I want to make an appeal to the 28,000 registered voters who don't vote.

563
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:05,731
Come out and vote on November 7th for Robert Cappucci.

564
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:06,111
Thank you.

565
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:06,831
That was really good.

566
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:09,933
Thank you, Mr. Cappucci.

567
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:22,568
Next two years, we'll give you 20 minutes, and we will charge you extra money.

568
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,030
George Sacco.

569
00:50:34,057 --> 00:50:35,298
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

570
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:36,459
Thank you for coming.

571
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,343
My name is George Rick Sacco, and I'm a candidate for Memphis City Council.

572
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:44,225
As a community advocate,

573
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,472
volunteer, husband, father, grandfather.

574
00:50:48,593 --> 00:50:53,556
I want to work in bringing more leadership and positive action to the citizens of Medford.

575
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:56,458
I'm a lifelong resident of Medford.

576
00:50:57,579 --> 00:50:59,841
I've been married for 46 years to my wife, Sandra.

577
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:03,263
I have two sons, Brian and Eric, and six wonderful grandchildren.

578
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:06,366
I'm a Medford High School graduate.

579
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:10,849
I served three years in the United States Army, serving one year in Korea.

580
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,772
I'm a veteran in pride

581
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:16,868
in honor to have served my country.

582
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:24,070
I attended Hampshire College, graduated with a business degree in management.

583
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:32,011
I have retired from the General Electric Company after 38 years of service as a senior sales engineer.

584
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:44,833
I was a member of the Mayor's Energy Commission for six years, and I received the Medford Green Award for citizen participation in that program.

585
00:51:46,818 --> 00:51:55,284
Medford has very specific needs that must be met to improve our quality of life in our neighborhoods.

586
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:59,066
These are just a few of those needs that I've outlined.

587
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:14,137
I can't get into specifics on each one, but I would like to discuss the opiate crisis, the charter review, and the street and sidewalk program, the issues which

588
00:52:15,213 --> 00:52:40,876
I should have mentioned, I am going to mention, uh, the charter review, sports zoning issues, adequate funding for our police and fire department, parking enforcement review of the existing contract, the opiate crisis and historical preservation of our buildings and our open spaces.

589
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:48,308
I'd like to start with the opiate crisis.

590
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,731
I want to give some statistics.

591
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:57,234
Medford in 2015 was ranked 25 in opiate deaths in Massachusetts.

592
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:00,056
2010 to 2015, 71 opiate drug-related deaths in Medford.

593
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,518
2014, we lost 14 people.

594
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:02,738
15, we lost 20.

595
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:17,053
16, we lost 17.

596
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:20,376
2017 numbers are in yet, but they're gonna be double digits.

597
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:23,258
2016 to 2017, 610 deaths in Massachusetts alone, opiate and drug related deaths.

598
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,341
July 2016 to June 2017, in this city,

599
00:53:44,741 --> 00:53:54,003
Our police department responded 52 times to narc drug users, basically brought back 52 people to life.

600
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:55,223
We have a crisis.

601
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:09,226
When I'm elected city councilor, I'm going to ask the administration for a line item in the budget geared specifically for the opioid crisis.

602
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,387
And included in that budget, I'm going to ask the administration

603
00:54:15,326 --> 00:54:22,548
to supply and equip our police and fire first responders with the latest personal protection equipment.

604
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:27,409
They're the first ones that go in these buildings, and the first ones as far as health issues.

605
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:29,489
They have to be protected.

606
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:35,611
As far as the charter review, 30 years.

607
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:38,051
The charter is our most important document.

608
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:39,792
It's like our Constitution.

609
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:42,092
Our Constitution is looked at.

610
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:43,533
Congress looks at it.

611
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:45,073
The people look at it.

612
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,400
We make changes, we don't make changes.

613
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:49,762
We have to do that for Method.

614
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:51,303
30 years, we have not looked at this charter.

615
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:53,185
It's a review.

616
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:55,287
The people vote.

617
00:54:55,787 --> 00:55:01,231
Whatever comes out of the commission, the people vote, any changes up or any changes down.

618
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:06,475
So it is a people's involvement, the citizens of Method's involvement in the charter review.

619
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:12,000
As far as street repairs, sidewalk repairs, currently,

620
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:15,354
Our streets are repaired on a yearly basis.

621
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:16,896
The council gets a budget.

622
00:55:19,037 --> 00:55:19,498
20 seconds.

623
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:21,099
I'm going to end.

624
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,244
I'm looking forward to serving as a Memphis City Councilor.

625
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:28,745
I appreciated you coming tonight.

626
00:55:28,885 --> 00:55:31,187
And vote for me for City Council.

627
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:32,348
I'd appreciate it very much.

628
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:33,489
November 7th.

629
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:33,809
Thank you.

630
00:55:35,571 --> 00:55:37,032
Thank you, Mr. Sacco.

631
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:42,897
John Falco.

632
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:52,473
Hello, hello.

633
00:55:53,214 --> 00:55:56,935
My name is John Falco, and I'm a candidate for re-election to the Medford City Council.

634
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:58,936
I am currently in my first term.

635
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:06,820
I'd like to begin by thanking the Medford Ward 6 Committee for hosting this event tonight, and I'd also like to thank each of you for being here tonight as well.

636
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:13,703
My wife Jackie and I reside at 123 Fulton Spring Road with our three sons, John, Joey, and Jack.

637
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:16,805
All three of my sons attend the Medford Public Schools.

638
00:56:17,993 --> 00:56:28,016
I'm currently an assistant vice president at an investment management firm in Boston and have over 25 years of finance experience in both public and private global organizations.

639
00:56:29,077 --> 00:56:32,958
The city of Medford provides a welcoming home to people from all over the world.

640
00:56:33,338 --> 00:56:37,040
I'm proud to live in a city that embraces diversity and inclusion.

641
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,202
As a first term city councilor, I have advocated for issues that I believe benefit all of Medford.

642
00:56:44,794 --> 00:57:01,288
I believe in a transparent government that supports the men, women, and organizations that are the backbone of our community, our schools, our police, and our fire departments, arts and cultural organizations, and citizen-led groups in an effort to increase transparency and community involvement.

643
00:57:01,808 --> 00:57:11,557
I led the effort to purchase legislative software which will increase transparency by providing 24-7 on-demand access to all public meetings and documents.

644
00:57:12,492 --> 00:57:29,640
As a parent, I know firsthand the value of small class size, improved technology, special education services, infrastructure improvements, and new program offerings, which is why I continue to advocate for additional funding to support the educational needs of our children.

645
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:32,819
My commitment to public safety is unwavering.

646
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:42,222
I implemented neighborhood community police meetings to cultivate engagement between the residents and our police officers in the interest of building stronger neighborhoods.

647
00:57:43,262 --> 00:57:55,327
I have also supported a new police station in turnout gear for our firefighters, and will continue to advocate for additional resources, equipment, and staff to protect our police and fire departments and Public Works employees.

648
00:57:56,427 --> 00:57:59,188
As we all know, traffic throughout our city is a problem.

649
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:03,446
that continues to have a negative impact on the quality of life for all residents.

650
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:09,352
The first resolution I offered was that the city hire a traffic engineer to study this significant problem.

651
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:17,660
Week after week, I staunchly advocated for this position because I believe it will aid in improving public safety and the quality of life.

652
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:23,707
Through this hard work and determination, a traffic engineer was finally included in this year's budget.

653
00:58:24,327 --> 00:58:30,490
I supported lowering the speed limit to 25 miles per hour in the interest of public safety, but I know there's more work that we need to do.

654
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:40,422
My resolution to hire an outside consulting firm to conduct a zoning needs analysis began the dialogue among my colleagues about this real critical issue.

655
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:48,763
Our zoning has not been reviewed in 50 years, and a complete assessment is needed to guide future smart and responsible development.

656
00:58:49,784 --> 00:59:01,026
I have been and will continue to be proactive in protecting our neighborhoods from oversized irresponsible development, whether it be in North Method, South Method, Wellington, West, Hillside,

657
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:11,773
I also supported extending the demolition delay on historic properties from 6 to 18 months because I am committed to protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods.

658
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:19,279
I continue to advocate for more resources in our Office of Community Development to support current and future business owners.

659
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:29,268
I am committed to making these areas more welcoming with improved lighting, safer and cleaner streets, and a beautification program that includes public art.

660
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:36,605
With its access to Mystic River and new management of the Chevalier Theatre, now is the time to revitalize Medford Square.

661
00:59:37,305 --> 00:59:44,647
I will continue to advocate for the creation of walking paths from Hormel Stadium to Medford Square as part of this revitalization.

662
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:49,448
Medford is changing, but it's important to remember that we need to maintain what we already have.

663
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:54,090
I believe it is critical that we maintain our schools, city buildings,

664
00:59:54,897 --> 00:59:55,397
in parks.

665
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:57,898
We need to repair and pave our streets and sidewalks.

666
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:04,500
We need to maintain all of our investments, old and new, for current and future generations of Medford residents.

667
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,362
We also need to think about environmental sustainability for the next wave of Medford residents.

668
01:00:11,182 --> 01:00:16,223
I was the only city councilor to support municipal aggregation, and I'll support it when it comes up again.

669
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:18,764
And I also supported charter review.

670
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:24,586
Medford continues to be a great place to live, work, play, and raise a family.

671
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:31,434
With its rich past and promising future, we are a city on the rise with a great deal of opportunity and potential.

672
01:00:32,694 --> 01:00:39,438
Over the next two years, I look forward to working with you and advocating for you to move Medford forward.

673
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:43,140
For more information, please go to my website, johnfalco.org.

674
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,882
I respectfully ask for your vote on Tuesday, November 7th.

675
01:00:47,722 --> 01:00:49,483
I'm John Falco, number three on the ballot.

676
01:00:49,843 --> 01:00:52,845
And if you want to contact me, 781-395-1290 or falco4medford at gmail.com.

677
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,570
Thank you, Councilor Fargo.

678
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,210
Thank you.

679
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:08,572
Mr. Scalfo, you're next.

680
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:19,934
Good evening, everyone.

681
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:24,015
My name is Ray Scalfo, and I'm a candidate for the Medford City Council.

682
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:28,096
My wife Nancy and I have made Medford our home for better than 30 years.

683
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:34,437
Together, we own and operate a successful HVAC, home heating oil business in Medford.

684
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:40,039
We employ a diverse workforce, and these employees have been key to our success.

685
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:49,902
We have been instrumental in advocating employees' education, training, and in several cases have helped some start their own business in this field.

686
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,443
Helping people and caring is what we do.

687
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:58,465
There are many aspects to running a successful business that are similar to running a city.

688
01:01:59,324 --> 01:02:12,114
Important in running a business is the implementation of a concise, functional, and realistic budget, including projections for personnel, equipment, facilities, and new growth.

689
01:02:14,156 --> 01:02:16,458
The same should be set forth in running a city.

690
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:20,961
So as you see, there is a little difference in running a business or running a city.

691
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:25,745
So with this in mind, I hope you understand why I'm running for the city council.

692
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:28,868
There needs to be major change

693
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:30,706
and the administrative process.

694
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:41,174
If you take a close look on how the city council operates under the city charter, you will see that in actuality, this body has no ability to affect real change in the city.

695
01:02:41,794 --> 01:02:44,556
Unfortunately, they have no real power.

696
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,838
This is what's wrong and needs to be addressed.

697
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:56,345
Although we have a few councilors who fight hard for the citizens and put in many hours, we have some who do not.

698
01:02:57,621 --> 01:03:04,244
It is a lot easier to go along, to get along, but this is not why we elect city councilors.

699
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,565
You need and you deserve positive results.

700
01:03:09,206 --> 01:03:12,407
The outdated and flawed city charter is part of the problem.

701
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:15,388
It gives sole power to the mayor.

702
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:20,550
There are no checks and balances unless four members of the council make the mayor accountable for her actions.

703
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:27,053
We as citizens are pretty much kept in the dark in spite of what you hear coming from the administration.

704
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,682
Who is watching out for our taxpayers?

705
01:03:32,582 --> 01:03:36,124
The present city council is not doing its job in this regard.

706
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:47,250
When the council had the opportunity to bypass the signature required of approximately 6,000 signatures to get the charter review, it was voted in favor by a four to three vote.

707
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:57,616
However, when it was sent to the state legislation for approval, it was voted down as the legislators felt that

708
01:03:58,354 --> 01:04:05,258
Because it was not a unanimous vote, there was not much interest on behalf of the citizens to have a hearing for the review.

709
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:10,200
Doesn't the legislature operate on the premise that majority rule?

710
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:16,904
Why then did they not accept the city council vote and have a public hearing at the statehouse?

711
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:22,547
Our state-led delegation was among the missing and failed to act on behalf of the Methodist citizens.

712
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:31,757
is an issue I strongly believe in, and if elected, will work with and for you to get it accomplished.

713
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:41,905
We have a candidate for school committee who has been collecting signatures for the long process version of the charter review and has incredibly collected over 4,200 signatures.

714
01:04:43,086 --> 01:04:47,790
Moving forward, I realize how easy it is to make promises as a candidate running for office.

715
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:51,873
It's all political talk, but the fact

716
01:04:52,445 --> 01:04:54,946
of the matter is that it really falls on deaf ears.

717
01:04:55,546 --> 01:05:07,192
And as every candidate makes the same promise year after year after year, just look at some of the sitting city councilors, not all, mind you, and their election year promises from previous elections are all the same.

718
01:05:07,712 --> 01:05:08,492
Nothing changes.

719
01:05:09,733 --> 01:05:19,657
We all know the despair and terrible conditions of our streets, sidewalks, signage, squares, lighting, and most of the municipal buildings are in.

720
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:21,358
And we all know

721
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:27,585
to serve shortage of personnel and equipment necessary to get the job done.

722
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:32,628
We all know that the budget is flawed and that the process must be changed.

723
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:43,155
Why are we being charged a new bimonthly tax called a water connectivity tax in addition to our regular water and sewerage bill?

724
01:05:44,576 --> 01:05:49,799
Knowing there's an approximate $6 million surplus in the water and sewerage enterprise account,

725
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:57,425
Why are the seniors being charged $25 per year for parking when it was promised by this administration that they would park for free?

726
01:05:58,265 --> 01:06:03,166
We must start to build a practical, solid business model and move forward.

727
01:06:03,566 --> 01:06:05,047
With your help, we can get this done.

728
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:12,148
So in closing, I promise you this, and only this, to listen to you and to act on your behalf to the best of my ability.

729
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:15,629
I hope to earn one of your seven votes this November 7th.

730
01:06:16,129 --> 01:06:17,709
I care about you and the city.

731
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:21,983
I, Ray Scaffo, candidate for city council, number 13 on the ballot.

732
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:22,623
Thank you.

733
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,624
Thank you, Mr. Scaffo.

734
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:31,104
George Scarpelli.

735
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:40,426
Good evening.

736
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:45,287
Two years ago, I stood before you and I told you that I have a vision.

737
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:50,389
of making Meffitt a better place to live, work, play, and raise a family.

738
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:56,233
Well, hello, my name is George Scott Pelley, and I'm running for re-election for the Meffitt City Council.

739
01:06:57,734 --> 01:07:04,297
Let me thank Henry and the Meffitt Ward and City Committee for holding this event this evening, and let me tell you a little bit about myself.

740
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:07,199
I'm a lifelong resident of the city of Meffitt.

741
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,362
I was born and raised on Parris Street by my wonderful parents, Lily and Aldo.

742
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:21,281
I'm married to my beautiful wife, Dina, and I have two wonderful children, John, 14, and Gianna, 12, who both attend the Medford Public Schools.

743
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:25,922
Growing up, I attended the Medford Public Schools and graduated in the class of 1987.

744
01:07:26,282 --> 01:07:36,025
I received my bachelor's degree from Salem State College in Education and then went off to Cambridge College to secure my master's degree in school administration.

745
01:07:37,046 --> 01:07:39,927
Many of you may know me because I've coached children or have

746
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:52,402
while volunteering as a coach at Medford High School, or my Medford High School coaching career for 20 years, or as a teacher in the Medford Public Schools for over 15 years.

747
01:07:53,643 --> 01:08:04,733
Well, nine years ago, I was given the opportunity to oversee the recreation department for the city of Somerville, where I oversaw staffing of over 100 employees in a multi-million dollar budget.

748
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:10,903
I'm a proud member of the Medford Mustang Hall of Fame and the Mass State Soccer Coaches Hall of Fame.

749
01:08:11,843 --> 01:08:21,549
I was a member of Medford's school committee for six years before running for seat on our Medford City Council last term.

750
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:28,053
While walking the streets of Medford, I spoke with our residents and listened to their concerns and issues.

751
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:33,376
I put a plan in place that if elected, I would attack these important issues head on.

752
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:40,506
One of the top priorities was having more collaborative city council, a city council that the city of Memphis would be proud of.

753
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:47,751
One good example of that collaboration was a 7-0 unanimous vote for this past budget that was unheard of.

754
01:08:48,912 --> 01:08:55,357
A few key initiatives that I championed over the last year and a half was first the implementation of a year-round recreation department.

755
01:08:56,098 --> 01:09:03,403
Thanks to the mayor and the city administration for naming me the chairperson for a focus group on recreation, this leadership role involved

756
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:15,676
involved working with committed volunteers in the community that worked to put the recreation program in place, which was unanimously voted in support of a full-time rec department.

757
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:35,238
a recreation department that will provide programming for senior citizens to preschool-age children, a department that will provide programming for our school department, Friends of the Fells, our arts community, our vice commission, the Friends of Chevalier Theater, the Mystic River Association, our business community, and many other partners.

758
01:09:36,278 --> 01:09:44,462
Another important issue to me and the residents of Medford and across this country is the horrible opiate crisis, which has personally affected many of us.

759
01:09:45,691 --> 01:09:50,954
After attending too many heart-wrenching funerals, we knew this issue needed to be addressed as soon as possible.

760
01:09:51,915 --> 01:10:06,304
The Mayor and the City Council has attacked this sensitive issue with great force by adding funds and hiring a recovery coach who works with the Board of Health and the Police Department that has helped families and individuals affected by this horrible epidemic.

761
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:08,606
Next is public safety.

762
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:17,365
Concerns of our citizens making sure we as a council supported all of our public safety personnel on the police and fire departments.

763
01:10:18,265 --> 01:10:28,868
We move forward the process of building a new police station, purchasing of 12 new police cars, new safety gear for our firemen and women with new breathing apparatus and turnout gear.

764
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:35,089
Finally, for the future, we have a plan in place for a new training tower and fire headquarters.

765
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,910
My continued support to public schools,

766
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:51,435
The city council secured educational funds through the budget that allows our class sizes to be arguably the best in the commonwealth, and to continue to give our teachers the ability to move our most important assets, our children, forward.

767
01:10:52,996 --> 01:11:02,862
This funding provided the resources necessary to add nine new programs in our vocational technical high school that included robotics, a restaurant, and a new media center.

768
01:11:03,882 --> 01:11:06,284
Also, we increased funding for capital improvement projects,

769
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,824
Those are a few key points that I've championed in such a short time.

770
01:11:11,105 --> 01:11:16,247
I'm asking you to help me to continue with our shared vision for this next election season.

771
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:20,229
We have accomplished a lot, but there is more hard work to go.

772
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:32,314
I will continue to focus on existing successes, push forward with the full review of our zoning laws and assist us in smart growth and development, continue with the development of Medford Square, and continue

773
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:40,405
to work with the Medford Community Preservation Community to assist in positive endeavors for affordable housing, historic community, recreation and arts.

774
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:44,706
I thank you all again and respectfully ask for your vote on November 7th.

775
01:11:44,746 --> 01:11:48,867
I'm joining you on November 7th on the ballot, hopefully number one in your heart.

776
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:49,107
Thank you.

777
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,328
Thank you Councilor Scarbelli.

778
01:11:55,248 --> 01:11:57,189
Next, Councilor Caraviello.

779
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:09,951
I'm the only left-handed person here, so we gotta switch to this side now.

780
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:14,532
Good evening.

781
01:12:15,232 --> 01:12:18,693
I would like to thank the Ward Six Committee for having this forum this evening.

782
01:12:20,014 --> 01:12:24,075
My name is Richard Caraviello, and I am running for re-election for the Memphis City Council.

783
01:12:24,655 --> 01:12:28,916
It has been an honor and a privilege to serve our city and its residents for the last three terms.

784
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:35,658
During this time, I've learned how complicated this job is, and the wide range of topics and issues I need to know.

785
01:12:36,636 --> 01:12:45,663
My years of experience as a businessman and community leader in the public sector have given me the skills to understand how our city truly operates.

786
01:12:46,624 --> 01:12:48,745
I've had the privilege to serve this community in many ways.

787
01:12:49,486 --> 01:13:04,217
As the president and executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, I have been a distinguished president of the Metro Kiwanis, and I serve the city as its representative to the Eastern Zone on the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, for which I am the chairman of that committee also.

788
01:13:05,931 --> 01:13:10,635
My wife Carol and I are married 41 years, and we've both lived in this community for our whole lives.

789
01:13:11,276 --> 01:13:12,437
We have raised our family here.

790
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:17,221
Our children and our grandchildren all attended the Medford Public Schools.

791
01:13:17,441 --> 01:13:22,726
I have volunteered in our community in children's literacy, schools, arts, sports, and charities.

792
01:13:23,246 --> 01:13:32,194
With nearly 30 years of business experience, including being an owner-operator and administrator-director, I possess the necessary skills to carefully examine the many issues we face

793
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:36,523
and to put resident interest first and keep Method moving forward.

794
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:44,486
In my role as council president, I am proud to have been a part of one of the most successful city councils in many years.

795
01:13:45,646 --> 01:13:54,130
And I take the responsibility of developing policies and setting priorities seriously while ensuring we work with the administration to balance our budget.

796
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:59,172
And I was proud to be part of a 7-0 budget, which is something that hasn't happened in many years here.

797
01:14:00,293 --> 01:14:01,193
I have the proven ability

798
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:13,768
to collaborate with our mayor and city staff to determine a common ground, develop solution, and analyze information objectively, which is an asset to the city council as we face crucial decisions.

799
01:14:15,829 --> 01:14:25,493
Being the last incumbent up here this evening, I have the ability to tag on to everyone's accomplishments because

800
01:14:25,814 --> 01:14:29,255
There's no accomplishment that any one counselor did by themselves.

801
01:14:29,935 --> 01:14:32,896
It was done as a group and a collaboration.

802
01:14:33,376 --> 01:14:37,038
So again, we all share the same goal here in our city.

803
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:41,219
And without collaboration, there would be nothing to ever get done in the city.

804
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,161
A challenge for us now is how to respond to the accelerated growth in the city of Medford.

805
01:14:50,322 --> 01:14:54,323
What we can do to preserve our small city feel we love and how to determine

806
01:14:55,203 --> 01:15:00,625
and how we continue to build on the great diversity in our community and to ensure housing affordability.

807
01:15:02,646 --> 01:15:05,447
These are the kinds of problems I have experienced and can tackle.

808
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:18,213
I am committed to advocating for our aging population by supporting programs to help our seniors and veterans who have served our country so they are able to live in the city of Medford.

809
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:24,876
I will support young families and advocate for the development of affordable housing and smart growth throughout our city.

810
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,612
Progress takes time, and it's now time that we start reinvesting in our community.

811
01:15:31,273 --> 01:15:43,820
I have supported many of the projects the mayor has proposed, such as the police station at Riverside Plaza, and the revitalization of Method Square, so it can be better utilized in creating an environment where our businesses can flourish.

812
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:52,265
A new fire training facility is in the works, and we were recently awarded a $12 million grant for a new library, which I took an important role in.

813
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:59,419
The newly founded Library Foundation will play a vital role in raising private funds to help lessen the cost to the city of Medford.

814
01:16:00,379 --> 01:16:11,105
These projects are not taking place at the same time as many will lead you to believe, but with responsible fiscal policies, these all can be achieved within the next five to six years.

815
01:16:13,046 --> 01:16:19,770
Something that no one's talked about here at all is the issue of grave appointments, which is the status of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

816
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,063
As our community grows in age, this asset of the local hospital grows in importance.

817
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:30,447
Our seniors have become dependent on this facility for care for themselves and their loved ones.

818
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:36,291
When you're having a heart attack or a stroke, that extra 10 to 15 minutes driving the ambulance can be vital.

819
01:16:36,812 --> 01:16:39,354
Or when you have a child that is injured or sick at 2 a.m.

820
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:43,497
in the morning, the importance of having a medical facility minutes away is essential.

821
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:53,012
I have been the only public official that has attended the Department of Public Health hearings and spoke out to keep this facility open and viable to our community.

822
01:16:53,032 --> 01:16:57,514
I'm telling you now, please don't let what happened in Baldwin happen here in Medford.

823
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,715
An effective counselor is one who gets things done.

824
01:16:59,955 --> 01:17:04,498
Richard Caraviello was a counselor who doesn't talk about getting things done, but gets things done.

825
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:13,763
Remember, government is about the people, and a core part of this principle is an attention to basic quality of life issues and responding to requests for basic city services.

826
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:16,208
Your vote makes a difference and your opinion wins.

827
01:17:16,228 --> 01:17:16,808
Thank you.

828
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:19,551
Again, I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes on November 7th, 2017.

829
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:23,414
Ian, I am the number one name on the ballot.

830
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:23,694
Thank you.

831
01:17:24,595 --> 01:17:27,958
Thank you, Counsel Caraviello.

832
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:37,727
And last, but certainly not least, I haven't missed her name before, Cheryl Rodriguez.

833
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:52,913
Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez, and I'm running for a seat on the Medford City Council.

834
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:56,156
Thanks to the Democratic Committee of Ward 6 for hosting us.

835
01:17:57,017 --> 01:18:03,842
When I received the email listing the nearly 30 City Council topics, my first reaction was, wow, that's a lot of stuff.

836
01:18:04,823 --> 01:18:07,705
I think that's what intrigued me about running for City Council.

837
01:18:08,005 --> 01:18:09,386
It's a pretty unique opportunity.

838
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:13,449
You get to wear lots of hats, but it all boils down to quality of life.

839
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,751
I'm a graduate of Medford High School.

840
01:18:15,852 --> 01:18:20,055
I have a daughter who graduated in 2014, and a nine-year-old in the Roberts.

841
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:25,060
My parents also live in Medford, and my husband Alexis Rodriguez is a candidate for school committee.

842
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:29,604
I'm a mom in the community who is heavily involved in the Roberts School PTO.

843
01:18:30,245 --> 01:18:37,932
I'm proud to say that I have committed to creating enrichment nights, running fundraisers, and applying for grants to help our children create memories at school.

844
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:44,077
I'm grateful to the teachers and principal for trusting me and working tirelessly on these inclusive events.

845
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:55,753
And thanks to all the parents who've helped in ways you never thought you would, like lugging a U-Haul's truck worth of yard sale items out of my house, or punching holes in nearly 600 pieces of artwork for our art show.

846
01:18:56,718 --> 01:19:01,241
I love Medford because there are so many great volunteer and service-oriented groups in the city.

847
01:19:01,921 --> 01:19:04,082
I would really like to find a way to link them all.

848
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:08,985
Often I hear, I wish we had a group that was working on X, and oftentimes we do.

849
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:16,170
I've met many amazing groups of people working to make the lives of people in our community better, and I've tried to help whenever I can.

850
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:20,913
Many of the events that we enjoy throughout the city are run by volunteers.

851
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:27,410
My commitment to the city made me want to run for city council to try to help in a different way.

852
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:34,234
I've attended meetings, met with elected officials for years to try and get assistance on various issues and needs around the city.

853
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:37,656
I've stood with Locust Street of Butters to stop overdevelopment.

854
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:41,218
I've collected signatures outside Stop and Shop for charter review.

855
01:19:41,678 --> 01:19:50,523
I've advocated for airplane noise relief, fought for small class sizes, and to this day, I still continue to go to zoning board meetings and stand with residents.

856
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:59,826
I want to be that person that you feel comfortable reaching out to, the one who will not only listen to your issue, but will dig in to find the best solution.

857
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:05,914
I would also like to help push for a portion of our budget to be set aside for future maintenance projects.

858
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:08,438
We all know that roofs don't last forever.

859
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:11,320
It doesn't have to be a scramble every time one springs a leak.

860
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,102
This will speed things up and help manage expectations.

861
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:21,065
Money set aside each year in the budget for streets and roads will allow us to fix more in our limited construction season.

862
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,747
This is just one part of our needed city plan.

863
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:25,608
We hear that Medford is hot.

864
01:20:25,728 --> 01:20:29,250
We need to take control so that the projects being built here enhance our city.

865
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:33,052
Medford needs to be a place where people work, eat, play, and live.

866
01:20:33,812 --> 01:20:39,356
A proper plan will keep us from turning into a bedroom community that creates no places for the people who live here to work.

867
01:20:40,237 --> 01:20:44,199
I see Mystic Ave as our blank space, our next big opportunity.

868
01:20:44,499 --> 01:20:49,103
I know a project with 500 apartments and a tiny amount of commercial is proposed for the center lot.

869
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:51,204
I think placing it there would be a mistake.

870
01:20:51,624 --> 01:20:52,565
We need to think bigger.

871
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,967
We need to stop the small-town thinking.

872
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:58,569
Projects should not be approved because it is better than what is there now.

873
01:20:59,049 --> 01:21:00,871
Yes, most anything is better than nothing.

874
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:02,452
But remember, Medford's hot.

875
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:05,213
Cities that are hot don't just take what is offered.

876
01:21:05,753 --> 01:21:08,053
We ask for what we want and what we need.

877
01:21:08,453 --> 01:21:10,174
That is how you move the city forward.

878
01:21:10,494 --> 01:21:12,114
That's how Medford will come alive.

879
01:21:13,095 --> 01:21:15,435
Mystic Ave could be our premier commercial area.

880
01:21:15,475 --> 01:21:22,317
It could hold lab space, office space, an entertainment complex, a beer garden, a doggie daycare, restaurants, a hotel.

881
01:21:22,337 --> 01:21:23,257
The sky's the limit.

882
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:30,439
If there seems to be a need for some residential, it can be placed at an extreme end of the street to not impact our commercial growth.

883
01:21:31,299 --> 01:21:41,972
Picture a center island with trees on it, bike lanes, beautiful wide sidewalks, a shuttle to the train station, another bringing people to the square to enjoy lunch, dinner, a show at the Chevalier Theater.

884
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:47,099
This is the biggest opportunity in Medford to create this shining new district.

885
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:48,981
All we have to do is ask for it.

886
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:49,982
Don't settle.

887
01:21:50,843 --> 01:21:53,625
While we're at it, we should move to our zoning reform.

888
01:21:54,065 --> 01:22:14,717
In addition to stopping overdevelopment and parcelization that is burdening our neighborhoods, our zoning should be updated so that all new construction housing projects that don't meet the threshold to add affordable units pay into our housing affordability fund to be used in conjunction with CPA money to create affordable housing in Medford.

889
01:22:15,037 --> 01:22:19,320
This is a minor ask and one that other cities don't hesitate to require.

890
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,662
Medford is growing, but like anything, we need to nurture it and guide it.

891
01:22:24,142 --> 01:22:29,145
In a well-planned city, that growth maintains a balance of commercial and residential.

892
01:22:29,506 --> 01:22:35,089
We need to leverage enough new commercial to be able to afford needed infrastructure improvements.

893
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:38,911
I'm excited to dig in and be a part of this pivotal time in Medford.

894
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:41,473
I'm a first-time candidate, long-time advocate for Medford.

895
01:22:41,513 --> 01:22:47,596
Please cast your vote for Cheryl Rodriguez, November 7th, and you have until 1159 tonight online to register to vote.

896
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:48,417
Please do so.

897
01:22:48,517 --> 01:22:48,817
Thank you.

898
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:52,557
Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.

899
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,022
I don't think I'm the only one who observed it.

900
01:23:00,362 --> 01:23:04,085
All 14 candidates had done an excellent job tonight.

901
01:23:04,185 --> 01:23:06,366
I believe they are just... Let's give them a round of applause.

902
01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:08,648
Thank you.

903
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:10,229
Job well done.

904
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:18,815
So before we depart, my co-moderator Henry and I want to thank everyone who assisted us in putting this together.

905
01:23:19,216 --> 01:23:26,219
We especially want to thank Representative Paul Donato and Nancy White, co-chair of the Medford City Democratic Ward Committee, for their continued support.

906
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:28,840
We thank our television crew member, Ralph Shouret.

907
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:33,541
We thank the Medford Transcript, Medford Patch, and every other media that helped us advertise the event.

908
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:38,203
Certainly, we need to thank the members of the Medford

909
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:41,326
Democratic World Six Committee.

910
01:23:41,486 --> 01:23:42,667
They did an excellent job.

911
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:44,909
Without them, we couldn't put this together.

912
01:23:45,449 --> 01:23:48,531
Can you stand up so you can be seen, member of World Six?

913
01:23:48,992 --> 01:23:49,812
Thank you.

914
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:56,817
Stand up.

915
01:23:57,397 --> 01:24:00,139
With that said, I want to remind you, you heard it.

916
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,103
What was recorded tonight will be rebroadcast in a few more days.

917
01:24:05,163 --> 01:24:06,364
I don't know when exactly.

918
01:24:06,904 --> 01:24:08,465
We shall find out by tomorrow.

919
01:24:09,057 --> 01:24:14,120
on channel 22 for Comcast or channel 43 and 47 for Verizon.

920
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:22,305
I don't know the deadline because I know the prior event that we have are still, okay.

921
01:24:22,685 --> 01:24:27,468
I don't know if any of your friends failed to get in touch with City Hall today.

922
01:24:27,768 --> 01:24:34,532
I'm doing that as a citizen because I had friends who were supposed to call in today to register to vote.

923
01:24:34,552 --> 01:24:35,233
They couldn't do it

924
01:24:35,693 --> 01:24:37,876
because there was an issue with the telephone.

925
01:24:38,296 --> 01:24:41,721
I don't know how they deal it, so I don't know where we're standing on that.

926
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:42,482
It's important.

927
01:24:42,822 --> 01:24:47,488
But most certainly, we must remember, vote on November 7th.

928
01:24:48,069 --> 01:24:49,351
Okay, thank you and good night.
