1
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:20,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon, family members, faculty, staff, students, volunteers, esteemed members of the school committee, and Medford Public Schools Administration.

2
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like to welcome you all to the dedication of these memorial gardens to honor the seven lives lost during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:42,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us now take a moment of silence to remember all of these amazing educators that are no longer with us.

4
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa Iannelli.

5
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank D'Alessio.

6
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Sue Bratton.

7
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:14,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Betsy Burns.

8
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis Moriarty.

9
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Anne Glencross.

10
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,345
[SPEAKER_04]: and Kevin Hickey.

11
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I would now like to invite up Paul DeLeva, principal of the Medford High School, to say a few words.

12
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:14,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So first and foremost, I'd like to thank everyone that's here for our dedication today.

13
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:21,878
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of school committee members and everybody that's been really a part of this project.

14
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And this project started off as the beginning of a CCSR project and I want to give credit to

15
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:33,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Rebecca McGinnis as she was a real driving force for this to happen.

16
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,168
[SPEAKER_02]: She did all the research.

17
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:41,213
[SPEAKER_02]: She did everything of meeting with the landscapers and even to the point where, you know, funding was becoming somewhat of a problem.

18
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: She was able to secure that with the CCSR and make this happen, which is nothing short of a miracle of a gorgeous space that is being used here.

19
00:02:51,653 --> 00:03:10,352
[SPEAKER_02]: With the people that we're dedicating, I've been blessed in my life that I've known them in some capacity of being a principal or being a teacher and just watching them as I was growing as an educator and watching them be somewhat as mentors to where we are today.

20
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I always kind of attribute is with this garden is from the book Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.

21
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:26,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody focuses on the beginning where it's the best of times and it's the worst of times.

22
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:34,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always take the last little bit as more of an understanding of what can be gained and what can be lost.

23
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:45,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the book of A Tale of Two Cities, the last thoughts of Sydney Carton, who was representing France at the time, is expressing a rebirth.

24
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:52,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And the things that she had stated is, I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from the abyss.

25
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:56,286
[SPEAKER_02]: and in their struggles to be truly free and their triumphs and their defeats.

26
00:03:56,947 --> 00:04:07,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the long years to come, I see an evil of this time and the precious time which is given natural birth and gradually making expansion of what itself is wearing out.

27
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:14,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous, and happy.

28
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:18,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And that England, which I shall see no more, obviously against England.

29
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:25,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I see I hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence.

30
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:30,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day.

31
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:36,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I see her and her husband, their course done lying by side by side in their lastly earthly bed.

32
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that each one is not more honored or held sacrifice than the other soul.

33
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,445
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, I was in the souls of both.

34
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:53,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a child that lays upon her bosom, who bore my name, a man willing his way, upon a path of life which was once mine.

35
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:58,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I see him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious by the light of his.

36
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:02,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the bolts I threw upon it faded away.

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I see him foremost.

38
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:12,663
[SPEAKER_02]: of those just judges in honors of men, bringing a boy of my name with a forehead that I know golden hair is to be placed.

39
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:22,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fare lock upon with not a tense of this day's disfigurement, and I hear them tell the child my story with a tender and falling voice.

40
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:33,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final, most important thought, it is a far, far better thing that I do than I've ever done before, and it's a far, far better rest that I go than I've ever known.

41
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:41,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I hear these words, I think of the lost staff members that we had during the pandemic, and it really resonates with my soul.

42
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope you share those sentiments.

43
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:49,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, thank you for everyone that has come, as well as been part of this dedication.

44
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:50,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

45
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:03,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd now like to invite up Chad Fallon, the principal of the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

46
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:09,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.

47
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:20,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to our school and thank you for attending this special dedication ceremony in remembrance of our staff and faculty members that have left a lasting impression on our school community.

48
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:26,782
[SPEAKER_06]: This memorial garden was truly a collaborative project and I was able to see the project from idea to conception.

49
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:33,007
[SPEAKER_06]: The dedication of this group of educators, community members, and students is truly a partnership we can be proud of.

50
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:42,599
[SPEAKER_06]: As the proud principal of Career and Technical Education here in Medford, it was no surprise to me to see so many of our students in various programs taking part in the project.

51
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard laughter, idea sharing, and friendly banter about the placement of bushes, lights, and so forth.

52
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I saw was even more remarkable.

53
00:06:53,982 --> 00:07:03,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a community come together to create a space for reflection and remembrance, and I saw the pride in the faces of all who took part as the project was completed.

54
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to all who made this possible.

55
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:16,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, too, even in the hottest days of the summer was Rebecca and Spencer watering this beautiful garden to keep it going when all of our lawns are probably brown.

56
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,883
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that needs to be mentioned, that you guys really did a nice job.

57
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:23,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

58
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the last 13 months, these gardens were created to memorialize and celebrate each of the individuals from the Medford Mustang community who passed over the course of the last two years due to COVID-19 and other serious illnesses.

59
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: These individuals were kind, caring, generous, and committed to the betterment of the students and the entire Medford community.

60
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:10,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the pandemic, we as a Mustang family were unable to process and heal from these great losses in a way that we previously would have.

61
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: We realized how important it was to have a physical space for students, staff, and families to reflect, heal, and connect with those they have lost.

62
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe that through the creation of these gardens, here on the vocational side, and by the high school bus loop, we are addressing the social emotional needs of the faculty, staff, and students.

63
00:08:37,423 --> 00:08:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: This project has hopefully demonstrated to students and staff that they can and do matter to others, and that they do have a lasting impact on the school, those individuals within, as well as the community as a whole.

64
00:08:52,506 --> 00:09:03,029
[SPEAKER_04]: This project began as a small idea, which turned into a large undertaking that proved to be both restorative and powerful, in that it brought together and connected so many people.

65
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:10,571
[SPEAKER_04]: These gardens began as an idea on a Zoom call between Mr. Duleva and Mr. Fallon, who agreed to let us proceed with this project.

66
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:19,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, after many emails, meetings, funding from the mayor's office, and generous personal donations, the project began to take hold.

67
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:29,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We also saw a large outpouring of support from many members across our Mustang community who wanted to help us with this project.

68
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: In hindsight, we were perhaps naive in thinking that this might be a relatively easy and quick project, but after 13 months, we can say with great certainty, we were very wrong.

69
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:57,248
[SPEAKER_04]: without the numerous hours of help, both physical and emotional, from administrators, members of the mayor's staff, and all of the teachers, staff, and students from the construction and craft labor shop, electrical shop, cabinetry, graphics, robotics and engineering,

70
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:12,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Stephanie McCauley, Gina Citrano, Norm Rousseau, John Brown, Carly Perrin, the Special Education Department, the CCSR, Mr. DeLava, Mr. Fallon, and all of the other staff and students who were integral in completing this beautiful project that you see here today.

71
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,506
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this would never have happened.

72
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:42,087
[SPEAKER_04]: What is so special about this garden is that because it is composed of native pollinator species, it will continue to grow each year and give back to the plants and animal species that surround us, reinforcing the spirit of giving, the restorative power of nature, and bring healing to those who come to spend a moment in both of these gardens.

73
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I will now read a poem from an anonymous author that embodies those we lost.

74
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,552
[SPEAKER_04]: One tree can start a forest.

75
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,273
[SPEAKER_04]: One smile can begin a friendship.

76
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,934
[SPEAKER_04]: One hand can lift a soul.

77
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,976
[SPEAKER_04]: One word can frame a goal.

78
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: One candle can wipe out darkness.

79
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,718
[SPEAKER_04]: One laugh can conquer gloom.

80
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,771
[SPEAKER_04]: One hope can raise our spirits.

81
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,052
[SPEAKER_04]: One touch can show you care.

82
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:24,054
[SPEAKER_04]: One life can make a difference.

83
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:26,235
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the ones.

84
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:33,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'd like to invite up Mateo de Vita to read an original poem.

85
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:43,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Skorka.

86
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:46,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really honored and touched to be asked to speak here.

87
00:11:48,285 --> 00:12:01,189
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a poem to read that I wrote about the teachers at Medford High that have helped shape me, and I feel I owe so much to the members of this community who are gonna be commemorated today, and I'm really grateful to be a part.

88
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:03,570
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Overpass Sunbeams.

89
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,611
[SPEAKER_13]: The epigraph is Voltaire.

90
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:07,991
[SPEAKER_13]: We must cultivate our gardens.

91
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,567
[SPEAKER_13]: The third floor overpass exposes our best ignored asset.

92
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:23,014
[SPEAKER_13]: On bright days, light spills in through the ceiling high windows onto the floor of the walkway, onto its cracked and sliding tiles, illuminating the ground.

93
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Some days the sunbeams point my way to class.

94
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Other days they draw my eyes outside to the fells.

95
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:32,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we are carved from an unruly brush.

96
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:39,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Something wild seeps into our classrooms, sits at our desks, sharpens its pencils, and in those desks it blossoms.

97
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:45,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Every day our community plants flowers in padded down paths to sow anew over where we want to grow higher.

98
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:52,396
[SPEAKER_13]: My teachers keep gardens, tending, grooming, raising the buds until they learn to reach for the sun themselves.

99
00:12:53,777 --> 00:13:00,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Every day, an army of overpass sunbeams orients me and guides me through jungles, concrete and verdant, shining their sunlight to make me grow.

100
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Who has crossed these tiles?

101
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:09,369
[SPEAKER_13]: The people seen and unseen, dedicating days to this place, these aims, until they are gone and leave but a blossom.

102
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:16,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Our school sits hidden between trees and trails, and yet, from its homegrown summits, its tallest trunks can see the city.

103
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:18,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

104
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:29,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Mateo.

105
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now going to hear from people who would like to speak on behalf of each of these people we have lost.

106
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:45,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We're first going to hear from John Brown and Andre Fatour, who will speak about Dennis Moriarty.

107
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:56,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper, rock, scissors?

108
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper, rock, scissors?

109
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon, everyone.

110
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:19,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a voicemail saved on my cell phone from the evening of March 19th, 2019.

111
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from Dennis Moriarty.

112
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very excited when he left the message.

113
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And the message he's reminding me of the next day was the annual breakfast at the high school sponsored by the PTO.

114
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:36,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wanted me to remember to bring Tupperware so we could sneak out leftovers for lunch.

115
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:44,292
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm grateful to have this message, to hear Dennis' voice, and to remember how much he used to make me laugh.

116
00:14:45,153 --> 00:14:50,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm grateful that I can still listen to this message and he can still make me laugh.

117
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis loved life and loved to be around people.

118
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: and he enjoyed sharing experiences with his friends.

119
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I became close to Dennis through our love for fishing and went on dozens of deep sea fishing trips with him.

120
00:15:05,648 --> 00:15:11,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Henry David Thoreau once wrote that many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not the fish they are after.

121
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure Dennis never read any Thoreau.

122
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:19,364
[SPEAKER_05]: But if ever a person were to epitomize this expression, it would be Dennis.

123
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis spoke to total strangers like they were old friends and would offer words of encouragement to anyone around him on the boat.

124
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,777
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone were hungry, Dennis would offer to share his food with them.

125
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: By the end of the trip, most people would know Dennis by name.

126
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dennis was a sight to behold on the ocean.

127
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:49,822
[SPEAKER_05]: He may have been one of the oldest and saltiest gentlemen on the boat, but he would tirelessly and relentlessly pull fish up from depths of over 200 feet and gracefully get them over the rail.

128
00:15:50,902 --> 00:15:57,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I could never keep up with him, and he liked to remind me throughout the day while grinning from ear to ear that I wasn't keeping up with him.

129
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:05,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a few times I found myself with Dennis in the middle of the Atlantic with the boat rolling through swells in excess of five feet.

130
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:11,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dennis would be bouncing around the boat nonstop like a pinball, banging into anything and everything.

131
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:21,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the middle of all of this, he would find a way to stabilize himself and look at me and selflessly ask, John, are you all right?

132
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's who Dennis was.

133
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis always caught fish, even when the rest of the boat wasn't.

134
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: He was especially proud of his largest fish of the trip sticker that he earned on the Bunny Clark in Maine.

135
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:45,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had this sticker prominently displayed in the kitchen of the old Cafe Electra and always tried to find a way to unabashedly work the sticker into a conversation so that he could brag about his achievement.

136
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was never hard to tell when Dennis had a successful day in the water, as the culinary students would be as busy as the Keebler elves that week, making Dennis' famous fish cakes to be sold in the bistro.

137
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dennis would be glowing in his glory and full of pride, leading them through the lesson.

138
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:10,528
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were fortunate enough to do something with Dennis, it would be smiles and laughter, a lot of it.

139
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:29,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it was fishing, riding motorcycles, hunting, going out for dinner, or traveling to Cuba where Dennis was fortunate enough to spend time in a Cuban hospital, or just spending some time having a cup of coffee in the bistro, Dennis always made each event special and memorable.

140
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:37,113
[SPEAKER_05]: While his loss has been overwhelming, the memories of laughter and camaraderie and the voicemail will last a lifetime.

141
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there really words to describe the irreplaceable Dennis Moriarty?

142
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but some might need to be censored.

143
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis was a person with strong convictions and strong sarcasm.

144
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:13,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Fierce defender of his craft and his friends, he took the utmost pride in his work in the culinary arts.

145
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,765
[SPEAKER_03]: He really made service an art form.

146
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Never was it more evident than when you watch the students he trained, especially for the front of the house.

147
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:30,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Their level of professionalism and precision in service could only stem from the high standards that Dennis set.

148
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:38,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis was so good at his craft that he could anticipate your needs before you did, always two steps ahead.

149
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,510
[SPEAKER_03]: He was also a charmer.

150
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,172
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved to socialize with people and charm them with his witty smile.

151
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis always remained young at heart.

152
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved to have a good time and he loved to travel.

153
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I am forever grateful that we got to go to Cuba on that group trip.

154
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:01,383
[SPEAKER_03]: He certainly was a big reason why that trip was one of the best times of my life.

155
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not talk about the hospital incident.

156
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:08,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Though he never could quite get his Spanish down.

157
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, the one thing that I think most people remember with fondness is his friendship.

158
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:21,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a good listener, spending time with him was knowing you were with someone who always had your back.

159
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: There will forever be an empty spot behind the culinary counter and in my heart that can never be filled.

160
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:30,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

161
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:47,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, John.

162
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:48,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Audrey.

163
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:55,557
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now going to hear from Carly Perrin, who will speak about Lisa Iannelli.

164
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:09,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm honored to speak about my friend Lisa Ionelli.

165
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:19,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I will always picture Lisa poised in her impossibly high heels and impeccably tailored suits, usually in a deep shade of purple.

166
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,067
[SPEAKER_08]: But Lisa was so much more than just stylish.

167
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:29,833
[SPEAKER_08]: She took me under her wing when I was a new teacher, and she was an invaluable mentor to me, both personally and professionally.

168
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:35,397
[SPEAKER_08]: She made sure I took the right classes and had a welcoming place to eat lunch every day.

169
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:40,882
[SPEAKER_08]: She doted on my daughter as she did on her son, Johnny, and we enjoyed spending time together.

170
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:44,725
[SPEAKER_08]: She loved the warm weather and taking her beloved dog, Jack, for walks.

171
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:49,689
[SPEAKER_08]: She worked hard to get her administrative license and took pride in doing her job well.

172
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:58,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa was a loyal and caring friend who was a strong shoulder to lean on for many, many colleagues throughout her career working in the Medford Public Schools.

173
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:04,721
[SPEAKER_08]: We shared countless laughs over our 20-year friendship, and a few tears, too.

174
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:12,708
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a trusted and beloved teacher who could be tough on her students, but those high expectations were always born out of love.

175
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:19,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Her door was never closed and she was quick with a smile and a piece of candy when he really needed a pick-me-up.

176
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:25,515
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a loving mother, sister, and daughter who was fiercely proud of her family.

177
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:31,979
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a strong woman who bravely faced her health challenges with grace and without ever complaining.

178
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:45,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa meant a great deal to many people, and I'm thrilled that this memorial garden will be a place where her spirit can be embodied and remembered in the flowers that bloom here in front of this school, where she helped so many young minds grow.

179
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

180
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:55,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Carly.

181
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:03,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We are now going to hear from Maria Dorsey and Max Heinig, who will speak about Frank D'Alessio.

182
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon, everyone.

183
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:31,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Knowing Frank D'Alessio was an honor, which I always knew, but never more clearly than I know it now, after living all this time without his presence in my life.

184
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank was a gentleman, loving, loyal, and honest.

185
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:48,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank was helpful and would do whatever he could to assist, whether it was a technology issue or a personal problem, and he was highly intelligent, with a recall of facts and information that was astounding.

186
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:55,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank loved his God above all else, and anyone who spent more than a few minutes with him knew this.

187
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,444
[SPEAKER_09]: He had a spiritual connection with his maker that made some uncomfortable, including leaders in his church.

188
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:10,308
[SPEAKER_09]: But Frank was steadfast in what he knew in his heart and believed with every fiber of his being that he was inspired by God.

189
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:15,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I call a person like him an apostle, the only one I ever knew.

190
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:23,246
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time Frank ever got frustrated was when any detail of his retirement plan went awry.

191
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:27,527
[SPEAKER_09]: He was single-minded in making sure all his ducks were in a row.

192
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:35,170
[SPEAKER_09]: How he looked forward to retirement with his family, his grandchildren, and times at his happy place, Disney World.

193
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,250
[SPEAKER_09]: How he adored them all.

194
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I could cry to think it will never happen.

195
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:58,460
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know Frank loved Disney, but he also loved bowling, and choosing the right bowling ball from his collection, creating Christmas villages, talking about the merits of a Subaru versus a Hyundai, and his vacation to the White Mountains were great conversation for Frank.

196
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,843
[SPEAKER_09]: He was sad when he made the decision not to return to New Hampshire the year before he left us after so many happy summers there.

197
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps if he had booked it one more time,

198
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:19,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent a lot of time with Frank and he helped me through some personal problems and life events, even though my faith differed from his.

199
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:30,121
[SPEAKER_09]: He prayed over me, over my daughter as she struggled, over her newborn, and he prayed over my sister both before and after she passed.

200
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:31,482
[SPEAKER_09]: He brought me peace.

201
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:35,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no doubt that Frank is also at peace.

202
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:42,308
[SPEAKER_09]: When he went into the hospital, he told me that this was God's will, whatever happened, and he was unafraid.

203
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: What a comfort that must have been to him.

204
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a comfort to me that his faith was that strong.

205
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:55,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank was a wonderful, supportive, and dear friend and co-worker, and I will miss him always.

206
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:11,029
[SPEAKER_14]: After Frank passed, I decided to write an elegy for him because I had shared so many great moments when he came to help me.

207
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:17,577
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is an elegy for Frank D'Alessio, a computer technician at Medford High School.

208
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes the light of my desktop would not come on.

209
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:25,933
[SPEAKER_14]: The fan would spin, just pushing dead air.

210
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:27,876
[SPEAKER_14]: The classics waited.

211
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:32,001
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd come, and if there was life inside, you brought it back.

212
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:35,426
[SPEAKER_14]: When it was doomed, you brought fresh tools.

213
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:42,809
[SPEAKER_14]: In the side of the library, you worked happily for years, skillful fingertips rough from soldering.

214
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,695
[SPEAKER_14]: A mechanical room in triage, each patient you would see too soon.

215
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:54,060
[SPEAKER_14]: When I panicked, you'd hustle up the stairs and stayed after school.

216
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:56,262
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't need thanks.

217
00:25:57,642 --> 00:26:06,672
[SPEAKER_14]: You smiled through 14 years of work many of us lamented, dreaming out of small windows at trees that never saw full sun.

218
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:15,682
[SPEAKER_14]: When last I saw you, masked, when the district chose to open doors, you set me up again and I could teach.

219
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:26,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Now mornings begin as the small light returns and the whiteboard shines words, black and clear as wisdom made fresh by attention.

220
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:31,766
[SPEAKER_14]: How many learned by the light you made come on for all of us?

221
00:26:44,454 --> 00:26:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Maria.

222
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:45,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Max.

223
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:53,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now going to hear from Michelle Hardy and family, who will speak about Annie Glencross.

224
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, bear with me.

225
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:19,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very fortunate to have had Annie Glencross in my life as a co-worker and a family member.

226
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:24,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Annie was my aunt, my godmother, like my second mother.

227
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:29,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Annie began working for the school department in 1970.

228
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:35,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Always willing to help others, she suggested I take my civil service test after graduation.

229
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Her office in food service was looking to hire another secretary,

230
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:42,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And how great would that be to work with someone I already loved?

231
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:46,806
[SPEAKER_07]: 35 years later, here I am working for the city.

232
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:52,414
[SPEAKER_07]: After many years working in food service, Annie transferred to the vocational office.

233
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:56,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Here she made many friends who quickly became her second family.

234
00:27:57,867 --> 00:28:01,828
[SPEAKER_07]: During our family gatherings, Annie would often speak of her work family.

235
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:06,489
[SPEAKER_07]: She was happy to share with us their accomplishments, milestones, and many pictures.

236
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:11,070
[SPEAKER_07]: We felt we knew each individual personally just from Annie's stories.

237
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,211
[SPEAKER_07]: The staff and students knew Annie was there for them no matter what.

238
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:18,012
[SPEAKER_07]: She welcomed all with her beautiful smile.

239
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:25,374
[SPEAKER_07]: She offered a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, many hugs, and most of all, access to her snack cabinet.

240
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:30,288
[SPEAKER_07]: The day of her funeral proved to us how special she was to all.

241
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:45,818
[SPEAKER_07]: As the procession drove past the high school, Winthrop Street was lined with staff, current and former students, and friends clapping and waving, as was the entrance to the cemetery with fellow administrative assistants whom she worked with for several years.

242
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:52,547
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as her family, her work family, was special to her, her family was her whole life.

243
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:59,032
[SPEAKER_07]: She enjoyed the time spent with her two daughters, Charlene and Paula, and loved having them close by.

244
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:05,336
[SPEAKER_07]: She was so proud watching her four grandsons grow up to be the amazing men they are today.

245
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:11,680
[SPEAKER_07]: She loved their wives as granddaughters, and her great-grandchildren made her life complete.

246
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,632
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate you keeping Annie's memory alive with this beautiful memorial.

247
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:22,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And how fitting is it that the garden is right outside of her window that she looked out for for so many years?

248
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:23,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

249
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:32,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Michelle.

250
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to welcome back Carly Perrin, who will speak about Betsy Burns.

251
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:49,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, Joan Bowen couldn't be here today.

252
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:50,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading her words.

253
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,501
[SPEAKER_08]: This is her tribute to Betsy Burns.

254
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:57,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Betsy was a dedicated and compassionate special educator.

255
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,747
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a true advocate for her students and was very passionate about teaching math.

256
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:07,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Betsy was always checking in with her colleagues and was a mentor for new special education teachers.

257
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:16,496
[SPEAKER_08]: She developed and maintained close relationships and was always found eating lunch in the learning group classroom and holding animated debates with Jack Pastor.

258
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:23,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Betsy loved to travel and one of her favorite places to visit was the most magical place on earth, Disney.

259
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:28,551
[SPEAKER_08]: She absolutely loved going to Disney and was a huge fan of all things Disney.

260
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Betsy loved planning her many expeditions to Disney and traveling with her nieces.

261
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,276
[SPEAKER_08]: We all loved and looked forward to hearing about her adventures.

262
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Strong, caring, and kind are just a few ways to describe Betsy.

263
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:49,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Several years ago at the beginning of a new school year, Betsy unexpectedly lost her husband and also received devastating news that she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

264
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:52,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Betsy fought through these difficulties.

265
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:55,666
[SPEAKER_08]: She attended school as much as she could during her treatment.

266
00:30:56,247 --> 00:31:01,370
[SPEAKER_08]: She never complained and never felt sorry for herself, nor would she let anyone else.

267
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:11,979
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my last memories of Betsy was when she stopped by my office one day to contribute her donation for a colleague who was sick.

268
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,681
[SPEAKER_08]: She had just come from receiving a chemo treatment and was more concerned about the staff person and what they needed.

269
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:30,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a breast cancer survivor myself, I can't tell you how much Betsy helped me personally going through my journey as well and never complained about what was going on with her and was always just so caring with me.

270
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:40,174
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, this is the epitome of Betsy, always thinking of others and helping out whenever possible despite how she was feeling or what was going on with her.

271
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:45,197
[SPEAKER_08]: We all miss her spirit and kindness as we walk by her old classroom, A201.

272
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:50,460
[SPEAKER_08]: The halls of MHS will never be the same, but we're glad we have this garden here to remember her.

273
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:51,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

274
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, Carly, and thank you for those words, Joan.

275
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:07,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to now invite Krista Murphy to say a few words about Sue Bratton.

276
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I should start by saying that a few paragraphs does not sum up Sue Bratton.

277
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,020
[SPEAKER_10]: The picture in the program is literally a snapshot of who she was.

278
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:27,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Sue Bratton, or the British, as a lot of the kids called her, was truly one of a kind.

279
00:32:29,219 --> 00:32:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: She worked as a dedicated parent professional, union treasurer, and value colleague at Medford Public Schools for 26 years from 1995 to 2001.

280
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:48,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Sue worked with countless children with a wide variety of special needs and had a special place in her heart for all the students, even the toughest kids to love.

281
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:52,993
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a tenacious and relentless advocate for her students.

282
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,636
[SPEAKER_10]: She would fight tooth and nail to make sure that all kids got what they needed to be successful.

283
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,623
[SPEAKER_10]: As a colleague she never missed recognizing a birthday anniversary or special life event.

284
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:08,926
[SPEAKER_10]: We will miss her quick wit invaluable advice and her great laugh.

285
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:14,810
[SPEAKER_10]: She really had a way of making everyone she interacted with feel seen and appreciated.

286
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:24,335
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I speak for a lot of people at the high school when I say we miss her every day and we are so happy to have this beautiful play area at our school to remember her by.

287
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

288
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:35,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Christa.

289
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'd like to invite up Alice Beth Fitzpatrick to say a few words about Kevin Hickey.

290
00:33:52,024 --> 00:33:59,188
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I don't think my few words can nearly touch the feeling and sentiment that many of you have about Kevin.

291
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:02,469
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today.

292
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So my office is right there.

293
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I have watched this garden go from conception to dedication.

294
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:17,299
[SPEAKER_11]: As I have watched, I've processed some of my own feelings of grief and loss that we've all endured over these past few years.

295
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Grief is challenging, and we all manage it differently.

296
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Having a network of support people is one thing that can help us through our grief.

297
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:37,242
[SPEAKER_11]: This network or family connection is embedded in the culture of the vocational school and is something that I credit our former educators for fostering.

298
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:44,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin Hickey, a former guidance counselor at MBTHS, helped to show me the importance of the Volk family.

299
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:55,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Though he had retired, he called me at the start of every school year for many years just to check in and see if there was anything I needed to support our students.

300
00:34:56,028 --> 00:35:00,631
[SPEAKER_11]: In the spring, he would stop by and ensure the students were able to attend the senior banquet.

301
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:08,577
[SPEAKER_11]: He embodied the Volk family spirit, and his connection and positive impact on students was enduring.

302
00:35:10,378 --> 00:35:25,048
[SPEAKER_11]: As I have observed the growth of this garden, I feel like Kevin would most value and be most honored by the efforts of the greater Volk family, a family that extends beyond CTE students and staff and includes our family,

303
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:30,752
[SPEAKER_11]: friends, fellow students, and educators who have helped to cultivate and support this project.

304
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:40,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for being here and for the work that you've done to honor those who we love and help us continue to grow this family connection throughout our school community.

305
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alice Beth.

306
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:54,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd now like to invite up the superintendent of Medford Public Schools to say a few words.

307
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon to everyone.

308
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:23,900
[SPEAKER_00]: On this celebration of life and the marking of this special memorial garden, I am here to say that I too have been moved by all of the words that were shared this day by the members of our staff.

309
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:27,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we have

310
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:34,319
[SPEAKER_00]: this memorial garden that is here in this wonderful plaque, which lists everyone's names.

311
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:52,146
[SPEAKER_00]: As I look at this garden and I see the beautiful flowers, the flowers will continue to give life, bring life, bring joy, bring peace, bring happiness, bring healing to everyone.

312
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:55,907
[SPEAKER_00]: The pandemic really gave us a curve ball.

313
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:59,389
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all healing in different ways.

314
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:09,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And although we are moving to the other side of it right now, we still have the scars of what happened during that time.

315
00:37:11,582 --> 00:37:18,910
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the family members that are here, I extend my sincere condolences to all of you.

316
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:23,385
[SPEAKER_00]: for your loved ones that are no longer here.

317
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:34,714
[SPEAKER_00]: But please know that as you look at this beautiful garden, we are honoring your loved ones and we are celebrating their life.

318
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:41,739
[SPEAKER_00]: We are celebrating their spirits and their contributions that they made to the Medford Public Schools.

319
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanna say thank you to all of you who came today to celebrate.

320
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:55,166
[SPEAKER_00]: the life of your loved ones, and to let you know that we here in Medford Public Schools will always remember and honor them.

321
00:37:56,266 --> 00:38:03,488
[SPEAKER_00]: May their souls rest in peace, and may we all continue to receive joy, peace, and happiness from this garden.

322
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:04,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

323
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd now like to invite up the director of the CCSR, Rich Trotta, to say a few words.

324
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:30,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say that this event is quite an honor for all these people.

325
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:38,926
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the tenets of the CCSR is making the world a better place, and these people did that.

326
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:44,731
[SPEAKER_12]: The world is a better place because they were here, and so with that in mind,

327
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:52,693
[SPEAKER_12]: We're committing to support this memorial garden for as long as the CCDR exists.

328
00:38:53,813 --> 00:39:01,155
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be part of our annual cost and support will definitely be there to take care of it and to make sure that it doesn't go away.

329
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:06,057
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all seen too many things go away, but this is not going away as long as we're here.

330
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Michael and Rebecca for putting this together.

331
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,237
[SPEAKER_12]: They did a fantastic job and we are all thankful for what you've done.

332
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:30,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank Chad and the vocational school staff for doing this fine work, the school committee and the superintendent and central office.

333
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:44,161
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that is clear to me after doing the CCR so long is that it really takes a village to make things happen and this is a perfect example of that and I'm so proud that we're a part of it and always will be.

334
00:39:46,788 --> 00:39:52,210
[SPEAKER_12]: One last thing I have to do, and I apologize for this, I have to shout out to Michael Skorka.

335
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,011
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael's final activity is this activity.

336
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:59,491
[SPEAKER_12]: He's now moving on to be a full-time teacher.

337
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:07,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure you realize that the CCSR has been a great success, and Michael has been a great part of that.

338
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:12,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And somebody asked me, well, who's gonna replace Michael Skorka?

339
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:14,255
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, no one, no one can.

340
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:25,624
[SPEAKER_12]: And Michael, you know, there's a saying in education, a teacher doesn't know where he or she, her influence will end.

341
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:28,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And Michael, your influence will never end.

342
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:36,253
[SPEAKER_12]: You've made such a big impact on all the students in the community that for generations your power will be felt.

343
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,935
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you, Michael, and I'd like to give Michael a round of applause.

344
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:47,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, and congratulations to everyone involved.

345
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:47,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

346
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:55,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Rich.

347
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I would now like to invite up the mayor of Medford to say a few words.

348
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:07,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be brief.

349
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:09,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.

350
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:14,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I know member Hayes from the school committee and former school committee, Paulette Van de Kloet is also here.

351
00:41:14,926 --> 00:41:15,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here.

352
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:22,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to send my condolences to the family and staff members, friends of those that we've lost.

353
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:33,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Skorka called me about a year ago about this project, and I wanted to make sure we did whatever we could to help support and find the funding for it.

354
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so glad we did.

355
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody who was a part of it.

356
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:37,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing.

357
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:40,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I expected it to be half the size.

358
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:41,654
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely gorgeous.

359
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, everybody.

360
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:45,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

361
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:52,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that this will bring peace to students and staff, whether you knew the seven amazing people that we lost or not.

362
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope the families come back and visit.

363
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also brings you peace.

364
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:57,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

365
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:05,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

366
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:07,758
[SPEAKER_04]: For the closing remarks,

367
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:13,358
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks we are memorializing today will continue to flourish through these gardens.

368
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to have created a safe, inclusive space where faculty, staff, students, and families can come and spend time to connect with nature and remember these amazing humans that once filled these halls with love, compassion, and generosity of self and spirit.

369
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:40,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We can all recognize the struggles that come with loss and moving through the grieving process.

370
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:51,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe these gardens will be a space for individuals and family members to heal, remember, and celebrate the humanity of those we lost.

371
00:42:52,591 --> 00:43:01,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for joining us today, and we hope to see you here spending time enjoying these gardens so that you may heal and find peace.

372
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:10,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you leave, please drive by the high school side drop-off loop and see the other half of the gardens.

373
00:43:10,983 --> 00:43:11,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
