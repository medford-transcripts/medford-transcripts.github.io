    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=10.458s">Good</a>  afternoon, family members, faculty, staff, students, volunteers, esteemed members of the school committee, and Medford Public Schools Administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=21.464s">We</a>  would like to welcome you all to the dedication of these memorial gardens to honor the seven lives lost during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=33.322s">Let</a>  us now take a moment of silence to remember all of these amazing educators that are no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=47.614s">Lisa</a>  Iannelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=57.063s">Frank</a>  D'Alessio. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=65.049s">Sue</a>  Bratton. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=73.076s">Betsy</a>  Burns. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=81.082s">Dennis</a>  Moriarty. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=88.909s">Anne</a>  Glencross. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=95.945s">and</a>  Kevin Hickey. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=115.35s">I</a>  would now like to invite up Paul DeLeva, principal of the Medford High School, to say a few words.</p>

    <p>[D'Alleva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=130.006s">So</a>  first and foremost, I'd like to thank everyone that's here for our dedication today. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=135.411s">We</a>  have a lot of school committee members and everybody that's been really a part of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=141.918s">And</a>  this project started off as the beginning of a CCSR project and I want to give credit to <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=148.724s">Miss</a>  Rebecca McGinnis as she was a real driving force for this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=153.107s">She</a>  did all the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=154.989s">She</a>  did everything of meeting with the landscapers and even to the point where, you know, funding was becoming somewhat of a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=161.253s">She</a>  was able to secure that with the CCSR and make this happen, which is nothing short of a miracle of a gorgeous space that is being used here. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=171.653s">With</a>  the people that we're dedicating, I've been blessed in my life that I've known them in some capacity of being a principal or being a teacher and just watching them as I was growing as an educator and watching them be somewhat as mentors to where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=191.966s">One</a>  thing that I always kind of attribute is with this garden is from the book Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=201.196s">I</a>  think everybody focuses on the beginning where it's the best of times and it's the worst of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=206.321s">But</a>  I always take the last little bit as more of an understanding of what can be gained and what can be lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=215.959s">So</a>  in the book of A Tale of Two Cities, the last thoughts of Sydney Carton, who was representing France at the time, is expressing a rebirth. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=225.362s">And</a>  the things that she had stated is, I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from the abyss. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=232.944s">and</a>  in their struggles to be truly free and their triumphs and their defeats. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=236.947s">Through</a>  the long years to come, I see an evil of this time and the precious time which is given natural birth and gradually making expansion of what itself is wearing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=249.134s">I</a>  see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous, and happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=255.398s">And</a>  that England, which I shall see no more, obviously against England. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=260.569s">I</a>  see I hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=266.954s">I</a>  see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=271.216s">I</a>  see her and her husband, their course done lying by side by side in their lastly earthly bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=276.94s">And</a>  I know that each one is not more honored or held sacrifice than the other soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=282.484s">That</a>  is, I was in the souls of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=285.666s">I</a>  see a child that lays upon her bosom, who bore my name, a man willing his way, upon a path of life which was once mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=294.293s">I</a>  see him winning it so well that my name is made illustrious by the light of his. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=299.977s">I</a>  see the bolts I threw upon it faded away. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=303.08s">I</a>  see him foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=304.981s">of</a>  those just judges in honors of men, bringing a boy of my name with a forehead that I know golden hair is to be placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=313.743s">Then</a>  fare lock upon with not a tense of this day's disfigurement, and I hear them tell the child my story with a tender and falling voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=323.206s">And</a>  then the final, most important thought, it is a far, far better thing that I do than I've ever done before, and it's a far, far better rest that I go than I've ever known. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=334.403s">And</a>  when I hear these words, I think of the lost staff members that we had during the pandemic, and it really resonates with my soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=341.687s">So</a>  I hope you share those sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=343.768s">And</a>  again, thank you for everyone that has come, as well as been part of this dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=349.931s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=359.376s">I'd</a>  now like to invite up Chad Fallon, the principal of the Medford Vocational Technical High School.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=369.329s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=371.13s">Welcome</a>  to our school and thank you for attending this special dedication ceremony in remembrance of our staff and faculty members that have left a lasting impression on our school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=381.438s">This</a>  memorial garden was truly a collaborative project and I was able to see the project from idea to conception. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=387.863s">The</a>  dedication of this group of educators, community members, and students is truly a partnership we can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=394.392s">As</a>  the proud principal of Career and Technical Education here in Medford, it was no surprise to me to see so many of our students in various programs taking part in the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=403.599s">I</a>  heard laughter, idea sharing, and friendly banter about the placement of bushes, lights, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=410.945s">But</a>  what I saw was even more remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=413.982s">I</a>  saw a community come together to create a space for reflection and remembrance, and I saw the pride in the faces of all who took part as the project was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=423.95s">Thank</a>  you to all who made this possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=426.732s">I</a>  will say, too, even in the hottest days of the summer was Rebecca and Spencer watering this beautiful garden to keep it going when all of our lawns are probably brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=437.44s">So</a>  I think that needs to be mentioned, that you guys really did a nice job. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=442.865s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=453.772s">Over</a>  the last 13 months, these gardens were created to memorialize and celebrate each of the individuals from the Medford Mustang community who passed over the course of the last two years due to COVID-19 and other serious illnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=470.267s">These</a>  individuals were kind, caring, generous, and committed to the betterment of the students and the entire Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=480.936s">Because</a>  of the pandemic, we as a Mustang family were unable to process and heal from these great losses in a way that we previously would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=491.823s">We</a>  realized how important it was to have a physical space for students, staff, and families to reflect, heal, and connect with those they have lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=504.113s">We</a>  believe that through the creation of these gardens, here on the vocational side, and by the high school bus loop, we are addressing the social emotional needs of the faculty, staff, and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=517.423s">This</a>  project has hopefully demonstrated to students and staff that they can and do matter to others, and that they do have a lasting impact on the school, those individuals within, as well as the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=532.506s">This</a>  project began as a small idea, which turned into a large undertaking that proved to be both restorative and powerful, in that it brought together and connected so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=544.109s">These</a>  gardens began as an idea on a Zoom call between Mr. Duleva and Mr. Fallon, who agreed to let us proceed with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=551.232s">Then,</a>  after many emails, meetings, funding from the mayor's office, and generous personal donations, the project began to take hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=560.834s">We</a>  also saw a large outpouring of support from many members across our Mustang community who wanted to help us with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=570.581s">In</a>  hindsight, we were perhaps naive in thinking that this might be a relatively easy and quick project, but after 13 months, we can say with great certainty, we were very wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=581.314s">without</a>  the numerous hours of help, both physical and emotional, from administrators, members of the mayor's staff, and all of the teachers, staff, and students from the construction and craft labor shop, electrical shop, cabinetry, graphics, robotics and engineering, <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=597.728s">Stephanie</a>  McCauley, Gina Citrano, Norm Rousseau, John Brown, Carly Perrin, the Special Education Department, the CCSR, Mr. DeLava, Mr. Fallon, and all of the other staff and students who were integral in completing this beautiful project that you see here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=613.344s">None</a>  of this would never have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=617.711s">What</a>  is so special about this garden is that because it is composed of native pollinator species, it will continue to grow each year and give back to the plants and animal species that surround us, reinforcing the spirit of giving, the restorative power of nature, and bring healing to those who come to spend a moment in both of these gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=643.789s">I</a>  will now read a poem from an anonymous author that embodies those we lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=651.811s">One</a>  tree can start a forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=655.353s">One</a>  smile can begin a friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=659.114s">One</a>  hand can lift a soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=663.335s">One</a>  word can frame a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=666.856s">One</a>  candle can wipe out darkness. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=670.737s">One</a>  laugh can conquer gloom. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=674.83s">One</a>  hope can raise our spirits. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=678.552s">One</a>  touch can show you care. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=682.693s">One</a>  life can make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=685.555s">They</a>  were the ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/neZnxmu43Ko&t=689.216s">And</a>  now I'd like to invite up Mateo de Vita to read an original poem.</p>
