1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:04,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a question without writing?

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:05,107
[SPEAKER_04]: My hand is broken.

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

4
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:07,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

5
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:26,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't show you anything.

6
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:49,381
it's

7
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, everybody, let's get started.

8
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again for being here.

9
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:07,539
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jessica.

10
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:11,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a third-generation Medford resident, and I come from a long line of teachers.

11
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm one of the many wonderful volunteers on the Invest in Medford campaign.

12
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:20,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited to be here with you all tonight in this beautiful, gorgeous Medford Public Library.

13
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:29,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And the point of this event is to be a guided conversation with our elected officials who are spearheading these and other question initiatives.

14
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for spending one day with us.

15
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:38,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And before we get into everything, I just want to let you all know how the format of this is going to go.

16
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:40,675
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit different.

17
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:42,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit interesting.

18
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole point of this is to be engaging with that community center.

19
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,020
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have some questions, we're not posting those.

20
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be saving those for the end.

21
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,962
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of how this is going to function,

22
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,552
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the questions will be answered.

23
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:02,835
[SPEAKER_07]: They have two minutes to respond just to keep things moving because we do have a hard stop at 8.30 out of respect for our library staff.

24
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So time questions will be limited.

25
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:09,059
[SPEAKER_07]: All questions that we are taking today are over there.

26
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:14,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So that will happen at the end of our informational section of the panel.

27
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:22,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to make sure that we stay on time and don't keep everybody here too late, we're not going to be doing a long line for questions.

28
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,287
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to be taking them

29
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:38,828
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, this will be recorded and will be posted online, so if there's someone out there that wasn't able to attend this evening, that is looking for more information, that will be made available.

30
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,830
[SPEAKER_07]: In the back of the room, we have some resources.

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So please feel free to take them, give them a read, take them home with you, give them to a friend.

32
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,353
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that is available to you.

33
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:51,595
[SPEAKER_07]: And myself, as well as many people in here, are volunteers for the campaign.

34
00:02:51,615 --> 00:03:04,200
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any questions, I'm really excited because the volunteer energy that we have for parents and teachers and homeowners and renters really coming together and making this campaign what it is, I'm very excited to be here with you tonight.

35
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So, without further ado,

36
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,198
[SPEAKER_07]: to introduce our panelists.

37
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:16,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have Mary Graham on the left side this evening, City Councilor Anna Callahan and City Vice Chair Ben Grant.

38
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:28,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm honored to be sitting here next to the three of you, so thank you so much for what you do and what you're able to do this evening.

39
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So to start off this evening, I'd like to pass over to Mary Graham.

40
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you all hear me?

41
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi everyone, my name is Jenny Graham.

42
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:54,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I know many or most of you from five years as a school committee member, most recently I've been vice chair.

43
00:03:54,137 --> 00:04:02,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also the chair of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee for the Princeton household, commonly referred to as FSEA.

44
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:08,663
[SPEAKER_09]: FSEA is a statewide authority that helps communities like ours build new high schools.

45
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:18,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not here to talk about anything for high school, but I do want to mention that that is another hat that I wear, so if you have questions about that, I'm happy to answer them after that.

46
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:25,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited that we're here because I'm excited that we all get to participate in this vote.

47
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:33,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the first time in Medgar we've ever let everybody have a choice and a voice in how our students forward.

48
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,900
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have some really big questions on the ballot this year.

49
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,441
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, we should have done this sooner.

50
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We can debate the merits of that.

51
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, at another time, maybe over coffee or a cocktail.

52
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:48,604
[SPEAKER_09]: But here we are and we have some choices to make.

53
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:57,067
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're following the school budget over the course of the last year, you know that we faced some very difficult decisions.

54
00:04:57,107 --> 00:05:01,389
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice way to say we laid off human beings who work in our schools.

55
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:08,931
[SPEAKER_09]: So trust me when I tell you nobody wants to do that, no matter what side of the aisle you're on.

56
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:24,516
[SPEAKER_09]: There's really a disagreement that we need more and not fewer mental health supporters in our schools, that our teachers do without, that our buildings are in disrepair, and that we have no current cut forward to fund our technology replacement program.

57
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,157
[SPEAKER_09]: So, those are real facts.

58
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:33,300
[SPEAKER_09]: They were very present when we negotiated the budget last year.

59
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:44,865
[SPEAKER_09]: The initial budget was much worse than where it landed, and we only landed in a slightly less bad place because we used one-time funds, also known as free cash.

60
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,626
[SPEAKER_09]: to temporarily fill the gap.

61
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:55,329
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a funding strategy for operating costs on a going forward basis or really for any sustainable content at all.

62
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:05,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that, I'm a finance major, I have a degree from Babson College, I run a business, I absolutely understand what it takes to make good decisions about these kinds of things.

63
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:11,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes you have to do the things in the short term that give you the bridge to the long term and that's what we did.

64
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we are, we're at sort of the other side of that bridge, and we're ready to make a plan for the long term.

65
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:33,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I am hopeful that the energy in this community is going to say yes, we want to invest in Medford, we want to invest in kids, we want to invest in our fire department, we want to invest in our roads, and we will have a completely different conversation next time than really we've had for the last year.

66
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,912
[SPEAKER_09]: budget cycles that I've been here.

67
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:41,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always just been some version of bad because there simply is not enough money.

68
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:46,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am ready to have a different conversation where we can talk about doing more for our students.

69
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll leave it there.

70
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pass it to Naomi Kern.

71
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:52,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are excited to be here with us.

72
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,225
[SPEAKER_09]: We're happy to answer your questions.

73
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

74
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:57,046
Thanks.

75
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:02,594
Thank you.

76
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:08,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I only just noticed that we are a new blonde chicks panel.

77
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:14,909
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to talk for a good picture because a lot of people are asking why do we have to increase hope?

78
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we trying to increase sexism?

79
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:32,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the basic question is really, do we have enough money to do the services in our city that we want, that we really are expecting from anyone that lives in any city in Massachusetts?

80
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:37,247
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll start by saying that we rank 320th out of 351 cities and towns.

81
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:40,529
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the 2024 budget, in terms of our budget per capita.

82
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:56,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So that means we have a smaller budget per person than all of the other 58 cities, and it is smaller per person than 90% of towns.

83
00:07:57,345 --> 00:08:02,991
[SPEAKER_11]: The only towns that have a smaller budget per person than we do are all much smaller than New York.

84
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:04,953
[SPEAKER_11]: So the truth is,

85
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:09,817
[SPEAKER_11]: We just can't run a city on the amount of money that we have.

86
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:30,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And Prop 2.5, I don't know how much we're, we need to get into that specifically, but Prop 2.5 in Massachusetts means that if we're gonna raise taxes more than the total amount of taxes that we bring into the city, more than 2.5% per year, we put that on the ballot and ask the voters to make that decision, and that's what we're doing here.

87
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:35,390
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing I want to raise now, because people ask this question a lot,

88
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there somewhere in our budget that we can scrimp and save?

89
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:47,993
[SPEAKER_11]: This giant blue piece of the pie is our schools.

90
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:56,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everyone on both sides of this question understands that we have a huge funding gap in our schools and that we need to find more funding for our schools.

91
00:08:57,315 --> 00:08:58,756
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one is insurance.

92
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Insurance is required by law.

93
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,903
[SPEAKER_11]: We cannot, this is not discretionary, we can't cut that budget.

94
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:06,784
[SPEAKER_11]: The next budget is pensions.

95
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:10,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Pensions, again, are a contract, but we cannot just decide.

96
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:16,454
[SPEAKER_11]: The next two are fire and police.

97
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:25,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that anyone on either side of this fractured and wrapped question wants us to drastically cut our fire department or our police department.

98
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,519
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one is DPW highway.

99
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,560
[SPEAKER_11]: That means our roads.

100
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:43,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing that's important to understand about roads is that the more you underfund them, the more money, you're ballooning the amount of debt that you have to pay later.

101
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:46,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for example, we had a road assessment done.

102
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It has five ratings, one, two, three, four, five.

103
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:54,127
[SPEAKER_11]: 49% of our roads fall into the worst two categories.

104
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:55,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's the problem.

105
00:09:55,968 --> 00:10:03,172
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs at least 30 times as much to fix a category five road as it costs to fix a category two road.

106
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:11,316
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you just always fix your category two roads, and always have your roads in good condition, you can actually do it with the state funding.

107
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:17,700
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you allow them, when you underfund them, and you allow them to get in such a dilapidated state, you just haven't.

108
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,341
[SPEAKER_11]: In prior administrations,

109
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:23,038
[SPEAKER_11]: You're ballooning the amount of debt that we have.

110
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:24,478
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can't underfront your roads.

111
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,980
[SPEAKER_11]: After roads is bonds.

112
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we have to pay that money back.

113
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,482
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not something that we can just decide not to pay.

114
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:40,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're getting into these tiny, we're not working up here in these teeny, weeny little ones.

115
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:47,926
[SPEAKER_11]: With the library, facilities, and other small departments like HR, things we simply cannot cut.

116
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:53,239
[SPEAKER_11]: There is nowhere in this budget that there's a ton of waste.

117
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,360
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nowhere in this budget.

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,003
[SPEAKER_11]: We already have, over decades, cut and cut and cut and cut.

119
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,643
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nowhere else to cut.

120
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:06,526
[SPEAKER_11]: We simply do not have the budget to support a city of our size.

121
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to pass it to Mayor, if I remember.

122
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:14,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

123
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Mayor Graham and

124
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:20,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kelly gave a great explanation.

125
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much more you want to hear from me, but I'm sure there will be a number of questions.

126
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:28,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here to support loud questions.

127
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:34,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I think question six and question seven are the most important to me to raise.

128
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:52,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been working on a new environment for us for years, and I think it's essential that we now is the time to be able to go to the final design, go to bid, and construct that new building for our staff and our city.

129
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And question seven especially,

130
00:11:56,108 --> 00:12:16,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done a video, I've done four videos, they're all on social media, and then I'll be more lengthy than I'll speak tonight, but question seven, 500,000, and that is to hire a completely separate DPW crew who can just work on our streets and our sidewalks, fill potholes, patchwork, and

131
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps seal our roads, which Councilor Calderon mentioned.

132
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do the preventive maintenance.

133
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are actively trying to do.

134
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:28,731
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an amazing DPW director, an amazing city engineer.

135
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,392
[SPEAKER_10]: They are working so hard with the funding and manpower.

136
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,173
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not fully there.

137
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So to have a center through,

138
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:43,839
[SPEAKER_10]: to tackle one of the largest issues that I hear about all the time, my street, my sidewalk, it's unsafe.

139
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I just busted a tire.

140
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:52,646
[SPEAKER_10]: To be able to do that and to put $500,004 just to get back down to the city is essential.

141
00:12:52,706 --> 00:13:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Schools, whether it's two, three, four, $500,004 just to put towards preventive maintenance and maintenance that we should already be doing.

142
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,115
[SPEAKER_10]: We just don't have the funding

143
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:10,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And we finally now have somebody on the city side for the first time ever.

144
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,831
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our first facilities maintenance director.

145
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,274
[SPEAKER_10]: He's actually.

146
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:21,717
[SPEAKER_10]: involved in the school department, banks, and so has our director of planning and development and sustainability.

147
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,499
[SPEAKER_10]: They're helping the schools make sure that we are getting work done.

148
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Biggest for me is we made sure this year that our security cameras are all functioning.

149
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:36,602
[SPEAKER_10]: We made sure that all of the door locks have been changed, so now we know who has

150
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:41,770
[SPEAKER_10]: We had lights that were running out, there was no lighting.

151
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,734
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the projects that we are working on to maintain.

152
00:13:54,961 --> 00:14:07,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've never had, it's like we do now on the city side, but on the school side, we still don't have those routine maintenance yearly checks, write-in checks of our systems.

153
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:18,267
[SPEAKER_10]: We've let our HR get so bad in the last 20 years on our political school loan that it's costing us over a million dollars for an OPM and architect.

154
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:23,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's almost $20 million to get AC and HVAC just to those two schools.

155
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,612
[SPEAKER_10]: They were built at the same time as our other non-federal schools.

156
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,795
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just the HVAC, VRM, et cetera.

157
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:42,719
[SPEAKER_10]: So to be able to put in several hundred thousand dollars to do routine maintenance and annual maintenance of our schools is essential.

158
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,440
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do it to prevent the bad.

159
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,586
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't let that, we can't go on like this.

160
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:59,158
[SPEAKER_10]: We just can't, especially when we have residents who are saying, please help fund our school, fund our city.

161
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,460
[SPEAKER_10]: and putting it to a vote.

162
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,964
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there are people that I know can't afford it, and I've said in my videos, and I'll say tonight, there are exceptions out there.

163
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:12,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Our assessors have an online paper copies in our assessor's office.

164
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:21,712
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a calculator on our city website that will tell you how this will affect you and what options there are for you if there are exemptions and exclusions.

165
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:29,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are ways, and the biggest part of that question seven is current personnel in our State Department.

166
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we did, we'll say do the hard work, you're not managing right.

167
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:41,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Graham and I, and the school committee, and the superintendent, and our finance staff, we did the hard, we did some very hard work.

168
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,798
[SPEAKER_10]: We got two to three million dollars from our school department.

169
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,921
[SPEAKER_10]: We want the taxpayers to let us know, do you want us to do it again?

170
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:59,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're going to have to cut at least $2 million in staff on the school side, but it's also going to take things up on the city side, because I prioritize our schools.

171
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:06,627
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are going to be some tough budget meetings moving forward if question seven doesn't pass, because I'll be

172
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:12,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're talking meetings going over budget.

173
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:17,348
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, please level the bottom as much as you can.

174
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:18,789
[SPEAKER_10]: We're already talking about that.

175
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:33,596
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not mismanagement, it's the fact that school costs, which is the largest piece of this puzzle, is up at least 8% across the state.

176
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,202
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't cut homeless transportation.

177
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:45,582
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about $500,000.

178
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:48,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny probably knows the numbers better than I do.

179
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:53,691
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot cut certain things that are essential in our school.

180
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Homeless transportation, transportation, special ed costs, they can't be cut.

181
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So our cuts are coming from people.

182
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:05,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Our cuts are going straight to the classroom, straight to the mental health supports, the guidance Councilors, people that are needed for our students.

183
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:08,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Since COVID it's been extremely tough.

184
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:17,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Our children are struggling and knowing that we did the hard work and we made the adjustments and we changed what I felt needed to be changed.

185
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:18,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked with the school committee.

186
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked with the city council.

187
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,260
[SPEAKER_10]: We passed a budget and we came up with this plan.

188
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,300
[SPEAKER_10]: We worked together.

189
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been very, very transparent.

190
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything we've done, we've laid out in press releases.

191
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's about four up there.

192
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,247
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing videos.

193
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:33,468
[SPEAKER_10]: We're speaking publicly.

194
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,029
[SPEAKER_10]: It is all transparent.

195
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,271
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to have the right to vote.

196
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:38,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes or no?

197
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:44,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had one of those questions split, because I do know there's some people that can't afford it.

198
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:48,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So question six is in required headquarters.

199
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:49,698
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a debt exclusion.

200
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:53,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Once that debt's paid off, that will fall off your due taxes.

201
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, it passes.

202
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Question seven, you spoke about.

203
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:04,407
[SPEAKER_10]: And then question eight, I too would love to be able to work towards our goals, which was

204
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:09,250
[SPEAKER_10]: better high school and vocational schedule and get our children in the classroom a little longer.

205
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that needs to be negotiated, so we won't go into depth about that.

206
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That will happen at the negotiation table.

207
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Without that funding, that won't be possible.

208
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,198
[SPEAKER_10]: That will not be possible.

209
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:20,599
[SPEAKER_10]: So now's the time for

210
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Some cities and towns do overrides quite often.

211
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:27,621
[SPEAKER_10]: We've never done it.

212
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,242
[SPEAKER_10]: In support of these override questions, I'll be voting yes.

213
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:31,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I just ask that you do your homework.

214
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:41,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask that you keep an open mind and really just think about it, especially how it will affect you and your family.

215
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:45,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that this is both of the people of my burden.

216
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they're successful.

217
00:18:54,776 --> 00:19:00,731
[SPEAKER_07]: really lovely segue into the part that everyone's been waiting for, the guided conversation.

218
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:06,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way that we decided to do this is we're going to go question by question, topic by topic.

219
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the volunteers and I were putting this together, we were taking into account what the majority of people have been asking us, what types of questions we get.

220
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,589
[SPEAKER_07]: We do reach out the things that we hear most often.

221
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:24,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So all these questions, these active questions for this conversation, are informed by voters like you.

222
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:27,114
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to start off with some really great financial stuff.

223
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:30,455
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my fault.

224
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:32,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have asked everyone to silence their phones in person.

225
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I was reminded to do that, and then it just slipped my mind.

226
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So if everyone could silence their phones, that would be awesome.

227
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,982
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to start with free cash and logistics for the revenue.

228
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what is free cash?

229
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:49,805
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some of the projects meant for you to use free cash for?

230
00:19:50,735 --> 00:20:01,789
[SPEAKER_07]: and just opening up the discussion about new growth commercial revenue, why is that not a bigger chunk of our budget, what is being done to expand this area.

231
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:09,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm happy to pass it off to our panel members if they would like to start picking apart these questions.

232
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:22,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I think I'm going to take what is free cash, and then the mayor is going to take what are the projects that are waiting in ways for free cash to be used for.

233
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:26,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So, free cash, dumb name, not free, not cash.

234
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:26,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

235
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:44,158
[SPEAKER_11]: So pre-cash is the official term for, at the end of budget season, let's say your budget was $108 million, and at the end of the budget, you spend $107 million, that $10 million difference, it's called pre-cash.

236
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:55,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Now maybe you had a little more revenue than you expected, maybe you didn't spend on something you thought you would spend on, but it's very common, and what's important to understand

237
00:20:55,709 --> 00:21:06,357
[SPEAKER_11]: is that it is recommended by the state of Massachusetts that cities and towns have between 3% and 5% of their budget in free cash each year.

238
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:11,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, 3% to 5% of the federal budget is between $5 million and $9 million.

239
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:16,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason it's recommended is because bond agencies

240
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:23,866
[SPEAKER_11]: will give you a rating based in part, so that's one of the things they use to give you a bond rating, which is like a credit rating.

241
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:35,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't have free cash, if you end up spending every penny, which I have heard from people like, we should spend every penny, it's mismanaged, we don't spend every penny.

242
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:41,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually financially mismanaged according to bond agencies and according to the state of Massachusetts if you spend every penny.

243
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:46,397
[SPEAKER_11]: It is considered that you are not being financially responsible with this.

244
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:53,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the most important thing to understand is that we need to have free cash in order to have a good profit.

245
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else can I say about free cash?

246
00:21:56,588 --> 00:22:00,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the next thing is just to talk about what it gets used for.

247
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:09,953
[SPEAKER_11]: The one other thing I will say is that in 2024, we, for the first time, created a capital stabilization fund.

248
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:15,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we were one of the last five municipalities out of 351, sorry, 10.

249
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:25,960
[SPEAKER_11]: We were one of the last five to create one, so we finally did that, and that's where you're supposed to put pre-cash so that it can be spent on capital projects.

250
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, to therefore, what does that mean?

251
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you.

252
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:40,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I've done a pre-cash video, and then on the city side, we just put out a diagram of city needs, what would that be?

253
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,815
[SPEAKER_10]: 100% open spend of free cash on.

254
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:46,476
[SPEAKER_10]: It just outlines the needs in Medford.

255
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:51,158
[SPEAKER_10]: We have over 100 million in backlog on our streets and sidewalks.

256
00:22:52,138 --> 00:23:07,484
[SPEAKER_10]: We're putting out a press release this week with regards to 10,000 homes that will get a letter in November letting them know they either have landlines into their home or that they're an unknown.

257
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:15,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be upwards of a hundred plus million dollars for the city to fix those lead mines.

258
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:21,516
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have over $200,000 million, $200 million.

259
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:27,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you also have a large issue with water and sewer infrastructure,

260
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:37,068
[SPEAKER_10]: put in over 420 years ago, that is probably several hundred million dollars to do our water and sewer infrastructure.

261
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:51,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So between the lead that needs to be, the new federal guidelines say we need to take care of this lead line issue over the next eight to ten years, we have to fix our streets and sidewalks, and we have to fix our water and sewer infrastructure.

262
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:52,820
[SPEAKER_10]: That alone is

263
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:55,024
[SPEAKER_10]: $400 million.

264
00:23:55,665 --> 00:24:00,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we have in the pocket, right here.

265
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,790
[SPEAKER_10]: several million in different buckets.

266
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,532
[SPEAKER_10]: One, like Councilor Callahan said, is five million into a stabilization account.

267
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:16,977
[SPEAKER_10]: That is our emergency fund, and that is important to have in case some large project, like a new roof, needs to get done anyway.

268
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:20,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we put, that included, we put six million into that.

269
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:24,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Five million went into a capital improvement stabilization account.

270
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was five million, it was our first,

271
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:42,304
[SPEAKER_10]: First stabilization comes ever, and as of July 1st, we either had projects go over in cost, or we've had emergencies of about $1.2 million, just from July 1st.

272
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:50,169
[SPEAKER_10]: That includes the Brooks School hot water heater, the blue, that was a couple hundred thousand.

273
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:50,930
[SPEAKER_10]: We had,

274
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was a water feeder.

275
00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:59,915
[SPEAKER_10]: We had road safety, traffic safety improvements at Central and Spring Street.

276
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:05,017
[SPEAKER_10]: That project was over $250,000 that we needed to spend money on.

277
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:13,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, there was another request for a grant match, for an MVP grant match of $35,000, and the list goes on.

278
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:18,184
[SPEAKER_10]: So in just a matter of a few months, we needed to spend $1.1 million.

279
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:19,785
[SPEAKER_10]: That account is down to $3.9.

280
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:26,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And that just goes to show the emergencies and the overages and the cost of things that we need to get done.

281
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:30,791
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a capital improvement plan that you can also access on our website.

282
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:35,894
[SPEAKER_10]: That has us spending millions of dollars a year just on equipment.

283
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:42,478
[SPEAKER_10]: DBW, police cruisers, fire trucks, and the list goes on.

284
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:45,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So please take a look at our capital improvement plan.

285
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,561
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a six-year plan.

286
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,162
[SPEAKER_10]: We've, Collin Center helped us with that plan.

287
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:53,332
[SPEAKER_10]: the most professional planning efforts ever had.

288
00:25:53,352 --> 00:26:00,039
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had one that was done in 2021, and we just re-updated it two years later.

289
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:01,400
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's on our website.

290
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:19,253
[SPEAKER_09]: The only other thing I'll say about free cash from my perspective, that money is the bucket of money that we can use to do capital projects at all.

291
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:25,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's nothing left at the end of the year, there are no opportunities for capital projects.

292
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,303
[SPEAKER_09]: The school budget is not resourced.

293
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: to do big capital projects.

294
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:34,487
[SPEAKER_09]: We rely on the city to be able to grant those one-time funds.

295
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:38,489
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very typical process in communities across the state.

296
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Cities usually do sort of pick up the cost of those school-based projects.

297
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:55,351
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee has re-launched a different and more rigorous capital planning process this year.

298
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:56,752
[SPEAKER_09]: We held our first meeting last week.

299
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:06,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of the reason we did that is I see some folks in the room who were part of building these new schools, and since then we really haven't done the right thing to maintain them.

300
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:07,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And why?

301
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Money.

302
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:11,404
[SPEAKER_09]: It costs money to do maintenance.

303
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a couple of ways we have to fix that.

304
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:20,310
[SPEAKER_09]: One is, we have to start doing that maintenance, which means the operating budget of the schools has to increase.

305
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,250
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not free cash.

306
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:26,254
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other is, we have realities like a broken water heater at the Brooks.

307
00:27:26,734 --> 00:27:33,619
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to prepare food for children at the Brooks, and they need to be able to sanitize their equipment, and they don't have a hot water heater.

308
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,701
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are, our staff are amazing.

309
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They do everything that they can to work on all this stuff.

310
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:41,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact of the matter is,

311
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:48,317
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the ways we could have done maintenance to this point and didn't, that leads us to capital needs.

312
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:57,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we have to get out of this cycle of waiting until something, there's a hole in the roof, a roof falls in, a hot water heater is broken.

313
00:27:57,782 --> 00:28:00,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be able to do a better job with that.

314
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:07,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can say that we should have done a better job for the last however long the schools have been built, 20 years, 25 years.

315
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:08,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with all of that.

316
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:12,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But here we are, and we have choices to make about how we move forward.

317
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:20,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And for me, I want to move forward in a productive way that addresses the backlog and sets us up on a path to go forward.

318
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:20,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

319
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:31,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly, before we move on to the next topic, do we want to discuss a little bit more about new growth as it pertains to the new sector?

320
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:32,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

321
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:38,041
[SPEAKER_10]: We averaged over the last couple decades, we've averaged anywhere from

322
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,653
[SPEAKER_10]: one to one and a half million in new growth.

323
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:47,417
[SPEAKER_10]: This past fiscal year, we brought that up, that number up to 2.5 million.

324
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are growing in new growth.

325
00:28:51,360 --> 00:29:02,468
[SPEAKER_10]: We've doubled the size of our planning department, thankfully, which is planning, development, and sustainability, and we have our first ever economic development director who's trying to bring in new business.

326
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:04,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've been working extremely hard on

327
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,033
[SPEAKER_10]: a number of projects that are in the works, and a number of projects that are coming in the future.

328
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:15,415
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we are doing well with regrowth, but we're always looking to expand.

329
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:20,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've, you should correct me if I'm wrong, but we had

330
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:29,874
[SPEAKER_10]: five or six life science facilities that were ready to move forward, and that market kind of fell apart.

331
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:39,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I started asking developers to bring life science to Medford right when I became mayor in 2020, and at that time it was too late.

332
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:41,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are,

333
00:29:41,523 --> 00:30:03,800
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get the tech industry, we're trying to get multi, we just put an RFP out for our three lots in Medford Square, that's gonna be mixed use, affordable housing, commercial, so we are doing everything we can, we're gonna have the space above the well into the air rights, and we're moving, but it just takes time, so you see a lot of development now, but you see more and more as the years go by.

334
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:17,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And just quickly, the city council has been working on rezoning, and we're pretty excited about this to ask, because we're gonna rezone for a lot of mixed use and a lot higher stories.

335
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:27,911
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll gradually, as it goes away from the metro squares, it'll gradually get more and more stories, but we're very excited about the amount of people who might have their, and I will also just, I will switch over to Ross.

336
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,313
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is our,

337
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:40,863
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the commercial sector, new growth, and I don't know how much you can see, but the last two years have been higher new growth than any time in the last 20 years.

338
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really are doing better.

339
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:48,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everyone.

340
00:30:49,662 --> 00:31:03,005
[SPEAKER_07]: In the spirit of moving forward and doing better, that's a wonderful segue, again, to our second portion of the guided conversation, where we start looking at three valid questions and answer some questions as it pertains to each of them.

341
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:08,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So question six is the de-exclusion or deconstruction of the required headquarters.

342
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:14,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what is a de-exclusion, and if there is a clear need for a required headquarters,

343
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,627
[SPEAKER_07]: There is, because there's a valid question on it.

344
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,828
[SPEAKER_07]: What type of things went into that process?

345
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:29,850
[SPEAKER_07]: What will happen if question six does not pass in terms of the infrastructure that currently exists?

346
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we haven't actually explained Prop 2.5 fully.

347
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:37,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to start by explaining Prop 2.5?

348
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:41,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just do Prop 2.5 and override versus a debt exclusion.

349
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:45,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So, unlike almost every other state in the country,

350
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:49,927
[SPEAKER_11]: where city councils are allowed to raise the taxes that they determine that they need.

351
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:58,012
[SPEAKER_11]: They're elected, they run on it, they either want to raise taxes or they want to not raise taxes, and then as elected officials, they make that decision.

352
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:11,580
[SPEAKER_11]: In Massachusetts, a statewide ballot measure passed in 1980 that said that no city or town can raise the total tax levy, total amount of money brought into the city, more than 2.5% per year.

353
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:14,654
[SPEAKER_04]: not including new growth, right?

354
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:18,095
[SPEAKER_11]: New growth changes the model, that's different.

355
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:28,279
[SPEAKER_11]: But the point is not that they can't raise the taxes, it's simply that to raise those taxes, they put it on the ballot and they allow the voters to make that decision for themselves.

356
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Even the proponents of Prop 10.5 did not want it.

357
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:37,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So it used to go 30 years without ever 40 years without ever putting it on the ballot.

358
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:41,005
[SPEAKER_11]: They believed that it should be put on the ballot and the voters should decide.

359
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:51,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Override is something that you increase the total amount that the tax levy can be.

360
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:57,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So in our case, it would be $3.5 million for question 7, $4 million more for question 8.

361
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:03,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point, that becomes a new tax levy, and that can be increased 2.5%.

362
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:24,953
[SPEAKER_11]: because it has a limited, it can only be used for the thing, well, they can both only be used for what they're supposed to be for, but it's for capital projects, and once it is paid off, that tax then goes down again.

363
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:26,055
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty much it.

364
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:41,009
[SPEAKER_10]: it was likely to be a 30-year loan for $30 million to build a new high school, and that wouldn't hit, fire station, I'm sorry, fire station, and that wouldn't hit our tax rolls this year.

365
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:42,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be next year.

366
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:53,411
[SPEAKER_10]: In debt exclusion, yes, we're asking for 30 million for a new headquarters, and the question was the process.

367
00:33:55,044 --> 00:34:07,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, like what, there's a clear need for public safety measures, so I guess a little bit more about why now and what the difference would be if this renovation of the tarp was not done.

368
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:08,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

369
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:13,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Back when I was on the city council, there was a proposal that was put before us.

370
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:20,041
[SPEAKER_10]: It was actually no community involvement, no involvement from anybody that I'm aware of except the chief of police at the time.

371
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just put before us.

372
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:24,704
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a design of a new police headquarters.

373
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:28,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time, as a city councilor, I just asked that we take

374
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,482
[SPEAKER_10]: a couple months to explore a combined station, a fire and a police station.

375
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:36,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Combined station would save us money in the long run.

376
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:56,972
[SPEAKER_10]: That didn't happen, so once I became mayor, obviously as I was campaigning, I made it a central issue to make sure that we also take a look at our fire headquarters and all of our fire buildings, there's six of them, and we put the work in that needs to be put in to make the living environment and the work environment a better place.

377
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,513
[SPEAKER_10]: So since that time, I commissioned a task force.

378
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:08,316
[SPEAKER_10]: We have put millions of dollars into the five substations, windows, roofs, new kitchens, and the list goes on.

379
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:16,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I also tasked my chief of staff, who is my trade and engineer, to lead that project.

380
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's been working on the EnviroHeadquarters for about

381
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,001
[SPEAKER_10]: over two years.

382
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I've kind of taken a step back.

383
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I have other things to do.

384
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:36,371
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a long list, so we divide and conquer, but she led that chapter with the prior fire chief and the current fire chief, and we've created a plan.

385
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, it's still in concept design.

386
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:46,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hopefully going into final design, especially if this vote passes, and we're working towards it.

387
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,682
[SPEAKER_10]: for a building that's 70 years old that needs a lot of work.

388
00:35:53,702 --> 00:36:09,408
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same problems that we have in the police station from ventilation to rodents to windows that need to be replaced and living quarters that need to be better maintained and updated.

389
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:15,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And the list goes on, and it's an old building, and our department and our city deserves better.

390
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:17,193
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's debt exclusion.

391
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:22,060
[SPEAKER_10]: We chose to go debt exclusion because you can bond multiple ways.

392
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,903
[SPEAKER_10]: One is through debt exclusion, and that is the extra tax.

393
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:29,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can put it on the budget.

394
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:32,147
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put the debt on the budget.

395
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:43,693
[SPEAKER_10]: But in my mind, if you're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars on your bond each year for our headquarters that we could have a debt exclusion on, in my mind, you're taking money away from our schools.

396
00:36:43,913 --> 00:36:46,494
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just can't afford that right now.

397
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:48,175
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't been able to.

398
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:51,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is the much better route.

399
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,698
[SPEAKER_10]: So what will happen if this doesn't pass?

400
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,435
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know how long we would build.

401
00:36:58,314 --> 00:36:59,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

402
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So there may be some additional questions about question six on the board, so if there are any, we'll do our best to get to them towards the end, but for the sake of time, I'd like to keep us moving.

403
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:17,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was a little something on question six, and now we're going to move to question seven and eight, which may or may not occur in details a bit more in her introductory remarks.

404
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to read this.

405
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:24,330
[SPEAKER_07]: These are pulled from the Investment Network website, a little explainer of each of the questions.

406
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:30,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The official language of the ballot questions can also be found on our website as well as the city's website for your reference.

407
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,666
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is what we will be diving into now.

408
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:39,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So questions that are named, a little bit of packaging, we'll assemble them.

409
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:49,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are going to be covering what is the difference in expense between road construction with an in-house crew, like this question will be advocating for, versus a contracted crew.

410
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:59,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We've received a lot of questions about the specifics regarding how we are going to be spending this money, so we're gonna go into a little bit more detail about the proposed plans for that.

411
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And responding to the claims,

412
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:06,339
[SPEAKER_07]: of the money going into a general fund being a restraining focus.

413
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:08,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's last two times together.

414
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:14,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Each of you have two minutes to kind of tackle this in whichever order you feel is best.

415
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Jen, would you like to start?

416
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:18,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

417
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:30,963
[SPEAKER_09]: We put out an explainer, there's some copies of it in the back, it's, we call it a one-pager because it's intended to be printed from the back, but maybe it's a two-pager to some.

418
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:43,871
[SPEAKER_09]: That document was our, my attempt with Member Reinfeld, who I think is here somewhere, I think she's in the back, to be responsive to people saying, well, what is this for?

419
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:48,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And the sneaky part is that when you're talking about the school budget,

420
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:53,281
[SPEAKER_09]: 80-85% of the school budget is subject to collective bargaining agreements.

421
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:58,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means 80-85% of our costs are about personnel.

422
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,956
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not uncommon, we're not unusual in any way.

423
00:39:02,737 --> 00:39:09,138
[SPEAKER_09]: But the truth of the matter is, we can't decide how much we're going to pay anybody.

424
00:39:09,658 --> 00:39:11,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That happens at a bargaining table.

425
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:17,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And in order to put information out, we would have to be doing that in collaboration with people at the bargaining table.

426
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Having those kinds of conversations when there is actually no money to spend is exceedingly difficult.

427
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:41,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we did instead was try to give you an understanding based on numbers we could share, like how much those salaries cost in this past year that we used one-time funds to fund, how many positions we saved.

428
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:50,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really tried in question seven on that explainer to tell you a little bit about what we're preserving when that question is successful.

429
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:52,279
[SPEAKER_09]: For question eight,

430
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,337
[SPEAKER_09]: What we tried to do, this one gets a little bit harder.

431
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:01,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what we start to talk about is what could we do in the future?

432
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:08,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we're back at the bargaining table to talk about things like living wages for our paraprofessionals.

433
00:40:09,238 --> 00:40:14,481
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done a lot of work to improve the pay scales for our paraprofessionals.

434
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:17,142
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to barely make a minimum wage.

435
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:19,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they make more than that.

436
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:23,865
[SPEAKER_09]: But they come to the table and tell us that they deserve more.

437
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:27,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We agree, but there is no more.

438
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:39,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what we tried to do in that explainer, take a look, have the answer questions afterwards, is give you some details about what we might do with the knowledge that it will all be spent on schools.

439
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:47,569
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee, through its statutory process around budgets, will hold hearings and pass a budget in the open.

440
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we're here to pass a budget in the open.

441
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,053
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're going to do when this is successful.

442
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:56,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we will cut the budget in the open.

443
00:40:56,294 --> 00:40:57,134
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the alternative.

444
00:40:57,174 --> 00:41:01,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So what seven does is help us not keep cutting.

445
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:05,199
[SPEAKER_09]: What eight does is allow us to have a different conversation about the future.

446
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:08,901
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not about doing less and less.

447
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:10,022
Thank you.

448
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

449
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:16,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just get into the last piece a bit because although

450
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:29,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm one member of the school committee, and Member Graham's one member, it's seven members have to vote on something, and the superintendent and the finance director create the budget, obviously with our help and advice and discussion.

451
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:42,322
[SPEAKER_10]: We're pretty clear, this is two million, question seven is two million in personnel, it's Chromebooks for our students, it's maintenance for our buildings, and it's a DPW crew.

452
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:51,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, will the superintendent want to take $50,000 from the maintenance to help with busing or special ed?

453
00:41:52,141 --> 00:42:01,143
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be, obviously, the prerogative of the superintendent and finance director, but we are not going to go cut positions to fund something else.

454
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:06,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We're being as clear as possible, knowing that, obviously, things will live.

455
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:10,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And with question eight, it's going to cost at least that or more.

456
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:12,248
[SPEAKER_10]: to extend the school day.

457
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:14,630
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not spending it another way.

458
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And the debt exclusion is the debt exclusion.

459
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:31,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't buy the argument that we're just going to go into the general fund and we're going to spend it on X, Y, and Z. We work very hard, member Graham and I, and Councilor Callahan as well, to balance the budget, to know the needs,

460
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:38,160
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's what the taxpayers want us to do, and we do it every day.

461
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:49,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we don't have full control of the schools, but we spend a lot of time, we spend a lot of time on that area, and I'm doing it on the city side, and it's the first time the city's had human resources in Medford.

462
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:54,724
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no human resources in the city of Medford until four years ago when I became mayor.

463
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:59,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So, holding people accountable, making sure your tax dollars are spent the right way, we're doing it.

464
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:00,465
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not perfect.

465
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:12,031
[SPEAKER_10]: believe me, I'm starting to look at the parking revenue, I'm looking at overtime, I'm looking at sick time, I'm doing it every day, and so is in Denver right now, both of us on the school side.

466
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:19,115
[SPEAKER_10]: So this money is going to our children, one way or another, it's our priority.

467
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:27,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I have to add is once you negotiate contracts with the teachers, then you have a contract.

468
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how that's possible.

469
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:41,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And how often have we cut the school budget?

470
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:54,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually went digging and Bedford has a history of flatlining budgets for the schools or giving an increase that's not enough to cover contractual increases.

471
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,706
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

472
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That has happened in Bedford for many, many years.

473
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:02,391
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time I could find an instance where we actually

474
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,415
[SPEAKER_09]: reduced the school budget was like back in the 80s.

475
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:09,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really don't have a history of cutting the budget.

476
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:16,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some history, unfortunately, of flatlining the budget, and we have some history of underfunding the budget.

477
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:20,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's really no history of us cutting the budget on the school side.

478
00:44:21,227 --> 00:44:31,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Other departments, I think for sure, have had different experiences with that, but when we talk about could we cut the budget, if we did, we would be handing out pay slips.

479
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We would be talking about the positions that we're eliminating.

480
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not what anybody wants to do.

481
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,284
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not my priority.

482
00:44:42,364 --> 00:44:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: There needs to be more help for our students, not less.

483
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So that fear, I understand it.

484
00:44:49,768 --> 00:45:00,492
[SPEAKER_09]: When you don't get to personally hand out the dollars, I understand that there's always a feeling that someone might not do it the way that you do, but that's why we have a committee of seven people.

485
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,292
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor doesn't get to decide this.

486
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:03,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get to decide this.

487
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:09,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires the majority vote of the school committee to spend every single penny that is spent.

488
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:13,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for your thoughts.

489
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:14,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give them a round of applause.

490
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:27,308
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, I invite any of our elected officials in support of this initiative to join the remainder of the panel at the front.

491
00:45:28,128 --> 00:45:32,931
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any last-minute questions that you'd like to get in, this is your time.

492
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:41,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But while everyone's reshuffling, I'm going to go take a look and see what our FAQs of the evening are, and then we'll move through those questions.

493
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:55,843
Hello.

494
00:45:57,264 --> 00:45:57,564
Hello.

495
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:27,827
th th

496
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:02,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for entertaining a quick intermission.

497
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to our school committee and city council elected officials that have joined us this evening.

498
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:18,674
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Councilor Matt Leming, Councilor Emily Lazzaro, school committee member Paul Rousseau, city council president Zach Harris, city council vice president Kate Collins, and school committee member Erin Olapade.

499
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:23,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, there's Erin, she's hiding from me, I'm so sorry, of course.

500
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:27,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but certainly not least, school committee member Erin Oropon.

501
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:37,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So, our lovely volunteers have taken your questions and they are giving them to me in order of most frequently asked.

502
00:47:37,705 --> 00:47:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So, our first theme of the evening is addressing trust and transparency in government.

503
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:57,019
[SPEAKER_07]: You just heard from three elected officials that are asking the voters to put their trust in them, and they've picked a very clear case for you, and so I'd like to give everybody the opportunity to talk through that as well.

504
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you, any of you, and we're gonna try to limit to two people responding for questions to keep it moving.

505
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:10,818
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Monday night, we wanna get everyone home on time.

506
00:48:10,979 --> 00:48:13,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, thank you.

507
00:48:14,422 --> 00:48:20,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So, any of our members sitting up here, could you explain the formation of the financial task force and how

508
00:48:22,918 --> 00:48:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: the issues of transparency and trust kind of come up around that.

509
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:28,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So just the behind-the-scenes process, if you could.

510
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am getting a question just about the raises at the beginning of the session.

511
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you would like to just provide an answer for that, that's what the people would like to hear first.

512
00:48:40,902 --> 00:48:45,683
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I'm going to Jenny first, and then Zach.

513
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:47,143
Which part do you want to do?

514
00:48:47,163 --> 00:48:48,884
I can do the start.

515
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:57,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So two years ago, a little past that.

516
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:04,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little bit of a disagreement, I would say, the mayor and I, over the budget.

517
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and I think it's important to sort of like, just be straight up, right?

518
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:12,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Council had some serious questions about the budget.

519
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:15,353
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to talk about an improved budget process.

520
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:17,194
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to talk about the underfunding issue.

521
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:26,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Vice President Collins and I were, had identified the need, the significant underfunding and the excuse of what type of funds to fund operating expenses.

522
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And that budget went to the last, I think, 2 a.m.

523
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:46,160
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting, the Mayor came out, and at the end of it, we made some improvements to the budget, and we talked about what we'd do the following year, and that budget actually passed, I think, unanimously, or at least the Councilor and I next to me voted for it at the end of the night.

524
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:55,235
[SPEAKER_01]: The next year we came back and we took a bit of a different approach, really focusing on what would a better budget process for the city look like.

525
00:49:55,755 --> 00:50:05,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And what ended up happening, the council collectively again unanimously put forward a set of budget requests, budget demands in a sense.

526
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:12,366
[SPEAKER_01]: President Morell at the time, Nicole Morell and I went and met with the mayor and we sat down and we said, here's what the council wants.

527
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:17,671
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a better budget process, we want more funding for our schools, we want more funding for our library.

528
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:24,116
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were able to negotiate on behalf of the council as council leadership with the mayor was three things.

529
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,958
[SPEAKER_01]: The formation of a financial task force,

530
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:44,562
[SPEAKER_01]: consisting of the leadership of the school committee, the city council, and the mayor, the commitment to establish a new budget process through a budget ordinance, which we passed this year and used in this year's budget, starting the process earlier than ever in the most transparent way possible, and the commitment to really address this issue of underfunding.

531
00:50:45,023 --> 00:50:47,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the financial task force did.

532
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:49,966
[SPEAKER_01]: We've released, again, multiple press releases.

533
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We announced it at the budget time last year.

534
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:55,009
[SPEAKER_01]: We announced the formation of the task force, and then we announced

535
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

536
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:12,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So to the questions that are in the community about the finance task force, that's exactly what we did each time we met.

537
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:16,693
[SPEAKER_09]: We had one question to answer, which was, what is our go forward plan?

538
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:21,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked in a lot of detail about what that could be.

539
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked a lot about plans for the future.

540
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:26,383
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about the high school coming online.

541
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:31,567
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about is this the start of a series of overrides or is it the end?

542
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:33,589
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, is it a one-time shot?

543
00:51:33,649 --> 00:51:34,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And we sort of landed

544
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:36,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I would say somewhere in the middle.

545
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:42,454
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do not want to be putting questions before you like some communities do every single year.

546
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:44,855
[SPEAKER_09]: We're new at this in Medford.

547
00:51:44,876 --> 00:51:50,758
[SPEAKER_09]: We have no community muscle around how to do it, how to have productive conversations that are respectful.

548
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:52,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all learning through that process.

549
00:51:52,439 --> 00:51:53,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're all here.

550
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,800
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not all in favor.

551
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

552
00:51:57,021 --> 00:52:01,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we landed on was a number that was big enough to make a difference.

553
00:52:01,824 --> 00:52:03,384
[SPEAKER_09]: smaller than what the real need is.

554
00:52:04,105 --> 00:52:05,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And what does that mean?

555
00:52:05,265 --> 00:52:17,747
[SPEAKER_09]: That means we have, again, created a bridge to a place where development can help start to carry some more of the load than it historically has been able to do in that regard.

556
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,328
[SPEAKER_09]: The final comment was about the school committee raise.

557
00:52:20,448 --> 00:52:21,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to correct the record.

558
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:23,289
[SPEAKER_09]: We did not receive a 143% raise.

559
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:31,830
[SPEAKER_09]: we received a $5,000 raise for the first time for the position in 24 years.

560
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:45,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I could tell you and we can talk afterwards about all the work that the school committee does, it is equivalent to the work of the council and I continue to believe that we should be paid the same as the council.

561
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:48,574
[SPEAKER_09]: But 5,000 is not 143% of $12,000, so that's that.

562
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:48,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

563
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:57,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you for that.

564
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:10,711
[SPEAKER_07]: In looking at the additional questions in this transparency category, we received a question about some grants that the city has been awarded for road work and as well as lead pipe repair.

565
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:16,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Do any of you want to talk a little bit about that and perhaps dive into that?

566
00:53:16,615 --> 00:53:18,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to take it?

567
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:31,697
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an application in for the EAP for lead pipe repair, but we don't have, we don't know if we'll get that for another month.

568
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that grant money is not guaranteed or accessible at the moment?

569
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:36,740
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not guaranteed.

570
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the EAP grant is, we don't know yet.

571
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:45,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be another month, and if we do get the grant, it will be, well, one-sixth of the need, or just above lead issue.

572
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:48,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so just so fan-day.

573
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:50,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

574
00:53:50,788 --> 00:54:03,417
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a substantial amount of money, but when you're talking 100 plus million dollars in replacement that we need to do, the 20 million grant that we applied for through the EPA, we'll just touch a fraction of that.

575
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:04,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

576
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:07,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone else have any thoughts before I go?

577
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, we're only taking questions.

578
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:19,245
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I can say, there will be time at the very end, everyone will mingle, so just please allow Councilors to answer any questions.

579
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:26,249
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I can say about grants that you can apply for through the EPA and other grant making

580
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,651
[SPEAKER_08]: companies, opportunities, foundations.

581
00:54:30,052 --> 00:54:38,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't fund a city, you can't operate a budget for a city of our size on grants alone.

582
00:54:39,077 --> 00:54:40,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wouldn't be enough.

583
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:43,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are opportunities for things like that, and it is exciting.

584
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:55,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I can definitely say that Alicia Klein and other department heads are utilizing every opportunity that they come across and they are aware of these opportunities.

585
00:54:56,042 --> 00:55:01,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I've spoken with Tim McKibben as well about a number of opportunities that they are aware of.

586
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:09,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is something that's being utilized when it's available.

587
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:10,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

588
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:12,467
[SPEAKER_07]: In the interest of moving along,

589
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:20,991
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now move on to our next set of questions, which are surrounded or centered on what happens if these questions do not pass.

590
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:29,055
[SPEAKER_07]: We've of course gotten into that kind of by talking about the potential for the programs that will be put into place if they do pass.

591
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:38,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if 7-8 don't pass, what has been cut that can be restored, and when will our taxes reflect that?

592
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:42,261
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, if it passes or if it fails.

593
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,358
[SPEAKER_07]: The question reads, what happens if 7 and 8 don't pass?

594
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:55,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alternatively, if they do pass, what has been cut that can be restored and when will our taxes reflect that?

595
00:55:56,794 --> 00:56:03,217
[SPEAKER_09]: On the school side, I would point you to the detailed graphic that actually does talk about the positions we saved.

596
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:11,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Those would be the first positions that would be cut in another sort of down budget cycle.

597
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So if these are not successful, those positions are gone.

598
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:17,303
[SPEAKER_09]: July 1.

599
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:20,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will say goodbye to humans who work in our school district again.

600
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:22,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to do that.

601
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:26,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want us to keep all of those folks because they're really important to our kids.

602
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:43,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And more importantly, I want to have the ability to address some of the structural issues that we have in our schools around totally incompatible high school schedules, the minimum number of hours that the state allows us, not enough transportation, all of those things.

603
00:56:44,324 --> 00:56:47,628
[SPEAKER_09]: can't even meet conversations if question 8 does not pass.

604
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:53,736
[SPEAKER_09]: If they pass, we can have a conversation and we will have to decide what our priorities are because

605
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:59,903
[SPEAKER_09]: There's $4 million is not the full enchilada in terms of fully funding everything.

606
00:56:59,923 --> 00:57:03,765
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still very far away from a free public school system.

607
00:57:03,945 --> 00:57:20,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We can debate the merits of free public school systems and things like free lunch at another time, but this amount of money does not put us even in the legal territory of giving away a free education, which probably I think we should do, but that's not what this does.

608
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,692
[SPEAKER_09]: This helps us move forward.

609
00:57:26,816 --> 00:57:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have any thoughts they'd like to add?

610
00:57:31,922 --> 00:57:33,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.

611
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:34,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

612
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:41,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the Mayor can speak to it too, right?

613
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get to this budget, we basically didn't do $3 million worth of looking at the Mayor for it, because she did approximately $3 million worth of stuff that we wanted to start doing this year about that on the city side.

614
00:57:54,818 --> 00:58:01,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you talk about having enough people to make sure that city government is performing its basic services,

615
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,347
[SPEAKER_01]: just another impact if it doesn't happen.

616
00:58:05,387 --> 00:58:08,029
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're talking, I think you guys mentioned it before, right?

617
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:17,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only would we likely have to cut many of the things that are funded by one-time funds, but there certainly would not be an opportunity for the city to add a staff member in a key office.

618
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:19,398
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's currently needed.

619
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:26,864
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I just want to say, going quickly back to the grant side of things, grants are 99% of the time one-time or short-term funds.

620
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:30,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's one year, two years, or three years, eventually the

621
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:35,518
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a sustainable way to fund a permanent operating budget.

622
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:44,621
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're talking about an override and talking about property taxes is because it is a permanent revenue source to fund ongoing expenses.

623
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:51,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And the great sad impact of Proposition 2.5 was that sustainable revenue went away.

624
00:58:51,964 --> 00:58:56,105
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, DPW 40 years ago had twice as many people working here.

625
00:58:57,043 --> 00:59:02,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're talking about just having people to work there to fill potholes, because we don't even have that anymore.

626
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:15,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a legacy both of the Proposition 2.5 law and 45 years of not being willing to say to the voters, yeah, this is hard, but we need to ask us to come together and fund these things.

627
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:16,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, they're not going to get done.

628
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Dana mentioned, then it just snowballs and gets worse and worse and worse.

629
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have some, oh I see a hand raised high.

630
00:59:27,675 --> 00:59:28,778
[SPEAKER_07]: School Committee Member Reinfeld.

631
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pass it on back to the other end.

632
00:59:33,878 --> 00:59:38,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to comment kind of a combination of these last two questions about transparency in the school.

633
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:43,801
[SPEAKER_06]: So member Graham already mentioned that the budget process is by law an open budgeting process.

634
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:49,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to say we in Bethlehem Public Schools are in a really good position to be transparent about things.

635
00:59:49,983 --> 01:00:00,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Our budget process got incredibly cleaned up by our last finance director who continues to consult one of the smoothest, most well accounted for budgeting that we've seen in quite a while.

636
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:03,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not school committee, but I watched the meetings.

637
01:00:04,487 --> 01:00:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a clean budget book.

638
01:00:05,767 --> 01:00:10,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We know where the money's going, how it's being spent, and we're going to continue to have those public meetings.

639
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a new capital planning process policy.

640
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:16,269
[SPEAKER_06]: We have open subcommittee meetings where these things are happening.

641
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:17,489
[SPEAKER_06]: They're happening in public.

642
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:19,949
[SPEAKER_06]: These conversations, we are collecting input.

643
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:30,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are in a really good position to show what is happening in the schools, where the money is going, and how it is responding to the needs that we're hearing.

644
01:00:31,613 --> 01:00:35,637
[SPEAKER_06]: from our department heads, from administration, from our vendors.

645
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good time to be transparent and we're ready to do that with these questions.

646
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,720
[SPEAKER_12]: to go up on that point of transparency.

647
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:56,225
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the last budget we just passed for the schools, you'll see that there appears to be a $3.5 million increase in transportation.

648
01:00:56,565 --> 01:01:03,629
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at our transportation contract, it's actually, we pay them more per year than our last budget's total transportation.

649
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:07,999
[SPEAKER_12]: because it shouldn't make any sense.

650
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:21,888
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in the past, because our budget wasn't big enough, we would not be school committee, but, you know, the finance people and the superintendent would get together and they would just like start erasing numbers and making them smaller to get down to a number.

651
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:28,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Because by law, every penny we spend in our budget has to be tied directly to where that penny's coming from.

652
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:30,654
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no wishful thinking in a budget.

653
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:36,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So it looks like our budget for transportation went up $3.5 million this year.

654
01:01:36,955 --> 01:01:37,595
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't go up.

655
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:39,815
[SPEAKER_12]: It went up a little bit, like 80,000, I think.

656
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:41,476
[SPEAKER_12]: So where is it?

657
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:44,816
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest of that money, previous years, was just not on the budget.

658
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:46,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you would not hire some people.

659
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:53,216
[SPEAKER_12]: They take some money from these accounts that aren't really for transportation and pay the bills that way.

660
01:01:53,236 --> 01:01:58,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have no idea how much it costs to run this district.

661
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:05,943
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the first budget in the time that I've been on the school committee where the transportation line item says what we have to spend for transportation.

662
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:09,065
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very simple example because it's such a stark jump.

663
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:14,809
[SPEAKER_12]: But there were budgets since I've been on the school committee where we have full-time special education

664
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:23,947
[SPEAKER_12]: permanent teachers, and if you looked in the budget, their salary on the budget says zero dollars, because it wasn't enough money, but we weren't gonna fire them.

665
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:33,213
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just kept them in the budget with a zero, and then on July 1st, we started paying them, and we didn't pay for other things that we needed to pay for.

666
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:41,218
[SPEAKER_12]: So the budget has always, in my time, in seven years, this is the first budget that actually makes any sense to anybody reading it.

667
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:45,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's a level of transparency that I'm just thrilled by.

668
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:59,669
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really hard because it does mean that if you decide you're gonna be transparent, next year if transportation is 4.1 million, you can't just suddenly decide it's gonna, well, we'll put three there so we can keep these teachers.

669
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:03,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

670
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:09,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And just super quickly for the last question of this subject matter.

671
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:17,345
[SPEAKER_07]: If a yes vote prevails, when will we see the increase on the tax bill?

672
01:03:17,866 --> 01:03:18,586
[SPEAKER_09]: January 25th.

673
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:20,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

674
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:22,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Except question six, right?

675
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:29,033
[SPEAKER_09]: The debt exclusion is not until there's an actual bond to be issued.

676
01:03:29,053 --> 01:03:34,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a good way to segue into our next most frequently asked question this evening.

677
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:38,800
[SPEAKER_07]: If question six passes, is the design of the fire station set as is?

678
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:44,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is the position of the fire chief plus department heads?

679
01:03:44,596 --> 01:03:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to assume that means what is their role in the process.

680
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:52,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So if someone would like to discuss about what that would look like.

681
01:03:55,373 --> 01:04:02,755
[SPEAKER_10]: What is set is a piece of land that we have to build the fire station on, which is a very difficult piece of property.

682
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:10,058
[SPEAKER_10]: It's configured in a way, especially the curb cuts and the structure of it.

683
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:15,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what is set is a 22,000 or so square foot building.

684
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,900
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to do 20 to 25,000 construction costs, and then obviously we need

685
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:26,074
[SPEAKER_10]: contingencies and additional funding for it to get finalized.

686
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:40,519
[SPEAKER_10]: What is also set is that we heard from the department and we heard from the current fire chief the position of the building, and that is not how other department heads of the city felt.

687
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:50,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a position where I was left, and I told you I stayed out of the process, but it was a position where I said, okay, traffic and transportation wants this,

688
01:04:50,816 --> 01:04:54,778
[SPEAKER_10]: planning, things that should go with this, engineering, DPW, they were all involved.

689
01:04:55,278 --> 01:05:06,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And our fire chief said, actually for our department and our members, and the safety of exiting that parcel, this is the way the building needs to be positioned.

690
01:05:06,624 --> 01:05:11,307
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's when I took a stand and said, we're gonna do what the fire department wants.

691
01:05:11,467 --> 01:05:14,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to those department heads that weren't happy with that.

692
01:05:14,568 --> 01:05:16,409
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are the things that are definite.

693
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's a concept design, so things can definitely be

694
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:22,738
[SPEAKER_10]: be tweaked and changed just like we've done over the last several months.

695
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:24,201
[SPEAKER_10]: We've added more storage space.

696
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:26,345
[SPEAKER_10]: We've changed bunk space.

697
01:05:26,786 --> 01:05:30,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I did put a training tower in the design because I've heard loud and clear that the

698
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,748
[SPEAKER_10]: training tower was a request of our department.

699
01:05:35,249 --> 01:05:44,152
[SPEAKER_10]: That was put in writing that the union would like to take that out in return for more bunk space, so we took the tower out, there's more bunk space.

700
01:05:44,772 --> 01:06:00,279
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not perfect, I'm not 100% happy, our planning director is not 100% happy, fire chief's not 100% happy, the list goes on, but it's gonna be a brand new building for our department, and final design will come after this building.

701
01:06:02,677 --> 01:06:13,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to apologize because I misinterpreted the question, but then you ended up answering the actual question, so it worked out just fine in terms of how the department heads felt about the process.

702
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:20,362
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies if that was your question and I misconstrued it, but the answer's there anyways.

703
01:06:20,382 --> 01:06:22,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have anything they want to add?

704
01:06:22,923 --> 01:06:26,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I would like to move on to some of the other questions and different subject matters.

705
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, and I just want to make kind of two points.

706
01:06:35,211 --> 01:06:40,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what the mayor said about there are things that are not set in stone and need to be tweaked, I think that's important.

707
01:06:40,192 --> 01:06:45,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've heard from some folks that there are tweaks that they would like to see made.

708
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:54,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this question of the clean zones and the phasing for folks, firefighters coming back from a firefighter, from a fire.

709
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:57,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Some questions around showers and bunk space.

710
01:06:58,195 --> 01:06:59,818
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's two things here.

711
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:04,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Voting yes on question six is about voting yes on a five and six mechanism, not a final design.

712
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:15,168
[SPEAKER_01]: The State Department of Revenue has very clear guidelines that say minor project changes, inflationary adjustments due to construction and timing can adjust the size of the bond slightly.

713
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:19,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna jump from a $30 million bond to a $40 million bond.

714
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:25,870
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna happen, but it might be from 30 to 31 or 32 if there are minor project changes that need to happen.

715
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:29,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So my hope is, as the mayor noted, there's a concept design.

716
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:31,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a final design.

717
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:49,225
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been statements at the Council Q&A last week from firefighters around things that they would like to see different, and I think we can vote yes on the financing mechanism, and my hope would be that as the design moves from a concept design to a final design, those project changes can happen.

718
01:07:51,649 --> 01:08:01,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one thing I want to add, there's a lot of things at the city level where we have to vote as a city council to authorize funds.

719
01:08:02,213 --> 01:08:04,534
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean that the money is immediately spent.

720
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:14,238
[SPEAKER_08]: It means that we are authorizing funds to let somebody move forward with a mechanism to

721
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:16,000
[SPEAKER_08]: start a project.

722
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't mean that you're writing a check that day.

723
01:08:18,284 --> 01:08:20,607
[SPEAKER_08]: This sort of reminds me of that process.

724
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:25,114
[SPEAKER_08]: You're authorizing us to take out a bond as the voters.

725
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:29,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So as things move and change, that process continues.

726
01:08:39,162 --> 01:08:43,926
[SPEAKER_07]: just for the sake of time, I am going to come down a little bit harder on the one or two persons.

727
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,109
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's totally okay because I think all of the information is good.

728
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:52,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we had all the time in the world, but seeing as it is 8-15, I just want to move things along.

729
01:08:52,594 --> 01:09:02,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So our next set of questions... So I actually haven't seen this question asked before.

730
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:03,864
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be

731
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:05,677
[SPEAKER_07]: doing questions through paper.

732
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:07,678
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to submit one, feel free.

733
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:11,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try to get through as most of them as possible, which is for the sake of the flow.

734
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,661
[SPEAKER_07]: We would love it if you could submit your question over there, and everyone will be available after.

735
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:26,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Not after this, that was kind of the idea of the city council chamber event last week.

736
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:34,862
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will be providing everyone with the campaign's contact information if they have additional questions.

737
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:42,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have a hard stop at 830, so we'll do our best to get through everything we possibly can.

738
01:09:42,824 --> 01:09:45,724
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate the understanding.

739
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:48,285
[SPEAKER_07]: This next question I personally haven't seen before.

740
01:09:50,197 --> 01:09:57,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can we address seniors and those on fixed income, and is there a possibility for rental assistance?

741
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:04,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So if any of my housing policy peeps have an answer to this, I'd love to hear it.

742
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:08,783
[SPEAKER_07]: You wanna go to Zach first?

743
01:10:11,264 --> 01:10:15,906
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor mentioned earlier the exemptions available through the assessor's office.

744
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:20,159
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the maximum exemptions allowed by state law.

745
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Only state representatives and state senators can increase them.

746
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:37,204
[SPEAKER_01]: The council and the mayor's office have been really intentional about maximizing, making sure that we're doing the most that the state allows us to do, and then tying our own exemptions to the state law so that if it ever goes up, Medford's go up automatically.

747
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:41,167
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some talk that seniors could be exempted.

748
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,209
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in the Proposition 2 1⁄2 law that allows that.

749
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:45,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't exist.

750
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.

751
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:50,512
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a difficult situation.

752
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:59,657
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing, as a city, the most that the state law allows us to do to try to protect all the people that the state law allows us to protect through exemptions.

753
01:11:00,057 --> 01:11:01,338
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the deferral program.

754
01:11:01,698 --> 01:11:05,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's 5% interest on the deferral program, but again,

755
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,783
[SPEAKER_01]: that is what the state law allows.

756
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:15,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we maybe could reduce that to as low as 2%, something we could look at 4%, so we're at 5 and you go down to 4, thank you.

757
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:21,873
[SPEAKER_01]: We could look at that, but we'd still have to talk to assessing, you know, and what would the impact of that be?

758
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:25,856
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the work-off program, but again, I think Anna's point

759
01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:31,436
[SPEAKER_01]: is incredibly restrictive about what it allows municipalities to do.

760
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:43,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we had a very different local tax system that could much more target and direct the impact and who's paying what taxes, but we have a flat property tax with limited exemptions, and that's what the state wants.

761
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more thoughts on that?

762
01:11:54,252 --> 01:11:57,855
[SPEAKER_07]: A very similar question, if any of you were able to answer that.

763
01:11:58,302 --> 01:12:02,831
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a question asking if free cash can be used for rental assistance.

764
01:12:02,871 --> 01:12:04,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone want to talk about that?

765
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:14,694
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a lot of supports for those who are struggling to pay rent.

766
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:20,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of that is funded through our community development block grant funding, our CPA funding.

767
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:25,996
[SPEAKER_10]: We did a round of funding to non-profits with our federal funds, APA money.

768
01:12:26,016 --> 01:12:30,497
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that is the avenue, more so than free cash.

769
01:12:32,977 --> 01:12:37,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I was able to discuss it, but a number of different funding sources.

770
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:44,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, moving on from that, I'm also seeing a handful of questions about private roads.

771
01:12:45,357 --> 01:12:48,939
[SPEAKER_07]: This was something new I learned recently myself, the idea of private road repairs.

772
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:54,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, how will private roads and tree removal be handled?

773
01:12:55,523 --> 01:13:00,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone wants to talk about that, that'd be awesome.

774
01:13:02,227 --> 01:13:08,031
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna do, I saw Kit's hand, so we'll go Kit and then Matt will come back to you.

775
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

776
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:19,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just keep this pretty brief and high level because the City Council has had a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads.

777
01:13:19,776 --> 01:13:28,258
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council has had quite a lot of meetings about the issue of private roads in particular over the past three years that I've been part of the Council.

778
01:13:28,936 --> 01:13:34,460
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have learned is that for the city to adopt what is currently a private road is an incredibly expensive process.

779
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:41,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the cost of private roads is expensive to residents, while it's still a private road.

780
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: For it to become a city on a public road, it has to be fully bought up to par, which is incredibly expensive on the order of millions, so that it can be maintained according to the status quo.

781
01:13:51,043 --> 01:14:00,269
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we all know that to improve the city's street canopy, to do that stuff removal that residents have been asking for, that city staff have been trying to do over so many years.

782
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:04,531
[SPEAKER_02]: The point I'm trying to make is that we know that these needs that they're not being filled.

783
01:14:04,551 --> 01:14:06,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to make headway on them for such a long time.

784
01:14:07,253 --> 01:14:11,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason that we're not making the headway that residents are really dying to see is because they are so expensive.

785
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:14,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that underlines the need to

786
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:24,243
[SPEAKER_02]: use this as a pivot point to try and begin making the investments that will result in visible improvements in our community.

787
01:14:24,684 --> 01:14:40,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know that there are a lot of residents who would love to at least be on the path towards progress, who would love to see a new private road, be eligible for adoption, and would like to see a more actionable plan for bringing some of those tree stumps down to earth and actually see our tree county expanding in these things.

788
01:14:40,895 --> 01:14:43,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And UC Central, they are incredibly expensive.

789
01:14:47,355 --> 01:14:58,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to add to that, so this actually came up at an event at a small house party where we were talking about these measures.

790
01:14:58,262 --> 01:15:08,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody asked me, well, if you're proposing to put $500,000 towards the GDW for road repairs, I live on a private road, how would that affect me?

791
01:15:08,769 --> 01:15:09,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea.

792
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:17,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ended up emailing Tim McGibbon, CC, the fellow who asked me, and what Tim said was that

793
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: there is no, so just by the fact, by the nature of it being private, there's no legal obligation for him to actively repair these roads.

794
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:42,665
[SPEAKER_05]: But he said that they, if, when they have capacity, they will do it anyway, just to keep the city nice, and putting a permanent road repair crew into being going will just give them,

795
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,506
[SPEAKER_05]: more capacity to do that.

796
01:15:45,526 --> 01:15:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was his perspective on that.

797
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:49,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

798
01:15:56,658 --> 01:16:01,479
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually, the law says what we can and cannot spend public funds on.

799
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:11,482
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do have a webpage that outlines this quite a bit, but anything public safety related especially, we can use public funds on private and public ways.

800
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:19,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do fill potholes, for instance, or tree branches that are in the middle of any public or private way, we'll get taken care of.

801
01:16:21,724 --> 01:16:29,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Since Tim came on board and Owen came on board, we do follow the laws as it relates to private and public ways, and it is very frustrating.

802
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:34,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

803
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:36,955
[SPEAKER_07]: This question is super quick, so I'm just going to answer it.

804
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:41,939
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there isn't a polling currently being taken for how this vote will go, but we're feeling pretty good.

805
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:46,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had actually a couple people ask about polling for this election.

806
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very expensive, so no, there isn't one being done based on our side.

807
01:16:52,082 --> 01:17:00,726
[SPEAKER_07]: There is another couple of questions that ask how many new students are enrolled in 2025 and how many teachers are retiring?

808
01:17:01,186 --> 01:17:07,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have appropriations of new students that are enrolling in 2025 and the amount of teachers retiring?

809
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:16,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Our overall school enrollment hasn't changed that much in the last handful of years.

810
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: What we are experiencing is record numbers of kindergartners coming into our schools every year.

811
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:37,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you use what they call a survival analysis that says how does that kindergartner become a first grader and a second grader and a third grader, the numbers climb over time.

812
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:44,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we do know is that two of our school buildings are absolutely busting at the seams.

813
01:17:44,734 --> 01:17:47,617
[SPEAKER_09]: The Roberts and the Brooks are busting at the seams.

814
01:17:47,677 --> 01:17:50,240
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not any more space in those buildings.

815
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:57,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we have another record kindergarten here next year, we're going to have an issue in those two buildings in particular.

816
01:17:57,467 --> 01:18:01,251
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the case in all four of our elementary school buildings and so there's some

817
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:11,064
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially expensive redistricting that we may have to do pretty urgently to deal with the realities of how the population is changing.

818
01:18:12,525 --> 01:18:22,729
[SPEAKER_09]: We also, looking forward, are looking at our population in our school system changing as we invest in our schools.

819
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,030
[SPEAKER_09]: We expect more parents to

820
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:35,367
[SPEAKER_09]: increase the number of students, both at the middle school and the high school is our prediction.

821
01:18:43,358 --> 01:18:51,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I did look at these numbers when I was doing some of the analysis and our levels are back to where they were right before the pandemic.

822
01:18:52,160 --> 01:19:08,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So when people left the school to have their needs met elsewhere, they're coming back to Medford and they're coming back with significant need based on not just the pandemic, but just general student needs.

823
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:10,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think things are going up.

824
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:23,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Our next question, we discussed this a little bit in the beginning of the panel through the remarks offered by our three panelists.

825
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:53,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for everybody, just to kind of reiterate the importance of this moment and why we're asking voters to make an investment, how do we get here and why have we not done an override before?

826
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:53,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Loaded question.

827
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:57,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very easy answer for whoever is choosing to tackle this.

828
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll take a shot at it.

829
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:02,811
[SPEAKER_09]: How did we get here?

830
01:20:04,112 --> 01:20:06,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been constrained by Prop 2.5 since 1980.

831
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:07,813
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we got here.

832
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:10,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Inflation is more than 2.5% every year.

833
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:14,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see, actually we should pass this chart around.

834
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,839
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see that Medford's new growth has been marginal since that same time.

835
01:20:19,939 --> 01:20:23,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So the two levers we have are taxation and new growth.

836
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And we haven't done any more taxation than 2.5%.

837
01:20:28,092 --> 01:20:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: and our new growth has been very minor in nature.

838
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:35,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, all of our costs are exploding.

839
01:20:35,393 --> 01:20:40,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Our healthcare, our pensions, all of those things go up in double digits.

840
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:44,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're sort of at a squeeze point and we have decisions that we have to make as a community.

841
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:56,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Why we didn't do it sooner, it takes a tremendous amount of will for elected officials to allow the city to vote in a representative way.

842
01:20:58,413 --> 01:21:02,638
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're an elected official, you have what many people think is tons of power.

843
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:05,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't personally feel that way, but lots of people do.

844
01:21:06,242 --> 01:21:08,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have a lot of decisions to make.

845
01:21:08,484 --> 01:21:10,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's two ways you can make decisions.

846
01:21:10,286 --> 01:21:15,292
[SPEAKER_09]: One is you can make decisions, and the other is you can ask the community to help you make the decisions.

847
01:21:15,332 --> 01:21:16,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is us saying to you,

848
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: we're asking you to help us make this decision.

849
01:21:20,253 --> 01:21:25,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is no more direct democracy than a ballot question in a presidential election year.

850
01:21:26,154 --> 01:21:35,056
[SPEAKER_09]: We are expecting wonderful turnout, there's a lot of energy, and we're super excited to see what this community really thinks of us.

851
01:21:37,516 --> 01:21:41,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, let's go Anna, and then I believe Kit, then Erica.

852
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:45,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say one very quick thing.

853
01:21:45,423 --> 01:21:49,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year, for the last 40 years, that we have not put this on the ballot.

854
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:53,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not allowed our community to make these decisions for themselves.

855
01:21:59,626 --> 01:22:10,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, we got here because we made decisions that filled short-term needs, that were band-aids, and we didn't look.

856
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:13,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Far ahead.

857
01:22:15,443 --> 01:22:21,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think just to add to what Jenny said, you can also just not make decisions, right?

858
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the other thing.

859
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:25,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Camps have been kicked out of the road for decades.

860
01:22:25,769 --> 01:22:26,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Some good things have happened.

861
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:30,792
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been projects that have founded the norm.

862
01:22:31,432 --> 01:22:33,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the new schools project is one of them.

863
01:22:34,614 --> 01:22:40,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But most basic maintenance, basic staffing, fixing 100

864
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:56,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Having enough staff to do the basic job of what a city needs to do has basically just not happened, and now that has created a massive debt that is coming due.

865
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:02,983
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a difficult inflection point, and it sounds like the library is closing soon.

866
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:05,885
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another thing right there.

867
01:23:06,245 --> 01:23:07,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Our library is not open on Sundays.

868
01:23:07,546 --> 01:23:08,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Most libraries are.

869
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:10,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Our library closes early on Saturdays.

870
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:17,034
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find every department, every single thing that the city does.

871
01:23:17,654 --> 01:23:24,376
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally a little less than most other places because we don't have the funds to do it.

872
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:33,659
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making decisions based on the money that's available and what we can and can't do, not necessarily what is best for students in the long term from the school side.

873
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:38,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can say really quickly, so I know where we have to go.

874
01:23:38,126 --> 01:23:41,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say just from a younger perspective, I think needs increase.

875
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:50,113
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that as we kind of continue to develop as a city, we're noticing as the school side that the needs of students are increasing individually, as a family, as a school system.

876
01:23:50,473 --> 01:23:56,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single person is needing more to be assisted to meet their needs of education success, educational equity, and the like.

877
01:23:56,896 --> 01:24:06,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really important to understand that the needs of the city 40 years ago, the needs of the city 20 years ago, or even five years ago, pre-COVID, are comparably different than they are today.

878
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:17,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that though I understand that there seems to be this understanding of how money is so drastically different than it once was, we have to understand that at least on the school side of things, the needs are so severely different now.

879
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:21,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why there isn't a new need financially, a new shift of how we can

880
01:24:22,385 --> 01:24:31,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that as someone who was recently both in university and in the school system here, I can tell you that it is incredibly important that even our school spaces are incredibly important.

881
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:44,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a population that feels though that as long as you're being taught by someone who really does care about the students and you're a student who really cares about the material, the school space and the environment you're learning in isn't nearly as important as those two core components.

882
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:54,983
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are, we do understand through statistics and through studies that the school space, the learning space is just as important as a teacher who's partly committed to the work and a student who wants to learn.

883
01:24:55,443 --> 01:25:06,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to understand that these needs are shifting, and I want us to understand that that's what's happening, that's why the money's changing, I think, as much as it has been in the past couple of years.

884
01:25:06,088 --> 01:25:06,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for your thoughts.

885
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:14,331
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a handful of questions that were given to me on Post-it Notes that they have been addressed in their reporting, so I'm going to assume that

886
01:25:14,969 --> 01:25:16,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We can all go back and find them.

887
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:21,295
[SPEAKER_07]: If for some reason you feel like your question hasn't been answered, once again, please reach out to the Steven and Besson Method.

888
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:22,496
[SPEAKER_07]: We're happy to answer.

889
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:32,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to wrap us up here, I wanted to say thank you to all of you for attending.

890
01:25:32,365 --> 01:25:34,347
Let's give a nice round of applause to just a slate of people.

891
01:25:41,195 --> 01:25:43,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for making that time.

892
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:46,658
[SPEAKER_07]: If you feel compelled by what you heard tonight, I would love to hear it.

893
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:48,160
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get involved with us.

894
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,643
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the home stretch of the election, and we need all the help we can get for people who feel really strongly about this.

895
01:25:53,303 --> 01:25:54,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your voting plan.

896
01:25:54,464 --> 01:25:56,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Early voting has started at City Hall.

897
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:59,167
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find all the dates and times and political issues on the city's website.

898
01:26:00,027 --> 01:26:00,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Text three friends.

899
01:26:01,008 --> 01:26:04,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure they have a voting plan, because civic engagement is more fun together.

900
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:05,631
[SPEAKER_07]: We do it as a community.

901
01:26:05,731 --> 01:26:06,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, democracy.

902
01:26:07,202 --> 01:26:08,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And once again, still have questions.

903
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:14,988
[SPEAKER_07]: If we didn't get to yours, if we didn't get exactly the wording right of what you wanted, please, please email us.

904
01:26:15,349 --> 01:26:17,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We wanna talk to you, we wanna hear from you.

905
01:26:18,311 --> 01:26:22,734
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also another question that what you would say to a voter that's on the fence or undecided.

906
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: You can reach out to any of us at any point in time.

907
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:34,724
[SPEAKER_07]: We spend a lot of time on the campaign trail and we're happy to share with you just some compelling things that we've discovered through our own conversations if you have friends that are on the fence.

908
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:52,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the spirit of an interesting format and something a little different for everybody, City Councilor Anne Callaghan has a little, has a little, I guess, not an interlude, an exit thing, just to play us out.

909
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:58,052
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to say once again, thank you for being here this evening.

910
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,093
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really grateful.

911
01:26:59,393 --> 01:27:04,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And without further ado, our multi-talented City Councilor Anne Callaghan.

912
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:05,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

913
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:12,044
[SPEAKER_04]: If you missed my question, I wanted a simple math fact.

914
01:27:12,364 --> 01:27:14,426
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the bottom line?

915
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:20,971
We are always available right now.

916
01:27:35,862 --> 01:27:35,922
Yes.

917
01:27:35,942 --> 01:27:36,242
Good job.

918
01:27:36,282 --> 01:27:37,223
It'll be 2.5% plus the 50.

919
01:27:37,263 --> 01:27:38,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

920
01:27:38,124 --> 01:27:38,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

921
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:38,304
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

922
01:27:38,364 --> 01:27:53,036
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

923
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: All you need is love and it's all I need
