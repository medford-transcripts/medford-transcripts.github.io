1
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:01,599
Okay, great.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,540
Welcome everyone to our meeting.

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:12,045

15
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:33,578
We have a larger than usual number of items on our agenda for this evening.

16
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,159
Many people who are waiting to be heard.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,641
So I'll do my best to help us move efficiently through the docket.

18
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:46,103
We'll start with roll call attendance of members of the board.

19
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:52,865
And so I've already introduced myself as the chair, vice chair, Jackie Furtado.

20
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:54,526
Present.

21
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:56,647
Deanna Peabody.

22
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:57,807
Present.

23
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,458
Clyce Andreessen.

24
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:00,679
Present.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Emily Hedeman.

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,681
Present.

27
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,321
George Fisher.

28
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:07,622
Present.

29
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,743
And do we have Christy?

30
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:10,423
Christy Dow.

31
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:11,784
Yes, present.

32
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:12,924
Okay, there you are.

33
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:13,524
How are you?

34
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,145
I'm good, sorry.

35
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:21,488
I'm still driving home, so I'll put my video on when I'm safe in the house.

36
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,469
Okay, good to have you with us.

37
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:25,803
Okay.

38
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:32,628
First item on the agenda tonight concerns 15 and so let's replace the request for a bond reduction.

39
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,612
Matt Roman Mr Roman of brown dog companies you're here with us tonight.

40
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,073
Hi, thank you everybody.

41
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,196
Nice to see you back.

42
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,256
Absolutely.

43
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,898
Recurring your recurring guest on the, on the videos.

44
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:58,692
Just to sort of cut to the chase for a minute, I understand that you are requesting a return of the balance of this bond.

45
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:05,556
It's an amount that's been reduced over time as your company has hit certain construction thresholds along the way.

46
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:11,219
And tonight's the night you want to have to return the balance for the remainder of that bond, is that right?

47
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,680
That's correct, yeah.

48
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,460
Okay, great.

49
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:14,721
And,

50
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:22,567
do you want to just mention, and you don't need to go into any detail, but just 30 to 60 seconds of where you're at.

51
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:22,908
Sure.

52
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:30,551
So the project is two new homes that were built to passive house standards.

53
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,672
So they are ultra energy efficient.

54
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:34,812
There's no fossil fuel.

55
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:35,933
They're all electric homes.

56
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,954
Not a lot of them being built here yet.

57
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:43,916
These were my brother and I's second and third

58
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,784
homes that we've done, we're now completing our fourth and fifth in another town.

59
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:53,827
These homes have been done for over a year and have been lived in and the people love them.

60
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:54,447
They're great.

61
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,647
They're super comfortable homes.

62
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:57,488
And the work's been done.

63
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,669
We just, it's more administratively getting everything signed off.

64
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,091
It's just, we'll sort of just dragged our feet in that regard.

65
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:11,214
But everything has been done and the engineer signed off and said everything, you know, place looks great.

66
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:11,934
We're happy with it.

67
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,752
I think that the city should be pretty happy with it.

68
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:16,734
Okay, that sounds good.

69
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:22,940
And Amanda, do we have anyone from the city or do you have a message to convey from the city for everyone's benefit?

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,720
Sure.

71
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:24,161
Yeah.

72
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:37,894
So I did discuss with the engineering division and can confirm that they performed a review of all the work done and feel that the conditions are met and that they are on board to recommend approval for the bond release.

73
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:39,945
OK, excellent.

74
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,048
Are there any comments from the board?

75
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:53,114
And if not, we can entertain a motion to allow the release of the remainder of the bond.

76
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,236
I'll make that motion.

77
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:58,258
Do we have a second?

78
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,020
Final second.

79
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,001
Excellent.

80
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,323
And let me go through the roll call then.

81
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:07,524
Jackie Furtado.

82
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:08,745
Yes.

83
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,520
Deanna Peabody.

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,560
Aye.

85
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:13,242
Klyce Andreassen.

86
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:15,744
Aye.

87
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:17,446
Kristi Dowd.

88
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:19,487
Aye.

89
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,589
Emily Hedman.

90
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,430
Aye.

91
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,611
George Fisher.

92
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:26,513
Aye.

93
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:28,615
And I'm an aye as well.

94
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:30,457
Great.

95
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:31,398
Thank you, Mr. Roman.

96
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,138
We appreciate it.

97
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,259
Congratulations.

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,160
Thank you all.

99
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,780
I appreciate it.

100
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:35,481
Have a good evening.

101
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:36,402
Thank you.

102
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:37,143
Okay.

103
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:37,563
Bye bye.

104
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:50,578
Okay, second item on the agenda tonight concerns 121 Riverside and Medford housing authority building there.

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,807
The method housing authority will be going through site plan review with us it's anticipated to occur sometime in November.

106
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:06,400
and understand that part of the site plan review process under the new ordinance is the requirement for a traffic study.

107
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:16,104
Medford Housing is before us tonight to request that we waive that full requirement.

108
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:25,629
And I just want the board to know and to assure them that the ordinance does allow us to make those sorts of waivers or accommodations

109
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,412
if we find the circumstances merit them.

110
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:37,199
So I'm not sure who would like to speak on behalf of Medford Housing Authority.

111
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,703
This is Ben Wilson.

112
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:49,550
I'm with Bargmann Hendry Archetype, our architectural firm, working with the Housing Authority on the project.

113
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,132
And on the

114
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:57,103
call here, and I apologize, my video is not working for some reason.

115
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:07,527
I got to this link sort of circumscribed through Microsoft, and I think it screwed something up.

116
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,408
So you'll have to trust me.

117
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:12,549
I'm a trustworthy face.

118
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,410
We'll give you a password tonight.

119
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,450
Use your imagination.

120
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:16,991
Okay.

121
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:22,033
So Gabe Cicerello is from the Housing Authority.

122
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:22,533
He's on

123
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:49,645
with us and Brian Ma who is working with Cambridge Housing Authority and is working as the project manager and development consultant is also on, as well as Brian, and I'm sorry here, let's see.

124
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:03,181
Brian, can you help me out here, Brian?

125
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:04,921
I couldn't find you.

126
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,582
You got a picture, okay.

127
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,483
Yeah, we're the transportation consultant on that project.

128
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:21,046
So our goal here this evening is to talk through the traffic memo

129
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:33,396
that has been submitted with our site plan application and the request for a waiver on the traffic study.

130
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:44,645
So I think that's really all I can say and add to this conversation and really should maybe either Gabe or Brian, you can just summarize it for them.

131
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:53,855
Yeah, Gabe, I don't know if you wanted to go into anything, but I could really kind of summarize what we did on the transportation side real quick, if that's okay with you.

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,164
If I could just jump in and just with the understanding we have members of the public who might be watching or following along with the proceedings tonight.

133
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:08,028
And so I would find it of interest, I think other members of the public might, maybe Mr. Secorello could address this.

134
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:16,413
And again, just in one minute, how does Medford Housing Authority, like, is it a state agency, it's a city agency?

135
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:21,316
Like just give me kind of the mission statement if you can in 60 seconds or less.

136
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:22,437
Sure.

137
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:23,778
Can I jump in too for a second?

138
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:24,809
Sorry.

139
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,570
Sure.

140
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,195
Being that this is the first time coming in front of us, I'm pretty sure.

141
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:35,639
I'd love a little synopsis of the project itself.

142
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,821
Yeah, I'd love to give that to you.

143
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:43,025
Okay, so I'm Gabe Ciccarello.

144
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:48,650
I'm the Director of Modernization and Procurement for the Medford Housing Authority.

145
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,471
So the Medford Housing Authority is an autonomous body.

146
00:09:54,151 --> 00:10:02,813
We have both federal and state public housing properties, and we also administer Section 8 vouchers.

147
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:10,115
We have about 850 public housing units and administer about 1,000 Section 8 vouchers.

148
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:15,717
We're coming before you tonight regarding the Salt and Stall project.

149
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:21,194
It is currently a 200-unit elderly disabled development.

150
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,596
We are doing a full rehab to the building.

151
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:31,979
And through the process of kind of reconfiguring the interior, we're going to be adding 22 units.

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,522
The existing unit configuration is there's 181 bedrooms and 22 bedrooms through

153
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:51,842
mixing around the unit configuration and taking up some interior common space, we're able to add 22 units to the development.

154
00:10:52,682 --> 00:11:04,169
And there's also an add alternate to increase some of the footprint for our administration office, our home base, our administration offices are within the salt and salt building at 121 Riverside Ave.

155
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:22,390
And the addition or the expansion of the office is not to really accommodate more staff, but it's just to make, to give the staff that we have there a little more space and just make it a little more workable because we're in very tight quarters there.

156
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:25,552
Okay, thank you for the overview.

157
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:33,336
Realizing that we'll go into much more detail on the overall project itself at the site plan review.

158
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,678
Could someone on your team give us a summary of

159
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:39,463
PB, David Ensign — He-Him, He-Him.

160
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:39,624
He-Him.

161
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:40,625
PB, David Ensign — He-Him.

162
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:59,456
Brian Zamocha, senior project manager at Niche.

163
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:12,540
We were retained by the proponent to basically just take a look at the traffic coming in and out and how can that be reflected in the future development.

164
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,401
So we, as traffic engineers, we take a lot of traffic data.

165
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:23,443
We had one of our employees go out and take traffic counts at the driveway during

166
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:32,644
what we define as the weekday morning and weekday evening peak hours, which is the peak times for the commuters on the roadway.

167
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:37,985
So we always want to look at what the impacts the site will have on the commuters.

168
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:45,807
So we took our counts and we came up with a trip generation for the existing development.

169
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:53,628
And then through that, we were able to come up with rates, which is trip per unit, and it came out to be about 0.25 trip per unit.

170
00:12:54,458 --> 00:13:03,522
apply that data to the additional 22 trips, and we get almost nothing, six trips in the morning, seven trips in the evening.

171
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:11,625
So we don't, this is, you know, based on our experience, this is almost negligible traffic added.

172
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:21,108
So, you know, just a full traffic study, I don't think would be warranted because all it's gonna show is you have no impact at all.

173
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:29,802
Yeah, I mean, there's a whole lot of technical mumbo jumbo in the memo that I don't really want to go into in the interest of time.

174
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,344
But the essence is, yeah, it's not going to have any traffic impacts.

175
00:13:35,905 --> 00:13:46,431
Okay, before I turn this to the board for questions, Amanda, do we have comments or city staff who would like to weigh in on this topic for us?

176
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:54,620
Yes, so I have a comment from Director of Transportation, Todd Blake, with the city.

177
00:13:55,701 --> 00:14:07,063
He reviewed the memo and waiver request, and his statement was that the memo appears to provide information to support not providing a full traffic study.

178
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:18,026
So this doesn't necessarily mean that there will be no impacts, but just that the full traffic study may not provide more info that would significantly inform

179
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,347
determining the project impacts.

180
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:30,890
So essentially saying that he would be comfortable with the memo as was already provided and does not see the need for a full traffic study.

181
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:35,032
And Mr. Ciccariello, you're

182
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,860
This is a this is a nonprofit organization so you're trying to keep your cost down is that the gist of where we're at.

183
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,561
Yes, we, as everyone knows, we just had all of our bids come in.

184
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:51,262
In the last couple weeks, we're significantly over budget.

185
00:14:51,942 --> 00:15:02,004
We're under time constraints so it's a public housing where it is crazy we have a. It's a premium to build affordable housing.

186
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:10,639
Yeah, every dollar we can save and time we can save is a huge asset.

187
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:20,267
Okay, let me turn that back unless the MHA team has more to offer.

188
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:24,050
Let me open it up to the board and see if there are any questions from board members.

189
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,950
David, this is vice chair Jackie for title.

190
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,331
Um, I wanted to go on record.

191
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,711
I'm going to recuse myself from this conversation.

192
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:38,612
Um, with, it just daunted me as, as, uh, the gentleman just referred to state funding.

193
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:46,434
I work for the executive office of policy and economic development, which DHTD is under me and public health and authorities and the state of Massachusetts are under us.

194
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,234
So I would have to recuse myself from this conversation.

195
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,975
Okay.

196
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,475
Well, thanks for bringing that to our attention.

197
00:15:53,367 --> 00:16:00,769
If it does make a difference, the SALT installed building at 120 Riverside Ave, it's a HUD development.

198
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,389
It's a federally funded development.

199
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,749
It's not under DHCD's purview.

200
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,930
I don't know if that makes a difference.

201
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,450
Just to be on the safe side.

202
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,611
Thank you.

203
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:11,731
Just to be on the safe side.

204
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,831
I understand.

205
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,732
But thank you for providing that information.

206
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:16,932
Thanks, Jackie.

207
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:18,932
Any other?

208
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:20,593
Yes, Emily, I see your hand.

209
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:21,413
Sure.

210
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:30,664
Looking at the traffic study, it looks like it was completed the week of Labor Day.

211
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:37,050
Do you think that had any impact on the traffic counts?

212
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:42,546
the week of Labor Day, not on Labor Day.

213
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,588
So traffic counts were collected Wednesday, September 7th.

214
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:50,352
If anything, one could make the argument that full traffic is restored at that time.

215
00:16:50,753 --> 00:17:01,422
And I know that we have actually, we actually saw as engineers traffic significantly increase, unfortunately, especially along the Pike, which I don't probably don't have to explain to anybody at this point.

216
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:06,626
But the point being is, yes, traffic was headed to Beijing.

217
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:07,767
Great, thank you.

218
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:09,806
Those are all the questions I have.

219
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:11,488
Thank you, Emily.

220
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:13,549
Other questions?

221
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:17,673
Okay.

222
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:35,007
If we're favorably inclined to this, we consider certainly a motion to approve the request for the acceptance of, what should it be?

223
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:43,352
It's to approve the request to not require a full traffic study for this project, for its site plan review.

224
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,693
Hi, this is Christy Dowd.

225
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:47,374
I'll make a motion.

226
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:52,916
to accept whatever you just said.

227
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,437
I'll make a motion or I'll second whatever Chris just said too.

228
00:17:58,837 --> 00:17:59,157
Okay.

229
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:01,877
We made it home, that's good.

230
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:02,637
Yes.

231
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,078
All right, excellent.

232
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:07,938
Roll call vote then.

233
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:13,239
Let's start with, oh, we can't Jackie's recuse, so we'll pass over Jackie.

234
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:14,519
Deanna.

235
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:15,700
Aye.

236
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,080
Blyson Dresen.

237
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,180
Aye.

238
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:21,388
Aye.

239
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,030
Christy Dowd.

240
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:24,011
Aye.

241
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,293
Emily Hedman.

242
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:26,194
Aye.

243
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:27,615
And George Fisher.

244
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:28,716
Aye.

245
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:30,418
I'm also an aye.

246
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,341
To the MHA team, thank you very much.

247
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,404
Appreciate your participation tonight.

248
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,386
We look forward to seeing you at the site plan interview.

249
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,568
Thank you so much for your time.

250
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:40,890
Thank you very much.

251
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:41,831
Have a good evening.

252
00:18:46,953 --> 00:19:07,261
Okay, next item on the agenda, I think we initially had listed the matters with the Tufts properties, but we're going to instead call an audible and go to the informal review that we're going to perform with 142 mystic Avenue, which is great American beer hall.

253
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:12,563
And I believe we have Brian, sir, sir, sir.

254
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:14,953
Excellent.

255
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:15,793
Nice to see you.

256
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:16,494
Nice to meet you.

257
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,055
Nice to meet you too, David.

258
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:18,456
Welcome.

259
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,918
Welcome.

260
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:30,247
Before we get started, just wanted to say we appreciate your willingness to be here and his background to the board and members of the public if they're listening.

261
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:38,614
We understand that you were going to be before us for site plan review at our meeting the last week of October.

262
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:51,797
And in an effort to just do whatever you can to sort of move the process along by the end of the month, you agreed to stop by and have one of these sort of informal sessions with us.

263
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,178
And we have seen them work with some success, I think.

264
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:03,200
And during the time I've been on the board, it usually works to our benefit and to the proponent's benefit to help move things along.

265
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,340
So we appreciate your cooperation in that regard.

266
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,781
Absolutely.

267
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:10,668
If you have any questions, feel free to jump in at any point.

268
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:14,668
I would like to just give a little background of what we're doing.

269
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,368
Yeah, why don't you get started.

270
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:19,089
I just want to make sure the board knows we're not doing a full site plan interview.

271
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:23,670
This is one of the informal ones, so we're going to give you feedback and we're going to ask questions.

272
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:31,472
There's not an official public comment period, but we'll do our best to give you good feedback and see where things go from there.

273
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,072
But we'll let you go to the floor, please.

274
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:33,972
That's great.

275
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:36,533
And so just a little bit of background about myself.

276
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,453
I've been working on

277
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:45,004
Mystic Avenue for the last 20 years started when I was in high school, part-time property manager, just painting and picking up cigarette butts.

278
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,606
And so after college, I went full-time.

279
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:54,768
And the properties I manage are 134 Mystic Ave, 142 Mystic Ave, 151, and 215.

280
00:20:55,509 --> 00:21:02,192
And so I also help out at Murray Supply, as actually my great-grandfather was Murray Matrendola's original partner at Murray Supply.

281
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:12,018
I've been on Mystic Ave for 20 years, and I love really the direction that it's going in, and I feel like this project can really help.

282
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:17,601
But right now, the site is made up of heavy automotive use.

283
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:25,967
We have an auto body shop there, we have a mechanic, we have Eastern bus with the school buses, and then we have a tow yard really for the city of Somerville.

284
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:30,310
Deep down, I always thought this was not the highest and best use for us.

285
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,833
I've been searching for a project that made sense.

286
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:43,085
And I started this in 2019 and picked up a lot of traction and COVID never happened.

287
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,868
I like to think that we'd be open by now, but it didn't.

288
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,331
And so we ended up re-upping the tenants that

289
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:50,037
we have here now.

290
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:54,181
And during that time, I've actually went out and found this great group.

291
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:59,466
And so there's five other investors, as well as myself, that are a part of this team.

292
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:08,075
And we've got Capital One backing us on a 7A loan, as well as the landlords that are committed to building the base build for this building.

293
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:08,375
And so

294
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:21,373
The concept is if you've been to a modern day brewery, a night shift, a Trillium, well, they all have tap rooms of some sort, a tap room where you can actually enjoy the beer that they're making.

295
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:26,757
Some of them are made up of a bar, some of them are made up of picnic tables inside, some have made them outdoor, indoor.

296
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:33,041
And so our idea really is to take that tap room and really just make it the star of the brewery.

297
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,450
our concept, meaning that we're not going to be brewing any of our own beer.

298
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:48,534
And we couldn't really do this about 10 years ago just because the craft beer movement hadn't happened yet in Massachusetts and New England.

299
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:52,396
And so over the last 10 years, we've seen Trillium and Night Shift really started.

300
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:57,298
But there's also great breweries out in Western Mass, like Oak Home, that are doing so well.

301
00:22:57,358 --> 00:23:04,541
And they've really become these really nice neighborhood spots where I like to think there's really something for everyone there.

302
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:10,094
you know, during the daytime, you see a lot of families go there, you know, bring the kids.

303
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:25,200
And then as you go into the night, you see, you know, younger couples or families go and then into the night, you see, you know, your, your, your late twenties, 30 year olds, you know, enjoying themselves, but and we're going to have a really nice indoor area.

304
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,381
That's going to have, it consisted of these long tables.

305
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:33,344
We're not going to actually have a prototypical bar because our motto is best brought together.

306
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:33,864
And,

307
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:45,811
If you've ever experienced Oktoberfest in Germany, it's really just long tables and people getting together and complete strangers just enjoying a beer and having fun.

308
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,633
And that's the type of atmosphere that we want to create.

309
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:53,396
We also want to have some really unique outdoor space on an outdoor patio.

310
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,417
That's going to be about 4,600 square feet.

311
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,598
So it's pretty big.

312
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:01,521
We're going to have outdoor games such as bago and all that.

313
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:06,444
The site is big enough to do all this.

314
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:10,926
It's just over 2 acres and our base building is about 20,000 square feet.

315
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:15,407
Outdoors, 4600, we're going to have a mezzanine level of.

316
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:21,189
About 1500 square feet indoor about 2600 square feet of outdoor.

317
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,890
We were hoping to attract a lot of private events.

318
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:29,346
from local Medford businesses, Somerville, Cambridge, all that.

319
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:37,471
Brian, I don't want to cut you short, but our meetings, we thrive on the visual.

320
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,952
Do you have a little slideshow for us?

321
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:40,833
You could walk us through?

322
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:41,493
Absolutely.

323
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:41,913
Yeah.

324
00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:43,354
If you want to share my screen.

325
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:45,315
Let's do it.

326
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:47,737
Okay.

327
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,418
You should have permissions, Brian.

328
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:51,699
Let me know if you have any trouble.

329
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,540
Let me do it right here.

330
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,480
Can you see this?

331
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:00,982
Yes.

332
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:02,782
Can you see my screen?

333
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:03,043
Yeah.

334
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:05,604
Okay.

335
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,926
This is the site as is right now.

336
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,126
Can you see this?

337
00:25:11,826 --> 00:25:12,027
Yes.

338
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:14,168
Okay.

339
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,550
This is night shift, but let me cut to the good stuff.

340
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,091
Well, this is a floor plan right here.

341
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,533
Here's the first floor.

342
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:37,262
As you can see, we're going to have the beer stacks and the food towards the exterior, the perimeter, and then the interior is going to be made up of tables.

343
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:41,405
Here is the outdoor patio on the left and the indoor mezzanine.

344
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:43,647
But let me get to the visuals.

345
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:52,118
So right here is our patio from the Mythic Ave view.

346
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,301
And you can also see the outdoor mezzanine that we're gonna do.

347
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:00,403
Any questions?

348
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:07,327
Yeah, board members, if you wanna jump in, cause it is informal, we can approach it that way as well.

349
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,709
I have a question.

350
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:11,210
Sure.

351
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,553
Your model, the exhibit three or exhibit C, the landscape plan,

352
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:25,727
And also the elevations and axonometric drawing that you provided as well, all make the site look flat.

353
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:32,008
So has there been any study on the existing topography?

354
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:35,829
It is relatively flat right now, but there will be.

355
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,230
Michael Giuliano, our civil engineer, is working on that.

356
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,451
Are you asking about the current condition of the site?

357
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:47,189
what we'll be building?

358
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,171
Both.

359
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:53,394
I think that we have an existing site plan as well.

360
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,756
Yeah, it's relative.

361
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:59,098
I mean, right now it's the parking lot, so it is pretty flat.

362
00:26:59,478 --> 00:27:06,904
But yeah, that will be provided full schematics when we do apply for our building permit.

363
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:11,868
So the existing site is the parking lot?

364
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:12,749
Yes.

365
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:15,511
About half of the proposed site would also be a parking lot?

366
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,147
Let me go back and show you.

367
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:35,533
Yeah, so right here is the, we bumped out the site to accommodate the buses.

368
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:40,415
So we're going to go back to the original boundary line, but this is where

369
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:52,757
It is going to go right now it's it's really it's flat and it will be a flat parking lot for where the where the where the parking is going to go for this and the bottom right hand section, there will be like a loading.

370
00:27:56,601 --> 00:28:02,607
I think what's missing from the landscape plans for me is an indication of where stormwater especially will be draining.

371
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:02,707
Yeah.

372
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,269
So yes, the lighting is indicated as well.

373
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:14,695
But what's really useful is like a photometric plan that shows, you know, how much lighting is actually being cast across the site.

374
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:19,298
Okay, how that's kind of affecting lighting off the site.

375
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:25,562
We can do a better job of providing you with some additional lighting.

376
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:32,767
But I believe Michael Giuliano's plan is to put some of the stormwater right here where the building, the current building is, that's going to be demoed.

377
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:35,828
and there's going to be a tank underneath there.

378
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:37,870
Okay.

379
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:48,399
There's a little bit of an inconsistency between the building elevation or the building elevation, I believe, which shows another building there.

380
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:53,463
Are you talking about the building that's currently there?

381
00:28:53,483 --> 00:29:01,170
I'm not sure what is represented on this drawing because I'm not very familiar with the project.

382
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,050
Okay.

383
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,012
Are you looking at exhibit B?

384
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:04,872
Correct.

385
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:05,573
Yes.

386
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:06,614
Yeah.

387
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:08,816
And exhibit B is a smaller building.

388
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:11,578
It looks to be about half the size of the building on the site.

389
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:13,799
Okay.

390
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,540
I'll take a look.

391
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,983
We were going to do a standalone retail building that we're not going to do anymore.

392
00:29:18,143 --> 00:29:23,167
We're just going to make a parking, but I don't know if I, I'll make that clear for our meeting.

393
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:31,386
Yeah, if you guys don't mind if I jump in, I believe that that was what was on the exhibit be that folks are referencing.

394
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:38,629
So it sounds like and Brian you can confirm that at this time that is not going to be pursued in this project.

395
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,271
No, no, we're not going to do that we're going to be a parking.

396
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:43,312
Thanks.

397
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:44,713
Thank you.

398
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:53,137
Is this is the project and I conform to the.

399
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,723
The open required open space for the site.

400
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:01,926
What is the required open space.

401
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:17,376
I think it's a zoning requirement, and as it wasn't listed in the permit refusal that was issued by building.

402
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:22,260
I, my assumption is that the project as proposed meets the

403
00:30:23,353 --> 00:30:23,894
requirement.

404
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:29,359
Folks, feel free to correct me if that doesn't feel like a reasonable leap.

405
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:31,001
Great.

406
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,763
So perhaps it's helpful.

407
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:35,405
Sorry, this is Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning.

408
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:45,896
We've been meeting with Mr. Zarthar for a while about this project and his intention and design that he worked with his architects was to not require any variances.

409
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,414
for this project.

410
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:58,681
So the permit refusal letter, the building department agreed that the plans that he has submitted to them, the building, the project does not actually require any variances.

411
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:04,465
So this project is being referred to the planning board for site plan review.

412
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:10,434
And this board will be the permit granting authority for this.

413
00:31:10,554 --> 00:31:18,938
It's just because of the size of the project that it has site plan review and not because it's going to either zoning board or city council.

414
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,720
Okay, Alicia, thanks for the clarification.

415
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:32,283
I guess, Brian, you just have to make sure that what you present to us is sort of the final and official one.

416
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:36,486
uh, is reflecting the actual conditions on the ground, all that kind of good stuff.

417
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:37,706
Oh, absolutely.

418
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:48,328
I had a question along those lines too, which is there's in the corner outside of your red box, there were still some buses when we looked at using the top right corner.

419
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:51,088
I get the sense that that's open space.

420
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,308
Is that the idea on the design?

421
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:55,429
Uh, let me go back.

422
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:56,369
Okay.

423
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,549
So it's going to be a parking lot.

424
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:01,990
Um, so right now it's going to go back.

425
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:07,513
The red space is the approximate boundaries of the 142 Mystic Ave.

426
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,734
And where that bump out is goes into 134 Mystic Ave.

427
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:13,054
So that's not the same property.

428
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:14,875
No, it's not the same property.

429
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,695
We're going to go back to the original property lines for this.

430
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:19,175
OK.

431
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:30,818
Brian, are you planning on implementing any sustainability initiatives into your designs or any kind of low impact

432
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:45,942
Principles into the work that you're doing like, like, solar panels and like, car charging stations that we mean are permeable papers, you know, making sure that any windows are well insulated.

433
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:50,560
Of course, you know, a million different directions.

434
00:32:50,620 --> 00:33:04,851
Yeah, we're also working with the state on on a couple of of the HVAC incentives out there to do the you know the ductless systems and so yeah that we're we're talking to everyone and

435
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:11,883
We're talking a lot of different groups right now about doing a lot of that, especially the car charging stations right now that the state's pushing.

436
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:16,884
So we are going to... Yeah, and I'd encourage you to look at low tech options as well.

437
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:34,348
So whether it's... George probably knows a bit more about this than I do, but in terms of planting trees so that they shade in the proper direction, permeable pavers over a portion of your parking lot is a fairly easy

438
00:33:34,754 --> 00:33:38,017
thing to do can also help with long-term maintenance costs.

439
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,421
Since I know you have a property management background.

440
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,822
Yeah.

441
00:33:43,363 --> 00:33:44,724
Keep the bills down.

442
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:45,465
That's the key.

443
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:46,166
Yeah.

444
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:46,526
Yeah.

445
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:50,290
Low CapEx, low OpEx, and everybody has high happiness.

446
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,852
But just thinking about it that way.

447
00:33:53,153 --> 00:33:55,935
And then I know that this property abuts

448
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,738
I forget what the road is on.

449
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:00,479
I drive by it.

450
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,220
I drive to get home.

451
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:02,781
It's not 93.

452
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:05,924
It's the one in between 93 and Mystic.

453
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:12,350
But just be mindful of that traffic as well as the realities of Mystic today.

454
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,815
Because I really do appreciate that your project and

455
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:24,554
some other projects that we've viewed on the board will help further develop Mystic into the avenue that we know it can be.

456
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:27,216
But just be mindful of its realities.

457
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,437
Absolutely.

458
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:33,221
And we own other parcels on Mystic Ave.

459
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:39,086
And so I am always looking at it to increase the value of not only that, but our neighbors as well.

460
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:45,871
And what I really like about this project is our peak hours are when Mystic Ave is really at its slowest.

461
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:54,106
Right now, like, if you go there on Thursday, Friday nights, there's not a lot of people driving down the gap because there's not a lot of destinations.

462
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,487
It's very heavy industrial 9 to 5.

463
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:03,230
And I think this project really checks a lot of boxes in terms of helping the city.

464
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:07,011
I mean, right now, there's just a tow yard for the city of Somerville.

465
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:07,671
It doesn't really have.

466
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:11,172
It doesn't really do much for now.

467
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,073
We don't need that at all.

468
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:12,533
Exactly.

469
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:26,117
Brian, just to pick up on what we almost offered to Emily there, and that is the solar electric vehicle charging.

470
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:28,537
We could talk about bikes.

471
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:38,019
We looked at another project just last month where they have a blue bike station that they're going to put in front of the new cannabis operator.

472
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:42,300
All of those things, by way of site plan review, we are definitely interested in.

473
00:35:42,820 --> 00:36:09,998
okay answers for them now that's fine if you're if you want to get your ducks in a row just know that those are things that we're definitely going to want to see on plans okay we're going to want to talk about when we get to the official meeting okay god i'll i don't have any of those answers right now but i will no problem that's why the info has been so helpful i think this is a really good introduction to the project brian thank you um i i'm i'm just going to second with

474
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,809
I just want to echo what others on the board have said.

475
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:14,289
I think, um.

476
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,292
I would encourage you to make like a full presentation of both.

477
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:31,057
The landscape and the building when you come before us, which should heavily include sustainability features for both the building and the site or.

478
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:33,138
At least highlight what you

479
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:56,569
open space was that when I look quickly at the sketch that you provided, it looks like a pretty large portion of the site would be paved.

480
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:06,853
And I think for me, obviously we wanna meet the zoning requirement, but things like parking up against the property line,

481
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:23,505
looking at things like that, like, you know, because when I see that, what I really want to see is like a planting strip so you can get trees, you know, against, you know, between you and your neighbors.

482
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,768
Take a look at that entry road.

483
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:28,810
It actually looks pretty wide to me.

484
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,675
I'm wondering if, you know, if there's a way to do a loop and sort of get rid of some asphalt and just think about

485
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:52,057
just put your thinking cap on and think about how you can reduce as much pavement as possible on the site, because I think that's just a win for both you and the interest of the town, sustainability, et cetera.

486
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:52,898
So thank you.

487
00:37:55,932 --> 00:38:00,859
Brian if I can just to echo some of what class was bringing up there.

488
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,990
Certainly would like to see more greenery in front maybe this is not a realistic image and maybe there's more, more to the plan.

489
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,513
What we're seeing in the picture it's in front of us.

490
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:29,270
Other thing to note, I'm scratching my head a little bit because I know in performance standards there is landscaping, I think landscape buffering, to pick up on again what Klaas is saying, hey we want to have some greenery between properties.

491
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:38,398
I think that's a requirement now in the new ordinance, so that's something else that we'll look at and you should look at between now and our next meeting.

492
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:47,382
And I mean, to that point, Brian, you know, I what's the right way to say this?

493
00:38:47,902 --> 00:39:01,552
I'd really love to hear from both your architect and or landscape architect on some of these things, you know, because I think they they bring a depth of knowledge that, you know, you as the overseer of everything may not have.

494
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:08,738
Is there is there like a buffer, like footwise from the you know, the

495
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,382
your neighbor that you need to have?

496
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,966
Is it grass, is it granary, is it trees?

497
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:19,628
I'm going to jump in here, Brian.

498
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:23,211
That's not our area of expertise is memorization of the code.

499
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:30,116
I think this is something that you need to work with your team on and just make sure that you're meeting those thresholds.

500
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:38,383
I think our comments will be this doesn't feel right versus this isn't lawful.

501
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,460
Okay, thank you.

502
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,401
Can I ask a question of the city?

503
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:58,714
And this may just be because I'm a newer resident, but is the long-term vision of Mystic that it's going to be like a pedestrian-focused avenue?

504
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:03,538
What's the long-term vision of Mystic?

505
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,180
Thanks, Emily.

506
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,482
I think that's a great question because

507
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:17,503
I would say, yes, we believe that there will be more and more pedestrian oriented things going on on mystic have.

508
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:34,815
We are seeing proposals for residential properties and even what we find now is that if if somebody was to build a life science building, they would want their employees to be able to walk down the road to a cafe cross the road beer hall.

509
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:35,856
Yes.

510
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:36,917
Yeah.

511
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:40,380
Actually, all their employees will want to go to the beer hall in the evening.

512
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:48,746
And we're finding more and more of the younger employees are interested in biking and walking to work, particularly biking if they're at any distance.

513
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:58,553
So the reason I ask that question is because, Brian, it looks like your monumental entrance is on the side of the building.

514
00:40:58,573 --> 00:40:58,633
Yes.

515
00:40:59,654 --> 00:41:05,118
And I also see that you have a beautiful patio directly up against, well,

516
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,981
parking lot and then patio.

517
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:16,968
I feel like there might be an opportunity to connect your building with the straight frontage of mystic again.

518
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:31,339
Not to contrast my further my previous comment of the reality is mystic today, but maybe investigate conditions where you know you can switch that monumental entrance from the side to the front.

519
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:33,160
Whether it's, you know.

520
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,222
You have two doors right here,

521
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:41,299
maybe those become the future monumental entrances.

522
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:50,204
I mean, the only issue I see with that is we don't want people being able to walk off with drinks.

523
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:53,746
We just want that confined area.

524
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:55,787
Sure.

525
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:56,648
Yeah.

526
00:41:57,508 --> 00:42:00,110
It's more of a safety issue on our end, liability.

527
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:05,513
Is that just something you could address with fencing around the perimeter of the patio?

528
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,288
Just a second, what other board members were saying.

529
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:12,810
I really agree with a lot of those comments.

530
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,636
I also just want to add, I think programmatically, it's really a really nice use of the space.

531
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:29,664
And I think it will add a lot of value to Mystic Avenue and a lot of value towards making Medford a more fun place to live.

532
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:30,865
So that's a good thing.

533
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,008
And just to add to Emily's comment as well,

534
00:42:34,695 --> 00:42:38,418
On the landscape plan, I'm not seeing a sidewalk.

535
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:42,741
And I do see on Google Maps that there are sidewalks on adjacent properties.

536
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:51,186
So I think the way that the project kind of engages the street in a way and engages pedestrians as they come by is going to be really important.

537
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:59,352
And so that kind of leads me to the front lot, which is directly adjacent to the patio, to the west of the patio.

538
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:03,555
And I feel like that's kind of a missed opportunity to

539
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:11,669
you're separating the whole pedestrian experience, what could be there from the patio with that.

540
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,531
I don't feel like that's the best use of space there.

541
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:23,537
We didn't want to put the patio right up against Mystic Ave just because there's cars and trucks daily passing.

542
00:43:23,618 --> 00:43:26,820
It's still heavy industrial, but we're hoping it changes over time.

543
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,263
But I wouldn't want to be drinking a beer and having fumes in my face.

544
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:38,628
Would you be able to buffer it with a green space, a planted green space, maybe like a park?

545
00:43:38,968 --> 00:43:44,411
The parking is so valuable.

546
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:47,993
Some of the complaints from the neighbors are, are we going to have enough parking here?

547
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:50,214
And we have 126 spaces.

548
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:54,176
We think we have plenty, but we think the parking is so valuable here.

549
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:58,918
Then a park that would just be open to the public.

550
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:01,879
I don't think that's feasible.

551
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:04,360
What is the parking requirement?

552
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:15,328
I don't think there's, I know we meet it, but I don't think the parking requirement is a lot with the Medford guidelines.

553
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:20,852
I know there's restaurants on Main Street in Mystic Ad that don't have any parking, but.

554
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:29,498
I mean, as an assembly use, I think, you know, in a retail use, it must,

555
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,680
the parking requirement must be plenty.

556
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:41,403
I just, you know, again, for next time, but I'd be interested in knowing where you are versus what the zoning requires.

557
00:44:41,863 --> 00:44:58,570
You know, I mean, again, this is a, you know, we're just thinking about open space and all that, you know, like this rendering, you know, we've had conversations like this a lot in this board in the past.

558
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,022
You know, I think I would urge you to be, actually, can you go back to that image?

559
00:45:07,283 --> 00:45:27,892
I would urge you to think really carefully about the exhibits you show because, you know, when you're presenting an image of a building, you know, I think in your mind it looks good, but there are certain images that show things to us that,

560
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:29,368
that are striking.

561
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:31,909
And I can just make an example out of this one.

562
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,331
The lack of texture on the building.

563
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:35,432
Is it a stucco building?

564
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:36,372
Is it a metal building?

565
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:37,913
How are you doing that?

566
00:45:38,594 --> 00:45:41,015
It seems to lack some definition in that way.

567
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:47,140
You have an entry there, which doesn't seem to have a canopy and really doesn't really mark the presence well.

568
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,562
That crosswalk is great, but where's it going?

569
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:54,104
It's going to a grass strip.

570
00:45:55,245 --> 00:45:58,187
These are all just little things that I like, just be careful when you're

571
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:18,986
presenting and showing these things because sometimes you're going to make more trouble than, you know, and that's sort of why I thought it would be important for you to have your designers involved in the next conversation so they could talk through some of the bigger ideas here and why things sort of ended up the way they did.

572
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:20,207
Okay.

573
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:25,431
The lack of windows on the ground floor, which looking at your program, I understand,

574
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,203
But it does make it look kind of like a hulking mass of a building.

575
00:46:30,883 --> 00:46:45,861
I think there could be an opportunity here, whether it's through public art or something to break up the mass visually, you know, kind of hint at what's what you know what awesomeness is inside.

576
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:45,941
Yep.

577
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:52,386
I was curious, Brian, were you thinking of more windows than this?

578
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:58,868
I just kind of use that wants to draw you in by way of seeing the fun that's happening inside.

579
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:00,288
Yeah.

580
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:06,770
So the fun inside is really in the interior of the space while the, I'll go back to the floor plan.

581
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:17,714
So if you look at the floor plan here, the interior is really what drives the space.

582
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:18,014
And so,

583
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:21,731
the exterior is going to be the food, the beer stalls.

584
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:34,001
There's really not a huge opportunity for windows along the sides, but where the patio is, absolutely, we're going to have as much windows as we can there on both floors.

585
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:41,847
But we will have windows on almost like the second level above the beer stacks.

586
00:47:43,188 --> 00:47:45,490
But if you're sitting inside, you're not going to be like,

587
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:48,500
looking through a beer stack out the window, if you know what I mean.

588
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,542
Everything is around the perimeter, so all the seating is in the interior.

589
00:47:52,562 --> 00:47:55,544
OK, got it.

590
00:47:55,824 --> 00:48:03,049
I'm thinking of, what is it, Remnant Brewing in Somerville in Beaumarket.

591
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:08,873
And you can see into, I know that that's a production facility, so it is slightly different.

592
00:48:08,913 --> 00:48:08,993
Yeah.

593
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:15,887
And if you're bringing up the night shift view, I know that one very well as well.

594
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:28,551
Maybe it would be interesting to see into that, because this corner that we're looking at behind the couple, I think they're taking a selfie.

595
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:40,174
That's food A, sometimes they use retail A. You could have some fenestration that gives an idea of what's in there.

596
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,444
Oh, on the exterior, you mean?

597
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:43,884
Yeah.

598
00:48:44,204 --> 00:48:45,204
Okay, yeah, yeah.

599
00:48:45,745 --> 00:48:47,005
We're open to that, absolutely.

600
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,646
Yeah, we're all talking about windows on the outside.

601
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:52,107
Oh, okay, I see, okay.

602
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,467
Yeah, yeah, we can, windows on the outside.

603
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:59,029
Windows, public art, just some way to break up the- I get it, yeah.

604
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:02,150
The mass of the building, the volume of the building.

605
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:05,631
Make it more human scale.

606
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:07,912
Okay, yeah, I totally understand that.

607
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,260
Brian, do you have an elevator in there to get to the mezzanine?

608
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:16,820
We do.

609
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,180
We do.

610
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,520
Yes.

611
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:18,861
Interesting.

612
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,442
Emily already mentioned, but there's no production planned on-site, right?

613
00:49:22,482 --> 00:49:25,703
These are going to be kegs and bottles that are brought in from off-site?

614
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:26,823
Absolutely, yeah.

615
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,123
We're going to have two food options as well.

616
00:49:29,324 --> 00:49:34,885
Snappy Patties is going to have a burger, one of the food options.

617
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:35,745
The other one's going to be pizza.

618
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:38,506
It's like rotating pop-ups?

619
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:40,672
No, no, it's going to be permanent.

620
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:44,394
So snappy patties, yeah, will be permanent as well as the pizza.

621
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:49,656
And then we're going to have for the outdoor, we're going to have some food trucks come in and service the outdoor.

622
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,216
But so that will be obviously rotating.

623
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:53,877
But yeah, where would those go?

624
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:55,318
Right.

625
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:59,599
We can see where these parking spaces are.

626
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,480
So right here.

627
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,862
That's a good use of that parking lot space.

628
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:06,762
Thank you.

629
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,823
maybe mentioning programming like that would be beneficial.

630
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:15,524
Okay.

631
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:21,047
Okay, Brian, I think we've given you a bunch of homework.

632
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:23,509
Yeah, just overall thoughts.

633
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,671
I mean, do you guys like this for the site?

634
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:29,373
Yes.

635
00:50:30,214 --> 00:50:32,575
Okay.

636
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:39,200
I can personally say that I think this is the kind of thing that Medford is

637
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:43,220
dying for, so I think it's exciting.

638
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,324
The area is, it seems like the perfect use for this area.

639
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:52,306
We're also looking at other projects in the vicinity.

640
00:50:52,326 --> 00:51:00,571
It'll be a one-stop shop for entertainment on Mystic Ave, but this will be great.

641
00:51:01,452 --> 00:51:06,135
Again, I encourage you to just keep going and thinking about

642
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:27,257
the design and I think a lot of the ideas about windows are also pretty important, you know, can only help you because the more people drive by and see into your building and see all the people having fun, the more they're gonna make that right turn and go in, you know, so, yeah.

643
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:34,162
I like it, this is very creative and I commend your commitment to the site.

644
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:35,403
Thank you.

645
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:36,904
And the corridor, so thank you.

646
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:54,234
Yeah, Brian, it seems like a really good project you know what this board tries to do at least in my, in my words, is to try to help these projects, you know it's it's community development board we're not here to obstruct projects we're here to try to improve them frankly.

647
00:51:55,234 --> 00:52:02,079
And so the feedback that you're getting from all of us tonight is is intended to try to just try to help your project be better.

648
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:12,146
It's going to only add value to you if you make it that much more attractive if you listen to some of the feedback from folks we have a great board with really interesting perspectives and folks really

649
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:13,807
You know, have something to add.

650
00:52:14,647 --> 00:52:37,683
And we can describe this better than I can but sort of we were we represent the voice of kind of the community, as it as it interfaces with the built environment so we want to make sure that this thing's going to look nice and people are going to really like it and it's a good reflection on the city which is all really just saying good reflection on YouTube.

651
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:38,824
Yeah.

652
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:43,446
But the visuals are the most important thing for us.

653
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:45,927
And we've got to see the green space.

654
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:46,908
We've got to see the trees.

655
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:47,988
We've got to see the buffers.

656
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:49,709
We've got to see what your vision is on.

657
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:52,450
If it's a big wall, where's the mural?

658
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,331
Where's the detail?

659
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:55,132
We really want to see that stuff.

660
00:52:55,272 --> 00:53:05,717
I know we only have a couple of weeks until our next meeting, but I do feel like there's, unless you have folks who are ready to jump on it, you definitely have some work to do to kind of get it to where

661
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:11,142
Um, we could, we could approve it and we can help you further refine it.

662
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,425
So, I just want to add 1 thing our.

663
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:18,829
Our small business loan is going to be contingent on us.

664
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,234
Like, getting through this meeting on the 26th, if we don't.

665
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:28,379
Get through it, then this meeting, then if we don't get past, then we're not going to qualify as.

666
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:36,760
the landlords are going to just exercise the options with the tow yard and the bus yard, and it's going to remain that way.

667
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,763
So I know I have some work to do, but that is a contingency for our small business loan.

668
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:50,008
Brian, it might make sense for you to set up a time to come in.

669
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:58,292
I think you've been talking with Vic, but talk with Amanda and possibly myself and go through some of our performance standards.

670
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:06,538
talk offline soon to go through some of this stuff too.

671
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:10,859
We can step through some of the details and requirements.

672
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:22,402
Can I also ask that, and City please correct me if I'm overstepping, but outline how many jobs are present on the site today, whether it's the tow yard,

673
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:31,613
I'm still a little unclear on, you know, what other buildings are being demolished, and then how many jobs would be present on this site.

674
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:36,535
Kitchen, you know, wheat staff, whoever.

675
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:40,397
I think that would be really useful information to have as well.

676
00:54:41,937 --> 00:54:42,718
Oh, I can prepare that.

677
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,238
I think you're going to come up on top too.

678
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:45,359
What's that?

679
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:48,469
I said, I think we're going to like the numbers that you show.

680
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,030
Yeah.

681
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:56,812
I guarantee it's double and it's going to be a lot better paying jobs than what's there now, but I I'll have now all that information for you.

682
00:54:57,412 --> 00:54:57,832
Wonderful.

683
00:54:57,852 --> 00:54:58,433
Thank you, Brian.

684
00:54:59,353 --> 00:55:01,274
Thank you for letting me jump in, David.

685
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:02,234
Absolutely.

686
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:03,795
Any other comments?

687
00:55:03,835 --> 00:55:13,518
Otherwise, I'd like to thank Brian for his time and and we look forward to seeing you again soon and helping you get this project off the ground here in Medford.

688
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:14,279
Awesome.

689
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,679
Thank you.

690
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:15,259
Thanks, David.

691
00:55:16,228 --> 00:55:16,528
Thank you.

692
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:17,209
Thank you, board.

693
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:25,514
Oh, OK.

694
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:25,934
Back to me.

695
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:28,856
All right.

696
00:55:30,196 --> 00:55:35,319
Our next item, well, Amanda, what do you think?

697
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,741
Are the folks from the Tufts team ready for us?

698
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:49,897
Yeah, so I guess perhaps I'll ask Adam Dash and others from the team from Tufts.

699
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:58,182
Would you like to go ahead now or should we push another item in front of these?

700
00:55:59,783 --> 00:56:03,086
This is Adam Dash from the, sorry.

701
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,828
I'm having some issues with connectivity here.

702
00:56:08,693 --> 00:56:12,275
Hi, this is Adam Dash from representing Tufts.

703
00:56:12,295 --> 00:56:12,755
Can you hear me?

704
00:56:13,675 --> 00:56:14,255
Yeah.

705
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:14,456
Yeah.

706
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:16,496
If you had another item, that would be great.

707
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:19,217
So I can sort of fix this connectivity problem if I could.

708
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:21,558
Okay, we can do that.

709
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,721
All right, then that leads us to our minutes.

710
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:32,203
And we have four sets of minutes.

711
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:38,933
that we are looking to approve tonight if acceptable to the board members.

712
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:48,216
Let me ask generally, I'd like to try to do this in a streamlined manner if I can do that as much as Attorney Dash might want me to take my time doing this.

713
00:56:49,356 --> 00:57:02,820
And that is to ask if any board members have specific comments about any of the four that they'd like to discuss before we start thinking about how we might go about an approval process.

714
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,920
Would anyone like to raise anything for discussion on these four sets of minutes?

715
00:57:14,442 --> 00:57:15,083
Okay, excellent.

716
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:21,546
So my thought was we have four of us who were at all four of the meetings.

717
00:57:22,813 --> 00:57:35,463
So my suggestion was going to be if Jackie or Deanna or Christie would like to make a motion to approve all four, and then someone else in that group could second it.

718
00:57:36,063 --> 00:57:38,625
And then when you go to the roll call and I kind of help you.

719
00:57:39,286 --> 00:57:42,228
We work through the roll call so we don't all have to say it four times.

720
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:57,055
So if there's a motion out there to approve the minutes from board meetings from June 9th, June 22nd, August 18th, and September 8th.

721
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:03,079
I will give them the motion.

722
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:08,022
I make a motion to approve the board meetings from June 9th, 22, June 22nd, 22, August 18th, 22, and 9, 8, 22.

723
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:15,874
Excellent.

724
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,957
And do we have a second for that motion from our select group?

725
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:20,578
I'll second that.

726
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:21,999
Okay, excellent.

727
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,283
So let me do this as I go through the roll call.

728
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:30,207
I'm going to, do we have unanimity?

729
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:31,369
No, we don't have.

730
00:58:33,571 --> 00:58:38,776
Okay, let me, I'll go through the roll call and then we'll see how many are saying yes or no to.

731
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,953
OK, so we're going to start with our vice chair, Jackie Furtado.

732
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:48,774
We're going to ask you a yes or no on all four.

733
00:58:49,774 --> 00:58:50,054
Yes.

734
00:58:50,754 --> 00:58:52,375
OK, we'll take that as a yes for all four.

735
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:56,015
Deanna Peabody, yes or no on all four?

736
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:57,816
Yes to all four.

737
00:58:58,656 --> 00:58:59,256
Kristi Dowd?

738
00:59:00,216 --> 00:59:01,097
Yes to all four.

739
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:02,697
OK, excellent.

740
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:10,767
Now let me ask for Kweiss, yes or no for June 9, June 22, and August 18.

741
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:12,428
Yes.

742
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:13,788
Excellent.

743
00:59:17,369 --> 00:59:24,451
And I have to ask Emily how she feels about the minutes for August 18, 2022.

744
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:29,183
I wholeheartedly approve and say yes.

745
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:30,204
Okay, excellent.

746
00:59:30,524 --> 00:59:34,188
So I am four thumbs up for the four minutes.

747
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:36,130
Amanda, how'd we do?

748
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:38,773
All approved?

749
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:43,177
I think, are there any minutes that require George's approval?

750
00:59:44,238 --> 00:59:45,299
I was there on September 8th.

751
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,381
So I say yes to that one.

752
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:48,182
Great.

753
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:49,263
Okay, excellent.

754
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,243
Then I think we're good.

755
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:54,645
I thought you were an informal observer at that meeting.

756
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:55,686
So my apologies.

757
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,147
Oh, that's true.

758
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:57,567
Right.

759
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:02,912
Either way, it's good to have your A. All right.

760
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:05,895
Amanda, I think we've completed that item and we're ready for Tufts.

761
01:00:08,922 --> 01:00:24,305
Great, yeah, so I welcome Adam, as well as, let me pull up my notes, I apologize, other team members, Rocco, Dorico, and Jerry, Frank, and anyone else from the Tufts team.

762
01:00:25,165 --> 01:00:30,106
I think first on our agenda was two to four Capon Street.

763
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,406
That's right, yes.

764
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:34,267
I believe I do need to read the notice.

765
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:35,567
Yes, apologies.

766
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,812
So let me get that formality out of the way and we're going to start with caping right.

767
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:43,775
Okay.

768
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:48,900
So we're conducting a meeting tonight.

769
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:59,030
Relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Walnut Hill properties core to demolish a non conforming for family dwelling.

770
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:08,252
and construct a new four-unit dormitory, allowed use with special permit per city council, at 2-4 Capen Street in Medford.

771
01:01:08,992 --> 01:01:16,557
Project is subject to a site plan review special permit as per our city zoning ordinance.

772
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:22,341
And it requires approval from the Community Development Board for Dover amendment uses.

773
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:27,304
Therefore, site plan review approval shall be required from the Community Development Board.

774
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:37,704
Okay, so I wanted to say just as background before we turn it over to the proponent that this is a Dover Amendment use.

775
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:47,787
We do now under our new zoning have a section 11.8 that addresses the Dover Amendment uses, which include educational uses.

776
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:55,009
As we know, it's religious uses, childcare facilities, solar energy systems, and some other exceptions that are there.

777
01:01:56,149 --> 01:02:07,278
And as a result of that, just for everyone's background, public included, these uses are given a little bit of deferential treatment under zoning.

778
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:12,683
So we are conducting site plan review.

779
01:02:14,384 --> 01:02:15,725
We're offering the final decision.

780
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:18,828
So this decision is not going to ZBA or city council.

781
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,962
And we're really limited to either an approval or an approval with conditions to the site plan.

782
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:34,887
We're literally under the ordinance not allowed to decline or reject the application unless they have failed to provide the information which they did not do.

783
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:39,268
So that is by way of background for everybody.

784
01:02:40,028 --> 01:02:46,389
So if attorney Dash, you want to start on things and realizing that we have two to four caping to talk about.

785
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:50,290
And then immediately afterwards, we're going to talk about 50 Winthrop street.

786
01:02:51,051 --> 01:03:04,774
So just to be fair, you know, if you inevitably, you're going to touch on number two, when you talk about number one, a little bit, maybe we can abbreviate number two, if you wrap some things up here in this first discussion, but we'll work that out as we go.

787
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:05,754
If you want to.

788
01:03:06,535 --> 01:03:09,741
If you want to, you work that as you like, is what I want to say.

789
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:12,218
Much appreciated, Mr. Chair.

790
01:03:12,338 --> 01:03:22,203
Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville and Davis Square, representing Walnut Hill Properties Corporation, which is a wholly owned affiliate of Tufts and is the owner and applicant of 224 Capon Street.

791
01:03:22,243 --> 01:03:24,544
I will address just 224 Capon in this instance.

792
01:03:25,124 --> 01:03:32,108
I'll address Winthrop when you open that matter, although much of what I say is background, we can probably skip in the Winthrop part, because it's just going to be duplicative.

793
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:33,648
They're very similar in many ways.

794
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,450
With us is Rocco DiRico from Tufts University.

795
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,071
I believe Chris Hogan may be here as well, but I don't know that he's presenting.

796
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:42,271
We'll see if we up there is Chris.

797
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:44,092
Jerry Frank from BFE Architects is here.

798
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:47,672
I see him in his conference room and he's going to be showing some slides.

799
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:52,493
So let me just give you some background because this is a little bit of an oddball.

800
01:03:52,973 --> 01:03:55,154
I know new situation with the new zoning.

801
01:03:55,874 --> 01:04:04,516
So, as I said, that we're seeking a site plan approval of a Dover amendment use and the owner is the owner and occupant in order to demolish an existing structure.

802
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:10,543
and construct a new structure for Tufts University student housing and residence director housing in the GR zoning district.

803
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:13,386
You want to put up slide two, Jerry?

804
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,113
So the project is in the Coho district.

805
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:20,595
Yes, I'm sorry, Alicia.

806
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:22,683
We don't see any slides.

807
01:04:23,544 --> 01:04:25,664
Yeah, neither do I. Yeah, I apologize.

808
01:04:25,784 --> 01:04:30,986
I actually can't find Jerry on the participants list, and I'm wondering if they're under a different name.

809
01:04:31,006 --> 01:04:32,686
They're under BFE Architects.

810
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:34,647
Yeah, BFE Architects.

811
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:35,327
Sure thing.

812
01:04:35,407 --> 01:04:35,907
Thank you.

813
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:39,648
So I will make you co-host, and you should be set now.

814
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,790
No, I got to do it this way.

815
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:49,773
Can everybody see this?

816
01:04:50,313 --> 01:04:50,994
You're in business.

817
01:04:51,474 --> 01:04:51,734
Thank you.

818
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,795
Can you put it on slide two?

819
01:04:53,175 --> 01:04:53,716
There we go.

820
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:58,779
So that and the dotted red line is what we call the coho area, you know, the community housing area.

821
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:04,983
And this was a commitment from Tufts University to the city for projects that they do in this area, such as these.

822
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:17,473
And there are a series of items that are requirements for coho project, and you can see some of them are there on the screen, the toughs will continue to pay taxes on the properties that students will not be required.

823
01:05:17,893 --> 01:05:23,318
What's our will be required to park on campus, they will not be parking in these properties and that is part of the relief we're seeking.

824
01:05:24,035 --> 01:05:33,100
other properties will not be used for fraternities or sororities, that each building will have a graduate resident director, that new lighting security features and bike racks will be there.

825
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:39,383
And then there are other items such as occupants will be limited to one student per bedroom and each unit will have a kitchen and a living room.

826
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:47,807
And it'll be fire protection and fire alarm systems, accessible units and shared amenities and bike racks will be installed and such.

827
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,880
There's more listed in the application.

828
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,241
I won't go through the entire list.

829
01:05:52,742 --> 01:06:02,931
So this existing structure that's there is an extreme disrepair, and we'll go through this, is a pre-existing non-conforming structure and is not handicap accessible and is not energy efficient.

830
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:07,335
The new structure will be in good repair, handicap accessible, and energy efficient.

831
01:06:07,636 --> 01:06:08,737
And again, we'll go into that.

832
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:24,269
The Medford Historic Commission heard this matter on July 11, 2022 on this project, under the auspices of the demo delay ordinance, and they found this existing structure CAPEN to not be significant, such that there was no demo delay imposed.

833
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,550
clearing it for demolition.

834
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:35,658
Before I have Jerry Frank from BFE Architects walk through the project details, I do want to go over the new zoning requirements for this Dover amendment use just real quick.

835
01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:41,843
For section 11.8.3, it says that the Community Development Board's reviews are limited to two things.

836
01:06:42,383 --> 01:06:46,907
One, whether the use qualifies for Dover protection and clearly under the law student housing does.

837
01:06:47,467 --> 01:06:55,554
And two, what reasonable regulations can be imposed for bulk height, yard size, lot area, setbacks, open space, parking, and building coverage.

838
01:06:56,435 --> 01:07:05,522
So with that in mind, I will sort of wrap up and sort of flesh this out a little bit more, but I think, Jerry, if you can walk the board through the next bunch of slides, that would be great.

839
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:08,084
Sure, happy to do.

840
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:15,891
Before we leave this slide, first, I'm going to introduce my colleague and associate, Arthur Love, who is making sure that I keep

841
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:19,833
some competence, technologically speaking, on here.

842
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:29,456
Just to give you a little, in case the key is a little too small, the dark blue are the properties we're talking about.

843
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:35,938
The lighter blues across the street are the Coho projects that have been completed.

844
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:43,900
So we're, again, within the same neighborhood, basically, as has been approved by the Coho Area Plan.

845
01:07:47,642 --> 01:08:03,950
What we have here on this drawing here is in the red is the existing structure that's been on site, the two-family house, and the blue is the proposed new building on it.

846
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:16,816
The existing structure goes into the setback limits that are kind of, and we took great care to make sure that our building

847
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:20,554
does conform within the setbacks of what we're talking about.

848
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:39,808
Adam touched upon something, this is a project and actually both projects where there are goals that the university had laid out to us, which are very much in concert with what the city of Medford has done when we have met with them, have talked about with this project.

849
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:45,913
And one of them was the whole issue of housing, of creating housing that was

850
01:08:47,234 --> 01:08:51,917
It's such a premium to bring that in as close to being on campus as one could get.

851
01:08:53,258 --> 01:09:07,928
Accessibility, and I'll point, just as you can see here, the grading, it's a tough site, so we've really been working very hard to bring the grade levels down so that we have an accessible building that can come in.

852
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:12,011
Currently, you cannot access the building that's on site.

853
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,362
The third element, which was so critical, is sustainability.

854
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:22,945
Tufts, as I'm sure you're all aware, has a mandate to become carbon neutral.

855
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:28,168
And this is one of the first projects that's really working in that endeavor to do that.

856
01:09:28,268 --> 01:09:36,652
So we are working, going on the guidelines or following, very aware of exceeding the Stretch Energy Code.

857
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:38,642
to the passive house standards.

858
01:09:39,123 --> 01:09:53,627
We may not be going for certification of it, but triple pane windows, very incredible amounts of insulation, both for the entire envelope walls and roof are really being implemented here.

859
01:09:55,287 --> 01:09:58,668
And the last one was really integrity.

860
01:09:59,669 --> 01:10:03,630
We began this project, well, it's a year and a half ago,

861
01:10:04,818 --> 01:10:07,059
to really study what the two buildings were like.

862
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:29,042
And we found that the building here had real, there were enough code violations, you know, to fill a book in terms of structural members that could not support proper roof loads in this day and age, walls that, and the foundations that were totally porous.

863
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,963
And you just, we just really needed to,

864
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:37,782
do major repairs to the whole project, which is one of the reasons that this has gone new.

865
01:10:37,802 --> 01:10:41,365
Next slide.

866
01:10:41,545 --> 01:10:46,188
Just the view of the site plan that we've talked about in here.

867
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:51,931
As Adam pointed out, there will be no parking on this site.

868
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:54,973
There will be an area for loading, unloading.

869
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:57,575
You can see that we do have bike racks.

870
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:00,457
We are planning on doing some,

871
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,598
very nice planting in and around the building.

872
01:11:03,938 --> 01:11:10,563
But again, we have also talked about the pavers, the permeable pavers.

873
01:11:11,003 --> 01:11:21,131
We are really striving and taking the whole sustainability aspect incredibly seriously, which is where we should be in this day and age.

874
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:30,798
We are containing trash in the areas that will be secured to that, and obviously new lighting and all of the things that are conforming to what the

875
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:36,009
coho area plan was to really dictate to us.

876
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:48,813
There is a garage that sort of a drive up almost like carport area that's being demolished in favor of that drive up, drop off and entry area that takes you to the main entrance of the building.

877
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:52,634
Next slide, please.

878
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:59,656
Just as on the top left-hand corner is the existing structure that's on site at 24 Capon.

879
01:12:01,357 --> 01:12:03,998
and you can see there's no accessibility to it.

880
01:12:04,518 --> 01:12:13,503
So what we've done with our building, again, we're working hard with the notion of keeping something that is consistent with the neighborhood.

881
01:12:13,523 --> 01:12:26,229
I mean, especially across the street with the Coho buildings that were built a few years ago, and as well as, you know, just allowing a way to really access it and accommodate persons with special needs.

882
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,483
The, this is the view on Winthrop street coming in through their garage.

883
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:40,628
Well, as you can see that it's a very simple drive up and be able to enter into the building.

884
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:46,273
Again, triple pane windows is what we're looking at.

885
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:51,037
And, you know, actually quite thick walls of insulation.

886
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:54,280
Excellent.

887
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:54,800
That's it.

888
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:55,741
That's it.

889
01:12:56,561 --> 01:12:58,043
Oh, I think the,

890
01:12:59,153 --> 01:13:15,740
One of the big things that we've had in terms, in addition to striving to respect the setbacks area is we've improved the height of the existing capon structure is taller than what we're proposing in our project here.

891
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:26,065
Even with the revised structural members and added insulation that we're putting in there to conform to the high sustainability requirements.

892
01:13:28,712 --> 01:13:33,075
And I think that's kind of what I have.

893
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:38,038
Obviously, we can respond to questions or comments that you have.

894
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:41,880
We do appreciate all the input that the city has given us thus far.

895
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:44,262
It is very helpful.

896
01:13:44,282 --> 01:13:52,627
And again, we are feeling very much that the goals that have been established by TOPS are very much in concert with what the city is looking for.

897
01:13:54,107 --> 01:13:54,427
Thank you.

898
01:13:55,388 --> 01:13:55,949
Thank you, Jerry.

899
01:13:55,969 --> 01:13:56,789
This is Adam Dasch again.

900
01:13:56,809 --> 01:14:00,112
I just want to go through the sort of nuts and bolts here while we're doing this.

901
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:04,495
I'm just going to let you know we did have a community meeting on these projects back in June.

902
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,556
Not required to, but we did.

903
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:19,286
Regarding the second inquiry by the Community Development Board under the zoning ordinance, this project reduces the number of existing non-conformities and will now comply regarding front and side setback, where it currently does not.

904
01:14:20,475 --> 01:14:24,736
The lot area, lot width, and lot depth are existing nonconformities.

905
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:27,257
Obviously, those are not changing because the lot is the lot.

906
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:28,237
I can't change that.

907
01:14:28,337 --> 01:14:29,217
So it is what it is.

908
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:35,519
The building height is nonconforming currently and will remain nonconforming.

909
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:37,859
However, we are reducing it by one foot.

910
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:41,580
So it will be 39 feet and a requirement of 35 feet.

911
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:48,462
So we would say it's not much of a violation and it's actually lesser of a violation than is current.

912
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:49,922
It'll stay the three stories.

913
01:14:51,143 --> 01:15:02,751
The parking nonconformity will be created in order for Tufts to meet the COHO requirements of removing existing parking, replacing with a drop off space and that the students there would not be allowed to park on site.

914
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:08,475
So that's the sort of a place where the zoning and the COHO rules sort of butt heads a little bit.

915
01:15:09,396 --> 01:15:16,301
But seeking relief we feel under the circumstances is appropriate and the bike spaces are being added as is the COHO requirement.

916
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:21,638
To offset this and that's going to be three bike racks of four bikes each so that's pretty pretty significant.

917
01:15:23,021 --> 01:15:26,467
The co host students will be parking on campus, as I said, not at this property.

918
01:15:27,327 --> 01:15:30,028
The proposed open space nonconformity is very small.

919
01:15:30,228 --> 01:15:33,889
It's 35.3% lot cover with a 30% requirement.

920
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:41,391
So we would say this is basically 424.4 square feet, which is pretty small building footprint differential.

921
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:49,394
And this is needed to carry out the Dover use by providing those required coho things such as the bedroom count that we need to do the dorm plus

922
01:15:50,077 --> 01:16:02,041
To meet the COHO requirements of the interior layout and amenities, the one student per bedroom, the kitchen and living room per unit, the residence director suite, the accessibility, all of that sort of takes up floor space with ramps and such.

923
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:08,843
So to do that, we ended up with 424.4 square feet over, but that's again, we would state de minimis.

924
01:16:09,843 --> 01:16:23,579
So in conclusion, an applicant would seek the site plan review to remove a decrepit unsafe structure and replace it with an efficient, accessible and safe one, which meets the Tufts Coho commitments to the city and brings more sustainability.

925
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:28,444
So we think this is a win all around and we hope that you would support it.

926
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:29,225
Thank you.

927
01:16:30,557 --> 01:16:31,177
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

928
01:16:31,197 --> 01:16:31,577
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

929
01:16:31,597 --> 01:16:32,057
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

930
01:16:32,097 --> 01:16:32,858
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

931
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:33,998
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

932
01:16:58,413 --> 01:16:59,354
Okay, fair enough.

933
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:02,095
Any initial board questions?

934
01:17:02,275 --> 01:17:10,919
If not, we'll go, or when we're done with that, we'll go to open it up to the public and then we'll come back for further discussion, Q&A and deliberation as a board.

935
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:15,342
Anyone want to speak here as an initial matter?

936
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:18,943
I'll speak.

937
01:17:19,584 --> 01:17:19,884
George.

938
01:17:20,924 --> 01:17:25,547
Yes, looking at plan C2, also visible

939
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:43,593
just in this elevation, the proposed porous paved – sorry, quite a mouthful – proposed porous paved drop-off area, in my experience with porous pavements, sometimes they require maintenance and that causes them to fail.

940
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:49,516
So, was there any consideration for using an open-cell paver instead?

941
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:52,277
It might require less maintenance as well?

942
01:17:54,070 --> 01:18:00,155
Yeah, and I think we talked about it as sort of was should probably be a better word.

943
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,776
I said, of course, about the permeable.

944
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:06,439
There are many options and as we're getting going and

945
01:18:08,064 --> 01:18:14,806
finalizing the bidding and getting samples of that, that is something that we certainly would look at for maintenance.

946
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:27,709
We live this all the time on projects is that you need to have something that holds up and still should do this job for shedding water, sort of back into the ground.

947
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,030
Great.

948
01:18:32,931 --> 01:18:33,991
That was my only comment, thank you.

949
01:18:36,117 --> 01:18:38,078
Okay, any other initial questions?

950
01:18:38,178 --> 01:18:41,039
I had a couple I was gonna throw to Attorney Dash.

951
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,421
If you could just, and again, if we have members of the public watching, it might be informative to them as well.

952
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:52,763
Can you give us a flavor of the adjacent properties?

953
01:18:53,364 --> 01:18:55,585
And I know across the street is the university itself.

954
01:18:56,885 --> 01:18:58,826
Is it Tufts controlled?

955
01:19:00,105 --> 01:19:01,666
Are the neighbors Tufts related.

956
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,108
Yeah, that's a good question.

957
01:19:04,148 --> 01:19:07,390
Okay, Jerry, could you go back to the slide we're going to go back.

958
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,091
Yeah, there we go.

959
01:19:08,171 --> 01:19:15,016
If you look on that Mr chair, the dark blue or the proposed buildings we're talking about the one on the bottom being Cape and the one on the top being Winthrop.

960
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:21,584
All the ones in light blue are existing Tufts properties and the lighter blue.

961
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:26,529
And then the other is other Tufts buildings are the light, light blue.

962
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,394
So basically everything that isn't white is Tufts affiliated.

963
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:33,978
So as you can see, pretty much Winthrop Street is pretty Tufts-y.

964
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:51,304
I mean, there are some houses in between I think Rocco could probably talk about, you know, as the community relations director, you know, the relationship with the neighborhood there but as you can see this neighborhood is very much a Tufts neighborhood and even those other houses that aren't tough sound often are rented to tough students.

965
01:19:52,165 --> 01:19:52,685
Sure, sure.

966
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,365
That makes sense.

967
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:53,905
Yeah.

968
01:19:53,945 --> 01:19:54,746
Thank you, Adam.

969
01:19:54,966 --> 01:19:56,406
And thank you, David.

970
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:57,286
Sorry to interrupt you there.

971
01:19:57,326 --> 01:20:01,367
But yeah, we were very intentional in picking these properties.

972
01:20:01,807 --> 01:20:11,150
Both properties are obviously owned by Walnut Hill, which is subsidiary Tufts University, but also both properties are surrounded by either other Tufts properties.

973
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:15,771
In the case of 50 Winthrop, you see that white house that's next to it.

974
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:21,452
That abutter is a landlord who rents exclusively to Tufts students.

975
01:20:22,152 --> 01:20:28,195
And he was very supportive of the first round of Coho and he's been supportive of this round of Coho as well.

976
01:20:28,235 --> 01:20:31,496
We've met with him several times and he's okay with the project.

977
01:20:34,577 --> 01:20:35,178
That's helpful.

978
01:20:35,218 --> 01:20:35,538
Thank you.

979
01:20:36,854 --> 01:20:51,365
Also, could you, Attorney Dash, maybe give us a sense like what, how many, what's going on in this building currently versus, I know you've mentioned the number of students who will reside in the building going forward.

980
01:20:52,185 --> 01:21:02,933
I think that's relevant to some of those larger community issues that you were mentioning in terms of where the students live and Tufts providing for its students.

981
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:07,602
Absolutely Mister chair and dash again I keep my the building I believe is vacant right now.

982
01:21:08,182 --> 01:21:17,971
So the we're proposing for a cape and for 4 units of the total of 21 student beds, one resident director bed for total of 22 beds in this property.

983
01:21:19,392 --> 01:21:22,335
So that's our plan right now I don't I don't think it's even have the ball.

984
01:21:23,156 --> 01:21:25,538
Rocco I guess you could probably verify that.

985
01:21:26,827 --> 01:21:27,407
That's correct.

986
01:21:27,428 --> 01:21:28,148
Thank you, Adam.

987
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:32,250
Yeah, I believe the city has deemed the property in inhabitable.

988
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:42,235
There's a gentleman who lived there for a number of years, you know, let the property go into disrepair and it was, I don't know if it was officially condemned by the city, but it certainly wasn't inhabitable.

989
01:21:43,495 --> 01:21:51,139
And when he left to go to assisted living, he put the market, the house on sale, and then we got it.

990
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:53,259
So I don't think anyone's lived there for a few years.

991
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:57,861
And it's, you know, after going through it, it was not savable.

992
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:01,623
Okay, thank you for the information.

993
01:22:04,104 --> 01:22:10,547
Amanda, do we have members of the public who'd like to speak on or ask questions or participate tonight?

994
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:37,571
I haven't yet received any written comments, but I would welcome folks, and it looks like we have a hand raised in the public currently to, you can raise your hand to let us know that you want to speak, I'll add you to the queue, or you can, in the chat, indicate that you'd like to, assuming, Chair, that we are going into public comment portion of the evening.

995
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:39,628
I was prepared to move forward to that.

996
01:22:40,148 --> 01:22:44,349
And I think you also have an email address that folks could use if they wanted to as well, right?

997
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:45,250
Yes.

998
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:59,194
So if anyone wants to send a written comment while we're going through this tonight, you can email at ocd at medford-ma.gov.

999
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:00,555
And I will put that in the chat.

1000
01:23:02,175 --> 01:23:06,657
And if you do that, I just ask that you include your name and address for the record.

1001
01:23:09,257 --> 01:23:19,940
And to mimic what you just said, if you're recognized here and have an opportunity to speak, which we hope you will do, please give us your name and address for the record before you start your comments.

1002
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:25,562
Okay, so we do have at least one hand that's up.

1003
01:23:25,602 --> 01:23:27,363
Am I seeing this correctly, Amanda?

1004
01:23:28,123 --> 01:23:29,243
Yes, yes.

1005
01:23:29,283 --> 01:23:34,685
So Mike, and I apologize if I mispronounce your name, Mike Krasinski, if you'd like to speak.

1006
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:36,622
Yep, you got my name right, thank you.

1007
01:23:37,583 --> 01:23:41,105
So my name is Mike Korzynski, I'm at 149 Birgadev in Medford.

1008
01:23:41,986 --> 01:23:49,932
I guess, so my question here is how is Dover being conferred here if Tufts is not the property holder of record?

1009
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:59,679
So the property holder is Walnut Hill Properties, which if I look at the properties they own, even in the Coho District, they own the building that, you know, Davis Pastry House is in.

1010
01:23:59,719 --> 01:24:00,219
So like what,

1011
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:08,793
what determines, how are you deciding to confer the deference of Dover to Walnut Hill?

1012
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:21,658
I mean, if the person at 52 Winthrop in the white box on slide two, if they were to form a 503C and said they were going to, I mean, Rocco had said earlier, they rent exclusively to tough students.

1013
01:24:21,758 --> 01:24:25,780
So if they were to form a 503C and rent exclusively to tough students, would they be entitled

1014
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:28,073
to deference under Dover.

1015
01:24:28,353 --> 01:24:31,014
So, I mean, I think this came up in the in the beer hall thing.

1016
01:24:31,074 --> 01:24:39,317
Something about it just doesn't quite feel right with Tufts not being the deed holder and Walnut Hill themselves asking for the Dover deference.

1017
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:47,500
Mr. Krasinski, I appreciate your comment and your question and that's certainly fair and relevant to our discussion tonight.

1018
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:55,243
I'm going to ask my brother, Attorney Dash, would you like to touch on that issue for us?

1019
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:02,635
help the public understand the connection between Walnut Hill and the educational uses of Tufts.

1020
01:25:08,165 --> 01:25:11,527
Mr. Chairman, if we've lost Adam, I'm happy to jump in.

1021
01:25:11,547 --> 01:25:14,248
It looks like he's still black.

1022
01:25:14,288 --> 01:25:18,690
But just to be clear, Walnut Hill purchased the property.

1023
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:21,592
Walnut Hill is a 501c3 nonprofit.

1024
01:25:22,152 --> 01:25:25,734
It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tufts University.

1025
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:34,338
This building will be owned and operated by Tufts University, just like in the first round of COHO.

1026
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:41,162
Once we begin using it as a dormitory, we switch over the ownership to Tufts University.

1027
01:25:41,222 --> 01:25:52,230
So I promise you it will be owned, operated, and staffed by Tufts University itself once we begin using it.

1028
01:25:55,974 --> 01:25:57,815
Mr. Kaczynski, did you have a follow-up?

1029
01:25:57,935 --> 01:25:59,056
The floor is still yours.

1030
01:25:59,837 --> 01:26:04,920
Oh, I mean, I guess I don't understand why they don't own it today, but I'm not sure.

1031
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:13,346
I mean, me and Rocco can both give our best guess, but I guess Adam would be the person who maybe could answer the question the best.

1032
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:13,707
I don't know.

1033
01:26:14,768 --> 01:26:18,470
I mean, to be quite frank, it was just a matter of timing.

1034
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,051
We're going to switch over the deed.

1035
01:26:21,112 --> 01:26:23,073
The deed transfer is in process.

1036
01:26:23,154 --> 01:26:24,214
It just takes time to do it.

1037
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:32,593
Before before we would again owner before we would occupy or use the building, it would be transferred fully over to Tufts University.

1038
01:26:32,953 --> 01:26:37,016
But again, I should echo that Walnut Hill is a 501C3.

1039
01:26:37,036 --> 01:26:38,157
It is a nonprofit.

1040
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:39,959
It does serve educational needs.

1041
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,381
But not every 501C3 can Clint over.

1042
01:26:46,293 --> 01:26:48,396
Colleges and universities can't.

1043
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:52,222
But Walnut Hill is a property management development company, right?

1044
01:26:53,103 --> 01:26:57,109
That works exclusively for a college slash university.

1045
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,531
They provide university housing.

1046
01:26:58,992 --> 01:27:01,496
They just provide university housing for faculty and staff.

1047
01:27:03,025 --> 01:27:13,612
So since this will be student occupied it will be owned by Tufts University, but they also own a bunch of property on Boston have right like a Danish pastry house tamper like those buildings do.

1048
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:17,635
So, like what's the line, if Rocco if I might.

1049
01:27:19,176 --> 01:27:29,019
The law doesn't actually say that it has to be the owned by a school, it has to be for the religious educational use or childcare center.

1050
01:27:29,639 --> 01:27:34,281
So it's, it could be as long as it is dedicated for educational use.

1051
01:27:35,281 --> 01:27:38,182
It is covered by Dover, regardless of the ownership.

1052
01:27:39,142 --> 01:27:42,023
There needs to be some understanding by the, the,

1053
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:52,545
the city as to how that is an educational use and housing has been deemed by the court system as an educational use.

1054
01:27:55,206 --> 01:28:00,949
If I can just add a couple of thoughts on there for Mr. Kuczynski or any other members of the public.

1055
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:08,653
I think what I'm hearing from Mr. Tirico is that this project is going to be tough and it won't be Walnut Hill.

1056
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,106
technicality for their application today, but it's Tufts.

1057
01:28:13,386 --> 01:28:21,708
And I think we would agree, and I'm sure he would agree with us, that if it was in a different name, that might be a different question.

1058
01:28:22,668 --> 01:28:40,072
If Mr. Tirico, I guess I shouldn't put words in your mouth, but I would presume that if suddenly we drove past and we saw Tufts or a Tufts entity leasing this out to Danish Pastry House, you probably would have, you know, it wouldn't be a Dover amendment.

1059
01:28:40,972 --> 01:28:41,633
anymore, right?

1060
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:43,314
That's correct.

1061
01:28:43,354 --> 01:28:49,197
Dover amendment is not, as Alicia pointed out, not about ownership, it's about use.

1062
01:28:49,777 --> 01:28:51,658
And this will be used for educational purposes.

1063
01:28:51,678 --> 01:28:53,399
It's going to be used to house our students.

1064
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:59,582
And the Dover amendment has time and time again said that housing students is part of an educational use.

1065
01:28:59,622 --> 01:29:04,225
So this will go to support our mission and is thus protected by Dover.

1066
01:29:06,013 --> 01:29:27,874
And either of you can tell me if I'm wrong, but I'm just, I'm just trying to sort of think through it in my mind and articulate to help others is part of this coho arrangement and the 20 points the Tufts has committed to in terms of its relationship with the city and what it will do with these properties are not do these properties as the case might be is all presume that this is Dover amendment use and

1067
01:29:28,975 --> 01:29:54,493
specifically yes it's going to be educational use only this is this is core stuff we're talking about right this is not a for-profit venture of a subsidiary of tufts is that that that's absolutely that's absolutely correct and you know the the word coho itself stands for community housing meaning that we're housing our students in the community so all these properties are being used to house juniors and seniors

1068
01:29:55,858 --> 01:30:03,846
Okay, and this, this discussion that we're having now just so we can save a little bit of time on our second project tonight.

1069
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:10,613
I think everything we're saying here and just confirm with me, everything we're saying about this property also applies at 50 with.

1070
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:12,215
That's correct.

1071
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:18,321
There's a deed transfer and process there and it'll be the same exact use and again, Dover is about use.

1072
01:30:20,304 --> 01:30:22,365
COB, Elaine McLaughlin she-her, she-hers, she-hers.

1073
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:52,165
project, but we have the opportunity to, if there are concerns that residents have about the project, we may be able to actually address specific concerns through this hearing process and through this hearing tonight.

1074
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:59,292
So if there were actual specific concerns about the project itself, we'd be open to hearing those at this hearing.

1075
01:31:00,332 --> 01:31:09,094
In this case, my concern was literally just that you're conferring Dover to Wallet Hill Properties, and that's a property management company, and it doesn't really make sense to me.

1076
01:31:10,694 --> 01:31:11,794
It doesn't feel correct.

1077
01:31:13,055 --> 01:31:16,455
I mean, if it transferred, that's fine, but as it is, it doesn't feel correct.

1078
01:31:20,256 --> 01:31:24,217
Do we have other members of the public who would like to speak on this project?

1079
01:31:26,562 --> 01:31:29,424
Confirming I haven't received any additional emails yet.

1080
01:31:30,325 --> 01:31:38,310
If any others would like to provide comment, please raise your hand or actually you may be able to use the chat to let me know.

1081
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:41,632
I'm just gonna give everyone a second to respond.

1082
01:31:41,652 --> 01:31:52,860
Okay, I'm not seeing any hands raised or comments made.

1083
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:57,633
Okay, thank you very much and thank you for the comments that we did receive.

1084
01:31:58,534 --> 01:32:02,877
Board members, do we have questions for the Tufts team on this project?

1085
01:32:11,112 --> 01:32:11,633
Any hands?

1086
01:32:12,814 --> 01:32:12,974
No?

1087
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:14,255
Jump in.

1088
01:32:15,637 --> 01:32:18,499
I guess I have a couple of questions to ask.

1089
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:31,232
And we're talking 2.4 here, not 50 yet, but is there more, I guess if I looked at what I think of as the corner, so it's not this view, but

1090
01:32:33,377 --> 01:32:35,158
Yeah, Artika, yeah, thank you.

1091
01:32:35,779 --> 01:33:01,737
Yeah, I just had a question about, and I know you've got some elevation that you're working with, and maybe, George, you can help me out, because you know this area better than I do, but in terms of the landscaping, is there more to be done, or is there more of an opportunity in terms of a tree or some feature that could make more prominent where you have that connection, where those sort of walls come together there at the sidewalk?

1092
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:07,707
Mr. Chairman, if I could just make one note.

1093
01:33:08,527 --> 01:33:31,006
In terms of adding trees to that corner, we actually had a discussion with the traffic engineer and due to the sight lines, he asked us, I think actually in our original plans, we had a tree at that corner and he asked us to remove it because of the concern of the sight lines for vehicles traveling on Cape and vehicles coming down hard on Winthrop.

1094
01:33:32,063 --> 01:33:36,827
But I think, you know, I'll defer to the architects, but I think we've added trees and other parts of the property.

1095
01:33:39,068 --> 01:33:49,775
As well as some other ground cover, I think we're trying to be also careful of not having plants in there that critters could be hiding out in and doing things.

1096
01:33:49,835 --> 01:33:51,457
So there is a balance.

1097
01:33:51,557 --> 01:34:00,643
But yes, I think we have plants looking at other types of low ground cover or some smaller shrubs.

1098
01:34:01,255 --> 01:34:02,176
in there to soften?

1099
01:34:04,217 --> 01:34:10,821
Yeah, the front of the lot facing Capon Street.

1100
01:34:11,602 --> 01:34:14,964
So that's the side that is visible to us there.

1101
01:34:16,045 --> 01:34:18,246
Your plans show it drawn as a three to one slope.

1102
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:24,751
So it's not really feasible to use that as a seating lawn or a usable lawn space.

1103
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:30,795
So it definitely would be possible or even advisable just to plan

1104
01:34:31,826 --> 01:34:33,607
some low shrubs or some low ground cover there.

1105
01:34:34,207 --> 01:34:44,070
Yeah, like the pachycephalos and those types of things that are very hardy and would take to that very well, junipers, another one that comes up.

1106
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,511
Yeah, absolutely.

1107
01:34:45,651 --> 01:34:47,031
Or something native as well.

1108
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:49,832
Definitely highly encourage using native plants.

1109
01:34:50,753 --> 01:34:51,513
Yeah, exactly.

1110
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:54,454
Yeah, we're looking at native and sort of drought resistant.

1111
01:34:54,494 --> 01:35:00,036
That's been sort of really the mission that's been given to us to be very cognizant of.

1112
01:35:07,233 --> 01:35:13,377
Okay, so if not if not reflected today that's that's on your your wish list, so to speak.

1113
01:35:13,397 --> 01:35:16,739
yeah yeah.

1114
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:29,288
I would say no word yes yeah I think I think that the goals, again, I feel are very compatible with what talks is looking for and I think what the city is looking for us, I you know we want to be very proud.

1115
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:31,377
and, you know, be good neighbors.

1116
01:35:31,397 --> 01:35:39,203
I mean, continue what's been started already on Winthrop Street and, you know, really create something that's in harmony.

1117
01:35:40,684 --> 01:35:40,944
Great.

1118
01:35:43,186 --> 01:35:47,750
Other questions from board members, though?

1119
01:35:48,817 --> 01:36:10,625
We did receive letters from various city departments, so I didn't know if there was anything in particular that Tufts had issue with in terms of requirements or recommendations from our various departments, or if you're comfortable with what's been presented there.

1120
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:13,226
Madam Chair, Adam Dasch again.

1121
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:15,007
Sorry, I've been having a little connectivity issues.

1122
01:36:16,888 --> 01:36:30,202
Yeah, as far as that goes, I mean, I would note that those items coming from the various departments aren't really zoning related the more building permit related and we do appreciate the department's bringing them up early in the process, because sometimes these don't come up until the end and then everyone's surprised.

1123
01:36:31,331 --> 01:36:36,976
But as far as things like sidewalks and such, it's really not, I guess in our opinion, a site plan review matter.

1124
01:36:36,996 --> 01:36:42,920
If one goes back to the zoning ordinance and the two areas of review by the board, they're really a little out of the scope.

1125
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:56,671
But as we go through the building permit process, we will certainly work with engineering and public works and everybody else as we always do to go forward and have these items work through.

1126
01:36:58,292 --> 01:36:58,913
Rocco, is that right?

1127
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:14,697
Thank you, Adam yeah I don't think we have any objections to the to the recommendations as Adam said it once we go through permitting, as we do on all our projects we work with the city of Medford to address their concerns and incorporate them into the project as best we can.

1128
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:30,695
Okay, so I guess stated differently you don't see anything in there that that is problematic at this point, and your intent is to to work with the city departments and cooperate with those requirements and recommendations.

1129
01:37:31,236 --> 01:37:31,736
That's correct.

1130
01:37:32,036 --> 01:37:32,156
Okay.

1131
01:37:32,196 --> 01:37:32,817
All right.

1132
01:37:32,957 --> 01:37:33,357
Fair enough.

1133
01:37:33,377 --> 01:37:37,420
Okay.

1134
01:37:41,447 --> 01:37:50,351
comments, otherwise we're being asked to accept or accept those conditions, the site plan review.

1135
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:52,712
David, this is Deanna.

1136
01:37:52,752 --> 01:38:02,857
We do usually condition the board, the department head notes though, as part of site plan review, don't we?

1137
01:38:04,177 --> 01:38:05,218
Absolutely, absolutely.

1138
01:38:05,258 --> 01:38:29,598
And I think, I think we could, we could, someone could offer a motion to approve site plan with the condition that Tufts works with the city departments to resolve all of the requirements and recommendations that have been put forward in these various letters.

1139
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,201
Yeah, I'll make that motion.

1140
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:37,402
Is there a second to that motion?

1141
01:38:38,003 --> 01:38:38,563
I'll second it.

1142
01:38:39,824 --> 01:38:40,105
Excellent.

1143
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:40,765
Thank you, George.

1144
01:38:41,406 --> 01:38:45,009
May I actually raise a housekeeping matter for this project?

1145
01:38:45,149 --> 01:38:45,570
Thank you.

1146
01:38:47,151 --> 01:38:57,941
When the other COHO projects were approved, that was done through the ZBA process because that's how we handled Dover before the changes to our zoning.

1147
01:38:58,661 --> 01:39:01,624
And they attached the

1148
01:39:03,523 --> 01:39:13,936
The document that has been referenced this evening the January 4 2018 apartments for juniors and seniors university commitments for zba review.

1149
01:39:15,197 --> 01:39:21,945
I have a copy of what was attached and nothing you've said this evening seems to be in um.

1150
01:39:25,216 --> 01:39:27,197
is different from the document that I have.

1151
01:39:27,838 --> 01:39:35,262
And I think that it would be appropriate for us to say that we anticipate that this, these same commitments are being followed.

1152
01:39:36,524 --> 01:39:52,437
Like so I was expecting that to be one of the conditions this evening, but I do want to confirm that the version that I have in hand is the version that is what was sent to the board this evening is also what Rocco and the Tufts group have.

1153
01:39:53,497 --> 01:39:56,340
I don't want to accidentally attach a wrong version.

1154
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:02,585
Is that something that can be done very quickly right now?

1155
01:40:02,725 --> 01:40:12,850
I was going to say, I could try to review it quickly if it was from the ZBA decision of round one of COHO.

1156
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:18,933
Yes, we will still agree to those 20 conditions and those 20 conditions will apply

1157
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:20,955
To these properties.

1158
01:40:21,976 --> 01:40:24,679
We actually created that list ourself.

1159
01:40:25,861 --> 01:40:38,155
After getting, you know, significant feedback from the neighbors that was based on you know those all 20 of those requests were generated from neighbor meetings and neighbor comments so as long as we can say that it's the exact same list that.

1160
01:40:38,934 --> 01:40:43,217
we agreed to when we went to the ZBA in phase one of the process.

1161
01:40:43,257 --> 01:40:43,977
Yes, we do.

1162
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:48,120
We will commit to those same 20 commitments.

1163
01:40:49,081 --> 01:40:55,025
And I will tell you that this was provided to Amanda and myself by Dennis McDougal, the Secretary of the Zoning Board.

1164
01:40:55,873 --> 01:40:57,934
So that I feel comfortable with that.

1165
01:40:58,054 --> 01:41:09,618
If it's from Dennis, I feel comfortable that him being the ZBA secretary, that that lines up with what was passed in round one.

1166
01:41:09,638 --> 01:41:10,778
I'm trying to remember the year.

1167
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:13,039
I think it was 2017, but whichever year it passed the ZBA.

1168
01:41:16,613 --> 01:41:23,159
I can confirm that in previous ZBA decisions, it refers to this document.

1169
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:29,784
So named like apartments for juniors and seniors, ZBA commitments.

1170
01:41:30,385 --> 01:41:32,646
And it gives the date of, I think like January, 2018.

1171
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:37,751
And it has the 2020 conditions on there.

1172
01:41:37,811 --> 01:41:42,755
So I do feel pretty confident that it is the same version.

1173
01:41:46,354 --> 01:41:53,200
So many of the things that Rocco's reference tonight about bike racks, and that the parking.

1174
01:41:54,461 --> 01:42:00,186
There wouldn't be parking spots there would be accessible parking only and drop off.

1175
01:42:01,045 --> 01:42:09,031
Things about fire protection and fire alarm systems, graduate resident directors throughout the at a certain ratio.

1176
01:42:10,312 --> 01:42:14,415
The neighbor meeting prior to construction, I think you've actually already held the neighbor meeting.

1177
01:42:14,435 --> 01:42:16,216
That's that's correct Alicia.

1178
01:42:16,236 --> 01:42:18,098
Yep, that was held on June 9th.

1179
01:42:18,963 --> 01:42:19,263
Right.

1180
01:42:20,724 --> 01:42:34,908
I feel like the only thing that you didn't mention didn't come up in this set was residents not being allowed to have barbecue grills, only activities, organizations can request barbecue grills.

1181
01:42:36,089 --> 01:42:43,371
And that's correct, Alicia, in that any of the COHO rules and regulations would extend to these two properties.

1182
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:45,732
So students are not allowed to have barbecues or

1183
01:42:46,604 --> 01:42:49,406
have propane tanks or anything on these properties.

1184
01:42:51,728 --> 01:42:56,132
And each unit will actually have its own graduate resident director.

1185
01:42:56,172 --> 01:43:00,355
So we actually exceed the commitment of the first round.

1186
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:07,261
And the very first one on here is that Tufts University will continue to pay real estate taxes on these properties.

1187
01:43:08,235 --> 01:43:08,835
That's correct.

1188
01:43:08,875 --> 01:43:11,677
Yeah, I actually have it open on my desktop now, Alicia.

1189
01:43:11,717 --> 01:43:14,818
So I think we're both looking at the same document.

1190
01:43:15,058 --> 01:43:24,842
And as we committed back in 2018, we will continue to pay real estate taxes on these properties so that the city doesn't lose any revenue.

1191
01:43:25,663 --> 01:43:26,543
Great, thank you.

1192
01:43:26,723 --> 01:43:35,407
And honestly, I was repeating some of them so that the board members were, because this was provided to the board, frankly, minutes before this meeting started.

1193
01:43:35,427 --> 01:43:37,968
I apologize that it didn't come to you earlier.

1194
01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:41,325
Okay.

1195
01:43:41,645 --> 01:43:43,626
Mr. Chair, if I may, I just want to correct the record.

1196
01:43:43,886 --> 01:43:48,167
I believe when I said the unit, the student bed count, I was actually speaking about Winthrop Street.

1197
01:43:48,227 --> 01:43:53,048
So for the record, for Capon, I pulled the wrong plan in front of me.

1198
01:43:53,108 --> 01:43:53,708
I apologize.

1199
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:54,408
They're very similar.

1200
01:43:54,528 --> 01:44:01,309
That the Capon one will have four units with 28 student beds and one residence director for a total of 29 beds, just to correct that.

1201
01:44:02,229 --> 01:44:02,470
Okay.

1202
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:08,131
That's actually what I thought I heard you say, but we'll give you credit for it.

1203
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:09,331
One of the two things is possible.

1204
01:44:10,582 --> 01:44:10,962
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

1205
01:44:11,022 --> 01:44:11,562
PB, David Ensign --- Okay.

1206
01:44:11,582 --> 01:44:11,802
All right.

1207
01:44:11,822 --> 01:44:13,203
Thank you for those clarifications.

1208
01:44:13,243 --> 01:44:30,728
Deanna, you had offered a motion, I guess, if you want to perhaps clarify that motion to say that we would be approving the site plan with the condition that Tufts continues to work with the department, city departments to resolve all requirements or recommendations and to

1209
01:44:32,588 --> 01:44:41,150
also condition this site plan approval on continuing to comply with the 20 points of what I'm calling the Tufts 20.

1210
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:44,991
Okay, I'll make that motion.

1211
01:44:45,911 --> 01:44:46,191
Excellent.

1212
01:44:46,231 --> 01:44:47,172
Do we have a second for that?

1213
01:44:47,192 --> 01:44:51,793
This is Christy.

1214
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:52,273
I'll second.

1215
01:44:53,093 --> 01:44:53,873
Thank you, Christy.

1216
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:55,454
Okay, roll call.

1217
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:59,315
Let's start with Jackie Furtado.

1218
01:45:00,635 --> 01:45:00,695
Aye.

1219
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:03,517
Deanna Peabody.

1220
01:45:04,278 --> 01:45:04,398
Aye.

1221
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:06,419
Clyde Sundreddison.

1222
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:07,420
Aye.

1223
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:08,621
Christy Dowd.

1224
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:09,781
Aye.

1225
01:45:10,282 --> 01:45:11,002
Emily Hedman.

1226
01:45:11,582 --> 01:45:11,703
Aye.

1227
01:45:12,903 --> 01:45:13,504
George Fisher.

1228
01:45:15,105 --> 01:45:15,305
Aye.

1229
01:45:16,766 --> 01:45:18,026
And I'm an aye as well.

1230
01:45:19,487 --> 01:45:20,188
Thank you very much.

1231
01:45:20,268 --> 01:45:25,231
Let me, we'll move on to the next somewhat related item with the same team.

1232
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:31,335
Let me read the notice that I have to read for all of these.

1233
01:45:33,947 --> 01:45:36,173
This is related to 50 Winthrop Street.

1234
01:45:43,433 --> 01:46:07,786
So the meeting and discussion will be relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Walnut Hill Properties Corp to demolish a non conforming for family dwelling and construct a new four unit dormitory allowed use with special permit per city council at 50 Winthrop Street in Medford project is subject to a site plan review special permit for our zoning ordinance.

1235
01:46:08,847 --> 01:46:15,131
and requires approvals from the Community Development Board for bill for amendment uses pursuant to section 11.8.

1236
01:46:16,312 --> 01:46:20,755
Therefore, site plan review approval shall be required from the Community Development Board.

1237
01:46:22,256 --> 01:46:26,259
So let's turn things over to Attorney Dash.

1238
01:46:27,123 --> 01:46:34,787
Thank you Mister chair again Adam dash 48 Grove Street in Davis Square in Somerville representing want to help properties Corporation wholly owned affiliate of tough.

1239
01:46:35,507 --> 01:46:47,273
And this is regarding 50 Winthrop Street seeking site plan review again with me a rocket to Rico from tough surgery Frank from BF the architects out here if you want to swap over the slide deck similar but not quite the same.

1240
01:46:48,614 --> 01:46:54,757
And again this is a project to demolish an existing structure and construct a new structure for Tufts University student housing.

1241
01:46:55,190 --> 01:47:03,757
and residence director housing in the gr zone and this one will be doing four units of 21 student beds and one resident director bed for total of 22.

1242
01:47:04,537 --> 01:47:09,301
I won't go through all the just all the stuff here, but if you look at the coho map this in front of you.

1243
01:47:10,062 --> 01:47:14,789
You can see the top there is the nearby 50 Winthrop street property in the dark blue.

1244
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:25,685
And again, this is another situation where the existing structures and extreme disrepair as a pre existing non conforming structure is not handicap accessible and is not energy efficient.

1245
01:47:26,065 --> 01:47:29,847
and the new structure will be in good repair, handicapped, accessible, and energy efficient.

1246
01:47:30,547 --> 01:47:43,974
Again, the Medford Historical Commission heard this matter back in July 11th, 2022, through the demolition delay ordinance and found the existing structure to be not significant, such that the demolition delay does not apply and the demolition could go forward.

1247
01:47:45,494 --> 01:47:50,017
I guess I won't go through what the Dover Amendment zoning says.

1248
01:47:50,097 --> 01:47:51,877
I guess, Jerry, you want to jump right to the slides?

1249
01:47:52,418 --> 01:47:52,838
Sure.

1250
01:47:52,938 --> 01:47:54,559
We're good with that.

1251
01:47:54,799 --> 01:47:54,959
Come on.

1252
01:47:55,278 --> 01:47:56,658
Yeah, we'll go to the next slide.

1253
01:47:57,278 --> 01:48:08,281
Yeah, again, as we did with the other ones, you can see in red is the existing outline of 50 Winthrop Street, and in blue is our new building.

1254
01:48:08,701 --> 01:48:19,103
What you'll notice right away, again, is we were able to get the entire building within the setbacks required of that, which was great.

1255
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:20,984
Exact same issues.

1256
01:48:22,406 --> 01:48:25,348
Adam was absolutely correct, is that accessibility.

1257
01:48:25,388 --> 01:48:28,089
The other building had all these different levels.

1258
01:48:28,189 --> 01:48:31,511
It was really near impossible to make it accessible.

1259
01:48:31,531 --> 01:48:34,392
We have achieved that here with the new structure.

1260
01:48:34,412 --> 01:48:47,099
In there, you'll see that there's a, the space where there's a garage is actually the loading and offloading is up in the back and through there, taking it off.

1261
01:48:48,379 --> 01:48:53,382
well, Winthrop Street, Emory, sorry, but it's off of Winthrop Street onto Emory.

1262
01:48:54,703 --> 01:48:57,624
And I think you wanna go to the next slide.

1263
01:48:57,644 --> 01:49:06,829
We can kind of just do, again, the same bits that we have in there, as you said, that we do better on the proposed setbacks as required.

1264
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:14,934
In the cases in here, we are doing better in the lot coverage

1265
01:49:15,965 --> 01:49:21,149
and we're under the required height of 35 feet, we're at 34.5 feet.

1266
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:42,822
Same issues, all of the sustainability issues absolutely parallel what we just spoke about on Capon Street, really striving in towards the pass the pass criteria on there as best as we can, both in terms in harmony with what the city is looking for,

1267
01:49:43,322 --> 01:49:46,404
as well as Tufts mandate for their future growth.

1268
01:49:49,147 --> 01:49:50,528
You get the two views.

1269
01:49:50,628 --> 01:49:57,413
Again, the notion of putting something that is very much in harmony with the neighborhood across the street in there.

1270
01:50:01,836 --> 01:50:02,457
Thank you, Chairman.

1271
01:50:02,637 --> 01:50:04,138
I've opened it for any questions.

1272
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:05,719
Again, residents involved.

1273
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:10,203
One thing that probably didn't get stated is that we talked about the resident director.

1274
01:50:10,903 --> 01:50:14,024
That's a fully accessible unit in each case.

1275
01:50:14,665 --> 01:50:25,689
And the criteria the ratios, you know, one to 40 we're better it's really one resident advisor per 25 that we have here, which is, you know, doing it better.

1276
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:33,893
Excellent point Jerry Adam dash again again this, there was a community meeting back in June of 2022, where we discussed Winthrop street as well.

1277
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:50,332
This actually is even an easier one than the Cape and street project because we are in for Winthrop, as Jerry said correcting non existing non conformities on side setback lot coverage building footprint and open space and those are all being brought into compliance.

1278
01:50:51,105 --> 01:50:58,992
Of course, as with the other one, the lot area, lot width and lot depth are existing non-conformities that we can't do anything about because the lot is the lot and it is what it is.

1279
01:51:00,073 --> 01:51:06,339
And then the parking is the only other item here because we have no building height issue and we have no open space issue.

1280
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:07,580
So really it's just the parking.

1281
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:15,548
And again, this is a COHO requirement to remove the parking and replace it with a drop-off area, which requires that relief.

1282
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:19,310
This one actually is a much simpler project.

1283
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:24,733
And again, they're going to be bike spaces that are added three racks of four bikes each to offset the lack of parking here.

1284
01:51:24,773 --> 01:51:28,376
And again, the students would be required to park on campus, not here.

1285
01:51:29,236 --> 01:51:42,104
So in conclusion, the applicant seeks the special, sorry, site plan review to remove a decrepit unsafe structure and replace it with an efficient, accessible and safe one, which meets the Tufts-Coho requirements with the city.

1286
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,042
Okay, thank you for the presentation.

1287
01:51:48,062 --> 01:51:52,085
Any initial questions before we seek some public comments?

1288
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,030
Amanda?

1289
01:52:00,333 --> 01:52:11,103
Yes, so I invite anyone from the public who, or I'm sorry, I should say before we go into public comment, I have not received any written comments on this yet.

1290
01:52:13,752 --> 01:52:22,720
And for anyone who's interested in submitting a written comment, you can email OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1291
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:26,503
And you would just need to include your name and address for the record.

1292
01:52:28,845 --> 01:52:38,433
And if the board is so inclined and wants to move into public comment, folks can begin by raising their hands or using the chat function to let me know.

1293
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,949
Sure.

1294
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:51,812
Seeing any activity, if folks in the public could let us know if they'd like to participate, we'd be happy to hear from you.

1295
01:52:57,574 --> 01:53:01,235
Just going to give it another couple seconds, but not seeing anyone as of yet.

1296
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:18,263
Any additional questions from board members for the Tufts team on this site?

1297
01:53:23,448 --> 01:53:32,555
I guess I just wanted to ask a question then, and that is at the comparing these two at the first site, there was

1298
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:43,176
Not, I mean you have a driveway here and then you have a path and I know you have accessibility challenges and improvements that are being made at both locations.

1299
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:57,808
Can you just sort of walk me through the driveways here but the driveway is not in the other building is that something that, like, what what is the driveways role here, if there wasn't one on the other building.

1300
01:54:01,546 --> 01:54:21,408
Adam I could take us, take the first bit of that we have no existing, we have an existing curb cut here, where there was, you know, driveway coming through there and rather than try to put something out on Winthrop Street and likewise a tape in the same thing there was a curb cup and a parking area and we, you know, basically

1301
01:54:27,438 --> 01:54:41,184
And what we were able to do since, in this case, the existing curb cuts to the side, we do want to be able to have access and accessible access to the front of the building, which is why we did that.

1302
01:54:41,864 --> 01:54:47,826
And on Capon Street, the parking was right there, so the access was just by there.

1303
01:54:47,907 --> 01:54:52,929
So it was, in a way, sort of simple as that.

1304
01:54:52,989 --> 01:54:56,550
We really were working with the existing curb cut areas to do that.

1305
01:54:58,175 --> 01:55:11,100
Okay, and that's the that's the spot for the accessible parking, and then you need the, the walkway or the right to take you to the, to take you to the front door.

1306
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:11,660
Correct.

1307
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:12,581
Okay.

1308
01:55:12,941 --> 01:55:13,281
All right.

1309
01:55:13,301 --> 01:55:16,662
We're always pushing for more open space or more green space so.

1310
01:55:18,318 --> 01:55:26,880
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, we wanted to try to get as much open space as possible on the site as well, but accessibility is also a top priority.

1311
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:33,581
We wanna make sure that any students are able to live at these properties and that they're able to enter through the front door.

1312
01:55:33,641 --> 01:55:37,882
They don't have to go around the sidewalk and all that other stuff.

1313
01:55:37,902 --> 01:55:43,524
So it's really to make sure that it's fully accessible for all of our students.

1314
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:45,564
Understandable, thank you.

1315
01:55:48,997 --> 01:55:49,277
Okay.

1316
01:55:50,438 --> 01:55:57,560
Any other questions or questions I have a quick question, please, please go back to the rendering.

1317
01:56:01,262 --> 01:56:08,144
Are you, are you really going to build these projects and leave the sidewalks and complete disrepair.

1318
01:56:13,918 --> 01:56:25,185
Please I just want to note that in this one on the engineering comments from the city that they know to condition repairing the sidewalk and repositioning crosswalk as part of offsite.

1319
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:28,107
Okay, thank you.

1320
01:56:31,249 --> 01:56:36,232
I just, I just found it curious that you went through the trouble of doing this nice rendering and left.

1321
01:56:36,252 --> 01:56:38,013
It's funny.

1322
01:56:42,084 --> 01:56:42,584
Right.

1323
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:50,468
It's funny you mentioned that, because when we originally did the renderings, we did all new sidewalks, and it looked too kind of not real.

1324
01:56:51,048 --> 01:56:55,491
So we kind of... We gave a character class.

1325
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:57,131
That's what it is.

1326
01:56:57,191 --> 01:57:01,393
But I think the engineering that saw to it otherwise grew over a period.

1327
01:57:01,614 --> 01:57:02,894
Because it needs to be safe.

1328
01:57:02,954 --> 01:57:05,976
It needs to be, you know, functional well.

1329
01:57:10,398 --> 01:57:10,778
Thank you.

1330
01:57:11,799 --> 01:57:12,139
Of course.

1331
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,780
Good question and good eye as always.

1332
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:15,501
Thank you.

1333
01:57:18,562 --> 01:57:18,862
All right.

1334
01:57:20,683 --> 01:57:24,805
Oh, not hearing more questions or comments from the board.

1335
01:57:24,825 --> 01:57:32,328
If someone would like to offer a motion, if we're at that point, sounds like a good idea.

1336
01:57:32,348 --> 01:57:33,849
I'll do it.

1337
01:57:34,109 --> 01:57:36,330
Motion to accept.

1338
01:57:38,931 --> 01:57:41,472
Okay, George, that'd be a motion to approve the site plan.

1339
01:57:42,788 --> 01:57:43,968
Yes, correct so I approve.

1340
01:57:44,889 --> 01:58:04,975
And would we have the same conditions presumably here as we did with property number one tonight that being toughs commitment to follow the toughs 20 as I'm calling it, and to work with the city departments to the extent requirements recommendations have been made in the letters that were circulated to the board.

1341
01:58:10,115 --> 01:58:12,016
including the off-site improvements.

1342
01:58:12,456 --> 01:58:13,116
I just want to add that.

1343
01:58:15,337 --> 01:58:17,257
I think those, sure.

1344
01:58:17,297 --> 01:58:17,497
Yeah.

1345
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:23,639
Yes, I would add those conditions, yes.

1346
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,160
Excellent.

1347
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:30,921
And do we have a second for George's, I believe it's his inaugural motion.

1348
01:58:30,941 --> 01:58:33,262
This is Christy, I'll second.

1349
01:58:34,062 --> 01:58:34,783
Thank you, Christy.

1350
01:58:35,883 --> 01:58:37,303
And we'll go to a roll call vote.

1351
01:58:38,304 --> 01:58:39,484
Vice Chair Jackie Furtado.

1352
01:58:40,499 --> 01:58:40,619
Aye.

1353
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,320
Aye.

1354
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:45,701
Aye.

1355
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:47,761
Aye.

1356
01:58:48,662 --> 01:58:49,602
Aye.

1357
01:58:49,762 --> 01:58:49,922
Aye.

1358
01:58:51,683 --> 01:58:51,823
Aye.

1359
01:58:52,843 --> 01:58:53,423
Aye.

1360
01:58:54,183 --> 01:58:54,323
Aye.

1361
01:58:55,324 --> 01:58:56,124
And George Fisher.

1362
01:59:01,186 --> 01:59:02,686
And I'm an eye as well.

1363
01:59:04,251 --> 01:59:08,033
Okay, Attorney Dash and the whole team, appreciate your participation.

1364
01:59:08,173 --> 01:59:13,616
Thank you for presenting on both of these and best of luck with the improvements you're making in the neighborhood.

1365
01:59:14,296 --> 01:59:19,399
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

1366
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,221
It's been a very efficient, great process under this new zoning, looking forward to many more.

1367
01:59:24,181 --> 01:59:24,842
Thank you very much.

1368
01:59:25,122 --> 01:59:25,582
Have a good night.

1369
01:59:29,924 --> 01:59:32,806
Okay, I think we have

1370
01:59:34,285 --> 01:59:45,089
PB, John Gerstle, PB – He, Him, His): made it tell me my right, we only have one more item on our on our list for tonight, and that is to discuss future meetings in kind of a larger sense, and that is.

1371
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:54,512
PB, John Gerstle, PB – He, Him, His): An idea and a mannequin speak to it as well, but to actually sort of pick a day.

1372
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:03,802
1st and 3rd Tuesday, 1st and 3rd Wednesday, 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month so that we have meetings that are on the calendar.

1373
02:00:04,622 --> 02:00:07,062
If we don't have matters to deal with, we don't have to meet.

1374
02:00:07,282 --> 02:00:11,823
A meeting could be canceled, but it would give us some ability to lock in our calendar.

1375
02:00:12,844 --> 02:00:17,805
And maybe most importantly for folks who are applying to see us,

1376
02:00:20,245 --> 02:00:26,513
They would then have like a deadline to get their submissions in by x date to get to why meeting.

1377
02:00:27,635 --> 02:00:38,989
So, that was a proposal, Amanda has raised I, I think it's a good one Amanda would you do you want to give the board members, your perspective and.

1378
02:00:40,026 --> 02:00:40,266
Sure.

1379
02:00:40,286 --> 02:00:45,551
Yeah, and I'll, I'll try to keep it quick because I know you guys have accomplished so much tonight.

1380
02:00:46,611 --> 02:00:49,554
I'm just so the way that I'm coming at this.

1381
02:00:51,175 --> 02:00:54,738
As, as of now the board obviously meets kind of as needed.

1382
02:00:54,758 --> 02:00:57,040
And as projects come to them.

1383
02:00:58,581 --> 02:01:03,364
And I think that flexibility is intended to help and accommodate applicants.

1384
02:01:04,064 --> 02:01:13,550
But I also, just in the span that I've been helping out with you guys, it does feel like, in some ways, we kind of lose time on the scheduling end.

1385
02:01:14,191 --> 02:01:19,034
And it also, I think, puts some pressure on you guys to convene.

1386
02:01:20,275 --> 02:01:23,477
And there's less predictability on your end.

1387
02:01:25,618 --> 02:01:33,877
And I guess I'm just thinking that I wanted to pose this all to you to see how you would feel about potentially moving to a standing meeting.

1388
02:01:35,848 --> 02:01:51,776
I think to make some of the regulatory timeframes that are attached to site plan review and other processes that this board has purview over, it would require potentially having two standing meetings a month.

1389
02:01:53,097 --> 02:02:02,701
And during some periods of time in some months, you would only meet once or maybe not at all, depending on how busy things are at that point in the year.

1390
02:02:04,455 --> 02:02:15,991
It feels like that's kind of the average meeting pace or sorry amount of meetings that happen, as is currently.

1391
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:20,276
And I think having the two meetings per month would.

1392
02:02:21,512 --> 02:02:28,078
Also, previous members of the board have talked about wanting to make sure that there aren't these really, really long marathon meetings.

1393
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:37,426
And so having, you know, the option for two meetings a month, I think kind of assuages that concern a little bit too.

1394
02:02:38,006 --> 02:02:43,351
But obviously this is entirely up to you all and what you're comfortable with and what you'd be interested in.

1395
02:02:43,531 --> 02:02:48,135
And so just wanted to kind of float it by you and see initial impressions.

1396
02:02:50,186 --> 02:02:50,667
I like it.

1397
02:02:50,687 --> 02:02:51,768
I'm more predictable.

1398
02:02:51,868 --> 02:02:53,690
I can have my schedule, the better.

1399
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:55,952
I support it as well.

1400
02:02:56,172 --> 02:02:57,013
Good idea, Amanda.

1401
02:03:00,456 --> 02:03:03,459
Others have thoughts on whether that would work for them?

1402
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,981
I think it's a great idea.

1403
02:03:07,343 --> 02:03:07,923
Thank you, George.

1404
02:03:08,264 --> 02:03:09,125
Also, it works.

1405
02:03:10,306 --> 02:03:10,486
Works.

1406
02:03:11,547 --> 02:03:32,593
It's funny I was just thinking about this, I literally was just thinking, because Wednesdays are hard for me and so I today I was telling someone I had to get home from meeting on Wednesday it was like, Oh, do you meet every third Wednesday or every, and I'm like, No, it's whenever we can he's like, Oh, so we were just discussing this whole thing so that this works.

1407
02:03:34,429 --> 02:03:35,451
Yeah, would.

1408
02:03:35,832 --> 02:03:36,753
Thanks, everyone.

1409
02:03:36,934 --> 02:03:39,819
And does it make sense?

1410
02:03:40,179 --> 02:03:41,181
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1411
02:03:41,201 --> 02:03:41,802
I'm good.

1412
02:03:41,822 --> 02:03:41,923
Okay.

1413
02:03:49,212 --> 02:03:58,198
Yeah, so, um, do folks want to talk about like potential days of the week tonight or should we leave that obviously we already have two meetings on the calendar.

1414
02:03:58,858 --> 02:04:09,105
So the 26 being the next and the 10th of November being the following, where we could spend some more time, and obviously in between then you know over email.

1415
02:04:10,065 --> 02:04:11,066
could narrow things down.

1416
02:04:11,186 --> 02:04:28,596
I feel like it could benefit me to have a little bit of time to understand like when I should be setting kind of submission deadlines for and things like that and how it may align with ZBA because obviously, or oftentimes, you know, projects come to us before them.

1417
02:04:28,656 --> 02:04:31,558
And so how do we, you know, link up with them?

1418
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:37,061
But yeah, just what are you all thinking for tonight?

1419
02:04:38,689 --> 02:04:51,173
Amanda, do you need to do legwork or could if we said first and third of the month blank with is that is that enough coordination like with CBA schedules and stuff like that?

1420
02:04:51,814 --> 02:04:55,835
Does it really matter if it's if it's Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of those two weeks or?

1421
02:04:56,382 --> 02:05:03,385
There, I'd want to think about if there are other standing meetings during those weeks.

1422
02:05:03,645 --> 02:05:17,271
But what I could do with you all here is if you're thinking first and third Wednesday, for example, or Thursday, you know, between now and next time or over email, I can do all of that vetting so that we solidify it next time around.

1423
02:05:17,291 --> 02:05:19,452
Does that sound good to everybody?

1424
02:05:19,472 --> 02:05:22,974
We probably should try to stay away from Wednesday given Jackie's schedule.

1425
02:05:23,655 --> 02:05:35,344
I just want to ask if there are any particular boards and commissions, the committee would want to stay away from conflicting with it because I see it as zoning board being an issue.

1426
02:05:35,364 --> 02:05:38,586
I assume city council is kind of an issue.

1427
02:05:38,606 --> 02:05:48,414
I will let you know that this current city council's plan is that they have a regular council meeting every other Tuesday and they generally have a committee of the whole

1428
02:05:48,995 --> 02:05:58,530
Every Tuesday or Wednesday that's not a regular city council meeting there, they're meeting, usually twice a week, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

1429
02:06:00,877 --> 02:06:10,763
As far as staff goes, there are some Committee of the Wholes and subcommittee meetings that we have to attend, but where the council believes we need to attend, they schedule those with us.

1430
02:06:11,364 --> 02:06:14,746
So they would always say to me, we want you to be at this meeting.

1431
02:06:15,386 --> 02:06:20,109
Are you like, does that conflict or which, you know, here are some dates, which ones work for you?

1432
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:25,172
Because they understand that we have requirements to be at other evening meetings as well.

1433
02:06:26,862 --> 02:06:30,584
Does that lead us to think that Thursdays are the best days?

1434
02:06:30,924 --> 02:06:34,805
Honestly, I feel like it is Thursdays are the best unless there's some other issue.

1435
02:06:35,406 --> 02:06:43,389
As far as I'm aware and scanning the city's calendar, the Historic District Commission meets on Thursdays.

1436
02:06:44,129 --> 02:06:52,493
The Medford Arts Council showed up once on a Thursday, but it's not that many.

1437
02:06:54,313 --> 02:06:56,274
And if we would, go ahead.

1438
02:06:56,394 --> 02:06:59,836
I was gonna say, I have class that begins at 6.30 on Thursdays.

1439
02:07:01,017 --> 02:07:21,109
So if we could meet starting at six and then I can coordinate with my professors or maybe talk to Alicia and Amanda offline about my board involvement to stay reasonable to myself as well as to what this board needs.

1440
02:07:21,950 --> 02:07:22,730
Emily, is that?

1441
02:07:24,067 --> 02:07:30,131
something that you foresee going on all year or is that a this semester class?

1442
02:07:30,832 --> 02:07:33,854
At least until the middle of December.

1443
02:07:34,735 --> 02:07:36,456
So October, November, December.

1444
02:07:36,576 --> 02:07:37,116
Yeah.

1445
02:07:37,997 --> 02:07:44,442
And then I can, I can potentially massage my schedule, um, next semester so that I don't have classes on Thursdays.

1446
02:07:44,462 --> 02:07:49,005
Well, I think November is pretty much, we already have our dates.

1447
02:07:49,385 --> 02:07:53,288
I would hope that we wouldn't have a meeting in the last week and a half in November.

1448
02:07:55,625 --> 02:08:02,113
And if December is maybe a one-off, maybe those Thursdays up, because we, I mean, you're a valuable member.

1449
02:08:02,233 --> 02:08:06,498
We want to work around your schedule.

1450
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:09,542
Maybe Thursday is something that can work.

1451
02:08:11,567 --> 02:08:21,731
After December, I mean, and David, and I appreciate you trying to accommodate my schedule too but the worst case scenario for me is I would be a half hour late, but I would be able to.

1452
02:08:22,712 --> 02:08:27,494
If I can't leave early enough, or I can do what Christie so dedicatedly did today and I'll just.

1453
02:08:28,674 --> 02:08:40,217
I can call in I mean I, it's just a matter of getting from Boston to Medford by six, six o'clock, even if the meetings or 630 that would help but there's so many other ways I can, I can make it work.

1454
02:08:40,537 --> 02:08:44,018
So I don't want you to exclude Wednesdays just for me.

1455
02:08:45,778 --> 02:08:48,219
So, when I look at the city calendar.

1456
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:52,320
It just we tend to have a lot of we tend to schedule public meetings.

1457
02:08:54,086 --> 02:09:05,935
But that doesn't mean we have to, it helps when we know enough in advance that like, if we're not going to have a CD board meeting, and then that opens it up for me and Amanda for other things.

1458
02:09:07,717 --> 02:09:09,478
Does ZBA meet on Thursdays as well?

1459
02:09:10,259 --> 02:09:11,399
Yes.

1460
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,981
Last Thursday.

1461
02:09:13,841 --> 02:09:14,582
Last Thursday?

1462
02:09:15,102 --> 02:09:15,583
Once a month.

1463
02:09:17,124 --> 02:09:17,344
Okay.

1464
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:19,791
And I'm just flipping through.

1465
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:22,613
So it's the Bicycle Commission that meets Wednesday nights.

1466
02:09:23,213 --> 02:09:24,414
We don't attend those.

1467
02:09:27,015 --> 02:09:30,076
I'm seeing other special meetings on my calendar.

1468
02:09:30,776 --> 02:09:33,438
Looks like the Elections Commission is going to be meeting Wednesday nights.

1469
02:09:33,518 --> 02:09:37,339
We don't attend those regularly for work.

1470
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,941
And then Conservation Commission.

1471
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:49,341
And I generally don't attend those unless it's a very sensitive situation or a very large project.

1472
02:09:50,902 --> 02:10:02,764
So is it something where we could look at, maybe it's Wednesday for anything we need to do in December, but maybe it's Thursday beginning in January?

1473
02:10:02,784 --> 02:10:05,204
Emily, does that help?

1474
02:10:05,244 --> 02:10:07,805
If we flip back and forth, would that be too inconvenient?

1475
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:13,082
first Wednesday, third Thursday.

1476
02:10:13,102 --> 02:10:18,486
I don't think there's anything that bars us from doing that.

1477
02:10:18,806 --> 02:10:19,267
Okay.

1478
02:10:19,707 --> 02:10:19,947
Yeah.

1479
02:10:21,048 --> 02:10:24,371
As long as everybody pays attention to their calendar and not their memory.

1480
02:10:24,391 --> 02:10:24,711
Yeah.

1481
02:10:24,851 --> 02:10:26,172
I don't want to overcomplicate things.

1482
02:10:26,372 --> 02:10:27,073
Okay.

1483
02:10:27,393 --> 02:10:30,375
My calendar is so complicated that I have to live by it.

1484
02:10:30,515 --> 02:10:31,576
Same.

1485
02:10:31,716 --> 02:10:32,377
Okay.

1486
02:10:36,841 --> 02:10:40,383
I mean, I don't think we have to offer a formal motion or anything votes on this thing.

1487
02:10:40,463 --> 02:10:42,424
I just want to make, you know, if we're going to go for it.

1488
02:10:43,484 --> 02:10:46,946
Um, I also want to try to make it work as best we can.

1489
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:56,891
So Wednesday and Thursday alternating, if that makes a difference and that gets everybody to participate, then that's, I think a good answer.

1490
02:10:58,012 --> 02:10:59,492
And we can meet later on Wednesdays.

1491
02:11:00,053 --> 02:11:04,635
And I'll, I'll suggest this the third Wednesday.

1492
02:11:05,323 --> 02:11:10,825
because that gives us just one more day for the next ZBA, which is the last Friday.

1493
02:11:10,845 --> 02:11:16,446
And then the first ones on like first Thursday and third Wednesday, right?

1494
02:11:16,486 --> 02:11:17,646
We were saying first and third.

1495
02:11:17,666 --> 02:11:23,748
And that way, that one that's closer to ZBA, we have just one more day.

1496
02:11:23,768 --> 02:11:26,389
And the Wednesday we need a little bit later.

1497
02:11:26,449 --> 02:11:27,209
Is that what I was hearing?

1498
02:11:28,428 --> 02:11:29,449
Would 630 work?

1499
02:11:30,409 --> 02:11:31,850
630 would definitely work.

1500
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:34,311
I think I would always get here.

1501
02:11:34,471 --> 02:11:35,251
I don't want to jinx it.

1502
02:11:39,252 --> 02:11:40,533
If you're taking the T, you never know.

1503
02:11:41,673 --> 02:11:44,975
And I do take the T because if you drive, I wouldn't get here until about 7, 8.

1504
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:53,058
And then, I mean, we've got the associate member, hopefully will be filled at some point.

1505
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:58,422
Deanna, we love having you on board, but we need to have a successor for you.

1506
02:11:58,522 --> 02:12:05,245
And so if we have standing meetings, I feel like it's not such a bad thing if a board member misses every now and again.

1507
02:12:05,265 --> 02:12:12,729
If you have something that pops up, it seems to be the value of the standing meeting outweighs missing one person here, here, there, one or two.

1508
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:16,851
How did we do, Amanda?

1509
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:17,271
Was that good?

1510
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,021
I think that that's great.

1511
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:22,125
Yeah, thank you all I let's let's do it.

1512
02:12:23,346 --> 02:12:35,680
I'll look at, I guess, starting in December, that first Thursday, being our potential potential one for them, and then we'll go from there into the next year.

1513
02:12:40,433 --> 02:12:44,076
All right, one final note for the evening.

1514
02:12:44,216 --> 02:12:50,902
So many of you have been following along with the comprehensive plan.

1515
02:12:51,982 --> 02:13:05,193
There's a draft that's been out for public comment for a couple of weeks now, and the comment period on that draft and the implementation chapter attached to it will be closing on Friday.

1516
02:13:06,314 --> 02:13:08,176
So if you or anyone you know has

1517
02:13:08,756 --> 02:13:20,186
Some ideas or comments on what's out there, we welcome them, but yeah we can send them in Friday, either to me, you guys have my address but also.

1518
02:13:21,214 --> 02:13:31,041
comp plan at medford-ma.gov, or you can visit the website that we have devoted to the comp plan, medfordcompplan.org.

1519
02:13:31,481 --> 02:13:33,562
And there's the draft on there.

1520
02:13:33,623 --> 02:13:39,106
There's an input form for if you want to submit input that way as well.

1521
02:13:39,927 --> 02:13:43,830
So please feel free to spread the word within your own networks.

1522
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:47,292
And of course, reach out if you have any comments or questions on that.

1523
02:13:50,755 --> 02:13:53,556
OK, I think we're ready to entertain the motion to adjourn.

1524
02:13:55,857 --> 02:13:56,637
Motion to adjourn.

1525
02:13:57,837 --> 02:13:58,377
And a second.

1526
02:13:59,418 --> 02:13:59,818
Seconded.

1527
02:14:01,978 --> 02:14:04,339
Oh, I said we'd be all roll call tonight.

1528
02:14:04,379 --> 02:14:05,920
So sure, Jackie Furtado.

1529
