    <p>[SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=534.042s">Paul</a>  McCaffrey 59 Prescott Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=537.724s">I</a>  want to thank the Council and the residents of Medford for allowing us to go and visit folks every day in different, different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=546.71s">You</a>  know, the, the one thing to take away from the with having therapy dogs is that <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=552.97s">It's</a>  kind of a force multiplier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=555.45s">Police</a>  departments and schools are using them to be kind of the first line of defense of bringing down tensions in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=564.532s">So</a>  one of the things is that you want to do before there's a tragic incident is to have dogs come in on a regular basis and make people comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=572.433s">Lilly</a>  tries every day to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=574.034s">And</a>  I appreciate the council's attention to the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=576.694s">And</a>  I hope that I can encourage more people to be therapy handlers in Medford.</p>

 <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=628.72s">Resolution</a>  to discuss concerns dealing with the Bedford Water Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=633.731s">to</a>  be resolved by the benefit City Council discuss concerns with the Medford Water Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=638.014s">We</a>  did receive two communications from the administration and I'll go over to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=642.358s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=644.6s">I</a>  appreciate bringing this forward to Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=647.702s">Let</a>  him indulge me with this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=650.385s">I</a>  know that I spoke to Mr. Stone King, supervisor who has now moved on to <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=660.749s">new</a>  community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=662.191s">And</a>  he passed along a letter that he asked if I, you know, could read he shared it with everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=670.699s">But</a>  for this is reading for Mr. Stone King says, dear Mayor Brianna Longo Cone, I'm writing to formally resign from the position as superintendent</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=689.991s">Thought</a>  it was a lot easier than that, didn't use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=693.414s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=693.934s">I</a>  appreciate you for indulging me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=707.506s">This</a>  new thing called the cell phone, it's trying to get used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=712.45s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=713.511s">It's</a>  something to do with these delicate fingers I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=725.384s">I</a>  promise, I'm almost there.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=736.367s">Yeah,</a>  can we have the therapy dog back in? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=738.528s">Round</a>  two? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=738.908s">Can</a>  we have round two of the therapy dog, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=744.489s">Where</a>  are you, Lily? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=745.189s">Okay,</a>  well.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=755.933s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=756.673s">All</a>  right, so I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=758.914s">He</a>  writes, I'm writing to formally resign from my position as Superintendent of Water and Sewer for the City of Medford effective April 5th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=766.436s">It</a>  is with heavy heart that I submit resignation as I've greatly appreciated the opportunities and experience I've gained in my time serving the City of Medford during my tenure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=776.599s">I</a>  have had the privilege of working under the leadership of DPW Commissioner Tim McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=780.582s">I</a>  must commend Commissioner McGiven for his professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=787.988s">His</a>  leadership has been a source of inspiration and guidance to me, and I am truly grateful for the support and mentorship he has provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=794.233s">I</a>  will strive to emulate his exemption leadership as I move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=799.175s">Despite</a>  the admirable qualities Commissioner McGiven have found myself increasingly frustrated with the administration's lack of action addressing critical issues within the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=807.858s">The</a>  recent handling supervisor of water and sewer job posting, coupled with the <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=814.46s">And</a>  something offers 0% costs of living increase for FY 24 has underscored and concerning absence of values you place in my position as well as the lack of priority place in the central matters, such as water main replacements, aging utility infrastructure staffing shortages and overall neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=832.739s">of</a>  the needs of the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=834.159s">I</a>  have worked tirelessly to address compliances issues, modernize departmental operations to highlight the pressing concerns surrounding the water distribution system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=844.921s">Regrettably,</a>  my pleas for assistance recognition of regulatory concerns and urgent calls for action seemingly fallen on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=854.103s">It</a>  is disheartening to feel ignored and undervalued in the position where the welfare of the community is at stake. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=859.924s">I</a>  believe that my efforts have made this positive impact, but there is still so much work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=866.146s">I</a>  have reached a point where I feel I have exhausted all avenues and effected meaningless change within the covered environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=872.008s">It</a>  is essential that the City refocuses its attention on critical infrastructure projects, staffing needs, and operational improvements to ensure the continued well-being of Medford and its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=883.032s">I'm</a>  deeply concerned the residents are unaware of the alarming conditions of the water system and its critical need for substantial improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=891.14s">Immediate</a>  focus and drastic change are essential to ensure the integrity of Medford water infrastructure <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=898.466s">as</a>  time is running out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=899.967s">I'm</a>  grateful for the opportunity to have served the city of Medford and valuable lessons I've learned along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=905.51s">I</a>  extend my deepest appreciation to all those who have supported and collaborated with me during my time here as those contributions have been instrumental in shaping my professional growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=914.974s">I</a>  wish the city of residence the best in the future and hope necessary steps will be taken to address the challenging challenges facing DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=922.638s">Thank</a>  you once again the opportunity to have been part of this community <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=926.62s">Sincerely,</a>  Dan Stone King. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=929.062s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. Stone King. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=932.044s">I</a>  had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Stone King and I had a great conversation with Tim McGibbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=939.158s">What</a>  I find appalling and what's frightening is that whenever lately, I don't know if we've followed along with my resolutions, we've always had something come back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=951.089s">Do</a>  you guys notice that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=952.571s">Every</a>  day after I bring something up, like even tonight, we have something about the water department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=957.796s">Why</a>  does it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=959.56s">Why</a>  does it take a negative resolution to make city administration move on something this important? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=965.503s">Mr.</a>  Stone King actually told me, we're not there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=969.664s">But</a>  he says he wants us to think in Medford as Flint, Michigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=973.606s">Now</a>  we know how bad Flint, Michigan is right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=975.827s">Now</a>  I said, Is it that bad? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=977.388s">When</a>  I talked to Tim, he says we're getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=980.851s">He</a>  was very excited when ARPA came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=984.934s">And</a>  the first phase of ARPA was meant for what? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=988.156s">Infrastructure</a>  needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=990.037s">So</a>  they had a plan in place to really start moving things along. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=994.2s">What</a>  he told me is that we're moving at a pace of about, what is it, a quarter or half a mile? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=998.123s">We</a>  need three miles a year to catch up in Medford for what the aging infrastructure that we have in our water department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1005.468s">What</a>  I found amazing to me is, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1007.824s">I</a>  don't know if people realize this, his position holds a license that you have to have to run the water department in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1015.449s">If</a>  you don't have the certain license, you're at serious risk of serious danger when it comes to your water quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1024.154s">So</a>  he's there having that license, which aren't many people that have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1028.377s">As</a>  a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1030.545s">As</a>  we speak right now, I believe Medford has hired Weston and Sampson, an outside agency, another outside company, paying them $200 an hour, an hour to sit in that office just to make sure that we have someone in place to qualify that our water is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1048.441s">Now,</a>  all this had to be done is a conversation and fair negotiation process to say, hey, what do we need to keep you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1055.555s">But</a>  I talked more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1056.615s">It</a>  wasn't about the money system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1058.836s">It</a>  was about the value. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1060.496s">He</a>  was in the position for two years, two years of vital, vital position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1065.457s">So</a>  do you know how many times he spoke to the mayor twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1068.658s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1073.699s">So</a>  we could say whatever we want and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1077.153s">And</a>  like I said, I'm gonna say it again, because there's a bunch of issues that I'll bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1080.474s">I</a>  want everybody to follow this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1081.734s">Because</a>  as I bring things up, all of a sudden we have resolutions from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1086.835s">It's</a>  funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1088.636s">But</a>  these are all too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1091.476s">Not</a>  for Weston and Sampson, they're making a killing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1093.257s">$1,600</a>  for today, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1094.597s">Eight</a>  hour days, $200 a day, $1,600 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1100.612s">Now,</a>  I'm gonna be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1102.094s">I've</a>  reached out to neighboring communities, asked them about this person with this license. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1106.618s">I've</a>  reached out to representatives MWRA that I know, from Medford, that hold that license. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1113.405s">Quote</a>  unquote, A, I would never come to Medford because the administration's a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1120.293s">And</a>  B, why would they leave? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1121.734s">They're</a>  making way more money where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1125.27s">So</a>  this is the problem that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1127.394s">And</a>  if you're watching, every week, it keeps piling on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1131.642s">It's</a>  the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1133.164s">It's</a>  a lack of leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1135.58s">So</a>  Mr. Stonekin wanted to send that along. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1137.801s">I</a>  know I had a great discussion with Tim McGibbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1140.963s">Tim</a>  did send over a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1143.405s">Everybody</a>  received the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1145.626s">And</a>  I shared that with Mr. Stoneking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1148.708s">And</a>  I said, well, he said, in typical fashion, nothing against Tim McGibbon and the DPW, because he works for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1156.886s">But</a>  all this does is just delay everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1160.367s">What</a>  do they say? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1160.867s">They're</a>  starting the process now to start looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1163.787s">And</a>  they've been working on it for a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1166.048s">His</a>  words were, quote unquote, it's just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1169.909s">That's</a>  what he's felt for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1171.389s">It's</a>  just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1172.269s">And</a>  I appreciate Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1173.549s">Listen,</a>  I know it's not Tim McGibbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1175.57s">I</a>  talked to Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1176.77s">His</a>  hands are tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1178.61s">We</a>  had a great discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1179.771s">And</a>  I understand his frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1183.231s">But</a>  we are where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1186.539s">So</a>  I thought I'd share another happy Medford story with everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1191.124s">And</a>  I know that council bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1193.266s">I</a>  know that he sent you have some administration, they sent some some messages to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1200.854s">Do</a>  you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1201.294s">Do</a>  you want me to read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1202.175s">I</a>  can read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1202.596s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1203.016s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1204.578s">And</a>  I also have the message here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1206.54s">And</a>  I do want to note that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1210.202s">We</a>  did have some of this discussion last budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1213.586s">We</a>  voted down the retained earnings to make sure that that funding was going to address infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1219.512s">That</a>  was the 1st time in a long time that that had happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1222.355s">But</a>  we do have this response from. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1225.243s">Commissioner</a>  McGivern. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1226.044s">It's</a>  dated April 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1229.427s">As</a>  you know, Dan Stone King, our former water superintendent, decided to leave the city of Medford for what he felt was a better opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1235.472s">Dan</a>  was a valuable member of the DPW leadership team and contributed significant improvements to the water and sewer division. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1241.037s">Dan's</a>  presentation of the state of the city's water system did not provide you with information on what steps and plans that the DPW <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1247.242s">with</a>  the support of the mayor have already taken to address our aging water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1250.585s">His</a>  letter unfortunately only focused on issues he felt were not getting enough attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1254.688s">It</a>  is worth balancing the minimal information he provided with a summary of actions that have taken place since I've been appointed leader of the DPW and before as city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1263.355s">It</a>  is important to highlight that the City of Medford purchases water from the MWRA and was responsible for distributing it to the ratepayers through a system of pipes, valves and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1271.562s">As</a>  part of this distribution, we regularly provide water quality testing to demonstrate the safety of our distribution system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1276.887s">The</a>  latest published information on Medford's water quality can be found at the MWRA website linked below. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1281.691s">This</a>  site is updated regularly with our testing information and ratepayers also receive a consumer confidence report from the MWRA in June that provides greater detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1290.919s">The</a>  web address is www.mwra.com, annual, water report, 2022 results, pdf, medford.pdf. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1300.216s">The</a>  city of Medford experienced a huge surge of roadway building and building development in the early part of the 20th century, so many of our water distribution pipes installed at that time were nearing the expected lifetime age of 75 to 100 years, with some lasting 120 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1313.822s">Knowing</a>  this fact, we completed an evaluation of our utility assets in 2020 when I was city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1319.324s">This</a>  study included, among other things, identifying the age, material, and quantity of our water distribution pipes based on the city's records. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1325.987s">This</a>  allowed the DPW to understand the needs of our water system, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1329.108s">and</a>  helped us identify steps to prepare for an increase in water main replacements throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1333.53s">When</a>  I became commissioner, we had recently suffered the loss of our longtime water superintendent, Dave Proctor, and I was tasked with finding a new person who could help us improve our water operations, assess our capital needs, and lead new initiatives to prepare <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1345.334s">for</a>  increasing our capacity to replace our aging water mains. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1349.056s">Mr.</a>  Stone King helped the DPW prepare a strategy that started in the 2024 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1353.579s">The</a>  goal of the strategy is to increase in-house and contracted water main relay capacity and align the development of the DPW capital improvement project to the needs of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1362.725s">We</a>  met with Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn in April of 2023 to discuss the strategy and steps we believe needed to be addressed in the FY24 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1370.772s">This</a>  resulted in the mayor beginning to formulate a communication plan, which is under development, as well as additions to the water and sewer operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1377.599s">These</a>  additions included a water supervisor position with an additional water quality coordinator and a deputy commissioner to oversee the operations of DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1385.786s">The</a>  water supervisor proposition is in front of you tonight to increase the compensation scale as it has been a significant challenge to attract a qualified candidate at the current scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1394.69s">We</a>  also included a plan to engage a consultant to help us develop a long-term rate study and indirect cost study. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1399.992s">We</a>  are currently working on these studies with Weston and Sampson. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1402.813s">These</a>  studies are critical to inform important decisions the City of Medford will need to make in the coming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1407.715s">The</a>  rate study will assess the needs of the system, contribute to the development of our capital project list, and identify rate and funding scenarios for a 10-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1415.638s">This</a>  information is critical to the long-term health and performance of our water distribution system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1420.14s">Both</a>  the utility asset evaluation as well as the long-term rate study are actions that the city had not done before, which presents its own unique challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1427.624s">We've</a>  also pursued initiatives that support these efforts, such as a hydraulic modeling of our entire system and developing a unidirectional regular flushing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1436.309s">The</a>  hydraulic modeling will help identify the cause of pressure or flow issues within the system, so those issues can be incorporated into capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1443.873s">There</a>  are also new initiatives related to our service lines, which are in response to new regulations that will go into effect later this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1450.115s">One</a>  of these initiatives is a lead service ordinance, which you'll be hearing more about shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1454.037s">It's</a>  worth noting that this letter only summarizes the work taking place for us to prepare us for replacing our aging water infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1460.562s">We</a>  also have aging pavement infrastructure, which must be coordinated with the water infrastructure work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1465.665s">As</a>  you know, these infrastructure assets are not the only ones that need more attention in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1469.628s">since</a>  proper asset management is costly over many years, it is critically important that we work together to evaluate, prepare, and execute projects as we march towards having systems and funding in place for long-term infrastructure performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1480.958s">In</a>  closing, we certainly have a lot of work to do with our water system, but we are taking the proper steps to plan for increasing the length of water main we replace each year and increasing the water quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1490.525s">This</a>  will take time, and effective partnerships between the mayor, city council, and DPW will be critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1496.718s">That</a>  is Mr. McGivern's letter, and I will note that Mr. McGivern did answer many questions on this in the last budget, including the scope of the problem being $500 million to $1 billion long-term problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1509.681s">So</a>  that was discussed a year ago in the budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1513.042s">I</a>  also met with Mr. Stone King and Mr. McGivern around the proposed lead service ordinance last year, and we had discussions along the lines, basically, of what Mr. McGivern just put out in this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1525.104s">And</a>  I was also asking many of the same questions that Mr. McGivern was asking here, that Mr. Stoneking was asking in his letter of the mayor, which is, when are we going to know the scope and scale of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1535.331s">And</a>  they said, basically, we need the long term rate study in place now that we have looked at the, we know what our assets are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1542.636s">There</a>  wasn't even an asset inventory in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1544.677s">That</a>  exists now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1545.898s">we</a>  now we need the long term rate study to go back and say, this is what it's going to cost in the long term to rate payers to fix the system, which I think both in the last budget season and in that meeting that I had, they referred to as one of the three oldest systems in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1559.222s">So</a>  that is where we are at. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1562.763s">And</a>  that is the letter from Mr. McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1566.104s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1567.764s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, and then Councilor Callahan, and then Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1571.165s">I</a>  appreciate Director McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1575.899s">But</a>  to my fellow councillors, is this not a theme that we see? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1584.245s">City</a>  Hall needs to be done, we're gonna set up a committee, we're gonna look at development, we're gonna set a consultant, we're gonna look into things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1594.754s">Everything</a>  is, just like Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1598.316s">Stoneking</a>  said to me, it's all talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1601.974s">This</a>  is a director of DPW speaking for his boss, who's over and over again shown that nothing's getting done, zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1611.942s">We're</a>  not getting anything done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1614.003s">We</a>  talk about multi-million dollar issues, that we had it right in our hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1618.066s">We</a>  had millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1620.448s">When</a>  ARPA came out, that we could still use for infrastructure needs, that we did nothing, zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1628.974s">But</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1630.609s">Mr.</a>  Stonekirk writes this letter, I put it on as a resolution, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1635.111s">The</a>  position that hasn't gotten any movement for months comes to us tonight for a change in CAF so we can raise it, so we can get better, we can entice people to come out now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1647.817s">So</a>  this is exactly what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1651.375s">What's</a>  that saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1651.995s">It's</a>  a dog wagging its tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1655.896s">What's</a>  that state? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1656.656s">The</a>  tail wagging its dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1657.497s">Tail</a>  wagging its dog, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1658.997s">And</a>  this is what I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1661.557s">Honestly,</a>  sometimes it's like watching a dog chase its tail with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1667.179s">So</a>  we've known since the mayor's been in 2020 that we've had a huge issue here and that it was compiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1675.041s">But</a>  now all of a sudden, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1677.239s">in</a>  her 50 years, we're gonna now go into this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1683.003s">I</a>  wish you put together a pilot program or a committee like she did with the finance, with the water department that April as well, and maybe we can get something going, but we still have seen nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1693.59s">We're</a>  still seeing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1694.471s">This</a>  still doesn't do us any, it doesn't do anybody any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1698.033s">So</a>  again, I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1701.243s">The</a>  answer, but it just only leads to the same old lack of leadership and the same old destructing, destroyed Medford that has nothing moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1713.122s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1714.565s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1714.945s">We</a>  also had this from the director of communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1719.129s">Steve</a>  Smurdy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1719.77s">Hello,</a>  Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1720.55s">I</a>  want to provide some additional information regarding the city's ARPA allocations for water and sewer projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1726.375s">Since</a>  the fall of 2021, the city has invested over 4 million in 13 projects that address critical water infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1732.621s">Among</a>  those projects are sewer system lining, sealing and testing, DPW water meter system replacement project, lead service line replacement rebate program, infiltration and inflow <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1742.109s">infiltration</a>  and inflow control plan, rights upon dam maintenance, Winthrop Street water main replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1748.212s">In</a>  addition to strengthening our water sewer system, the mayor has been working with City Engineer Wartella and DPW Commissioner McGibbon to address the over 100 million backlog in street repairs due to neglect over the past few decades by identifying projects that were close to beginning construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1762.258s">The</a>  administration was able to deploy ARPA funding across multiple road infrastructure projects including <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1767.2s">patchwork</a>  on 34 streets identified in the pavement assessment, intersection improvements at Spring Street and Central Avenue, Pinker Street Roadway and utility construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1776.827s">The</a>  mayor is also hoping to allocate $1 million in ARPA funding to continue the repair work of the city's sidewalks, as well as additional tree stump removals in 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1784.031s">You</a>  can read more about the work already done on sidewalks and stumps on the city website, and you can view a full list of projects, as well as a dive deeper into project descriptions by visiting the city website medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1797.441s">slash</a>  department slash finance slash ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1801.545s">Councilor</a>  Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1802.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1803.447s">So</a>  to me, these letters were a <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1808.103s">quite</a>  frightening reminder that our water pipes are 100 years old, almost older than any other city, and that instead of over the decades spending the money that came in through our water system on the water system and replacing these pipes for decades, that that money went into the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1831.937s">and</a>  was spent on other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1833.518s">And</a>  so we have, for decades, not improved our water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1838.16s">We</a>  have, for decades, not improved our roads, which is why that 49% of our roads as of 2021, hard to know whether that's improved or gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1851.014s">probably</a>  has gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1853.135s">49%</a>  of our roads are in the worst two classes of roads out of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1857.098s">That's</a>  the most expensive kinds to replace, to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1861.682s">Our</a>  schools, which are 20 years old, have not been properly maintained for the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1867.787s">Salaries,</a>  and we talk about the salary of this particular position in the water department, but salaries across the city are not commensurate with other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1880.168s">So</a>  we can't find people to fill a lot of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1882.87s">It's</a>  not just that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1883.931s">There</a>  are a lot of positions we cannot find people to fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1888.854s">Previous</a>  administrations have been like 30, 40 years ago were given a city in pretty good shape and did not do the repairs that were needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1901.104s">And</a>  that has left us in a position that I'm really, they've kicked the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1905.886s">And</a>  I'm trying to understand what kind of management style it would make up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1910.188s">I</a>  mean, if $500 million is the amount to repair our water system, and we know that it's $100 million probably or more to repair the roads, get the roads back into shape, there isn't a style of management that can <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1925.339s">magically</a>  make that money up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1928.8s">My</a>  thing about the management is not that I'm making any kind of statement, but my statement is about the funding that we have to do the absolute basics necessary for a city to function. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1942.622s">You</a>  cannot have water pipes that function. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1946.143s">You</a>  do not have a city, functional city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1948.083s">You</a>  don't have roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1949.524s">These</a>  are the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1951.164s">And</a>  this isn't purely the fault of this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1954.687s">This</a>  is something that we have kicked the can down the road for many decades until we find ourselves by doing things that were financially irresponsible, but were made taxpayers happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1969.817s">And</a>  now we're in a position where we have had that situation going on for so long that we're going straight off a cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1986.826s">I</a>  talked to some of the engineering folks about the water systems, and they said, oh, you know, there is money coming into the water system that we can use to repair it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1996.553s">But</a>  of course, that money used to go to other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=1999.655s">That</a>  money has always come in, and it used to go to the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2003.077s">So</a>  now that money isn't going to be going to the things that it used to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2007.14s">So</a>  those things will go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2009.081s">There</a>  is not enough funding to take care of the financial irresponsibility of former administrations and former city councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2017.827s">really</a>  administrations because the state councils do not have do not have hardly any effect on the budget because it's really up in the hands of the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2026.513s">I</a>  just want to clarify one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2028.334s">The</a>  common practice, as far as I was aware, was that funds that were called retained earnings, which were surplus funds gathered by rate payers in the enterprise fund that funds water and sewer, that those funds were returned to rate payers to keep rates low. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2045.045s">So</a>  it wasn't that they were in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2046.466s">It's</a>  that the council, the mayor requested, the mayor, excuse me, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2051.769s">Thank</a>  you, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2052.65s">I</a>  don't want to get into this again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2054.231s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2056.94s">The</a>  council, many mayors and many councils, mayors recommended, water and sewer commissions recommended, and councils voted to return retained earnings to taxpayers on the orders of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2069.816s">And</a>  those are funds that could have gone to maintenance of the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2073.24s">Vice</a>  President, that's just the facts, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2075.362s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2077.998s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2080.119s">I</a>  think it's a good idea for us to have this discussion, you know, to use the word from your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2085.782s">We</a>  know we're coming up on budget.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2088.223s">Please</a>  don't shout from the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2090.284s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2091.084s">Please</a>  don't shout from the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2092.045s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2094.206s">Please</a>  don't shout from the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2095.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2097.047s">Please</a>  don't shout from the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2098.208s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2104.211s">No,</a>  you shouldn't be shouting from the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2106.312s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2110.988s">but</a>  I know I'm not loud enough to talk over people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2113.249s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I appreciate the resolution to discuss the water and sewer department, especially as we're coming right up on budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2121.072s">This</a>  is a conversation that we're going to have anyway, and as other councilors have noted, this is a conversation that we've had every year in the past two budget cycles that I have been a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2130.896s">you</a>  know, this is a, this has been raised as a multi-million dollar issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2138.057s">We</a>  know that it will take multi-millions of dollars to make good on this investment, to bring ourselves out of the rear of all cities and towns in Massachusetts when it comes to our water infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2150.86s">I</a>  believe that Commissioner McGibbon told us during our budget hearing last year that we're one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2158.728s">The</a>  three cities with the oldest water infrastructure in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2161.659s">That's</a>  that's not a <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2164.744s">end</a>  of the ladder that any of us want to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2168.085s">And</a>  we know that this is multi-millions of dollars in the fixing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2172.067s">This</a>  is many decades in the making. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2174.828s">One</a>  thing that I do find heartening from the letters from the administration, from letters from current and former members of DPW leadership that I think is heartening, is that there's a clear mutual respect from Commissioner McGivern and former Superintendent Stoneking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2190.255s">That</a>  mutual respect within the DPW leadership <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2194.458s">you</a>  know, and knowing that this is a shared priority between the DPW, between the City Council, between the administration, we know that we need to look for <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2205.37s">We</a>  need to look for assets wherever we can find them with this big of an infrastructural project ahead of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2212.639s">As</a>  was stated earlier, we were the first council to vote to keep retained earnings within the Water and Sewer Department so that it could go towards funding infrastructure repairs and improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2221.87s">Obviously</a>  that is a small first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2226.806s">we</a>  have a ways to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2228.487s">I</a>  am glad for any steps in the right direction that were taken by ARPA, that were taken by Superintendent Stone King during his tenure, and that I know that Commissioner McGivern is working hard on every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2239.393s">And</a>  I think it is one of the things that rang most loudly for me from Commissioner McGivern's letter to the city council was that all of these major infrastructural efforts <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2252.301s">between</a>  bringing our water infrastructure up to par and our roads infrastructure up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2258.483s">You</a>  know, we got at least 500 million on the water side. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2263.004s">I</a>  believe it's maybe even at least 200 million if we really wanna get every road where we know residents want them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2269.766s">These</a>  things have to be done in concert, be done efficiently to make sure that we're making the best use of every dollar because we have to use so many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2278.888s">Last</a>  point I wanna make for now, I did, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2281.363s">Commissioner</a>  given noted the most recent report from the M. W. R. A. On the state of Medford sweater, which is from 2021 in his letter to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2290.848s">I</a>  did follow that read through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2292.949s">I</a>  think that it's worth noting that when it comes to when it comes to our water infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2298.925s">We</a>  know, because everybody has cited, that some of our pipes are 120 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2303.929s">We</a>  also know that the most recent report from the MWRA is that our drinking water is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2308.472s">And</a>  we also know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure that it stays that way without interruption for all future generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2314.057s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2316.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2316.679s">Any</a>  further comment by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2319.701s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2321.061s">very</a>  briefly because I think a lot of what I would say has been covered by the three councillors who've spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2327.586s">I</a>  think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2330.034s">When</a>  past administrations were looking at the water infrastructure in the city, it was easy, since everything was built around the same time, to say that we didn't need to make these investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2338.94s">But</a>  we always do need a longer-term outlook about how we're going to fund projects, even decades in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2347.246s">It</a>  was disappointing, and it is disappointing to us that that wasn't done decades prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2352.269s">But</a>  it is, I think, a good step for us to start with that study about the rates going forward, because <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2360.094s">that.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2360.254s">Such</a>  a large scale of infrastructure improvement will need a lot of communication with our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2366.059s">And</a>  if you know, and I think it's becoming clear through this discussion through discussions in the past during the budget seasons that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2374.746s">Money</a>  is a huge factor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2377.028s">And</a>  so if money is a big question here, we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2384.155s">something</a>  like that rate study is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2386.639s">Now,</a>  another thing can also be true that I think Councilor Scarpelli raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2392.881s">we</a>  need better follow through on these reports, on these committees that are created from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2400.847s">For</a>  example, the classification study is something that we still haven't seen over years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2406.551s">We</a>  were promised this years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2408.733s">And</a>  that's something that affects the items on our agenda, like the CAF amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2416.519s">to</a>  the superintendent of water role. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2420.403s">We</a>  need to follow up on these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2421.724s">Now</a>  as a city council, I think we've done better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2424.586s">I</a>  think we've worked together, especially Councilor Scarpelli and us, we've worked together to push the administration to keep them accountable on those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2434.796s">We</a>  need to keep doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2436.297s">We</a>  need to keep making the historic investments that we haven't been making as a city council that we made for the first time last year in the water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2444.805s">And</a>  I think that's very, very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2446.967s">I</a>  know there's lots to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2448.509s">There's</a>  this is a very complex issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2450.851s">I</a>  think. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2452.052s">a</a>  commission to begin Burns letter does actually point to a lot of substantive steps being taken in terms of, um, physical improvements to the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2460.554s">Um,</a>  not just the monetary side of things, but there's lots of follow through to, uh, to for us to hold to account.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2471.156s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng any further comments from members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2475.197s">Seeing</a>  none of their emotion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2480.515s">Vice</a>  President Collins, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2493.064s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2497.407s">Is</a>  there any public participation on the matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2499.489s">I</a>  see one hand on Zoom and one person in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2502.371s">We'll</a>  go to the chamber first. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=2503.712s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

afar, from distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3141.567s">Some</a>  of our heroes live right amongst us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3145.588s">I</a>  haven't spoken in this council chamber for over 40 years, close to 40 years anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3152.652s">And</a>  I'm so proud that I had the opportunity to serve with an honorable man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3157.294s">I</a>  sometimes didn't disagree with Jack McClain. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3161.388s">I</a>  wouldn't agree with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3162.588s">I</a>  wouldn't agree with myself again if I had the opportunity to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3169.65s">But</a>  he kept his nose clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3171.77s">He</a>  was an honorable man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3173.65s">He</a>  played it close to the vest, and I was more outspoken, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3182.132s">But</a>  don't look too far to see who your heroes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3186.813s">They</a>  live on Lapham Street on Costello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3190.652s">Jack</a>  McGlynn was a true American hero. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3194.033s">He</a>  served in the war. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3196.474s">I</a>  think I'm getting choked up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3199.054s">That</a>  ghost army was really something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3202.315s">What</a>  heroes they were making noise over here to get the Germans to come and look when they were really over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3212.398s">I</a>  am not going to take much of your time just to let you know that I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3218.797s">We</a>  are very honored to have such a decent man in our midst. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3222.24s">And</a>  his wife was terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3224.102s">Helen,</a>  I used to call her the first lady of Medford all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3228.185s">She</a>  was terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3229.927s">Jack</a>  McGlynn was an honorable man, even though I didn't sometimes agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3234.33s">Maybe</a>  I wasn't so honorable, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3237.233s">But</a>  you ought to be so proud to be sitting in those seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3241.897s">I</a>  look back at my days in the legislature and my days sitting over there with great pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3247.664s">When</a>  the people of the city vote for you and say, take care of our business, that really means something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3253.25s">It</a>  means they trust you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3254.772s">It</a>  means they want you to do the right thing by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3259.577s">And</a>  I'm sure you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3261.978s">It</a>  was an honor to sit here, it's an honor to speak here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3266.56s">I'm</a>  not gonna take any more of your time, except to let you know that I feel that sometimes honorable people don't get mentioned enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3274.704s">Jack</a>  Wicklin was an honorable man, whether I agreed with him or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3279.506s">Agreeing</a>  with me didn't make you honorable or dishonorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3282.948s">It</a>  meant that we just agreed or we didn't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3287.13s">But</a>  in those days, seats were different. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3290.68s">The</a>  council has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3292.301s">They</a>  had pews over here, rows. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3295.521s">And</a>  I wish they were back, to be very frank. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3298.182s">I</a>  wish they were back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3301.523s">I</a>  don't know what else to say, but I hate to give this microphone up after all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3309.505s">I'm</a>  not going to give it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3310.486s">I</a>  want to take it with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3313.947s">Well.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3317.177s">When</a>  you get elected, that's an honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3319.678s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3320.458s">Think</a>  about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3321.498s">Think</a>  about the thousands of people who put their necks beside your name because they wanted you to be here speaking for them and not listening to Kavanaugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3332.941s">But</a>  I enjoyed my days here, and I enjoyed my days in the legislature, and I enjoyed being a representative of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3340.683s">And</a>  I'm sure that you all do also. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3342.928s">So</a>  with that, I'm out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3345.032s">See</a>  you in 40 years again.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3346.175s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3347.838s">If</a>  I can, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3364.682s">Yeah,</a>  if I can, Judge Kavanaugh, if you can, if you honor me just for a moment, it takes a great man to know a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3384.206s">So</a>  I think that it's important that Medford knows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3397.346s">You</a>  know, talk about a legend. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3404.732s">He's</a>  uh Judge Kavanaugh is is uh someone we should all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3409.455s">So,</a>  sometimes what he just said, sometimes I get offended now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3414.039s">Some</a>  of my behavior sometimes when you have honorable people like that approach the bench and um I remember as a young man, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3428.529s">to</a>  speak on behalf of another great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3432.049s">We're</a>  losing our heroes, and the gentleman who's leaving the chamber right now is one of those people, so we should give him what he deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3440.491s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3443.351s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Secretary.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3454.891s">the</a>  first person I canvassed this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3459.873s">I</a>  went to his house, and he was the first person I spoke to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3462.735s">And</a>  he gave me really, really good advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3465.416s">He</a>  said to make sure that you earn votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3468.918s">You</a>  don't just ask for them, you have to earn them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3471.038s">So</a>  I appreciated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3473.119s">We</a>  had a nice chat.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3474.44s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3475.36s">I</a>  appreciate you being here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3478.027s">And</a>  just for folks watching and to note once again what Judge Kavanaugh was saying, we did dedicate and commemorate our last meeting in honor of Jack McGlynn and his service in the Ghost Army, which as folks can look up online, was made up of a few thousand folks who looked like 50,000 and made the German Nazi armies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3505.458s">think</a>  that there were mass mobilizations in one place or the other, but they had tanks, blow up tanks, and there was a signal core sending false radio transmissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3514.542s">It's</a>  impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3516.203s">And</a>  I'll just reiterate my favorite anecdote from that was when Mayor Mike McGlynn, Jack McGlynn's son, got a call from a newspaper after some documents had been declassified in the 1990s. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3529.188s">And</a>  he called his dad and he said, dad, what's this ghost army that they called about? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3534.03s">The</a>  newspaper's calling, he said, who called you about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3538.112s">He</a>  wanted to call the Pentagon and make sure that there hadn't been a leak of classified information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3544.015s">He</a>  hadn't told his own son 50 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3546.035s">And</a>  I think that speaks to the humility of that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3550.237s">And</a>  they were honored with the, excuse me, they were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal, that entire unit, all the units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3558.319s">Public</a>  participation, is there anyone else who would like to participate for public participation in the chambers? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3564.981s">Just</a>  in general, there is, of course, participation on the additional items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3571.623s">Seeing</a>  none of the chambers, we do have one on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3573.624s">I</a>  see a hand, Bill Giglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3576.985s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3579.505s">Hi,</a>  Bill Giglio, Winterspeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3581.607s">I</a>  just have three very quick things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3583.668s">I</a>  didn't get my hand raised quick enough on the first resolution about the pet therapy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3588.512s">That's</a>  really, really, really good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3590.213s">It's</a>  worked for me in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3591.914s">And</a>  I've known it to work for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3594.576s">And</a>  that's a really great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3595.697s">So</a>  I appreciate you putting that through. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3597.978s">Second,</a>  Winter Street was freshly repaved about, I don't know, a year or so ago, and parts of it, especially where I live down by the high school, are already being dug up, and it's being patched, and now it obviously already looks horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3611.243s">Does</a>  anybody happen to know what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3613.144s">I</a>  know you might not know what's going on, but does anybody happen to know why it's being dug up already?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3618.394s">I</a>  don't know why, but I do know that under the city's rules, any reopenings within five years of a repaving require curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3626.281s">So</a>  if you want to email me, let me know where that's being temporarily patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3631.005s">I</a>  can let you know when their plans are to do a full curb-to-curb repaving, because that is the city rule on that.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3638.749s">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3639.65s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3640.572s">And</a>  also getting back I know on the first thing on the on the body cams from earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3646.9s">It</a>  was a very good meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3648.281s">I</a>  just want to say, Chief Buckley put on a great presentation very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3652.907s">Unfortunately,</a>  at the end he got he got bombarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3655.911s">with</a>  a bunch of nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3656.992s">And</a>  I just, I honestly think it was unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3659.713s">And</a>  I would honestly love to see that subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3662.335s">I</a>  mean, he was visibly upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3664.816s">He</a>  was called a lot of unnecessary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3667.378s">And</a>  I think maybe like an apology, maybe a written apology or some sort of formal apology to Chief Buckley would really be in line, in my personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3677.564s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3678.752s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3679.052s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3679.893s">And</a>  I know that members of the committee did speak to the chief after, you know, one of the public participation rules, the most recent Supreme Judicial Court ruling is that we cannot prevent anyone from, we cannot regulate the content of any public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3695.905s">So</a>  people are able to say whatever they think, other than they can't be swearing or, you know, being vulgar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3702.91s">But</a>  other than that, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3704.271s">We</a>  can't regulate the content of what anyone's saying, so while I understand the frustration when public comments may not be what folks want to hear, and I understand the Chief's frustration at public comments that he did not want to hear, the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that people can say what they want to say, and the only rules that we can set are around how long folks have to speak and when they can speak.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3726.055s">Well,</a>  if they did speak to him after that, I'd like to say I appreciate that, because it was a little, you know, my opinion, a lot of it was uncalled for, and if they spoke to him after, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3735.423s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3736.704s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3738.746s">Any</a>  further public participation before we resume the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3747.633s">We</a>  did have two public comment emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3749.254s">Is</a>  there a motion on the public comment emails to enter them into the record?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3751.636s">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3752.85s">on</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to enter public comment emails into the record, seconded by Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3760.852s">Madam</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3768.035s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3769.255s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3770.635s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3772.136s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3773.596s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3774.517s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3775.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3777.298s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3778.738s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3780.459s">Councilor</a>  Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3781.519s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3782.574s">Councilor</a>  Tseng yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3784.255s">President</a>  beers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3785.336s">Yes,</a>  I mean from another negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3786.997s">Those</a>  emails will be included as part of the official record of the meeting. <a href="../resolutions/24-076.pdf"><font color="green">24-076</font></a> be resolved by the city council that we requested the city administration provide a full report involving the use of taxpayer dollars being used to fund lawsuit settlements and investigations with city of Medford, active and past employees.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3805.468s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the city council moved to executive session if needed to discuss sensitive funding information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3810.031s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3811.554s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3813.935s">And</a>  again, I think that there's a dialogue that's being that's that's created now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3818.477s">And</a>  I hope everybody's really watching and listening because we're hearing a lot lately about lack of funding, lack of management, saying it's not mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3829.36s">But</a>  what we're seeing in what the dialogue that I'm trying to show everyone is that <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3838.131s">We</a>  have rules in this council that any awards over $5,000 have to be approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3845.414s">We</a>  know of many, multiple, multiple hundreds of thousands of settlements that have been put out there that I've talked to different representatives that we know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3856.297s">So</a>  anytime we have these issues and we have these issues that come up and questions that come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3864.522s">It</a>  seems like they're hidden agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3867.524s">We've</a>  been asking, for instance, what we paid KP Law since they've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3872.708s">Now</a>  we voted on what? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3874.809s">$5,000</a>  for a retainer so they can be on staff for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3879.493s">Well,</a>  now that's blown up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3880.533s">Now</a>  we don't know what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3881.614s">I</a>  know that if it goes by the trend of December, which is close to $80,000 for the month of December, that's pretty frightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3890.04s">And</a>  that's not including other things we know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3893.208s">So</a>  I bring this up to ask the mayor, especially before the budget season and before my colleagues asked him that what we're seeing a trend of possibly asking for taxpayers to be penalized for the lack of mismanagement and what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3908.381s">When</a>  I say lack of mismanagement, we see a mayor speaking for years at debates talking about new growth and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3919.494s">At</a>  the debate with Councilor Caraviello, she spoke and saying that we have three projects ready to go that raise millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3926.779s">Those</a>  projects are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3927.96s">That's</a>  why I asked, I asked for the Office of Community Development to come out because we had 40B jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3934.244s">Remember</a>  we talked about the mismanagement of the 40B jobs and losing over 600 housing units for affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3942.56s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3943.321s">We</a>  lost millions and millions and millions of dollars for fees, fines and new taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3948.446s">It's</a>  called new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3949.827s">We</a>  haven't had that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3951.308s">We</a>  had the mayor talk about Method Square, starting Method Square, shovels in the ground, bringing millions of dollars of revenue, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3959.596s">We've</a>  seen nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3961.621s">So</a>  when I say mismanagement, it's mismanagement of understanding of where we're going in the direction we're going in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3970.311s">We</a>  can say we didn't fund anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3972.573s">We</a>  can say that we're putting money into the general account. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3975.216s">And</a>  the reason why we have to put in general account is because our management <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3979.682s">isn't</a>  following through with the promises that they've made of transparency and follow through for new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3986.087s">We</a>  haven't seen any of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3987.808s">This</a>  is why we're going to general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3989.49s">This</a>  is why the money that was earmarked for one thing has to go to another thing, because we're losing that money because we're not the mismanagement of our finances in the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=3999.517s">I'm</a>  gonna give you some examples that I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4001.358s">I'm</a>  asking the mayor for a report, meeting executive sessions, not to know anybody's names, but to understand that, where is this going? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4012.847s">We're</a>  looking for mismanagement of finance for City of Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4015.709s">So</a>  I would like to see the dismissals of city staff, and then the lawsuits filed by that city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4023.475s">The</a>  cost of investigating <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4027.025s">these</a>  city staff members, the cost for hiring private investigators, this I'm even hearing, and this is what the problem is when you have lack of transparency and lack of openness, central administration, that I believe the firefighters were told to be careful because people are watching them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4046.879s">And</a>  this is this is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4048.661s">This</a>  is what happens because it's been done before. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4051.63s">There's</a>  a city, there's a DPW employee that was followed for months, months by a private investigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4058.554s">He</a>  was let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4060.515s">He's</a>  right now in active, it's in an active process right now, but they've already told him, the courts have already ruled, there was nothing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4070.5s">We</a>  wasted thousands and thousands of dollars on investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4074.803s">We're</a>  looking at the cost of legal representation for all these cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4079.434s">Forget</a>  about the 40 B cases that you know, they could have won. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4083.939s">It's</a>  an automatic, you can't fight a 40 B and lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4086.922s">All</a>  you can do is string it along a long enough time so the developers can back out because they're losing so much in funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4095.831s">Well,</a>  that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4097.893s">One</a>  project we had, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4102.188s">A</a>  development company went bankrupt after four years, they're gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4106.11s">The</a>  40B projects, they waited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4108.351s">We</a>  know the world's the gold gym site. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4111.212s">The</a>  owner spent over $12 million to keep that going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4114.414s">Well,</a>  the investors in that job had done what now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4116.955s">They've</a>  said, you know what, enough is enough, we're moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4119.777s">The</a>  project on Boston Ave that I believe they're talking about possibly putting in a mosque now, five acres putting to a mosque, lack of taxpayer money, lack of new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4130.953s">Think</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4132.294s">Understand</a>  the mismanagement and what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4135.157s">That's</a>  where where's the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4136.438s">Why</a>  is there money there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4138.38s">Why</a>  are we looking now to look at a pretty pretty outrageous and intense movements to try to bring new money in through the tax payers? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4148.564s">We</a>  can't do that until we see where the mismanagement is coming at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4153.913s">We</a>  see the city, the staffing that has to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4157.318s">I</a>  would ask for the record that the mayor please <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4162.836s">inform</a>  us the cost of any consultants or per diem staff that she has in place right now, she has in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4170.342s">And</a>  I say, let's say four years since you've been in office, and what we're paying out the staff that she hasn't filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4176.226s">And</a>  it's not because it's not because people are leaving because they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4184.693s">They're</a>  being pushed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4186.354s">You're</a>  talking about good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4188.348s">We</a>  haven't even heard the case haven't heard about about Aleesha Nunley, the best finance director in the Commonwealth, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4196.414s">Mike</a>  Durham, the best veterans affairs director that method has ever seen the state has ever seen gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4205.061s">You're</a>  talking about settlements that I know that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4207.743s">Did</a>  you did you know the custodians settled on their their legal issues that they were they were given back $500,000 that the city reimbursed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4217.657s">They</a>  were rewarded that did we vote on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4220.839s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4222.42s">So</a>  the cost of settlements, the cities in the schools, I want to know what that what those numbers are not the people, but what the numbers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4232.325s">And</a>  the cost of the law firms because I know it's just not KP law, you can see that when we say KP law, everybody picks on them, because they're in front of us every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4241.39s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4243.188s">We</a>  have multiple, multiple law offices that are working for the city of Medford, multiple. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4250.091s">And</a>  it hurts me because I see new Councilors giving reports that they met with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4258.475s">It's</a>  funny because some of our Councilors, Justin and I laughed the other day when Matt talked about, Councilor Leming talked about he met with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4267.839s">I</a>  was never given, no one's ever told me we could talk to KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4271.343s">But</a>  I would love to know what that costs, because an in-house city solicitor is part of their salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4278.344s">It</a>  makes it so easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4280.885s">So</a>  when we look at this resolution, this is really to get a report before the budget comes out, before we look at some drastic changes, because I don't know if people heard, but I believe the school department has $7.5 million to get leveled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4296.227s">Is</a>  that what we're hearing? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4297.488s">7.5</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4301.704s">Now,</a>  now I'm going to guarantee you everybody, the rainy day account. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4306.927s">Why</a>  does somebody want to bring the rainy day account in? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4309.269s">She's</a>  got to put the money from somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4311.971s">So</a>  she wants to take it from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4313.532s">I'm</a>  going to let everybody know this is what it is because I've been here a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4316.614s">She's</a>  going to go to free cash, call it a rainy day account and pull out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4320.396s">Is</a>  it truly $7.5 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4322.177s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4324.199s">Everybody</a>  nervous about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4325.48s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4326.08s">You</a>  should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4326.921s">That's</a>  a scary number. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4328.622s">It's</a>  still going to be a scary number. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4331.377s">But</a>  the mismanagement of this city, the mismanagement of the school department, the mismanagement of the finances and that office in this city has been devastating to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4342.882s">Not</a>  only lack of new growth, but also in fraudulent and misleading and legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4356.587s">And</a>  again, we don't know what they are, we can only speculate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4359.529s">This</a>  is why I asked the mayor to bring us a report in the executive session so my fellow councils can look at this when it comes down to understanding some of the comments that my fellow councils have made in the past about looking at different funding mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4376.423s">going</a>  back to the taxpayers and saying, hey, we need we need X amount of money $250 million for new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4383.469s">And</a>  I believe it was I've talked to new school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4386.312s">I</a>  know we have some people in the audience right now that worked on this new school projects before I've talked to people in Somerville just did a new school people in Arlington to think in this climate of $7.5 million in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4399.443s">that</a>  the school committee is going to come to us and ask us for $2.5 million so they can start the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4405.729s">And</a>  we don't even know. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4406.73s">I</a>  think it starts at 30% reimbursement of a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4413.275s">We</a>  don't even know what it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4415.871s">the</a>  feasibility study $2.5 million when we don't even know if we're going to come close to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4421.157s">And</a>  from what I'm gathering from my friends that I have in the state, it's not very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4426.122s">So</a>  the reason why I bring this up in this, this is, this is hopefully we can go to do I think it's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4432.329s">Probably</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4433.03s">We're</a>  never going to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4434.352s">But</a>  the hope is to go on executive session with the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4437.97s">with</a>  her legal team, with the HR director, with the chief of staff with the mayor with us sit there and say, Okay, this is what we spent the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4446.696s">These</a>  are lawsuits that are pending, because I know there are lawsuits out there right now that they're trying to settle out of court. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4453.381s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4454.821s">So</a>  there's hundreds of 1000s of millions of dollars out there that still have to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4460.105s">And</a>  in the meantime, we have nothing new going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4463.067s">Oh,</a>  I take it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4465.629s">We</a>  have a music venue going on in Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4468.49s">You</a>  know, Mystic Ave, we're supposed to change the zoning, the gateway community is gonna come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4474.872s">What's</a>  the talk now? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4475.772s">We</a>  have one building being talked about, one building and nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4482.695s">So</a>  I ask again, my fellow councilors, as we go through this process of looking to where the needs are in our city, we all know <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4491.109s">We're</a>  fiscally strapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4492.11s">We</a>  all know we're in crisis financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4496.073s">And</a>  possibly, if it came down and we could sit together with the administration and they can show us, they can show me that, you know what, George, this is the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4508.002s">You</a>  know, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4509.963s">We</a>  didn't lose millions of dollars in new tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4512.385s">We</a>  didn't lose millions of dollars in new fees and fees in permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4517.188s">We</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4518.775s">We</a>  didn't lose millions of dollars on on settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4521.836s">We</a>  didn't lose millions of dollars on on legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4526.719s">If</a>  they can show me that I will be the first one to vote yes on anything that you ask for an increase in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4533.522s">But</a>  until they can show us <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4536.755s">that</a>  they're not mismanaging our funds, because this is what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4540.216s">The</a>  city council, we're in charge with a fiscal stewards of our our city's finances, with the last line of defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4547.619s">So</a>  unless we can prove that they can prove that all we'll be doing moving forward, and any sort of tax, any sort of override any sort of debt exclusion, it's putting more money into a hole that'll disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4561.544s">Period.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4564.127s">I</a>  think we're all smart enough to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4565.988s">So</a>  this is why I bring this resolution up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4568.508s">I</a>  ask the mayor to please bring this forward, that she meets with us in executive session to give us a breakdown, to prove me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4576.791s">I</a>  hope she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4578.451s">Come</a>  prove me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4579.691s">Tell</a>  me we're not spending millions and millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4584.653s">And</a>  then we could see a way that we can find a way to fund the city the way it needs to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4589.034s">But</a>  until then, these are huge questions that they need to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4593.502s">This</a>  is mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4596.026s">This</a>  isn't hundreds of years of neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4599.472s">This</a>  is mismanagement from someone that's been in office now for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4603.899s">She's</a>  done nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4605.201s">When</a>  neighborhood communities were in the same spot we were, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4609.844s">talk</a>  to the mayor in Malden, talk to the mayor in Somerville, talk to the mayor in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4614.307s">They</a>  had the same issues we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4616.329s">They</a>  used those funds to make sure they did what was right for their community first, before she started covering general accounts because she mismanaged the business of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4628.318s">She's</a>  done a terrible job in the city bringing finances in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4633.622s">Remember,</a>  the last meeting we had was new growth was what? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4636.9s">our</a>  new growth that we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4637.961s">I</a>  know Councilor Bears says that the city assessor is going to give us a great report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4641.383s">I</a>  can't wait to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4643.164s">But</a>  here we are, year five now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4646.306s">Year</a>  five, she's the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4648.207s">The</a>  most we've seen that was presented to us was a million dollars, new growth from fees and fines from traffic and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4657.974s">That</a>  was amazing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4660.034s">That</a>  was amazing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4661.075s">So</a>  I asked for this report, because I don't know, I'm sure you're all smart enough that you see what I'm trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4667.422s">I'm</a>  trying to show my colleagues that listen, I understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4671.246s">And</a>  you we need we need the finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4674.249s">But</a>  understanding taxation isn't always the best resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4678.294s">First,</a>  let's find out what's causing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4681.983s">Why</a>  aren't we bringing in new money? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4683.484s">Why</a>  are we spending so much money on things we shouldn't be? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4687.646s">And</a>  then if we shows that that's not true at all, Councilor Scarpelli, then I walk away in peace voting for whatever the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4696.231s">But</a>  right now, this right now shows poor, poor mismanagement of the finances of this community and the leadership of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4704.235s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4706.116s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4709.246s">I'm</a>  going to go to Vice President Collins, but first I just want to say a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4713.489s">Last</a>  year the budget fiscal 24 budget new growth was 2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4718.713s">And</a>  we did receive in the budget, we have meetings on the three departments tomorrow in committee of the whole, we did receive a quarter one quarter two budget to actuals document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4728.12s">from</a>  the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4729.22s">The</a>  law department spending as of December 31st was $172,000 out of a budget of $552,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4733.642s">So</a>  only families spent 31% of their budget, 50% of the way through the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4736.943s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4737.963s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4739.064s">I</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4750.992s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, we've known each other for a term. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4752.673s">You</a>  know, there's a lot I agree with you about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4753.994s">There's</a>  some I disagree with you about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4755.155s">That's</a>  not news to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4757.076s">What</a>  I do think that we all share is that we're looking for the holistic picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4761.468s">and</a>  I do think that as a city council under our current charter, we're kind of always at a disadvantage because we do have the final vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4771.012s">We</a>  don't craft it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4771.972s">We</a>  can't add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4773.353s">We</a>  can only make line item subtractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4776.934s">We</a>  are in a difficult and disadvantaged position to have that 30,000 foot view on the budget when we receive all of our information <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4786.638s">through</a>  intermediaries, through departments, through the administration, essentially second hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4791.223s">And</a>  I think all of us have found that challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4793.265s">I</a>  know that I have found it challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4798.646s">There's</a>  a lot that I think is really critical as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4800.968s">We</a>  already had a conversation tonight on two major pieces of infrastructure that we know will take years to bring up to the level of condition that residents deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4810.076s">And</a>  we barely even touched on the new high school, and that's another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4813.959s">Residents</a>  deserve a new, better high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4818.103s">And</a>  I think it is both true that we need to make sure we have a clear picture of why our budget is the way it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4826.078s">in</a>  fairness to everybody, and we have to hold that it's equally crucial that we do what needs to happen so that residents have the environment and the resources and the public sector and the public staff and the city infrastructure that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4844.248s">And</a>  I know for me, we cannot afford to wait on any avenues that can get us closer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4851.872s">I</a>  also do want to note, you know, we speak about <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4855.552s">what</a>  our jurisdiction is and what our jurisdiction isn't for, you know, what city resources look like and what our budget looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4863.841s">I</a>  also want to add, since we mentioned Mystic Avenue, it's a constant source of frustration for me that we don't have a more direct hand in the spending of city resources so that we, you know, when <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4873.422s">that.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4873.522s">City</a>  staff and residents come to us bringing up particular projects and departments that we can't more directly intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4880.126s">But</a>  I am really proud that this council has, you know, for several terms now made it a shared goal to do what we can on the zoning ordinances side so that we can lay the foundation for rapidly improving new growth commercial <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4896.855s">it's</a>  not direct because developments come from developers, but we have a direct hand in laying the foundation where our commercial tax base, where new growth can flourish in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4908.644s">And</a>  so I'm proud that that's one piece that we do have jurisdiction over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4911.786s">This</a>  council is making a priority for several terms now, and we are already starting to see developers take advantage and start to take <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4923.094s">that's</a>  going to benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4925.875s">Um</a>  everything that we talk about in these chambers that deserve more investment than what we're currently getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4929.936s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4933.997s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4935.678s">Um</a>  I definitely do believe that, uh, our city's underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4939.819s">I</a>  think it is a pretty simple math problem that when you don't fix your water price for 100 years, you don't fix your roads for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4945.021s">You</a>  don't fix your schools for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4946.581s">You</a>  don't <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4950.578s">for</a>  years so that those salaries are below commensurate for other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4955.303s">I</a>  think that that math problem is pretty simple one, but that doesn't mean that I believe that all of our money is being spent properly and I really appreciate this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4964.672s">I</a>  think it's incredibly important that we understand and that the community also understands how money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4971.777s">and</a>  that we are really responsible and that that money is not being wasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4977.42s">So</a>  I really appreciate this resolution and any other resolutions that come to us having transparency and understanding the way that the city is being run and to make sure that our funds are being used well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4993.127s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4994.007s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=4997.208s">Any</a>  comments from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5001.693s">Seeing</a>  none, is there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5003.575s">Oh,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PSTGVKtblL8&t=5004.817s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>
