[SPEAKER_09]: Just give your name and address for the record, please.

160
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,740

00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,668

[SPEAKER_28]: Paul McCaffrey 59 Prescott Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

163
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:05,429
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to thank the Council and the residents of Medford for allowing us to go and visit folks every day in different, different situations.

164
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,093
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, the, the one thing to take away from the with having therapy dogs is that

165
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,250
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kind of a force multiplier.

166
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:23,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Police departments and schools are using them to be kind of the first line of defense of bringing down tensions in school.

167
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:32,333
[SPEAKER_28]: So one of the things is that you want to do before there's a tragic incident is to have dogs come in on a regular basis and make people comfortable.

168
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Lilly tries every day to do that.

169
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,154
[SPEAKER_28]: And I appreciate the council's attention to the matter.

170
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:40,735
[SPEAKER_28]: And I hope that I can encourage more people to be therapy handlers in Medford.

171
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Paul.

172
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:47,864

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate bringing this forward to Council.

196
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Let him indulge me with this resolution.

197
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I spoke to Mr Stone King, supervisor who has now moved on to

198
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:01,450
[SPEAKER_05]: new community.

199
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:09,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And he passed along a letter that he asked if I, you know, could read he shared it with everybody here.

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:22,572
[SPEAKER_05]: But for this is reading for Mr. Stone King says, dear Mayor Brianna Longo Cone, I'm writing to formally resign from the position as superintendent

201
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Thought it was a lot easier than that, didn't use that.

202

[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

203
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:45,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you for indulging me.

204
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: This new thing called the cell phone, it's trying to get used to it.

205
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize.

206
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something to do with these delicate fingers I have.

207
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:09,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise, I'm almost there.

208
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, can we have the therapy dog back in?

209
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:18,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Round two?

210
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:22,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have round two of the therapy dog, please?

211
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:25,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you, Lily?

212
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:34,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well.

213
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

214
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I apologize.

215
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:46,056
[SPEAKER_05]: He writes, I'm writing to formally resign from my position as Superintendent of Water and Sewer for the City of Medford effective April 5th, 2024.

216
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:55,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It is with heavy heart that I submit resignation as I've greatly appreciated the opportunities and experience I've gained in my time serving the City of Medford during my tenure.

217
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I have had the privilege of working under the leadership of DPW Commissioner Tim McGiven.

218
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:07,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I must commend Commissioner McGiven for his professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of Medford.

219
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:13,752
[SPEAKER_05]: His leadership has been a source of inspiration and guidance to me, and I am truly grateful for the support and mentorship he has provided.

220
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I will strive to emulate his exemption leadership as I move forward.

221
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:27,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite the admirable qualities Commissioner McGiven have found myself increasingly frustrated with the administration's lack of action addressing critical issues within the department.

222
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:32,719
[SPEAKER_05]: The recent handling supervisor of water and sewer job posting, coupled with the

223
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:51,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And something offers 0% costs of living increase for FY 24 has underscored and concerning absence of values you place in my position as well as the lack of priority place in the central matters, such as water main replacements, aging utility infrastructure staffing shortages and overall neglect.

224
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,899
[SPEAKER_05]: of the needs of the DPW.

225
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:04,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I have worked tirelessly to address compliances issues, modernize departmental operations to highlight the pressing concerns surrounding the water distribution system.

226
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Regrettably, my pleas for assistance recognition of regulatory concerns and urgent calls for action seemingly fallen on deaf ears.

227
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:19,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It is disheartening to feel ignored and undervalued in the position where the welfare of the community is at stake.

228
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:25,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that my efforts have made this positive impact, but there is still so much work to be done.

229
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:31,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I have reached a point where I feel I have exhausted all avenues and effected meaningless change within the covered environment.

230
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:42,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It is essential that the City refocuses its attention on critical infrastructure projects, staffing needs, and operational improvements to ensure the continued well-being of Medford and its residents.

231
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:50,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm deeply concerned the residents are unaware of the alarming conditions of the water system and its critical need for substantial improvement.

232
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Immediate focus and drastic change are essential to ensure the integrity of Medford water infrastructure

233
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,527
[SPEAKER_05]: as time is running out.

234
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:05,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served the city of Medford and valuable lessons I've learned along the way.

235
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:14,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I extend my deepest appreciation to all those who have supported and collaborated with me during my time here as those contributions have been instrumental in shaping my professional growth.

236
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:22,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish the city of residence the best in the future and hope necessary steps will be taken to address the challenging challenges facing DPW.

237
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you once again the opportunity to have been part of this community

238
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Dan Stone King.

239
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. Stone King.

240
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:37,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Stone King and I had a great conversation with Tim McGibbon.

241
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:51,069
[SPEAKER_05]: What I find appalling and what's frightening is that whenever lately, I don't know if we've followed along with my resolutions, we've always had something come back from the administration.

242
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:51,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys notice that?

243
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:57,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Every day after I bring something up, like even tonight, we have something about the water department.

244
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:58,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it take?

245
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it take a negative resolution to make city administration move on something this important?

246
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Stone King actually told me, we're not there yet.

247
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But he says he wants us to think in Medford as Flint, Michigan.

248
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we know how bad Flint, Michigan is right?

249
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I said, Is it that bad?

250
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,669
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talked to Tim, he says we're getting there.

251
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very excited when ARPA came out.

252
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first phase of ARPA was meant for what?

253
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Infrastructure needs.

254
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had a plan in place to really start moving things along.

255
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,722
[SPEAKER_05]: What he told me is that we're moving at a pace of about, what is it, a quarter or half a mile?

256
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We need three miles a year to catch up in Medford for what the aging infrastructure that we have in our water department.

257
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:46,849
[SPEAKER_05]: What I found amazing to me is,

258
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:54,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if people realize this, his position holds a license that you have to have to run the water department in Medford.

259
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have the certain license, you're at serious risk of serious danger when it comes to your water quality.

260
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's there having that license, which aren't many people that have that.

261
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact,

262
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:27,420
[SPEAKER_05]: As we speak right now, I believe Medford has hired Weston and Sampson, an outside agency, another outside company, paying them $200 an hour, an hour to sit in that office just to make sure that we have someone in place to qualify that our water is safe.

263
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:34,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, all this had to be done is a conversation and fair negotiation process to say, hey, what do we need to keep you?

264
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,595
[SPEAKER_05]: But I talked more about that.

265
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't about the money system.

266
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:39,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about the value.

267
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:45,437
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in the position for two years, two years of vital, vital position.

268
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:48,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you know how many times he spoke to the mayor twice?

269
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Twice.

270
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could say whatever we want and what's going on.

271
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:00,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, I'm gonna say it again, because there's a bunch of issues that I'll bring up.

272
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:01,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I want everybody to follow this along.

273
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as I bring things up, all of a sudden we have resolutions from the mayor.

274
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

275
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are all too late.

276
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for Weston and Sampson, they're making a killing.

277
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: $1,600 for today, right?

278
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:15,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight hour days, $200 a day, $1,600 a day.

279
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.

280
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:26,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reached out to neighboring communities, asked them about this person with this license.

281
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:30,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reached out to representatives MWRA that I know, from Medford, that hold that license.

282
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:39,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote unquote, A, I would never come to Medford because the administration's a mess.

283
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And B, why would they leave?

284
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,216
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making way more money where they are.

285
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the problem that we're having.

286
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're watching, every week, it keeps piling on.

287
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

288
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lack of leadership.

289
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,741
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. Stonekin wanted to send that along.

290
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I had a great discussion with Tim McGibbon.

291
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim did send over a letter.

292
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody received the letter.

293
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shared that with Mr. Stoneking.

294
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, he said, in typical fashion, nothing against Tim McGibbon and the DPW, because he works for the mayor.

295
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But all this does is just delay everything.

296
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:20,847
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they say?

297
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,747
[SPEAKER_05]: They're starting the process now to start looking into it.

298
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been working on it for a couple of weeks.

299
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,628
[SPEAKER_05]: His words were, quote unquote, it's just talk.

300
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,329
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he's felt for two years.

301
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:31,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just talk.

302
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate Tim.

303
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, I know it's not Tim McGibbon.

304
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to Tim.

305
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,530
[SPEAKER_05]: His hands are tied.

306
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a great discussion.

307
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand his frustration.

308
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,412
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are where we are.

309
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought I'd share another happy Medford story with everybody.

310
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that council bears.

311
00:19:53,266 --> 00:20:00,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that he sent you have some administration, they sent some some messages to the city council.

312
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have that?

313
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:01,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to read it?

314
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I can read it.

315
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:02,976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

316
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:03,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

317
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,500
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also have the message here.

318
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,781
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to note that.

319
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:13,125
[SPEAKER_24]: We did have some of this discussion last budget season.

320
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:19,492
[SPEAKER_24]: We voted down the retained earnings to make sure that that funding was going to address infrastructure needs.

321
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,715
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the 1st time in a long time that that had happened.

322
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,897
[SPEAKER_24]: But we do have this response from.

323
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:26,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Commissioner McGivern.

324
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:28,386
[SPEAKER_24]: It's dated April 11th.

325
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:34,832
[SPEAKER_24]: As you know, Dan Stone King, our former water superintendent, decided to leave the city of Medford for what he felt was a better opportunity.

326
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:40,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Dan was a valuable member of the DPW leadership team and contributed significant improvements to the water and sewer division.

327
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:46,742
[SPEAKER_24]: Dan's presentation of the state of the city's water system did not provide you with information on what steps and plans that the DPW

328
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,565
[SPEAKER_24]: with the support of the mayor have already taken to address our aging water system.

329
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,668
[SPEAKER_24]: His letter unfortunately only focused on issues he felt were not getting enough attention.

330
00:20:54,688 --> 00:21:02,675
[SPEAKER_24]: It is worth balancing the minimal information he provided with a summary of actions that have taken place since I've been appointed leader of the DPW and before as city engineer.

331
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:11,062
[SPEAKER_24]: It is important to highlight that the City of Medford purchases water from the MWRA and was responsible for distributing it to the ratepayers through a system of pipes, valves and meters.

332
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:16,407
[SPEAKER_24]: As part of this distribution, we regularly provide water quality testing to demonstrate the safety of our distribution system.

333
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:21,671
[SPEAKER_24]: The latest published information on Medford's water quality can be found at the MWRA website linked below.

334
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:30,219
[SPEAKER_24]: This site is updated regularly with our testing information and ratepayers also receive a consumer confidence report from the MWRA in June that provides greater detail.

335
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,373
[SPEAKER_24]: The web address is www.mwra.com, annual, water report, 2022 results, pdf, medford.pdf.

336
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:53,241
[SPEAKER_24]: The city of Medford experienced a huge surge of roadway building and building development in the early part of the 20th century, so many of our water distribution pipes installed at that time were nearing the expected lifetime age of 75 to 100 years, with some lasting 120 years.

337
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:58,884
[SPEAKER_24]: Knowing this fact, we completed an evaluation of our utility assets in 2020 when I was city engineer.

338
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:05,447
[SPEAKER_24]: This study included, among other things, identifying the age, material, and quantity of our water distribution pipes based on the city's records.

339
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:08,688
[SPEAKER_24]: This allowed the DPW to understand the needs of our water system,

340
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,889
[SPEAKER_24]: and helped us identify steps to prepare for an increase in water main replacements throughout the city.

341
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:24,934
[SPEAKER_24]: When I became commissioner, we had recently suffered the loss of our longtime water superintendent, Dave Proctor, and I was tasked with finding a new person who could help us improve our water operations, assess our capital needs, and lead new initiatives to prepare

342
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,476
[SPEAKER_24]: for increasing our capacity to replace our aging water mains.

343
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Stone King helped the DPW prepare a strategy that started in the 2024 budget.

344
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:42,185
[SPEAKER_24]: The goal of the strategy is to increase in-house and contracted water main relay capacity and align the development of the DPW capital improvement project to the needs of the system.

345
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:50,312
[SPEAKER_24]: We met with Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern in April of 2023 to discuss the strategy and steps we believe needed to be addressed in the FY24 budget.

346
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:57,078
[SPEAKER_24]: This resulted in the mayor beginning to formulate a communication plan, which is under development, as well as additions to the water and sewer operating budget.

347
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:05,286
[SPEAKER_24]: These additions included a water supervisor position with an additional water quality coordinator and a deputy commissioner to oversee the operations of DPW.

348
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:14,109
[SPEAKER_24]: The water supervisor proposition is in front of you tonight to increase the compensation scale as it has been a significant challenge to attract a qualified candidate at the current scale.

349
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,612
[SPEAKER_24]: We also included a plan to engage a consultant to help us develop a long-term rate study and indirect cost study.

350
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:22,393
[SPEAKER_24]: We are currently working on these studies with Weston and Sampson.

351
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:27,135
[SPEAKER_24]: These studies are critical to inform important decisions the City of Medford will need to make in the coming years.

352
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:35,118
[SPEAKER_24]: The rate study will assess the needs of the system, contribute to the development of our capital project list, and identify rate and funding scenarios for a 10-year period.

353
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:39,560
[SPEAKER_24]: This information is critical to the long-term health and performance of our water distribution system.

354
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:47,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Both the utility asset evaluation as well as the long-term rate study are actions that the city had not done before, which presents its own unique challenge.

355
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:55,729
[SPEAKER_24]: We've also pursued initiatives that support these efforts, such as a hydraulic modeling of our entire system and developing a unidirectional regular flushing program.

356
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:03,232
[SPEAKER_24]: The hydraulic modeling will help identify the cause of pressure or flow issues within the system, so those issues can be incorporated into capital projects.

357
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:09,595
[SPEAKER_24]: There are also new initiatives related to our service lines, which are in response to new regulations that will go into effect later this year.

358
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,497
[SPEAKER_24]: One of these initiatives is a lead service ordinance, which you'll be hearing more about shortly.

359
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:20,061
[SPEAKER_24]: It's worth noting that this letter only summarizes the work taking place for us to prepare us for replacing our aging water infrastructure.

360
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:25,165
[SPEAKER_24]: We also have aging pavement infrastructure, which must be coordinated with the water infrastructure work.

361
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:29,168
[SPEAKER_24]: As you know, these infrastructure assets are not the only ones that need more attention in Medford.

362
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:40,817
[SPEAKER_24]: since proper asset management is costly over many years, it is critically important that we work together to evaluate, prepare, and execute projects as we march towards having systems and funding in place for long-term infrastructure performance.

363
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:50,145
[SPEAKER_24]: In closing, we certainly have a lot of work to do with our water system, but we are taking the proper steps to plan for increasing the length of water main we replace each year and increasing the water quality.

364
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:55,470
[SPEAKER_24]: This will take time, and effective partnerships between the mayor, city council, and DPW will be critical.

365
00:24:56,718 --> 00:25:08,961
[SPEAKER_24]: That is Mr McGivern's letter, and I will note that Mr. McGivern did answer many questions on this in the last budget, including the scope of the problem being $500 million to $1 billion long-term problem.

366
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:12,481
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was discussed a year ago in the budget season.

367
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:23,984
[SPEAKER_24]: I also met with Mr. Stone King and Mr. McGivern around the proposed lead service ordinance last year, and we had discussions along the lines, basically, of what Mr. McGivern just put out in this report.

368
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:35,271
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was also asking many of the same questions that Mr McGivern was asking here, that Mr. Stoneking was asking in his letter of the mayor, which is, when are we going to know the scope and scale of this?

369
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:42,616
[SPEAKER_24]: And they said, basically, we need the long term rate study in place now that we have looked at the, we know what our assets are.

370
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:44,357
[SPEAKER_24]: There wasn't even an asset inventory in 2020.

371
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,378
[SPEAKER_24]: That exists now.

372
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:58,782
[SPEAKER_24]: we now we need the long term rate study to go back and say, this is what it's going to cost in the long term to rate payers to fix the system, which I think both in the last budget season and in that meeting that I had, they referred to as one of the three oldest systems in the state.

373
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,002
[SPEAKER_24]: So that is where we are at.

374
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,764
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is the letter from Mr. McGiven.

375
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:07,164
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can, Mr. President.

376
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:11,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Scarpelli, and then Councillor Callahan, and then Vice President Collins.

377
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:13,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate Director McGiven.

378
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:19,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But to my fellow councillors, is this not a theme that we see?

379
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:32,972
[SPEAKER_05]: City Hall needs to be done, we're gonna set up a committee, we're gonna look at development, we're gonna set a consultant, we're gonna look into things.

380
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:38,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is, just like Ms.

381
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoneking said to me, it's all talk.

382
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:51,661
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a director of DPW speaking for his boss, who's over and over again shown that nothing's getting done, zero.

383
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,942
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not getting anything done.

384
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about multi-million dollar issues, that we had it right in our hand.

385
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We had millions of dollars.

386
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:07,193
[SPEAKER_05]: When ARPA came out, that we could still use for infrastructure needs, that we did nothing, zero.

387
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:09,355
[SPEAKER_05]: But again,

388
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Stonekirk writes this letter, I put it on as a resolution, what happens?

389
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:26,296
[SPEAKER_05]: The position that hasn't gotten any movement for months comes to us tonight for a change in CAF so we can raise it, so we can get better, we can entice people to come out now, right?

390
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,318
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is exactly what we're seeing.

391
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:31,975
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that saying?

392
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dog wagging its tail.

393
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:36,496
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that state?

394
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,477
[SPEAKER_05]: The tail wagging its dog.

395
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Tail wagging its dog, exactly.

396
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I feel.

397
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:46,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, sometimes it's like watching a dog chase its tail with this administration.

398
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:54,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've known since the mayor's been in 2020 that we've had a huge issue here and that it was compiling.

399
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: But now all of a sudden,

400
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:01,942
[SPEAKER_05]: in her 50 years, we're gonna now go into this, right?

401
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:12,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you put together a pilot program or a committee like she did with the finance, with the water department that April as well, and maybe we can get something going, but we still have seen nothing.

402
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still seeing nothing.

403
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:17,993
[SPEAKER_05]: This still doesn't do us any, it doesn't do anybody any good.

404
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I appreciate

405
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:32,661
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer, but it just only leads to the same old lack of leadership and the same old destructing, destroyed Medford that has nothing moving forward.

406
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:33,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

407
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:34,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

408
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:38,008
[SPEAKER_24]: We also had this from the director of communications.

409
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:39,730
[SPEAKER_24]: Steve Smurdy.

410
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, counselors.

411
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,815
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to provide some additional information regarding the city's ARPA allocations for water and sewer projects.

412
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:52,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Since the fall of 2021, the city has invested over 4 million in 13 projects that address critical water infrastructure needs.

413
00:28:52,621 --> 00:29:01,769
[SPEAKER_24]: Among those projects are sewer system lining, sealing and testing, DPW water meter system replacement project, lead service line replacement rebate program, infiltration and inflow

414
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:08,072
[SPEAKER_24]: infiltration and inflow control plan, rights upon dam maintenance, Winthrop Street water main replacement.

415
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:21,798
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to strengthening our water sewer system, the mayor has been working with City Engineer Wartella and DPW Commissioner McGibbon to address the over 100 million backlog in street repairs due to neglect over the past few decades by identifying projects that were close to beginning construction.

416
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:26,680
[SPEAKER_24]: The administration was able to deploy ARPA funding across multiple road infrastructure projects including

417
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:36,286
[SPEAKER_24]: patchwork on 34 streets identified in the pavement assessment, intersection improvements at Spring Street and Central Avenue, Pinker Street Roadway and utility construction.

418
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:43,811
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor is also hoping to allocate $1 million in ARPA funding to continue the repair work of the city's sidewalks, as well as additional tree stump removals in 2024.

419
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:56,400
[SPEAKER_24]: You can read more about the work already done on sidewalks and stumps on the city website, and you can view a full list of projects, as well as a dive deeper into project descriptions by visiting the city website medfordma.org.

420
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,663
[SPEAKER_24]: slash department slash finance slash ARPA.

421
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:02,126
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Kelly.

422
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:03,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

423
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:07,012
[SPEAKER_18]: So to me, these letters were a

424
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:31,237
[SPEAKER_18]: quite frightening reminder that our water pipes are 100 years old, almost older than any other city, and that instead of over the decades spending the money that came in through our water system on the water system and replacing these pipes for decades, that that money went into the general fund.

425
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:32,938
[SPEAKER_18]: and was spent on other things.

426
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:37,720
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we have, for decades, not improved our water system.

427
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:47,745
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, for decades, not improved our roads, which is why that 49% of our roads as of 2021, hard to know whether that's improved or gotten worse.

428
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:51,954
[SPEAKER_18]: probably has gotten worse.

429
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,958
[SPEAKER_18]: 49% of our roads are in the worst two classes of roads out of five.

430
00:30:57,098 --> 00:31:00,821
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the most expensive kinds to replace, to repair.

431
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:06,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Our schools, which are 20 years old, have not been properly maintained for the last 20 years.

432
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:18,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Salaries, and we talk about the salary of this particular position in the water department, but salaries across the city are not commensurate with other cities.

433
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,770
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can't find people to fill a lot of positions.

434
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,910
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just that position.

435
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:26,792
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a lot of positions we cannot find people to fill.

436
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:39,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Previous administrations have been like 30, 40 years ago were given a city in pretty good shape and did not do the repairs that were needed.

437
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:45,586
[SPEAKER_18]: And that has left us in a position that I'm really, they've kicked the can down the road.

438
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:50,168
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm trying to understand what kind of management style it would make up for.

439
00:31:50,188 --> 00:32:04,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if $500 million is the amount to repair our water system, and we know that it's $100 million probably or more to repair the roads, get the roads back into shape, there isn't a style of management that can

440
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,379
[SPEAKER_18]: magically make that money up here.

441
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:22,302
[SPEAKER_18]: My thing about the management is not that I'm making any kind of statement, but my statement is about the funding that we have to do the absolute basics necessary for a city to function.

442
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:25,463
[SPEAKER_18]: You cannot have water pipes that function.

443
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:27,903
[SPEAKER_18]: You do not have a city, functional city.

444
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:28,984
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have roads.

445
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:30,524
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the basics.

446
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:34,306
[SPEAKER_18]: And this isn't purely the fault of this mayor.

447
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:48,656
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that we have kicked the can down the road for many decades until we find ourselves by doing things that were financially irresponsible, but were made taxpayers happy.

448
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:58,924
[SPEAKER_18]: And now we're in a position where we have had that situation going on for so long that we're going straight off a cliff.

449
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:15,952
[SPEAKER_18]: I talked to some of the engineering folks about the water systems, and they said, oh, you know, there is money coming into the water system that we can use to repair it.

450
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:19,254
[SPEAKER_18]: But of course, that money used to go to other things.

451
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:23,057
[SPEAKER_18]: That money has always come in, and it used to go to the general fund.

452
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:26,819
[SPEAKER_18]: So now that money isn't going to be going to the things that it used to go to.

453
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,360
[SPEAKER_18]: So those things will go down.

454
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:36,626
[SPEAKER_18]: There is not enough funding to take care of the financial irresponsibility of former administrations and former city councils.

455
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:45,633
[SPEAKER_18]: really administrations because the state councils do not have do not have hardly any effect on the budget because it's really up in the hands of the mayor.

456
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:47,934
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to clarify one thing.

457
00:33:48,334 --> 00:34:04,725
[SPEAKER_24]: The common practice, as far as I was aware, was that funds that were called retained earnings, which were surplus funds gathered by rate payers in the enterprise fund that funds water and sewer, that those funds were returned to rate payers to keep rates low.

458
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,386
[SPEAKER_24]: So it wasn't that they were in the general fund.

459
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:11,089
[SPEAKER_24]: It's that the council, the mayor requested, the mayor, excuse me, thank you.

460
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:12,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, please.

461
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,191
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to get into this again tonight.

462
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:14,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

463
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:28,534
[SPEAKER_24]: The council, many mayors and many councils, mayors recommended, water and sewer commissions recommended, and councils voted to return retained earnings to taxpayers on the orders of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars every year.

464
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:32,399
[SPEAKER_24]: And those are funds that could have gone to maintenance of the system.

465
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President, that's just the facts, thank you.

466
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:36,203
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

467
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:40,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Behrs and Councilor Scarpelli.

468
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good idea for us to have this discussion, you know, to use the word from your resolution.

469
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,503
[SPEAKER_09]: We know we're coming up on budget.

470
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:50,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Please don't shout from the crowd.

471
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:50,664
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

472
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Please don't shout from the crowd.

473
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:52,345
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

474
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:55,246
[SPEAKER_24]: Please don't shout from the crowd.

475
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:55,607
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

476
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Please don't shout from the crowd.

477
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:58,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

478
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:01,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

479
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I frequently need a reminder to talk louder.

480
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

481
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,252
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you shouldn't be shouting from the crowd.

482
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:06,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

483
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,569
[SPEAKER_09]: but I know I'm not loud enough to talk over people.

484
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:21,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate the resolution to discuss the water and sewer department, especially as we're coming right up on budget season.

485
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:28,955
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a conversation that we're going to have anyway, and as other councilors have noted, this is a conversation that we've had every year in the past two budget cycles that I have been a part of.

486
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:37,057
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, this is a, this has been raised as a multi-million dollar issue.

487
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:50,740
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that it will take multi-millions of dollars to make good on this investment, to bring ourselves out of the rear of all cities and towns in Massachusetts when it comes to our water infrastructure.

488
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that Commissioner McGibbon told us during our budget hearing last year that we're one of the

489
00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:01,559
[SPEAKER_09]: The three cities with the oldest water infrastructure in the state.

490
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,743
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's not a

491
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:07,745
[SPEAKER_09]: end of the ladder that any of us want to be on.

492
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:11,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that this is multi-millions of dollars in the fixing.

493
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,908
[SPEAKER_09]: This is many decades in the making.

494
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:30,195
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that I do find heartening from the letters from the administration, from letters from current and former members of DPW leadership that I think is heartening, is that there's a clear mutual respect from Commissioner McGivern and former Superintendent Stoneking.

495
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,016
[SPEAKER_09]: That mutual respect within the DPW leadership

496
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:43,495
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and knowing that this is a shared priority between the DPW, between the City Council, between the administration, we know that we need to look for

497
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,496
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to look for assets wherever we can find them with this big of an infrastructural project ahead of us.

498
00:36:52,639 --> 00:37:00,988
[SPEAKER_09]: As was stated earlier, we were the first council to vote to keep retained earnings within the Water and Sewer Department so that it could go towards funding infrastructure repairs and improvements.

499
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously that is a small first step.

500
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:07,687
[SPEAKER_09]: we have a ways to go.

501
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:18,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I am glad for any steps in the right direction that were taken by ARPA, that were taken by Superintendent Stone King during his tenure, and that I know that Commissioner McGivern is working hard on every day.

502
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it is one of the things that rang most loudly for me from Commissioner McGivern's letter to the city council was that all of these major infrastructural efforts

503
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:37,402
[SPEAKER_09]: between bringing our water infrastructure up to par and our roads infrastructure up to par.

504
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:42,364
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we got at least 500 million on the water side.

505
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:48,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's maybe even at least 200 million if we really wanna get every road where we know residents want them.

506
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:56,448
[SPEAKER_09]: These things have to be done in concert, be done efficiently to make sure that we're making the best use of every dollar because we have to use so many of them.

507
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:00,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Last point I wanna make for now, I did,

508
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Commissioner given noted the most recent report from the M. W. R. A. On the state of Medford sweater, which is from 2021 in his letter to the City Council.

509
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I did follow that read through it.

510
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:17,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's worth noting that when it comes to when it comes to our water infrastructure.

511
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: We know, because everybody has cited, that some of our pipes are 120 years old.

512
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We also know that the most recent report from the MWRA is that our drinking water is safe.

513
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:33,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure that it stays that way without interruption for all future generations.

514
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:34,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

515
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:36,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

516
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment by members of the Council?

517
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:40,202
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Sang?

518
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:46,285
[SPEAKER_26]: very briefly because I think a lot of what I would say has been covered by the three councillors who've spoken.

519
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,986
[SPEAKER_26]: I think, you know,

520
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:58,440
[SPEAKER_26]: When past administrations were looking at the water infrastructure in the city, it was easy, since everything was built around the same time, to say that we didn't need to make these investments.

521
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:06,425
[SPEAKER_26]: But we always do need a longer-term outlook about how we're going to fund projects, even decades in the future.

522
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:11,708
[SPEAKER_26]: It was disappointing, and it is disappointing to us that that wasn't done decades prior.

523
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:19,474
[SPEAKER_26]: But it is, I think, a good step for us to start with that study about the rates going forward, because

524
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:20,194
[SPEAKER_26]: that.

525
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:25,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Such a large scale of infrastructure improvement will need a lot of communication with our residents.

526
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:33,786
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you know, and I think it's becoming clear through this discussion through discussions in the past during the budget seasons that.

527
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,628
[SPEAKER_26]: Money is a huge factor here.

528
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:40,291
[SPEAKER_26]: And so if money is a big question here, we need to

529
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:46,219
[SPEAKER_26]: something like that rate study is important.

530
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,649
[SPEAKER_26]: Now, another thing can also be true that I think Councillor Scarpelli raised.

531
00:39:52,881 --> 00:39:59,086
[SPEAKER_26]: we need better follow through on these reports, on these committees that are created from the administration.

532
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:06,331
[SPEAKER_26]: For example, the classification study is something that we still haven't seen over years.

533
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,752
[SPEAKER_26]: We were promised this years ago.

534
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:15,538
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's something that affects the items on our agenda, like the CAF amendment.

535
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,962
[SPEAKER_26]: to the superintendent of water role.

536
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:21,664
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to follow up on these things.

537
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:24,506
[SPEAKER_26]: Now as a city council, I think we've done better.

538
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:34,175
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've worked together, especially Councilor Scarpelli and us, we've worked together to push the administration to keep them accountable on those issues.

539
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:35,817
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to keep doing that.

540
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:44,765
[SPEAKER_26]: We need to keep making the historic investments that we haven't been making as a city council that we made for the first time last year in the water system.

541
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,427
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that's very, very clear.

542
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,489
[SPEAKER_26]: I know there's lots to be said.

543
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,831
[SPEAKER_26]: There's this is a very complex issue.

544
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,512
[SPEAKER_26]: I think.

545
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:59,954
[SPEAKER_26]: a commission to begin Burns letter does actually point to a lot of substantive steps being taken in terms of, um, physical improvements to the system.

546
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:07,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, not just the monetary side of things, but there's lots of follow through to, uh, to for us to hold to account.

547
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:13,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor saying any further comments from members of the council.

548
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:17,858
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none of their emotion on the floor.

549
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:22,256
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins, Councillor Scarpelli.

550
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:37,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to receive and place on file by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

551
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any public participation on the matter?

552
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,690
[SPEAKER_24]: I see one hand on Zoom and one person in the chamber.

553
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,532
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to the chamber first.

554
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

555
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,015
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

556
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:47,456
[SPEAKER_27]: Robert Jones, 5 St.

557
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:49,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Mary Street.

558
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:51,619
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a little confused at this point.

559
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,863
[SPEAKER_27]: The water sewer account is an enterprise fund.

560
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,724
[SPEAKER_27]: You touched upon it, President Beas.

561
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:58,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

562
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:06,190
[SPEAKER_27]: Which means that for anybody that doesn't know, the receipts of the water and sewer bills go into an enterprise fund.

563
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,533
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a separate fund, and it has to be used for that purpose.

564
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,096
[SPEAKER_27]: traditionally, we've had a surplus.

565
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:22,484
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't recall at all that we talked about sending the excess back to the ratepayers, but it's an account that traditionally runs at a surplus.

566
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:27,067
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm not sure why we haven't been reinvesting that into the system where it should be.

567
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:31,130
[SPEAKER_27]: And Councilor Scott Pelli touched on something else.

568
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:39,276
[SPEAKER_27]: We do studies, we do scope of work, we hire consultants, we do everything but actually fix the problem.

569
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:49,374
[SPEAKER_27]: I've heard about all these plans and other studies that, but not actually replacing the pipe.

570
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:53,640
[SPEAKER_27]: Sounds like we had a good guy that just got frustrated and left.

571
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:55,809
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to actually do the work.

572
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:57,311
[SPEAKER_27]: The city is famous for it.

573
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:01,735
[SPEAKER_27]: When you have something, you need to update it and maintain it, or it's going to break down.

574
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,837
[SPEAKER_27]: We should have been doing that throughout the years.

575
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,159
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we can do it a little bit at a time.

576
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,822
[SPEAKER_27]: Take the surplus every year, replace the pipe.

577
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:10,844
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't think we need another consultant study.

578
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:11,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

579
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:12,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

580
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:14,968
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to Maureen on Zoom.

581
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,850
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

582
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Maureen.

583
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:22,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Maureen Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.

584
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:33,567
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an issue that's close to my heart because I've been in health care my whole entire life, and this is a serious health care issue.

585
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:53,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been lots of discussion about how for many years, I actually heard the word decades now, the city of Medford administration and city council has been aware that there's a major infrastructure problem regarding water and sewer.

586
00:43:55,357 --> 00:44:00,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never received any money back on my taxes on my water and sewer bill.

587
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:04,444
[SPEAKER_01]: but they go up every year.

588
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:09,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So could someone address where that money is going?

589
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:24,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And second of all, is there a committee or a formal arrangement between the mayor and other committees to look at

590
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:35,835
[SPEAKER_01]: sources such as state funding or as federal funding because I feel that we're on the edge of the slippery slope here.

591
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:44,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard four or five times tonight the MWRA has tested our water and said that it's safe.

592
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:49,986
[SPEAKER_01]: What if the next time they test it, it is not safe?

593
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:52,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like some answers please.

594
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:53,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

595
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:56,608
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Maureen.

596
00:44:56,628 --> 00:45:00,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address for the record, please.

597
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Donna Silva, 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway.

598
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a photo which I'd like to show.

599
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to, can we show this?

600
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Zach, can you put this up on?

601
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,902
[SPEAKER_24]: If you email it to me, I can probably put it up.

602
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, I'm gonna turn it here, and I don't know if you can see it.

603
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:21,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So can the council see it?

604
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:25,490
[SPEAKER_08]: These are my filters on my water system.

605
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a house system, a home water system, and two filters.

606
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:32,875
[SPEAKER_08]: They're supposed to last six months.

607
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:34,755
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what your kids are drinking.

608
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,616
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what they're drinking.

609
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:39,517
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what you're drinking, okay?

610
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:40,958
[SPEAKER_08]: They're black.

611
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:42,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I shouldn't say that.

612
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:44,059
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not black, they're dark brown.

613
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's only three months.

614
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one on the other side is only one month.

615
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:56,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they say the water is safe, I don't understand that.

616
00:45:59,551 --> 00:45:59,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you?

617
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:00,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody?

618
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:02,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I don't.

619
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:03,876
[SPEAKER_08]: The water is not safe.

620
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:04,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you see this?

621
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:06,839
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I can't speak to the filters.

622
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:08,901
[SPEAKER_24]: The MWRA tests the water.

623
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:11,263
[SPEAKER_24]: They determine that it's safe.

624
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:12,244
[SPEAKER_08]: They test the water.

625
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:20,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway, maybe we have bad pipes on my street.

626
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:29,811
[SPEAKER_08]: When I called the city, what they told me to do, that they were going to do, is they were going to open one of the fire hydrants.

627
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And by doing that, it would push the water through.

628
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:39,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I was told that we were at the end, so it was a dead zone, which then they said, no, it wasn't.

629
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,317
[SPEAKER_08]: and that the water would flood through.

630
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:42,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't changed.

631
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:44,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had this system for years.

632
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,444
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gross, isn't it?

633
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I saw your face.

634
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:48,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross.

635
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:49,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross.

636
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:50,367
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we drink.

637
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,228
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we drink.

638
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:56,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So if the MWRA wants to say our water is fine,

639
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:58,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And we wanna believe it?

640
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:00,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I don't.

641
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:03,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I spent a few thousand dollars to put the system in.

642
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:08,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not really, it wasn't that much money, but with the filters buying them all the time, I'm probably up to that by now.

643
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a reverse osmosis system for my drinking water.

644
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:15,611
[SPEAKER_08]: And I advise that if you can afford it, to do it.

645
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:17,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

646
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:18,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

647
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,020
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment?

648
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,141
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

649
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:26,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Andrew Castaneda, Cushin Street, Medford, Mass.

650
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:34,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I just heard that Asian water pipes are over 100 years old, I believe.

651
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Between 75 and 120 are many of the water pipes.

652
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Boston is even older.

653
00:47:41,454 --> 00:47:43,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they've replaced all their pipes.

654
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:52,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And someone spoke and said it would cost like a half a billion dollars to replace all the new water pipes with new water pipes.

655
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:58,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many overrides or dead exclusions would that take?

656
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be more than a half a billion.

657
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:06,397
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, I think as we go now, if it ain't bust, don't fix it.

658
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:09,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just repair when there's a leak.

659
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of anyone that's not having access to fresh water, whether it's polluted or not, I have no clue.

660
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:19,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seems like, I never heard a complaint from anyone, and I talked to a lot of people.

661
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem to, everybody seems to have water.

662
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:31,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like to see the potholes filled from the Crystal Campbell fountain, which ain't working, the day after Patriots Day, after many years.

663
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:43,057
[SPEAKER_06]: going from right there on Riverside Ave going towards Route 93, I have to negotiate five or six bad potholes.

664
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should just concentrate, first of all, on the potholes, or as Councilor DelaRusso called them, potholers.

665
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:55,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

666
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

667
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,944
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins, to receive and place on file.

668
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

669
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CUMMING.

670
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:17,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

671
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

672
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:20,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

673
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lozano.

674
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:23,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

675
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:25,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lemming.

676
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:26,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

677
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scarpelli.

678
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:29,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

679
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:31,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Sang?

680
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:32,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

681
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:33,849
[SPEAKER_15]: President Beers?

682
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:36,170
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I'm in affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

683
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:37,891
[SPEAKER_24]: President Beers?

684
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,072
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-076 offered by Councilor Sperpelli.

685
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:40,833
[SPEAKER_24]: President Beers?

686
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:41,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Vice President Collins.

687
00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:43,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize for interrupting.

688
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to motion to take public participation out of order.

689
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:50,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand we have a member of the audience who can't stay very late, but would like to speak during public participation.

690
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, public participation on the motion of Vice President Collins to take public participation, seconded by?

691
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Saing, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

692
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Callaghan?

693
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:09,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

694
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:11,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins?

695
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:11,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

696
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:13,607
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lazzaro?

697
00:50:13,787 --> 00:50:14,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

698
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:15,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Fleming?

699
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:16,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

700
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scapelli?

701
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:19,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

702
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor saying President bears.

703
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:23,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes 74.

704
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:25,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Another negative motion passes public participation.

705
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:29,539
[SPEAKER_24]: We received two public comment emails and I'm also vice president Collins.

706
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,562
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have someone who'd like to speak in public participation.

707
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:32,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President bears.

708
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:35,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I was informed that there's a former member of the council who would like to speak.

709
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:36,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

710
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, members of the council.

711
00:50:57,948 --> 00:50:58,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

712
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:07,652
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a little bit jealous, a lot jealous, because at one time I sat in one of those seats for eight years, but now no one even knows my name, not even me.

713
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:16,696
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, I'm here tonight because I had the opportunity when I was in politics

714
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:26,278
[SPEAKER_22]: To serve with Jack McGlynn in the legislature and to serve with Jack McGlynn, we both had simultaneous elections to serve up here in the city council.

715
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:32,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Both were distinct honors for me, and I'm very proud of my service to the city of Medford.

716
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:40,868
[SPEAKER_22]: I apologize for my dress today, but I haven't been well, and I sort of had to come out of the bed to get here.

717
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:43,690
[SPEAKER_22]: But Jack McGlynn,

718
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:50,685
[SPEAKER_22]: was a member of the Ghost Army, the so-called Ghost Army.

719
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:59,311
[SPEAKER_22]: They would be over here and they would be making noises from over there to try to make the Germans know that they were around.

720
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:02,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Jacques Moulin never mentioned that to me.

721
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,074
[SPEAKER_22]: He never mentioned it at all.

722
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:11,159
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew him for 30, 40 years, but he never said I was in the service and I was in the Ghost Army.

723
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,101
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a ghost service to me.

724
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:21,127
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm here to let you know that all heroes don't come from afar, from distance.

725
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of our heroes live right amongst us.

726
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:30,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't spoken in this council chamber for over 40 years, close to 40 years anyway.

727
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:36,713
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm so proud that I had the opportunity to serve with an honorable man.

728
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:40,155
[SPEAKER_22]: I sometimes didn't disagree with Jack McClain.

729
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:42,568
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't agree with all of you.

730
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:46,649
[SPEAKER_22]: I wouldn't agree with myself again if I had the opportunity to go back.

731
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,730
[SPEAKER_22]: But he kept his nose clean.

732
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,930
[SPEAKER_22]: He was an honorable man.

733
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:58,971
[SPEAKER_22]: He played it close to the vest, and I was more outspoken, I guess.

734
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:06,293
[SPEAKER_22]: But don't look too far to see who your heroes are.

735
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:08,853
[SPEAKER_22]: They live on Lapham Street on Costello.

736
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:13,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Jack McGlynn was a true American hero.

737
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,113
[SPEAKER_22]: He served in the war.

738
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:17,814
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I'm getting choked up here.

739
00:53:19,054 --> 00:53:21,435
[SPEAKER_22]: That ghost army was really something to think about.

740
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:29,957
[SPEAKER_22]: What heroes they were making noise over here to get the Germans to come and look when they were really over here.

741
00:53:32,398 --> 00:53:37,539
[SPEAKER_22]: I am not going to take much of your time just to let you know that I think that

742
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,160
[SPEAKER_22]: We are very honored to have such a decent man in our midst.

743
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,621
[SPEAKER_22]: And his wife was terrific.

744
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:47,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Helen, I used to call her the first lady of Medford all the time.

745
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:48,986
[SPEAKER_22]: She was terrific.

746
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:53,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Jack McGlynn was an honorable man, even though I didn't sometimes agree with him.

747
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe I wasn't so honorable, I don't know.

748
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,616
[SPEAKER_22]: But you ought to be so proud to be sitting in those seats.

749
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:06,923
[SPEAKER_22]: I look back at my days in the legislature and my days sitting over there with great pride.

750
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:12,789
[SPEAKER_22]: When the people of the city vote for you and say, take care of our business, that really means something.

751
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,351
[SPEAKER_22]: It means they trust you.

752
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:17,935
[SPEAKER_22]: It means they want you to do the right thing by them.

753
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:20,398
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sure you will.

754
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:25,860
[SPEAKER_22]: It was an honor to sit here, it's an honor to speak here tonight.

755
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:34,204
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not gonna take any more of your time, except to let you know that I feel that sometimes honorable people don't get mentioned enough.

756
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:38,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Jack Wicklin was an honorable man, whether I agreed with him or not.

757
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:42,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Agreeing with me didn't make you honorable or dishonorable.

758
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,049
[SPEAKER_22]: It meant that we just agreed or we didn't agree.

759
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,151
[SPEAKER_22]: But in those days, seats were different.

760
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,880
[SPEAKER_22]: The council has changed.

761
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:54,821
[SPEAKER_22]: They had pews over here, rows.

762
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,282
[SPEAKER_22]: And I wish they were back, to be very frank.

763
00:54:58,182 --> 00:54:59,022
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish they were back.

764
00:55:01,523 --> 00:55:05,744
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what else to say, but I hate to give this microphone up after all these years.

765
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:10,466
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to give it up.

766
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:13,466
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to take it with me.

767
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:14,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Well.

768
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:19,658
[SPEAKER_22]: When you get elected, that's an honor.

769
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:20,318
[SPEAKER_22]: It really is.

770
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:21,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about it.

771
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:31,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about the thousands of people who put their necks beside your name because they wanted you to be here speaking for them and not listening to Kavanaugh.

772
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:39,803
[SPEAKER_22]: But I enjoyed my days here, and I enjoyed my days in the legislature, and I enjoyed being a representative of the people.

773
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:42,286
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sure that you all do also.

774
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:44,351
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that, I'm out of here.

775
00:55:45,032 --> 00:55:46,155
[SPEAKER_22]: See you in 40 years again.

776
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

777
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:49,021
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can, Mr. President.

778
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if I can, Judge Kavanaugh, if you can, if you honor me just for a moment, it takes a great man to know a great man.

779
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:27,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that it's important that Medford knows that.

780
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:44,672
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, talk about a legend.

781
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:49,395
[SPEAKER_05]: He's uh Judge Kavanaugh is is uh someone we should all be proud of.

782
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sometimes what he just said, sometimes I get offended now.

783
00:56:54,039 --> 00:57:01,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my behavior sometimes when you have honorable people like that approach the bench and um I remember as a young man,

784
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:11,429
[SPEAKER_05]: to speak on behalf of another great man.

785
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:20,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We're losing our heroes, and the gentleman who's leaving the chamber right now is one of those people, so we should give him what he deserves.

786
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:22,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

787
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,392
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

788
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:38,913
[SPEAKER_10]: the first person I canvassed this summer.

789
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to his house, and he was the first person I spoke to.

790
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:45,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And he gave me really, really good advice.

791
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:48,277
[SPEAKER_10]: He said to make sure that you earn votes.

792
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:50,778
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't just ask for them, you have to earn them.

793
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:52,679
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciated that.

794
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:53,840
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a nice chat.

795
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councillor Zara.

796
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you being here.

797
00:57:58,027 --> 00:58:24,200
[SPEAKER_24]: And just for folks watching and to note once again what Judge Kavanaugh was saying, we did dedicate and commemorate our last meeting in honor of Jack McGlynn and his service in the Ghost Army, which as folks can look up online, was made up of a few thousand folks who looked like 50,000 and made the German Nazi armies.

798
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:34,402
[SPEAKER_24]: think that there were mass mobilizations in one place or the other, but they had tanks, blow up tanks, and there was a signal core sending false radio transmissions.

799
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:36,063
[SPEAKER_24]: It's impressive.

800
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:47,547
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'll just reiterate my favorite anecdote from that was when Mayor Mike McGlynn, Jack McGlynn's son, got a call from a newspaper after some documents had been declassified in the 1990s.

801
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:53,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And he called his dad and he said, dad, what's this ghost army that they called about?

802
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,131
[SPEAKER_24]: The newspaper's calling, he said, who called you about that?

803
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:03,995
[SPEAKER_24]: He wanted to call the Pentagon and make sure that there hadn't been a leak of classified information.

804
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,995
[SPEAKER_24]: He hadn't told his own son 50 years later.

805
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:10,197
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that speaks to the humility of that role.

806
00:59:10,237 --> 00:59:16,020
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were honored with the, excuse me, they were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal, that entire unit, all the units.

807
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:24,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Public participation, is there anyone else who would like to participate for public participation in the chambers?

808
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:29,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Just in general, there is, of course, participation on the additional items on the agenda.

809
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:33,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none of the chambers, we do have one on Zoom.

810
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:35,505
[SPEAKER_24]: I see a hand, Bill Giglio.

811
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:38,766
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

812
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:41,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winterspeed.

813
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:42,948
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have three very quick things.

814
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:47,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't get my hand raised quick enough on the first resolution about the pet therapy.

815
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:50,173
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really, really, really good thing.

816
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:51,374
[SPEAKER_12]: It's worked for me in the past.

817
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:54,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've known it to work for a lot of people.

818
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:55,677
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's a really great thing.

819
00:59:55,697 --> 00:59:56,918
[SPEAKER_12]: So I appreciate you putting that through.

820
00:59:57,978 --> 01:00:11,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Second, Winter Street was freshly repaved about, I don't know, a year or so ago, and parts of it, especially where I live down by the high school, are already being dug up, and it's being patched, and now it obviously already looks horrible.

821
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:13,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody happen to know what's going on?

822
01:00:13,144 --> 01:00:16,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you might not know what's going on, but does anybody happen to know why it's being dug up already?

823
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:26,161
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know why, but I do know that under the city's rules, any reopenings within five years of a repaving require curb-to-curb repaving.

824
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:30,945
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you want to email me, let me know where that's being temporarily patched.

825
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:37,911
[SPEAKER_24]: I can let you know when their plans are to do a full curb-to-curb repaving, because that is the city rule on that.

826
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:39,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's great.

827
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:40,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

828
01:00:40,572 --> 01:00:46,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And also getting back I know on the first thing on the on the body cams from earlier.

829
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,261
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a very good meeting.

830
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:52,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say, Chief Buckley put on a great presentation very thorough.

831
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:55,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, at the end he got he got bombarded.

832
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:56,932
[SPEAKER_12]: with a bunch of nonsense.

833
01:00:56,992 --> 01:00:59,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just, I honestly think it was unnecessary.

834
01:00:59,713 --> 01:01:02,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would honestly love to see that subcommittee.

835
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, he was visibly upset.

836
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:06,838
[SPEAKER_12]: He was called a lot of unnecessary things.

837
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:17,104
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think maybe like an apology, maybe a written apology or some sort of formal apology to Chief Buckley would really be in line, in my personal opinion.

838
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:17,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

839
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:19,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

840
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:19,873
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

841
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:35,805
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know that members of the committee did speak to the chief after, you know, one of the public participation rules, the most recent Supreme Judicial Court ruling is that we cannot prevent anyone from, we cannot regulate the content of any public participation.

842
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:42,710
[SPEAKER_24]: So people are able to say whatever they think, other than they can't be swearing or, you know, being vulgar.

843
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,671
[SPEAKER_24]: But other than that,

844
01:01:44,271 --> 01:02:05,340
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't regulate the content of what anyone's saying, so while I understand the frustration when public comments may not be what folks want to hear, and I understand the Chief's frustration at public comments that he did not want to hear, the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that people can say what they want to say, and the only rules that we can set are around how long folks have to speak and when they can speak.

845
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:15,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if they did speak to him after that, I'd like to say I appreciate that, because it was a little, you know, my opinion, a lot of it was uncalled for, and if they spoke to him after, I appreciate that.

846
01:02:15,423 --> 01:02:15,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

847
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:17,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

848
01:02:18,746 --> 01:02:22,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further public participation before we resume the agenda?

849
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:29,194
[SPEAKER_24]: We did have two public comment emails.

850
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:31,616
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the public comment emails to enter them into the record?

851
01:02:31,636 --> 01:02:32,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

852
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:38,412
[SPEAKER_24]: on the motion of Councillor Collins to enter public comment emails into the record, seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

853
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:44,174
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

854
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Callaghan.

855
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

856
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:50,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

857
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

858
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:53,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

859
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:55,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lazaro.

860
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

861
01:02:57,298 --> 01:02:58,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lemming.

862
01:02:58,738 --> 01:02:59,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

863
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:01,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scapelli.

864
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:01,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

865
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:03,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor saying yes.

866
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:05,056
[SPEAKER_15]: President beers.

867
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:06,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I mean from another negative.

868
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:09,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Those emails will be included as part of the official record of the meeting.

869
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:25,108
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-076 be resolved by the city council that we requested the city administration provide a full report involving the use of taxpayer dollars being used to fund lawsuit settlements and investigations with city of Medford, active and past employees.

870
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:29,971
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it further resolved that the city council moved to executive session if needed to discuss sensitive funding information.

871
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:30,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

872
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:32,454
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. President.

873
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:38,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I think that there's a dialogue that's being that's that's created now.

874
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope everybody's really watching and listening because we're hearing a lot lately about lack of funding, lack of management, saying it's not mismanagement.

875
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:56,283
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we're seeing in what the dialogue that I'm trying to show everyone is that

876
01:03:58,131 --> 01:04:04,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We have rules in this council that any awards over $5,000 have to be approved by this council.

877
01:04:05,414 --> 01:04:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We know of many, multiple, multiple hundreds of thousands of settlements that have been put out there that I've talked to different representatives that we know nothing about.

878
01:04:16,297 --> 01:04:23,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So anytime we have these issues and we have these issues that come up and questions that come up,

879
01:04:24,522 --> 01:04:26,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like they're hidden agendas.

880
01:04:27,524 --> 01:04:32,588
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been asking, for instance, what we paid KP Law since they've been here.

881
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we voted on what?

882
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: $5,000 for a retainer so they can be on staff for the mayor.

883
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:40,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now that's blown up.

884
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:41,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we don't know what it is.

885
01:04:41,614 --> 01:04:48,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that if it goes by the trend of December, which is close to $80,000 for the month of December, that's pretty frightening.

886
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not including other things we know nothing about.

887
01:04:53,208 --> 01:05:07,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bring this up to ask the mayor, especially before the budget season and before my colleagues asked him that what we're seeing a trend of possibly asking for taxpayers to be penalized for the lack of mismanagement and what we're seeing.

888
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:18,509
[SPEAKER_05]: When I say lack of mismanagement, we see a mayor speaking for years at debates talking about new growth and development.

889
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:25,899
[SPEAKER_05]: At the debate with Councilor Caviello, she spoke and saying that we have three projects ready to go that raise millions of dollars.

890
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:27,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Those projects are gone.

891
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I asked, I asked for the Office of Community Development to come out because we had 40B jobs.

892
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:41,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember we talked about the mismanagement of the 40B jobs and losing over 600 housing units for affordable housing.

893
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:42,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

894
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:48,085
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost millions and millions and millions of dollars for fees, fines and new taxes.

895
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:49,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called new growth.

896
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:50,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had that.

897
01:05:51,308 --> 01:05:59,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the mayor talk about Method Square, starting Method Square, shovels in the ground, bringing millions of dollars of revenue, nothing.

898
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:00,177
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen nothing.

899
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:09,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I say mismanagement, it's mismanagement of understanding of where we're going in the direction we're going in the city of Medford.

900
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say we didn't fund anything.

901
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say that we're putting money into the general account.

902
01:06:15,216 --> 01:06:18,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why we have to put in general account is because our management

903
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:25,947
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't following through with the promises that they've made of transparency and follow through for new growth.

904
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:27,128
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't seen any of it.

905
01:06:27,808 --> 01:06:29,470
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why we're going to general fund.

906
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:38,337
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why the money that was earmarked for one thing has to go to another thing, because we're losing that money because we're not the mismanagement of our finances in the city hall.

907
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna give you some examples that I want.

908
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking the mayor for a report, meeting executive sessions, not to know anybody's names, but to understand that, where is this going?

909
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:55,168
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for mismanagement of finance for City of Method.

910
01:06:55,709 --> 01:07:02,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see the dismissals of city staff, and then the lawsuits filed by that city staff.

911
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:06,076
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost of investigating

912
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:25,959
[SPEAKER_05]: these city staff members, the cost for hiring private investigators, this I'm even hearing, and this is what the problem is when you have lack of transparency and lack of openness, central administration, that I believe the firefighters were told to be careful because people are watching them now.

913
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:28,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is this is what happens.

914
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,402
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what happens because it's been done before.

915
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:37,753
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a city, there's a DPW employee that was followed for months, months by a private investigator.

916
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:39,314
[SPEAKER_05]: He was let go.

917
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:49,760
[SPEAKER_05]: He's right now in active, it's in an active process right now, but they've already told him, the courts have already ruled, there was nothing wrong.

918
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,442
[SPEAKER_05]: We wasted thousands and thousands of dollars on investigators.

919
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:58,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at the cost of legal representation for all these cases.

920
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:03,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget about the 40 B cases that you know, they could have won.

921
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:06,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an automatic, you can't fight a 40 B and lose.

922
01:08:06,922 --> 01:08:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: All you can do is string it along a long enough time so the developers can back out because they're losing so much in funding.

923
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:16,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what happened.

924
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,974
[SPEAKER_05]: One project we had,

925
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:25,470
[SPEAKER_05]: A development company went bankrupt after four years, they're gone.

926
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The 40B projects, they waited.

927
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:30,072
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the world's the gold gym site.

928
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:33,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The owner spent over $12 million to keep that going.

929
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the investors in that job had done what now?

930
01:08:36,955 --> 01:08:38,956
[SPEAKER_05]: They've said, you know what, enough is enough, we're moving forward.

931
01:08:39,777 --> 01:08:50,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The project on Boston Ave that I believe they're talking about possibly putting in a mosque now, five acres putting to a mosque, lack of taxpayer money, lack of new growth.

932
01:08:50,953 --> 01:08:51,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about that.

933
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand the mismanagement and what's happening.

934
01:08:55,157 --> 01:08:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where where's the money?

935
01:08:56,438 --> 01:08:57,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there money there?

936
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:07,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we looking now to look at a pretty pretty outrageous and intense movements to try to bring new money in through the tax payers?

937
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:13,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do that until we see where the mismanagement is coming at City Hall.

938
01:09:13,913 --> 01:09:17,258
[SPEAKER_05]: We see the city, the staffing that has to be paid.

939
01:09:17,318 --> 01:09:21,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask for the record that the mayor please

940
01:09:22,836 --> 01:09:29,621
[SPEAKER_05]: inform us the cost of any consultants or per diem staff that she has in place right now, she has in the last few years.

941
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, let's say four years since you've been in office, and what we're paying out the staff that she hasn't filled.

942
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:43,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not because it's not because people are leaving because they want to.

943
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:45,593
[SPEAKER_05]: They're being pushed out.

944
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about good people.

945
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:55,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't even heard the case haven't heard about about Alicia Nunley, the best finance director in the Commonwealth, I would say.

946
01:09:56,414 --> 01:10:03,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Durham, the best veterans affairs director that method has ever seen the state has ever seen gone.

947
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:07,102
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about settlements that I know that we know.

948
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:14,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you did you know the custodians settled on their their legal issues that they were they were given back $500,000 that the city reimbursed them.

949
01:10:17,657 --> 01:10:20,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They were rewarded that did we vote on that?

950
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:21,079
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

951
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:31,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cost of settlements, the cities in the schools, I want to know what that what those numbers are not the people, but what the numbers are.

952
01:10:32,325 --> 01:10:40,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cost of the law firms because I know it's just not KP law, you can see that when we say KP law, everybody picks on them, because they're in front of us every day.

953
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

954
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:48,470
[SPEAKER_05]: We have multiple, multiple law offices that are working for the city of Medford, multiple.

955
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:57,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And it hurts me because I see new counselors giving reports that they met with KP Law.

956
01:10:58,475 --> 01:11:06,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because some of our counselors, Justin and I laughed the other day when Matt talked about, Counselor Lemming talked about he met with KP Law.

957
01:11:07,839 --> 01:11:10,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I was never given, no one's ever told me we could talk to KP Law.

958
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:17,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would love to know what that costs, because an in-house city solicitor is part of their salary.

959
01:11:18,344 --> 01:11:19,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it so easy.

960
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:35,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we look at this resolution, this is really to get a report before the budget comes out, before we look at some drastic changes, because I don't know if people heard, but I believe the school department has $7.5 million to get leveled.

961
01:11:36,227 --> 01:11:37,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what we're hearing?

962
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: 7.5 million.

963
01:11:41,704 --> 01:11:45,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, now I'm going to guarantee you everybody, the rainy day account.

964
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:49,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does somebody want to bring the rainy day account in?

965
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:50,710
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got to put the money from somewhere.

966
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So she wants to take it from free cash.

967
01:11:53,532 --> 01:11:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let everybody know this is what it is because I've been here a long time.

968
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:00,056
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going to go to free cash, call it a rainy day account and pull out.

969
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it truly $7.5 million?

970
01:12:02,177 --> 01:12:02,518
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

971
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody nervous about that?

972
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

973
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,540
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be.

974
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:07,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a scary number.

975
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still going to be a scary number.

976
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:22,402
[SPEAKER_05]: But the mismanagement of this city, the mismanagement of the school department, the mismanagement of the finances and that office in this city has been devastating to this community.

977
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:31,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only lack of new growth, but also in fraudulent and misleading and legal fees.

978
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:39,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we don't know what they are, we can only speculate.

979
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:55,763
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I asked the mayor to bring us a report in the executive session so my fellow councils can look at this when it comes down to understanding some of the comments that my fellow councils have made in the past about looking at different funding mechanisms.

980
01:12:56,423 --> 01:13:02,568
[SPEAKER_05]: going back to the taxpayers and saying, hey, we need we need X amount of money $250 million for new high school.

981
01:13:03,469 --> 01:13:05,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe it was I've talked to new school committee.

982
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:17,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have some people in the audience right now that worked on this new school projects before I've talked to people in Somerville just did a new school people in Arlington to think in this climate of $7.5 million in the hole.

983
01:13:19,443 --> 01:13:25,408
[SPEAKER_05]: that the school committee is going to come to us and ask us for $2.5 million so they can start the project.

984
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:26,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't even know.

985
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:33,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it starts at 30% reimbursement of a new high school.

986
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,376
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even know what it's going to be.

987
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:40,716
[SPEAKER_05]: the feasibility study $2.5 million when we don't even know if we're going to come close to this.

988
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:45,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I'm gathering from my friends that I have in the state, it's not very positive.

989
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:52,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason why I bring this up in this, this is, this is hopefully we can go to do I think it's going to happen?

990
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:52,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

991
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,831
[SPEAKER_05]: We're never going to see this.

992
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:57,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But the hope is to go on executive session with the administration

993
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: with her legal team, with the HR director, with the chief of staff with the mayor with us sit there and say, Okay, this is what we spent the last four years.

994
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: These are lawsuits that are pending, because I know there are lawsuits out there right now that they're trying to settle out of court.

995
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:14,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that.

996
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:18,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's hundreds of 1000s of millions of dollars out there that still have to be spent.

997
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:22,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, we have nothing new going.

998
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I take it back.

999
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:28,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a music venue going on in Mystic Ave.

1000
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:34,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mystic Ave, we're supposed to change the zoning, the gateway community is gonna come in.

1001
01:14:34,872 --> 01:14:35,692
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the talk now?

1002
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one building being talked about, one building and nothing else.

1003
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:49,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ask again, my fellow councilors, as we go through this process of looking to where the needs are in our city, we all know

1004
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:52,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fiscally strapped.

1005
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know we're in crisis financially.

1006
01:14:56,073 --> 01:15:06,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And possibly, if it came down and we could sit together with the administration and they can show us, they can show me that, you know what, George, this is the data.

1007
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:08,662
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're right.

1008
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't lose millions of dollars in new tax.

1009
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:16,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't lose millions of dollars in new fees and fees in permitting.

1010
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:17,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't.

1011
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:21,756
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't lose millions of dollars on on settlements.

1012
01:15:21,836 --> 01:15:26,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't lose millions of dollars on on legal services.

1013
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:32,721
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can show me that I will be the first one to vote yes on anything that you ask for an increase in taxes.

1014
01:15:33,522 --> 01:15:35,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But until they can show us

1015
01:15:36,755 --> 01:15:39,696
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're not mismanaging our funds, because this is what we do.

1016
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:47,139
[SPEAKER_05]: The city council, we're in charge with a fiscal stewards of our our city's finances, with the last line of defense.

1017
01:15:47,619 --> 01:16:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless we can prove that they can prove that all we'll be doing moving forward, and any sort of tax, any sort of override any sort of debt exclusion, it's putting more money into a hole that'll disappear.

1018
01:16:01,544 --> 01:16:01,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

1019
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all smart enough to understand that.

1020
01:16:05,988 --> 01:16:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is why I bring this resolution up, Mr. President.

1021
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:16,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I ask the mayor to please bring this forward, that she meets with us in executive session to give us a breakdown, to prove me wrong.

1022
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:17,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope she can.

1023
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:19,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Come prove me wrong.

1024
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:21,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me we're not spending millions and millions of dollars.

1025
01:16:24,653 --> 01:16:28,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we could see a way that we can find a way to fund the city the way it needs to be funded.

1026
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:32,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But until then, these are huge questions that they need to answer.

1027
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,385
[SPEAKER_05]: This is mismanagement.

1028
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:38,951
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't hundreds of years of neglect.

1029
01:16:39,472 --> 01:16:43,198
[SPEAKER_05]: This is mismanagement from someone that's been in office now for years.

1030
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: She's done nothing.

1031
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,785
[SPEAKER_05]: When neighborhood communities were in the same spot we were,

1032
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to the mayor in Malden, talk to the mayor in Somerville, talk to the mayor in Everett.

1033
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:55,708
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the same issues we had.

1034
01:16:56,329 --> 01:17:07,998
[SPEAKER_05]: They used those funds to make sure they did what was right for their community first, before she started covering general accounts because she mismanaged the business of the city.

1035
01:17:08,318 --> 01:17:12,661
[SPEAKER_05]: She's done a terrible job in the city bringing finances in the system.

1036
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:15,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, the last meeting we had was new growth was what?

1037
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,941
[SPEAKER_05]: our new growth that we talked about.

1038
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:21,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Councilor Baird says that the city assessor is going to give us a great report.

1039
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to see it.

1040
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:25,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But here we are, year five now.

1041
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:27,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Year five, she's the mayor.

1042
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:37,153
[SPEAKER_05]: The most we've seen that was presented to us was a million dollars, new growth from fees and fines from traffic and parking.

1043
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:38,954
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing to me.

1044
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:41,015
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing to me.

1045
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:46,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked for this report, because I don't know, I'm sure you're all smart enough that you see what I'm trying to do here.

1046
01:17:47,422 --> 01:17:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to show my colleagues that listen, I understand what you're saying.

1047
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And you we need we need the finances.

1048
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,693
[SPEAKER_05]: But understanding taxation isn't always the best resolution.

1049
01:17:58,294 --> 01:18:00,796
[SPEAKER_05]: First, let's find out what's causing this.

1050
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't we bringing in new money?

1051
01:18:03,484 --> 01:18:06,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we spending so much money on things we shouldn't be?

1052
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:16,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we shows that that's not true at all, Councilor Scott Pelli, then I walk away in peace voting for whatever the city needs.

1053
01:18:16,231 --> 01:18:23,995
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, this right now shows poor, poor mismanagement of the finances of this community and the leadership of this community.

1054
01:18:24,235 --> 01:18:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1055
01:18:26,116 --> 01:18:27,117
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

1056
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,769
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go to Vice President Collins, but first I just want to say a couple things.

1057
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:36,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Last year the budget fiscal 24 budget new growth was 2.5 million.

1058
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:47,560
[SPEAKER_24]: And we did receive in the budget, we have meetings on the three departments tomorrow in committee of the whole, we did receive a quarter one quarter two budget to actuals document.

1059
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,200
[SPEAKER_24]: from the administration.

1060
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,582
[SPEAKER_24]: The law department spending as of December 31st was $172,000 out of a budget of $552,000.

1061
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:56,923
[SPEAKER_24]: So only families spent 31% of their budget, 50% of the way through the year.

1062
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:57,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

1063
01:18:57,963 --> 01:18:59,044
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, President Baird.

1064
01:18:59,064 --> 01:18:59,524
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate that.

1065
01:19:10,992 --> 01:19:12,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, we've known each other for a term.

1066
01:19:12,673 --> 01:19:13,954
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a lot I agree with you about.

1067
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,135
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some I disagree with you about.

1068
01:19:15,155 --> 01:19:16,196
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not news to anybody.

1069
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:20,519
[SPEAKER_09]: What I do think that we all share is that we're looking for the holistic picture.

1070
01:19:21,468 --> 01:19:30,452
[SPEAKER_09]: and I do think that as a city council under our current charter, we're kind of always at a disadvantage because we do have the final vote on the budget.

1071
01:19:31,012 --> 01:19:31,832
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't craft it.

1072
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:32,913
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't add to it.

1073
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,754
[SPEAKER_09]: We can only make line item subtractions.

1074
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:45,318
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in a difficult and disadvantaged position to have that 30,000 foot view on the budget when we receive all of our information

1075
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:50,582
[SPEAKER_09]: through intermediaries, through departments, through the administration, essentially second hand.

1076
01:19:51,223 --> 01:19:53,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think all of us have found that challenging.

1077
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:54,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that I have found it challenging.

1078
01:19:58,646 --> 01:20:00,948
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot that I think is really critical as we move forward.

1079
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:09,555
[SPEAKER_09]: We already had a conversation tonight on two major pieces of infrastructure that we know will take years to bring up to the level of condition that residents deserve.

1080
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:13,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And we barely even touched on the new high school, and that's another one.

1081
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Residents deserve a new, better high school.

1082
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:25,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it is both true that we need to make sure we have a clear picture of why our budget is the way it is,

1083
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:43,728
[SPEAKER_09]: in fairness to everybody, and we have to hold that it's equally crucial that we do what needs to happen so that residents have the environment and the resources and the public sector and the public staff and the city infrastructure that they deserve.

1084
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:51,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know for me, we cannot afford to wait on any avenues that can get us closer to that.

1085
01:20:51,872 --> 01:20:54,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I also do want to note, you know, we speak about

1086
01:20:55,552 --> 01:21:03,521
[SPEAKER_09]: what our jurisdiction is and what our jurisdiction isn't for, you know, what city resources look like and what our budget looks like.

1087
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:12,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to add, since we mentioned Mystic Avenue, it's a constant source of frustration for me that we don't have a more direct hand in the spending of city resources so that we, you know, when

1088
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:13,502
[SPEAKER_09]: that.

1089
01:21:13,522 --> 01:21:19,145
[SPEAKER_09]: City staff and residents come to us bringing up particular projects and departments that we can't more directly intervene.

1090
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:31,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But I am really proud that this council has, you know, for several terms now made it a shared goal to do what we can on the zoning ordinances side so that we can lay the foundation for rapidly improving new growth commercial

1091
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:48,604
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not direct because developments come from developers, but we have a direct hand in laying the foundation where our commercial tax base, where new growth can flourish in the city.

1092
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:51,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm proud that that's one piece that we do have jurisdiction over.

1093
01:21:51,786 --> 01:22:01,954
[SPEAKER_09]: This council is making a priority for several terms now, and we are already starting to see developers take advantage and start to take

1094
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:05,295
[SPEAKER_09]: that's going to benefit.

1095
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:09,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Um everything that we talk about in these chambers that deserve more investment than what we're currently getting.

1096
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:10,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1097
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:12,757
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins Council.

1098
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:13,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

1099
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:15,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1100
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:19,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Um I definitely do believe that, uh, our city's underfunded.

1101
01:22:19,819 --> 01:22:25,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it is a pretty simple math problem that when you don't fix your water price for 100 years, you don't fix your roads for decades.

1102
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,541
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't fix your schools for 20 years.

1103
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:26,801
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't

1104
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:34,942
[SPEAKER_18]: for years so that those salaries are below commensurate for other cities.

1105
01:22:35,303 --> 01:22:44,331
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that that math problem is pretty simple one, but that doesn't mean that I believe that all of our money is being spent properly and I really appreciate this resolution.

1106
01:22:44,672 --> 01:22:50,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's incredibly important that we understand and that the community also understands how money is being spent.

1107
01:22:51,777 --> 01:22:57,380
[SPEAKER_18]: and that we are really responsible and that that money is not being wasted.

1108
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:10,685
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really appreciate this resolution and any other resolutions that come to us having transparency and understanding the way that the city is being run and to make sure that our funds are being used well.

1109
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:13,587
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1110
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:14,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

1111
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,449
[SPEAKER_24]: Any comments from members of the public?

1112
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:23,075
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

1113
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:24,196
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sure.

1114
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:26,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1115
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

1116
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:32,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a comment about public participation.

1117
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:39,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confused on how it was carried out because I read the agenda and I thought the emails were going to be read aloud and that did not happen.

1118
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:42,720
[SPEAKER_00]: So regarding this resolution, of course, I support it.

1119
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:48,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say that in my view, this is the most productive city council meeting that I've been to.

1120
01:23:49,164 --> 01:23:56,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to the two past ones, and this is the kind of discussions that directly affect residents and that I hope that I can see more in the future.

1121
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:02,010
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just note that we've had many of these discussions the last two before the last two meetings.

1122
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's good.

1123
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:04,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.

1124
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have been to the past two.

1125
01:24:06,472 --> 01:24:15,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read the two emails and I've also been, as I've mentioned, to the past two meetings, and I know what has been going on here in the city council chamber.

1126
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:20,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give my view on how I see things.

1127
01:24:21,164 --> 01:24:25,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe it's clear, most unfortunately, that the Metro community is divided.

1128
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:30,871
[SPEAKER_00]: The City Council should strive to avoid creating further divisions among Metro neighbors.

1129
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:36,596
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all work to build upon our similarities, rather than drift apart based on our differences.

1130
01:24:37,296 --> 01:24:43,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Generalizations are unfair and damaging because they indiscriminately put everyone in the same bag.

1131
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:48,961
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a problem with the behavior of one or a few individuals, then the problem should be discussed with those individuals separately.

1132
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:58,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Referring to a group of people as an angry mob and accusing them of being ignorant stigmatizes those that are, in fact, a group of fellow Medford neighbors.

1133
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:08,763
[SPEAKER_00]: We should try to understand why some residents are feeling frustrated that the city's government today is a clear example of why some of us are very, very frustrated at what we're seeing.

1134
01:25:10,347 --> 01:25:23,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself feel frustrated, in addition to what I've been seeing today, that the solutions proposed by this city council to address some of Medford's problems almost always rely on more government control and higher and or new taxes.

1135
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:29,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Relying on more government control and higher taxes often leads to inefficient solutions and can stifle economic vitality.

1136
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:33,824
[SPEAKER_00]: To address Medford problems, we should instead consider approaches that leverage market mechanisms.

1137
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:34,405
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance,

1138
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:41,669
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.

1139
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:41,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage private investment through deregulation where excessive rules may deter business growth and innovation.

1140
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:41,669
2.

1141
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:49,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Implement a user fee structure for specific services which aligns costs directly with those who benefit, rather than a blanket tax increase.

1142
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:49,713
3.

1143
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:59,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Foster competition in service provision like waste management or consulting services, I've been in email communication with several of you regarding this, which can increase quality and reduce costs.

1144
01:26:00,106 --> 01:26:07,609
[SPEAKER_00]: A focus on enhancing economic freedom and reducing unnecessary governmental overhead can lead to more sustainable and effective solutions.

1145
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:19,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to summarize by stating that I prefer a city council chamber that is full of passionate, and yes, sometimes noisy, neighbors rather than a chamber that is empty and completely silent.

1146
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:25,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It's healthy for our local democracy to have so many residents interested in the work of the city council.

1147
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:28,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find unity in our passion for local politics.

1148
01:26:28,256 --> 01:26:28,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

1149
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:31,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1150
01:26:35,544 --> 01:26:41,127
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion on the topic of the lawsuit settlements and investigations?

1151
01:26:55,981 --> 01:26:59,742
[SPEAKER_04]: the executive session meeting with the City Council to discuss these issues and concerns.

1152
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:07,124
[SPEAKER_24]: So motion to refer the paper to the mayor, requesting answers to the questions and an executive session, please.

1153
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1154
01:27:14,866 --> 01:27:18,907
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1155
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:20,647
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll go to public participation.

1156
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:23,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr Orlando, name and address for the record, please.

1157
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:29,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Richard Orlando of Winford Way, Medford, Massachusetts.

1158
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:33,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Just a very brief statement, something that came to mind.

1159
01:27:34,338 --> 01:27:37,781
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd just like you to think about this.

1160
01:27:38,682 --> 01:27:45,408
[SPEAKER_20]: The city's lack of financial responsibility should not be borne by taxes to the public.

1161
01:27:46,707 --> 01:27:55,918
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless you can demonstrate financial responsibility, being run correctly, the dropkick shouldn't be to increase tax to the people until you get the answer to those questions.

1162
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,199
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all, thank you.

1163
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:57,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1164
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:04,448
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a question from our hand raised on Zoom.

1165
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:06,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Maureen, name and address for the record, please.

1166
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:13,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.

1167
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:28,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell Councilman Scarpelli how grateful I am that he keeps bringing up the issue of transparency, because there is nothing coming from the mayor's office in City Hall.

1168
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:31,227
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion, first of all.

1169
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:39,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently that opinion is shared by others, such as another Medford resident who spoke before I did.

1170
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:47,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite eloquently, I want to mention that it seems to me like the mayor is

1171
01:28:49,682 --> 01:28:55,624
[SPEAKER_01]: kicking the can down the road in terms of filling vital positions within the city of Medford.

1172
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:57,685
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have a city councilor.

1173
01:28:58,485 --> 01:29:03,107
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have a assistance, not city councilor.

1174
01:29:03,447 --> 01:29:05,087
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have a city solicitor.

1175
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:08,068
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have an assistant city solicitor.

1176
01:29:08,888 --> 01:29:17,611
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to outsource the chief of the fire services and she wants to outsource the water

1177
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:25,608
[SPEAKER_01]: key positions within the Medford water and sewer offices.

1178
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:35,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I just want to make one comment that is very dismaying to me to watch a city counselor

1179
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:55,784
[SPEAKER_01]: in the session right now who has been on his computer and his cell phone for the past half an hour while I sit here patiently waiting and concentrating and listening to everything, every word that all of you have to say.

1180
01:29:56,804 --> 01:30:02,186
[SPEAKER_01]: That person should be spoken to about the inappropriateness of his behavior.

1181
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:04,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1182
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:07,117
[SPEAKER_23]: through the chair.

1183
01:30:07,237 --> 01:30:08,218
[SPEAKER_23]: Are you referring to the chair?

1184
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not referring to the chair, sir.

1185
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:18,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm referring to one of the members sitting in the round table around the chair.

1186
01:30:19,644 --> 01:30:19,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1187
01:30:19,964 --> 01:30:23,305
[SPEAKER_24]: I will just note that, you know, for example, we may be managing Zoom.

1188
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:25,887
[SPEAKER_24]: I often take notes and bring up reference documents.

1189
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:30,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli brings up things on his phone, researches things on his phone.

1190
01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:34,331
[SPEAKER_24]: They're often tools to enhance our participation in the meeting.

1191
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:40,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect that and admire that because you're multitasking in a difficult environment.

1192
01:30:41,053 --> 01:30:49,118
[SPEAKER_01]: But one individual has been scrolling on his computer and typing into his cell phone the entire time.

1193
01:30:49,638 --> 01:30:54,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really an abuse of power and time in this setting.

1194
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,003
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1195
01:30:57,263 --> 01:30:59,584
[SPEAKER_24]: It's certainly not.

1196
01:31:01,825 --> 01:31:04,447
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment on

1197
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:05,899
[SPEAKER_24]: this paper.

1198
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:17,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the mayor requesting answers to the questions and an executive session seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1199
01:31:17,864 --> 01:31:19,065
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1200
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:21,606

[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lozano.

1205
01:31:28,328 --> 01:31:28,529
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1206
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:30,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lemming.

1207
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,310

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_15]: President Beard.

1213
01:31:37,609 --> 01:31:39,050
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 60 affirmative, more than negative.

1214
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:40,191
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

1215
01:31:40,211 --> 01:31:43,554
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-077 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1216
01:31:43,594 --> 01:31:44,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Resolution to discuss.

1217
01:31:45,155 --> 01:31:46,316
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

1218
01:31:53,762 --> 01:32:01,488
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to join papers 24-077 and 24-081 by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1219
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:02,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1220
01:32:07,574 --> 01:32:08,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CASSIDY.

1221
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:10,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CASSIDY.

1222
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:26,970
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, seven in the affirmative.

1223
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,912
[SPEAKER_24]: None of the negative emotion passes 24 dash 07.

1224
01:32:29,952 --> 01:32:30,952
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I read them both?

1225
01:32:30,972 --> 01:32:31,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, sure.

1226
01:32:31,933 --> 01:32:32,273
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1227
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:44,139
[SPEAKER_24]: 24 dash 077 by Councillor Scarpelli be resolved that the City Council discussed the possible harmful materials being stored on the MBTA commuter railway that abuts residential homes, most notably the creosote railroad ties and 24 dash 081.

1228
01:32:47,982 --> 01:33:08,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Council President provided verbal update on efforts by Council leadership, the mayor, city staff, representative Garmelie and local residents to remove creosote Soak Railroad ties that are an environmental and health hazard along the MBTA lower line, be it further resolved that the council request immediate action by the MBTA to remove these ties from residential areas and forward a copy of this resolution by email to our state delegation.

1229
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1230
01:33:10,081 --> 01:33:21,106
[SPEAKER_05]: First, this was reached out by a few neighbors and they didn't realize, and I explained to them that Council President and a few of other my colleagues have been working tirelessly on this issue.

1231
01:33:21,126 --> 01:33:29,971
[SPEAKER_05]: When I went out to visit and talk with them, you can blatantly smell the creosote that is, I can't see how it's not harmful.

1232
01:33:31,371 --> 01:33:35,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that you've done your due diligence, Council President, I really appreciate that.

1233
01:33:35,452 --> 01:33:40,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how hard you work with the MBTA, our state delegation to make sure something moves on this.

1234
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:48,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just gonna step away and just give you the kudos you deserve because you've worked tirelessly on this.

1235
01:33:48,496 --> 01:33:52,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we're seeing the true ignorance of our MBTA work its magic.

1236
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1237
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:56,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli I appreciate that I can just give a brief update.

1238
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:10,090
[SPEAKER_24]: There's been an issue ongoing for over two months now, especially behind Tyler app but along the lower line commuter rail where railroad ties soaked increase so which is a pretty toxic flammable material have been being placed within

1239
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:17,557
[SPEAKER_24]: 50 feet of homes, you know, right in a residential neighborhood, some of them nearby to a daycare in February.

1240
01:34:17,577 --> 01:34:22,642
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is part of a program to replace the rail lines.

1241
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:24,824
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, they have to do it for safety purposes, but.

1242
01:34:27,068 --> 01:34:45,550
[SPEAKER_24]: In February, there was the first time these were placed there and I was just able to successfully work with Director Blake and some other folks to get the MBTA to move the ties up the line into Winchester, where they're in near the forest, you know in the DCR forest area rather than right abutting residential homes.

1243
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:56,454
[SPEAKER_24]: And then a couple weeks ago, maybe five times as many ties came and replaced right on Tyler Avenue along the MBTA railroad line.

1244
01:34:57,615 --> 01:35:02,177
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor has made direct requests director Blake from traffic and transportation has made requests.

1245
01:35:02,617 --> 01:35:05,358
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been working with director with representative Garber Lee.

1246
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:19,465
[SPEAKER_24]: Residents have been reaching out, residents have engaged the Mass Department of Environmental Protection, and there's probably a couple hundred, 200 email chain at this point, going back and forth between dozens of people trying to get the MBTA to do this.

1247
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:24,127
[SPEAKER_24]: And the MBTA has basically said, no, we have to replace the ties, prove that this is toxic.

1248
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,269
[SPEAKER_24]: So it has been a frustrating.

1249
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:36,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, just last week, we were out trying to get them to do something, been talking to Representative Garbally, and he's been basically getting a stonewall as well.

1250
01:35:37,277 --> 01:35:39,318
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are continuing to try.

1251
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:42,461
[SPEAKER_24]: The MBTA has invoked a couple of things.

1252
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,704
[SPEAKER_24]: They basically said, if you want to prove it's toxic, call the EPA.

1253
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:54,090
[SPEAKER_24]: And then they've also said, we'll bring in the Federal Railroad Administration if we have to bring in the federal, because it's federal rails, we have to replace the rails.

1254
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:54,691
[SPEAKER_24]: So they are

1255
01:35:56,152 --> 01:36:07,159
[SPEAKER_24]: not responding in the way that you would hope of a partner in government on this issue, but we have had a lot of people working on this, and I'll continue to keep working on it as best as I can.

1256
01:36:07,419 --> 01:36:07,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1257
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:10,261
[SPEAKER_26]: Councillor Sang.

1258
01:36:10,962 --> 01:36:15,945
[SPEAKER_26]: I wanted to thank both you, President Baird, and Councillor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

1259
01:36:18,095 --> 01:36:27,561
[SPEAKER_26]: I was going through my inbox, and the first time we heard about this issue as a council actually was in June last year, where we did actually get a resolution on it, a temporary resolution.

1260
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:34,105
[SPEAKER_26]: Back then, similar to what you were describing now, there was a lot of back and forth from residents, city staff.

1261
01:36:35,106 --> 01:36:40,810
[SPEAKER_26]: I made calls, I know you made calls, a number of councillors made calls at the time, and we got a temporary solution.

1262
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,631
[SPEAKER_26]: But then this issue came back.

1263
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:48,076
[SPEAKER_26]: And it seems like the number of ties there is higher than ever.

1264
01:36:48,596 --> 01:36:52,801
[SPEAKER_26]: One resident did actually, I think, bring out a pretty decent idea in asking.

1265
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:55,904
[SPEAKER_26]: I had to make sure I had the language for it.

1266
01:36:56,444 --> 01:36:58,386
[SPEAKER_26]: It's somewhere deep in the email chain.

1267
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:03,872
[SPEAKER_26]: But to ask for the actual material safety data sheet for the creosote.

1268
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:06,392
[SPEAKER_26]: that was applied to the ties.

1269
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:15,435
[SPEAKER_26]: I was wondering if either of you would be amenable to adding that into the resolution as well to ask for that material safety data sheet.

1270
01:37:16,155 --> 01:37:17,375
[SPEAKER_26]: This is a serious issue.

1271
01:37:17,715 --> 01:37:21,456
[SPEAKER_26]: I know you in particular have worked really tirelessly on this.

1272
01:37:21,716 --> 01:37:24,797
[SPEAKER_26]: Our state rep, Sean Garvely, has worked very hard on this as well.

1273
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:29,318
[SPEAKER_26]: I think this is a pattern that we see from the MBTA of non-response.

1274
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:37,778
[SPEAKER_26]: We give them so much money, we contribute, we benefit from them, and yet we want to be partners, and yet there is this non-response.

1275
01:37:38,398 --> 01:37:42,362
[SPEAKER_26]: When we were looking at the accessibility improvements for the bus stops, that took a year.

1276
01:37:42,842 --> 01:37:52,011
[SPEAKER_26]: When we were thinking about the Orange Line shutdown years back, our city was proactive in reaching out and saying, what can we do to facilitate traffic, and we got posted.

1277
01:37:52,651 --> 01:37:55,133
[SPEAKER_26]: and so we really need to keep working on this.

1278
01:37:56,054 --> 01:38:05,001
[SPEAKER_26]: We have had times in the past where we were unified as a council and reached out and worked with the city staff as well and actually did get concessions from the MBTA.

1279
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:06,462
[SPEAKER_26]: So I hope this is the case this time.

1280
01:38:07,383 --> 01:38:14,589
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm certainly amenable to the amendment and did request that from the MBTA and they did not provide the document.

1281
01:38:17,111 --> 01:38:21,654
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's an amendment from Councillor Seng to request the materials

1282
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:24,842
[SPEAKER_24]: Could you, the safety data sheet?

1283
01:38:25,402 --> 01:38:26,523
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, that's right.

1284
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:34,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Material, yeah, okay.

1285
01:38:37,687 --> 01:38:47,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Great, on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by, and myself as amended by Councillor Sang, as seconded by Councillor Lazaro, any further discussion by members of the council?

1286
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:53,683
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, any discussion by members of the public in person or on Zoom?

1287
01:38:57,248 --> 01:38:59,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none in person, we'll go to Bill Giglio on Zoom.

1288
01:39:00,152 --> 01:39:01,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1289
01:39:01,634 --> 01:39:04,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

1290
01:39:05,632 --> 01:39:10,237
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very confused about like the, the actual, where is the disconnect?

1291
01:39:10,297 --> 01:39:20,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we have one side and by the way, thank you for doing this, but we have one side that is very adamant that it's very toxic and hazardous.

1292
01:39:20,905 --> 01:39:29,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you have the MBTA who's saying it's not, there's no type, or is there any type of an emergency, anybody that can come down and test that?

1293
01:39:29,747 --> 01:39:38,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if it was like any type of, you know, anything else, wouldn't it be like an emergency instead of us just requesting something and waiting on that?

1294
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:41,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there something that can be done quicker or sooner?

1295
01:39:42,771 --> 01:39:49,277
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, as far as I'm aware, the Board of Health has been engaged as well in Medford, and they have sent a number of comments along.

1296
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:50,919
[SPEAKER_24]: They've requested action by the Mass.

1297
01:39:50,979 --> 01:40:03,811
[SPEAKER_24]: Department of Environmental Protection, and the MBTA's response has essentially been that, according to them, they don't have any proof that it's not safe and that this is a project required by the Federal Railroad Administration.

1298
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:06,873
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's essentially been their response.

1299
01:40:06,913 --> 01:40:07,634
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, they have...

1300
01:40:08,695 --> 01:40:11,256
[SPEAKER_24]: To give them some credit, they have responded to the emails.

1301
01:40:11,617 --> 01:40:15,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Beyond that, the responses have not really been sufficient.

1302
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:16,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1303
01:40:16,539 --> 01:40:23,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, responses are nice, but that doesn't protect the health and no pun intended.

1304
01:40:24,003 --> 01:40:31,047
[SPEAKER_12]: So as far as the city tracks are covered, as far as us trying to fix this.

1305
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:33,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So nothing ever comes back from the city.

1306
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:38,011
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have any authority to order them to stop work.

1307
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:42,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, but you did, I mean, it's obviously brought to their attention anyways.

1308
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:44,041
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, yeah.

1309
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:46,983
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that's great, then thank you guys for doing this.

1310
01:40:47,964 --> 01:40:49,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, much appreciated.

1311
01:40:51,767 --> 01:40:53,248
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1312
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:59,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Gerald Burns, 44 South Border Road, Medford.

1313
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:04,977
[SPEAKER_07]: While you were all talking, I just looked up the EPA as far as creosote.

1314
01:41:06,747 --> 01:41:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, within this, there's some basic information and things.

1315
01:41:10,209 --> 01:41:30,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But in disposing of items treated with creosote safely, one of these items says, do not burn creosote or other preservative treated wood in a residential setting to avoid possible inhalation of toxic chemicals in the smoke and ash.

1316
01:41:30,819 --> 01:41:30,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1317
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:32,160
[SPEAKER_24]: You already read it, right?

1318
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1319
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,902
[SPEAKER_24]: A resident sent around some EPA regulations around creosote.

1320
01:41:35,962 --> 01:41:38,184
[SPEAKER_24]: And then they said, well, these are creosote soap ties.

1321
01:41:38,644 --> 01:41:41,205
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a different, you know, I mean, it's just kind of a run around.

1322
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:43,627
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, they haven't burned.

1323
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:47,689
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you go down to the neighborhood, I'm not going down there.

1324
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:49,250
[SPEAKER_24]: It's it's a brutal smell.

1325
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,632
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's persistent and pervasive.

1326
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:51,832
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1327
01:41:51,852 --> 01:41:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1328
01:41:54,153 --> 01:41:54,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1329
01:41:54,694 --> 01:41:54,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1330
01:41:57,876 --> 01:41:57,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh,

1331
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion by members of the public on this item?

1332
01:42:04,342 --> 01:42:04,823
[SPEAKER_24]: One more.

1333
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,424
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1334
01:42:09,145 --> 01:42:11,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Don McEwen, 143 Playstead Road.

1335
01:42:11,187 --> 01:42:16,710
[SPEAKER_19]: We just looked up on the internet about creosol and the health effects.

1336
01:42:17,191 --> 01:42:22,114
[SPEAKER_19]: The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has determined that coal

1337
01:42:23,396 --> 01:42:29,925
[SPEAKER_19]: For coal tar, creosol is a problem and a human carcinogen.

1338
01:42:30,426 --> 01:42:30,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1339
01:42:32,549 --> 01:42:33,390
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we sent.

1340
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:42,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1341
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:46,542
[SPEAKER_05]: A few piles.

1342
01:42:47,363 --> 01:42:48,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's hundreds.

1343
01:42:49,524 --> 01:42:50,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I live across the street.

1344
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:51,426
[SPEAKER_19]: You see it, right.

1345
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:52,967
[SPEAKER_19]: So I see that I smell it.

1346
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:53,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1347
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:54,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying.

1348
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:56,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want everybody to know the reach out to myself.

1349
01:42:56,109 --> 01:42:56,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1350
01:42:56,609 --> 01:43:00,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the council bears in this in and of itself.

1351
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:00,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe.

1352
01:43:00,432 --> 01:43:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1353
01:43:00,752 --> 01:43:01,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Staying right.

1354
01:43:01,913 --> 01:43:02,533
[SPEAKER_05]: That's scary.

1355
01:43:02,653 --> 01:43:03,454
[SPEAKER_24]: It's baffling.

1356
01:43:04,895 --> 01:43:10,065
[SPEAKER_24]: We sent all the same information over and they said we have to get the project done.

1357
01:43:10,085 --> 01:43:15,154
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

1358
01:43:16,397 --> 01:43:18,358
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just want to make a quick question.

1359
01:43:18,538 --> 01:43:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible to they could store these these this credit site ties inside of some sort of a trailer?

1360
01:43:25,442 --> 01:43:29,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And when the workers go in, they can put on their masks and pull out as needed.

1361
01:43:30,205 --> 01:43:31,126
[SPEAKER_24]: Just thinking out loud.

1362
01:43:31,606 --> 01:43:34,748
[SPEAKER_24]: We've we've asked for a number that was Andrew Castagnetti, by the way.

1363
01:43:35,868 --> 01:43:39,410
[SPEAKER_24]: We've asked for a number of solutions, moving them, storing them differently.

1364
01:43:40,171 --> 01:43:41,091
[SPEAKER_24]: They're pretty solid.

1365
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:42,192
[SPEAKER_24]: They're locked into their position.

1366
01:43:47,284 --> 01:43:48,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

1367
01:43:48,124 --> 01:43:57,328
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion by Councillor Scarpelli and myself, as amended by Councillor Sang, as seconded by Councillor Lazzaro, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1368
01:44:11,534 --> 01:44:12,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CALLAHAN.

1369
01:44:12,595 --> 01:44:12,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1370
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:15,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1371
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:15,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1372
01:44:17,059 --> 01:44:18,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lazzaro?

1373
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:18,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1374
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lemming?

1375
01:44:21,661 --> 01:44:21,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1376
01:44:23,902 --> 01:44:24,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1377
01:44:25,243 --> 01:44:25,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1378
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Thang?

1379
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:27,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1380
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:29,605
[SPEAKER_15]: President Beers?

1381
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:30,065
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1382
01:44:30,105 --> 01:44:33,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Having the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

1383
01:44:33,387 --> 01:44:35,047
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-078 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1384
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:43,791
[SPEAKER_24]: Be it resolved that the City Council discuss the Mayor's request in hiring an outside consultant to review Medford Fire Department policies and procedures with additional cost to the taxpayers of Medford.

1385
01:44:43,832 --> 01:44:44,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1386
01:44:46,398 --> 01:44:47,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1387
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:51,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there are a few representatives from the fire department here.

1388
01:44:52,574 --> 01:44:56,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm again when we're talking about mismanagement of city funds.

1389
01:44:57,098 --> 01:45:06,786
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I brought this up is during the school committee meeting when they were talking about the you know what the devastating news in that financial front was.

1390
01:45:07,407 --> 01:45:19,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I believe there was some conversation about possible layoffs and we talked about, you know, we're talking about, you know, police, fire teachers, most important people in our community.

1391
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:20,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1392
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:40,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the mayor sent this email saying that they were bringing in, I believe it's municipal solutions that were coming in, and they were going to, at a startup cost to start, almost $10,000 to bring this organization in to do a study of procedures and policies that were 60 years old.

1393
01:45:41,152 --> 01:45:47,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I emailed the mayor, I expressed my displeasure again of wasting taxpayers' money because

1394
01:45:49,926 --> 01:46:03,320
[SPEAKER_05]: In the normal situation, and I've talked to police officers, I've talked to directors and assistant superintendents, I've talked to other department leaders in our community, in our city structure.

1395
01:46:04,121 --> 01:46:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're making fundamental policy changes and procedures, it starts with the people we already pay, the professionals that are there.

1396
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:22,436
[SPEAKER_05]: They work on those policies, and then they review it together with the administration, making sure it falls in all the criteria that's needed, and they make those necessary changes.

1397
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:24,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I bring up 60 years.

1398
01:46:25,718 --> 01:46:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mayor responded, said, if you have any questions, contact Chief Evans.

1399
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Evans picked up the phone right away.

1400
01:46:31,061 --> 01:46:31,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate that.

1401
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:36,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a great conversation, and I respect Chief Evans.

1402
01:46:36,483 --> 01:46:38,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the difficulties in, and we had a,

1403
01:46:40,046 --> 01:46:44,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We had an agreed to disagree moment because he said, George, I'm trying to do a lot here.

1404
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:48,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have some policies that are 60 years old.

1405
01:46:50,013 --> 01:46:51,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't do everything at once.

1406
01:46:52,294 --> 01:46:59,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, Chief, first of all, in the normal situation, would you have done this with your team?

1407
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,382
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he's inundated because he started this position.

1408
01:47:04,463 --> 01:47:06,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So simple question is this chief,

1409
01:47:07,697 --> 01:47:17,491
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's 60 years old, if there truly is policies and procedures that are 60 years old there, you can't wait another six months?

1410
01:47:18,769 --> 01:47:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: to save the city taxpayers money, especially when you're talking about possibly laying off firefighters.

1411
01:47:25,555 --> 01:47:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did hear some great news that I'll also ask.

1412
01:47:29,559 --> 01:47:39,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask our our friends from the fire department that I hopefully they give us some good news tonight because I heard some things about this possible grant that

1413
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:43,452
[SPEAKER_05]: would absolutely save our community and I'm actually giddy about it.

1414
01:47:43,992 --> 01:47:45,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that's it.

1415
01:47:45,894 --> 01:47:47,816
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be that'll be something that I'm going to add on.

1416
01:47:47,856 --> 01:47:50,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, I know that today,

1417
01:47:51,676 --> 01:48:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: today, municipal solutions were on site meeting with I believe the deputy chiefs and starting the process already.

1418
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the final number is.

1419
01:48:02,522 --> 01:48:02,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be 50,000.

1420
01:48:02,923 --> 01:48:05,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be the cost of another firefighter.

1421
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:20,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know because what we did get we got a start of almost 10,000 the beginning of a study again, another year, I'm going to say it because we don't normally do this in our community and other departments.

1422
01:48:21,803 --> 01:48:28,707
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's in the police, with the police department, they start the process with the police department and their leadership team.

1423
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:33,891
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's in the school department, they start with their direct as a curriculum, they work it out.

1424
01:48:34,551 --> 01:48:43,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if they need more clarity and more backing, then they go out to an organization and bring someone to tie that in together for maybe a minimum amount of money.

1425
01:48:44,906 --> 01:48:52,411
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're seeing right now, shockingly, the fire department, the firefighters aren't even being looked at to do that.

1426
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:57,934
[SPEAKER_05]: People that we've trusted, all of a sudden now, everything is under a microscope.

1427
01:48:58,855 --> 01:49:13,204
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the mayor is bringing in municipal solutions to meet with the fire department to look at how to make these six-year-old changes and change the policies and procedures in their association, which I don't disagree with.

1428
01:49:14,602 --> 01:49:23,745
[SPEAKER_05]: but to spend, again, mismanagement financial funding in this community is just waving its ugly face again at wasting money again.

1429
01:49:25,345 --> 01:49:40,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that you're on the forefront, Mr. Jones, and you guys have been, so if you have anything to add, I know that I wanna know how that was going, if you can, what's the practice usually with the fire department, with past chiefs?

1430
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

1431
01:49:43,632 --> 01:49:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, that's good.

1432
01:49:44,354 --> 01:49:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That hasn't passed yet, right?

1433
01:49:45,938 --> 01:49:52,534
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I don't know if anyone's noticed, but given that we are having a relatively short night.

1434
01:49:53,063 --> 01:49:54,064
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't been putting the timer on.

1435
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:55,664
[SPEAKER_24]: God, you haven't put up the buzzer.

1436
01:49:55,845 --> 01:49:56,765
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't put up the timer.

1437
01:49:56,785 --> 01:49:57,726
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty good.

1438
01:49:58,486 --> 01:50:04,109
[SPEAKER_24]: It's because it's supposed to manage when we need to manage time, and we've been good tonight about managing our time.

1439
01:50:04,449 --> 01:50:16,016
[SPEAKER_24]: I do want to note one thing, which is when we received that email, I did request, ask the question of the mayor about whether there'll be a public report, and specifically with regards to how the council can be a collaborative part of strategic planning.

1440
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:20,178
[SPEAKER_24]: And she said, yes, there'll be a public report, and we'll be provided with the report and recommendations.

1441
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:26,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Before we go to members of the Fire Union, I do want to see if there's any further comment by members of the Council.

1442
01:50:29,362 --> 01:50:31,203
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, name and address for the record, please.

1443
01:50:31,463 --> 01:50:34,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle Marcelino, 11 Spencer Road, and I'm the Union Secretary.

1444
01:50:35,725 --> 01:50:39,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the same questions as far as like why they hired a third party and

1445
01:50:40,282 --> 01:50:40,482
[SPEAKER_13]: that.

1446
01:50:40,502 --> 01:50:42,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, why they picked who they picked.

1447
01:50:43,184 --> 01:50:59,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke with the chief today regarding this whole thing, and he said that so far the gentleman that is doing the survey is coming up with a lot of the same things that we had to say about the department that were critically understaffed that things need to be improved on all fronts.

1448
01:51:00,097 --> 01:51:03,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Um and I would hope that anybody who's worth their weight in the

1449
01:51:07,651 --> 01:51:19,340
[SPEAKER_13]: We, as the fire union, we have actually put together our own, we've solicited the company to do our own study too, just in case we need to bring up our own information.

1450
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:25,204
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that we looked into was who this person was, who the company was and who they've serviced.

1451
01:51:25,324 --> 01:51:32,130
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were told that they may have contacted or done a study in Woburn, but that isn't true.

1452
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Woburn had no idea about this company.

1453
01:51:35,232 --> 01:51:35,832
[SPEAKER_13]: In a brief,

1454
01:51:37,179 --> 01:51:40,702
[SPEAKER_13]: survey of the gentleman that heads up their fire service area.

1455
01:51:41,122 --> 01:51:46,065
[SPEAKER_13]: He comes from a very different universe than from what we work here in Medford.

1456
01:51:46,165 --> 01:51:51,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a Metro Boston department, so we run around 12,500 runs last year.

1457
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,211
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 106 of us right now.

1458
01:51:56,193 --> 01:51:59,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, there's 65,000 plus residents in the city of Medford.

1459
01:52:00,095 --> 01:52:02,277
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a career, he had a career in

1460
01:52:03,274 --> 01:52:08,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Woodbury, Connecticut, that did 310 calls per year last year.

1461
01:52:09,937 --> 01:52:14,260
[SPEAKER_13]: They were all an entire volunteer staff.

1462
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:21,183
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he was also the chief in a New Hampshire department that had a census of about 5,000 residents.

1463
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:22,524
[SPEAKER_13]: They did 1,111 runs last year.

1464
01:52:27,286 --> 01:52:33,571
[SPEAKER_13]: and they have two full-time members on their department staffing and everybody else is volunteer.

1465
01:52:33,631 --> 01:52:38,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just a very different format from what we run here in Medford.

1466
01:52:38,354 --> 01:52:48,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of confusing if they come up with something outside of, or recommendations that are different from what we do, it's kind of hard to compare because he's coming from a different universe.

1467
01:52:48,922 --> 01:52:53,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I wouldn't go to California and tell the YLN firefighters how to do their job.

1468
01:52:56,414 --> 01:53:03,264
[SPEAKER_13]: We have, like I said, we have our grant, our company that's going to be doing a similar study on safety and staffing.

1469
01:53:03,284 --> 01:53:11,737
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mean, as far as we knew from the union was just that we got an email saying that they hoped that we would cooperate to identify

1470
01:53:12,569 --> 01:53:16,652
[SPEAKER_13]: issues impacting services to review policies and assistant planning.

1471
01:53:16,912 --> 01:53:27,060
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are a career fire department with 106 members that have centuries, hundreds of years of time in service collectively.

1472
01:53:27,481 --> 01:53:36,908
[SPEAKER_13]: So I feel like we are a professional service that would be able to get together and update these policies to be able to do the right thing for our city that we are all very well versed in.

1473
01:53:37,188 --> 01:53:45,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the six if I can, Mr. President, yes, the 60 year old policies that they're talking about is it's I know we have six year old policies here.

1474
01:53:45,055 --> 01:53:49,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for instance, we don't I'm milking cows can't roam free.

1475
01:53:50,219 --> 01:53:58,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the type of stuff that we're seeing in these policies that they're just useless policies that they're old, but they're still there that we just need to take out what some of the Okay.

1476
01:53:59,026 --> 01:54:08,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them have been slightly updated over the years to be able to accommodate things like we don't utilize the Lawrence Memorial anymore, obviously, if somebody got injured, that kind of thing.

1477
01:54:09,313 --> 01:54:22,020
[SPEAKER_13]: So things have been slightly tweaked over the years, but as a whole, the policies and procedures, they do need to be revamped, but they could very well be done by us, by our senior staff and whatnot.

1478
01:54:24,282 --> 01:54:26,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Financial mismanagement, everyone.

1479
01:54:27,538 --> 01:54:28,479
[SPEAKER_05]: or retaliation.

1480
01:54:28,499 --> 01:54:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1481
01:54:28,939 --> 01:54:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one or the other.

1482
01:54:30,039 --> 01:54:37,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like every week the firefighters are here and we're bringing up something that the mayor is keeps piling on.

1483
01:54:38,104 --> 01:54:40,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a little disappointed with that, but thank you.

1484
01:54:40,465 --> 01:54:41,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry to interrupt.

1485
01:54:42,486 --> 01:54:52,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, no, it's the only other, um, you know, the only other thing that we know, I do know that she was looking at the mayor was looking at

1486
01:54:52,824 --> 01:54:55,085
[SPEAKER_13]: was a big bone of contention with the former chief, which he freed men.

1487
01:54:55,105 --> 01:54:57,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1488
01:54:57,746 --> 01:54:58,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Would try to let him settle in.

1489
01:54:58,866 --> 01:55:01,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1490
01:55:01,487 --> 01:55:04,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1491
01:55:04,108 --> 01:55:05,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Would try to let him settle in.

1492
01:55:05,049 --> 01:55:05,169
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um.

1493
01:55:06,069 --> 01:55:11,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Things like safety, Chief Friedman was not really willing to compromise on, and obviously we aren't as well.

1494
01:55:11,311 --> 01:55:27,698
[SPEAKER_13]: So to have another company come in and be paid by the mayor to assess our safety, our services, kind of makes me uncomfortable because if he's drawing a paycheck from her, then it might end up being that it could skew their opinion of what's necessary and what isn't.

1495
01:55:34,175 --> 01:55:34,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1496
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:35,796
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions for members of the council?

1497
01:55:37,156 --> 01:55:39,317
[SPEAKER_24]: I have two, if no one else has any.

1498
01:55:40,238 --> 01:55:43,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one, you mentioned a grant councilor Scarbelli, do you guys want to talk about that at all?

1499
01:55:44,099 --> 01:55:45,060
[SPEAKER_24]: That's good news, can I?

1500
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

1501
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:59,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know that it's time of the year right now that the firefighters can apply for a grant that they would, I don't know what the agency is, FEMA, that FEMA would allow the city

1502
01:56:01,147 --> 01:56:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: to incorporate a grant for as many members to get you to even to where your staff needs to be, and they would pick up the total cost, correct me if I'm wrong, for three years.

1503
01:56:14,073 --> 01:56:14,914
[SPEAKER_05]: for three years.

1504
01:56:15,314 --> 01:56:17,216
[SPEAKER_05]: This will make our firefighters whole.

1505
01:56:17,597 --> 01:56:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have to wait, we don't have to use a penny of this, this community's funding to make that happen.

1506
01:56:24,264 --> 01:56:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: When I heard I heard that I was so excited.

1507
01:56:26,706 --> 01:56:29,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just I, you know, it's something it's good that we're hearing some good news.

1508
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:32,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us an update with that?

1509
01:56:32,472 --> 01:56:35,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So we submitted the grant, it was due on Friday, the 12th.

1510
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:36,697
[SPEAKER_13]: We did submit

1511
01:56:37,611 --> 01:56:48,017
[SPEAKER_13]: to FEMA, like Councilor Scabali said, it awards, it can award up to however many you ask for.

1512
01:56:48,677 --> 01:56:54,941
[SPEAKER_13]: The point of the grant is to bring you up to compliance with certain National Fire Protection Agency regulations.

1513
01:56:55,021 --> 01:56:58,983
[SPEAKER_13]: They pick them, and then we find the need based on what they pick for that year.

1514
01:56:59,604 --> 01:57:02,886
[SPEAKER_13]: So based on staffing levels right now that we're at 106, we are budgeted for 122.

1515
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:03,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Technically, we should have

1516
01:57:07,088 --> 01:57:10,510
[SPEAKER_13]: around 132 based on the National Fire Protection Agency standards.

1517
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:27,359
[SPEAKER_13]: So initially, we had written the grant to try to acquire 20 extra personnel, which would bring us up to standard for the response to a house fire, which is how they count it, and also the staffing on each individual piece of apparatus.

1518
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:30,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would mean with overtime, what would that do to be fully staffed?

1519
01:57:31,266 --> 01:57:33,668
[SPEAKER_13]: It would decimate over it would eliminate over time.

1520
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:35,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about that.

1521
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:38,652
[SPEAKER_13]: So currently, we stand we have, like I said, we're budgeted for 122.

1522
01:57:38,692 --> 01:57:39,493
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this weird fine line of

1523
01:57:43,547 --> 01:58:09,126
[SPEAKER_13]: staffing full you know staffing up to a certain point and then being over that it's like it's better to have pay over pay the overtime than it is to staff the members it's and i'm not sure what that line is but um it's hard to get over that hump into the area where now you're fully staffed and you don't need to pay the overtime it's again i don't know what number that is but this grant is beautiful because if you staff appropriately

1524
01:58:09,969 --> 01:58:16,416
[SPEAKER_13]: It pays for the people for three whole years, and then you have to worry about it three years from now.

1525
01:58:17,398 --> 01:58:27,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, the way that FEMA awards is they want to see you go from non-compliant, which we're non-compliant right now, to fully compliant, based on the number of people that we work with.

1526
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:27,529
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're asking for 16.

1527
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:35,873
[SPEAKER_13]: We were going to ask for 15 because we have five members that are being hired, like, you know, very shortly.

1528
01:58:37,654 --> 01:58:47,758
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was knocked down to 11 to hire only 11 because we couldn't figure out how they were going to be funded three years from now.

1529
01:58:49,149 --> 01:58:55,535
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose for the grant is to spend that three years to be able to find out how you would be able to increase the funding.

1530
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:58,137
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would get us from 111 to 122.

1531
01:58:58,417 --> 01:59:06,744
[SPEAKER_13]: It would have gotten us the 15, well, we have five coming on, so it would have brought us up to what, 120, I think 126 was the magic number at that moment.

1532
01:59:06,844 --> 01:59:07,785
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, 15 plus, so 20, 106 plus 20.

1533
01:59:07,825 --> 01:59:08,886
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, because we have five being hired.

1534
01:59:08,906 --> 01:59:09,707
[SPEAKER_24]: So now it's 106 plus 16.

1535
01:59:16,288 --> 01:59:19,411
[SPEAKER_13]: It's five being hired, yeah, and then the 11 additional, I'm sorry, yeah.

1536
01:59:19,992 --> 01:59:23,315
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can't through the chair, I'm a little confused.

1537
01:59:23,335 --> 01:59:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So where we put in- We put in for 11.

1538
01:59:27,558 --> 01:59:34,985
[SPEAKER_13]: We put in for 11 because it was going to, the mayor specifically said she couldn't fund more than 120.

1539
01:59:38,624 --> 01:59:55,398
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were trying to convey that at the end of the grant period was when we would have to worry about it and that there would be some attrition that would happen at the very end of the grant period that would kind of take up for the remainder, but- I don't want to interrupt, but I thought the stipulations, you have to be at that minimum.

1540
01:59:55,758 --> 02:00:01,043
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to maintain the current staffing level, which if the grant got awarded, we would be at 111.

1541
02:00:01,343 --> 02:00:01,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So doesn't it...

1542
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:08,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're not asking for the 15, we're asking for 11.

1543
02:00:08,204 --> 02:00:11,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So those four can avoid us from getting this grant.

1544
02:00:12,654 --> 02:00:14,015
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not that they can void us.

1545
02:00:14,115 --> 02:00:18,478
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that we're kind of undershooting, and it's not as favorable to FEMA.

1546
02:00:18,838 --> 02:00:29,086
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're going to find a city or town that's going to overshoot and show in good faith that they're trying to make big changes in the name of safety and well-being of the city.

1547
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:37,171
[SPEAKER_13]: So because we undershot, we're probably, it might not make it through the first round, and it might get red in the second round.

1548
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:41,835
[SPEAKER_13]: But usually what they want to do is first swipe, they take the people who are making the biggest jumps.

1549
02:00:42,642 --> 02:00:47,503
[SPEAKER_13]: The additional would have been a big jump for us.

1550
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:48,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Just so I can get the numbers straight.

1551
02:00:48,704 --> 02:00:56,546
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds to me like this FEMA grant based on the National Fire Protection Standards would be, they want us at 132 firefighters.

1552
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,166
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be like the most ideal.

1553
02:00:58,306 --> 02:01:01,167
[SPEAKER_24]: And that would be like the overshooting if we were shooting for 132.

1554
02:01:02,878 --> 02:01:05,399
[SPEAKER_24]: we're budgeted for 122, we only have 106.

1555
02:01:05,499 --> 02:01:08,901
[SPEAKER_24]: We're bringing on five, which gets us to 111.

1556
02:01:09,501 --> 02:01:14,563
[SPEAKER_24]: And she went for another 11, which just brings us to 122, which we're already budgeted for.

1557
02:01:14,664 --> 02:01:21,707
[SPEAKER_24]: So this would just be basically using federal money to pay for something we're already budgeting for, not trying to use it to go above the 122.

1558
02:01:21,747 --> 02:01:26,869
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's because the concern is that after three years, how do you pay for over 122?

1559
02:01:26,909 --> 02:01:26,969
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1560
02:01:26,989 --> 02:01:27,069
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1561
02:01:27,089 --> 02:01:27,289
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, sorry.

1562
02:01:31,011 --> 02:01:32,592
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes a little bit to get into.

1563
02:01:32,832 --> 02:01:35,174
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not as complicated as how they funded walking court.

1564
02:01:35,194 --> 02:01:37,375
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me tell you that.

1565
02:01:37,415 --> 02:01:39,176
[SPEAKER_05]: My last question, if you can, Mr. President.

1566
02:01:39,436 --> 02:01:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1567
02:01:39,836 --> 02:01:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would mean that the fight, my hope would be that the fight upon will be exempt for any cuts then, because they would have to maintain that number, correct?

1568
02:01:47,941 --> 02:01:56,064
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were going to say they do award us, we are not allowed to show any changes in staffing.

1569
02:01:56,104 --> 02:02:00,325
[SPEAKER_13]: So we submitted the grant on Friday and it said that the budgeted staffing was 122.

1570
02:02:00,965 --> 02:02:09,188
[SPEAKER_13]: So going into, say awards in July, which I think it's the end of July that they start awarding, they're gonna call for us to submit our roster.

1571
02:02:09,228 --> 02:02:13,349
[SPEAKER_13]: If our roster or budget is lower than the 122, then they can pull the funding.

1572
02:02:13,509 --> 02:02:14,050
[SPEAKER_13]: They can pull the award.

1573
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,670
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.

1574
02:02:15,472 --> 02:02:20,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, we've heard so many negative things in the last, it's good to hear something positive.

1575
02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Danielle, you've been instrumental with being the union secretary.

1576
02:02:26,206 --> 02:02:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you've been the busiest person.

1577
02:02:27,707 --> 02:02:31,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Bobby and Eddie want to say that they are, but I appreciate all your hard work.

1578
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, because what we're doing with this is we're actually finding alternative ways to fund our firefighters and our fire department for the safety of our community and creative ways and not coming out of the tax base.

1579
02:02:46,415 --> 02:02:49,878
[SPEAKER_05]: But so I applaud you guys that that was such that's great news.

1580
02:02:50,579 --> 02:02:50,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1581
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:59,907
[SPEAKER_13]: It went unsaid last year, excuse me, but union members wrote for another FEMA grant last year at this time for equipment and won it.

1582
02:02:59,927 --> 02:03:06,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And they won, it was like something like 70,000 to replace the compressor that fills our SCBA bottles.

1583
02:03:06,332 --> 02:03:13,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's several other grants that are kind of, we have one that's coming in that we're waiting to hear about awards.

1584
02:03:13,598 --> 02:03:16,060
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have another one that was awarded through the state.

1585
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,262
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our staff doing all this.

1586
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:22,064
[SPEAKER_05]: We're paying someone over $10,000 to see what's right for you.

1587
02:03:22,625 --> 02:03:23,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Just just throwing it out.

1588
02:03:23,586 --> 02:03:24,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

1589
02:03:24,486 --> 02:03:41,980
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to clarify along those lines when you say we submitted is that the union has submitted or the union work with the chief to submit or the union staff wrote it and the chief submitted I just fired apart the whole fire staff with the exception of the chief is part of the union but we had like firefighters that worked on duty during the day.

1590
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, got together did the research and submitted the grants.

1591
02:03:45,282 --> 02:03:47,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Great, and it's on behalf of the fire department.

1592
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:49,507
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on behalf of the fire department, yes.

1593
02:03:49,567 --> 02:03:49,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1594
02:03:49,907 --> 02:03:54,332
[SPEAKER_13]: If anybody wants the write-up for the two grants, the two FEMA grants, I'd be happy to send them over.

1595
02:03:54,372 --> 02:03:56,615
[SPEAKER_13]: It took a long time, so I want people to read it.

1596
02:03:56,755 --> 02:03:57,756
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll take it.

1597
02:04:03,559 --> 02:04:05,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Any further comments Councilor Sang?

1598
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:08,801
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to thank you guys for being so proactive on it.

1599
02:04:09,481 --> 02:04:10,762
[SPEAKER_26]: I would love to read the grants.

1600
02:04:10,922 --> 02:04:21,366
[SPEAKER_26]: If there's ways for us to support, like if we can send an individual letters or a letter from Council to support the grant process, just let us know and I think we would be really, really happy to help.

1601
02:04:22,706 --> 02:04:24,127
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll send you our budget ordinance too.

1602
02:04:24,147 --> 02:04:27,328
[SPEAKER_05]: See what else you can do.

1603
02:04:29,042 --> 02:04:31,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else, what other magic they can perform.

1604
02:04:31,543 --> 02:04:33,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Cog, what do you look like in school building?

1605
02:04:33,923 --> 02:04:36,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Burris.

1606
02:04:36,924 --> 02:04:38,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you again for being here.

1607
02:04:38,405 --> 02:04:43,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know from my other line of work, just a glimmer of how much work writing these grant applications is.

1608
02:04:43,866 --> 02:04:46,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know this was a whole, truly a whole crew effort.

1609
02:04:46,787 --> 02:04:47,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for that.

1610
02:04:48,007 --> 02:04:50,528
[SPEAKER_09]: It is really interesting to get a glimpse into.

1611
02:04:51,729 --> 02:05:00,534
[SPEAKER_09]: This other side of the work of administrating the fire department and just to echo what counselors and counselors are probably put out there you know this council is no stranger to putting together.

1612
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,862
[SPEAKER_09]: that we can do to bolster the application.

1613
02:05:04,882 --> 02:05:14,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, of course, I'm sure that in a perfect world, we'd all like to see, you know, overshooting, getting up to that, you know, maximum recommended number and using those three years to figure out how to stay there.

1614
02:05:15,326 --> 02:05:29,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But in lieu of that, you know, it's my hope that hopefully we get great news at the end of July and in that intervening three years is when we're, you know, getting to a place of better resilience with the city's budget so that we can further escalate in a reliable way.

1615
02:05:29,552 --> 02:05:30,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you again.

1616
02:05:32,918 --> 02:05:33,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1617
02:05:33,178 --> 02:05:33,919
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comments?

1618
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:39,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to say our staffing is incredibly low right now at 106.

1619
02:05:40,525 --> 02:05:48,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It's impossible to get through shifts basically without overtime at this point, which is exhausting for firefighters.

1620
02:05:48,613 --> 02:05:54,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, everybody, there was a lot of talk about our overtime budget and earlier in the year.

1621
02:05:54,298 --> 02:05:58,062
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand that it looks and sounds great to, you know,

1622
02:05:58,482 --> 02:05:59,404
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody's getting overtime.

1623
02:05:59,484 --> 02:06:07,156
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reality of it is, is that that means that we're working 24 hour shifts, and then working additional little shifts after that, that means we don't go home for 36 hours.

1624
02:06:07,717 --> 02:06:12,585
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have so much overtime that with the old chief, we actually had to sit down

1625
02:06:13,556 --> 02:06:24,100
[SPEAKER_13]: and discuss one of our own policies to be able to bridge the gap because we couldn't get members, people weren't signing, weren't taking overtime because they either had commitments at home and everything.

1626
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:30,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means that we have to hold members, we have to hold firefighters beyond their shifts, normal shifts.

1627
02:06:30,243 --> 02:06:31,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Mandatory overtime.

1628
02:06:31,363 --> 02:06:44,278
[SPEAKER_13]: So then we had to actually accommodate the idea of all right, well, it's more it's actually healthier to ask a firefighter if they would want to work an additional fourth shift, then force a member to come on, you know, work three shifts, excuse me.

1629
02:06:44,758 --> 02:06:44,958
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1630
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:52,362
[SPEAKER_13]: So we kind of we talked to the chief, we all agreed that it was better to like offer this out and let somebody work an additional shift.

1631
02:06:52,382 --> 02:06:58,344
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means we have 40, we have some members that have worked 48 hours straight, but you don't go home, you're in the station for 48 hours.

1632
02:06:59,524 --> 02:07:01,885
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a long, it's a long haul at the end of the day.

1633
02:07:01,965 --> 02:07:12,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the end of the two days, so you know, trying to get more personnel to be able to increase staffing and support daily just daily shifts is huge, let alone the safety of

1634
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:17,011
[SPEAKER_13]: the members on the fire ground, you know, responding to fires and whatnot in the city.

1635
02:07:17,531 --> 02:07:21,493
[SPEAKER_24]: After the next five coming through, is there any more pipeline updates that you've received?

1636
02:07:22,053 --> 02:07:24,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, we don't know about the hiring now.

1637
02:07:24,675 --> 02:07:24,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Got it.

1638
02:07:24,915 --> 02:07:26,235
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1639
02:07:27,976 --> 02:07:28,897
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

1640
02:07:32,559 --> 02:07:34,299
[SPEAKER_24]: We do have one person on Zoom.

1641
02:07:34,359 --> 02:07:35,960
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Maureen on Zoom.

1642
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,441
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record please.

1643
02:07:39,975 --> 02:07:43,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you done on 55 Ellsworth Street Medford mask.

1644
02:07:43,982 --> 02:07:49,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I broached this subject when I spoke a while ago, and

1645
02:07:51,991 --> 02:07:59,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much to the firefighters and the union for researching this grant money.

1646
02:08:01,158 --> 02:08:10,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my question is, between the fire department, the police department, the MWRA, the MBTA,

1647
02:08:14,346 --> 02:08:34,161
[SPEAKER_01]: schools aside, I don't know who we could approach, is there any one individual working in the administration or a group of individuals working in the administration to look at or investigate those grants that are out there that the city of Medford would qualify?

1648
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:38,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilman Scott Pelley keeps talking about

1649
02:08:38,945 --> 02:08:48,574
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, transparency and, you know, we have spoken already about, you know, outsourcing jobs that could be filled within the city.

1650
02:08:48,594 --> 02:08:51,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me like we're spending

1651
02:08:52,915 --> 02:09:13,997
[SPEAKER_01]: close to a million dollars a year, if not more, paying outside city solicitors, outside water resource people, and again, outsourcing the job to look at and evaluate the current Medford Fire Department and its needs.

1652
02:09:15,218 --> 02:09:16,739
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of money out there.

1653
02:09:16,879 --> 02:09:19,579
[SPEAKER_01]: FEMA is a federal agency.

1654
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:39,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, I ask if there's anyone looking on the current administration at local state government and federal government grants that we could call upon or apply for to solve some of the money issues within the city of Medford.

1655
02:09:39,985 --> 02:09:40,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1656
02:09:41,752 --> 02:09:42,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Maureen.

1657
02:09:42,273 --> 02:09:46,337
[SPEAKER_24]: There are a number of people on the city staff who look at different grants.

1658
02:09:46,357 --> 02:09:51,583
[SPEAKER_24]: We have a CDBG, which is Community Development Block Grant, and other grants manager in the planning department.

1659
02:09:51,683 --> 02:09:53,965
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a federal funds manager in the finance department.

1660
02:09:54,966 --> 02:09:58,791
[SPEAKER_24]: And the city actually has been historically very successful at bringing in outside grant funding.

1661
02:09:59,952 --> 02:10:01,373
[SPEAKER_24]: And I super appreciate hearing.

1662
02:10:02,374 --> 02:10:03,435
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a testament what you just said.

1663
02:10:03,455 --> 02:10:04,476
[SPEAKER_24]: You've been successful in the past.

1664
02:10:04,496 --> 02:10:05,778
[SPEAKER_24]: You're hoping to be successful again.

1665
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:10,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Oftentimes, departments are looking for grants in their specific fields.

1666
02:10:10,922 --> 02:10:16,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Chief Buckley's been up here before from the police department talking about grants that people on his team have looked at.

1667
02:10:18,089 --> 02:10:20,792
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, in general, these grants are for

1668
02:10:21,494 --> 02:10:29,116
[SPEAKER_24]: specific purposes and are meant for specific projects, not to supplement the city's need for operating funds.

1669
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:30,457
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's one of the major issues.

1670
02:10:30,497 --> 02:10:40,740
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that sounds like one of the issues you ran into here is that, you know, this grant is ideally to go beyond what the city is doing on operating funds.

1671
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:48,862
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's while the city has brought in a lot of grants, and if you go to the city finance department page and you look at what's called the ACFR,

1672
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:51,276
[SPEAKER_24]: comprehensive financial report.

1673
02:10:51,337 --> 02:11:07,692
[SPEAKER_24]: You can see there's a line in there and you and in some years, the city's brought in as many as 10 million 15 million in grants, but they're generally one off like the 2 million brought in for the car park project or, you know, money brought in to hire specific staff for specific studies or specific times and not to supplement.

1674
02:11:08,959 --> 02:11:10,420
[SPEAKER_24]: the general fund budget.

1675
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:31,569
[SPEAKER_24]: The only money that comes to us to supplement the general fund budget is from the state Chapter 90 program, the UGA, which is the worst name, Unrestricted General Government Aid, and Chapter 70 school funding, which are generally the only thing out there where we as a city get money to fund the general fund that doesn't come from local taxes and fees.

1676
02:11:33,724 --> 02:11:48,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I take the opportunity to thank you, President Beers, for focusing a lot on the creosol road MBTA ties that are out there.

1677
02:11:49,051 --> 02:11:52,592
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone already spoke to, it's a known carcinogen.

1678
02:11:53,032 --> 02:11:55,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your effort there.

1679
02:11:55,693 --> 02:11:57,654
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really appreciated by the city.

1680
02:11:57,674 --> 02:11:59,235
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1681
02:11:59,295 --> 02:11:59,855
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate it.

1682
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,561
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully, we can actually solve this.

1683
02:12:06,223 --> 02:12:09,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comments, questions on the paper before us?

1684
02:12:09,585 --> 02:12:10,146
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Jones.

1685
02:12:10,726 --> 02:12:11,267
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.

1686
02:12:11,587 --> 02:12:12,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Bob Jones, 5 St.

1687
02:12:12,588 --> 02:12:13,088
[SPEAKER_27]: Mary Street.

1688
02:12:14,249 --> 02:12:14,910
[SPEAKER_27]: It's amazing.

1689
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:20,274
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a fire station on Salem Street that's been out of service for over a year.

1690
02:12:21,255 --> 02:12:25,699
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a sidewalk and ramp area in front of West Memphis Station that I've been writing up for five years.

1691
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:31,464
[SPEAKER_27]: But all of a sudden, we get a consultant that's going to come into the fire department and revamp our fire department.

1692
02:12:32,506 --> 02:12:35,547
[SPEAKER_27]: completely unnecessary, as we just discussed.

1693
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:40,468
[SPEAKER_27]: We're at the lowest point we've been in my 23 years on the job at 106 members.

1694
02:12:41,848 --> 02:12:43,808
[SPEAKER_27]: The money should be going to a firefighter.

1695
02:12:44,288 --> 02:12:46,009
[SPEAKER_27]: We have plenty of repairs that need to be made.

1696
02:12:46,669 --> 02:12:52,490
[SPEAKER_27]: There is much institutional knowledge on the fire department that can do the work of this consultant.

1697
02:12:53,950 --> 02:12:57,111
[SPEAKER_27]: We have policies and procedures that get updated every day.

1698
02:12:58,114 --> 02:12:59,434
[SPEAKER_27]: There's something that needs to be updated.

1699
02:12:59,534 --> 02:13:01,975
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pushed out by the chief of the administration of the training division.

1700
02:13:02,595 --> 02:13:04,095
[SPEAKER_27]: This is completely unnecessary.

1701
02:13:05,415 --> 02:13:07,376
[SPEAKER_27]: This goes along with the study route.

1702
02:13:07,776 --> 02:13:08,796
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's do another study.

1703
02:13:09,376 --> 02:13:15,818
[SPEAKER_27]: And if the study says what the union said, and everybody in the fight department said, I don't know if they're going to listen.

1704
02:13:15,918 --> 02:13:21,399
[SPEAKER_27]: City administration maybe will listen if they hire somebody and they say the same things that we do.

1705
02:13:22,459 --> 02:13:23,999
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think the report will be buried.

1706
02:13:24,039 --> 02:13:26,980
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd love to get a copy of it if at all possible.

1707
02:13:28,514 --> 02:13:43,346
[SPEAKER_27]: The other thing that I don't know if kind of glossed over it's just a Marcelino said that if we went for another four firefighters for this grant, we'd have a much better opportunity to get past the first round of funding, but the city was reluctant to do so.

1708
02:13:44,327 --> 02:13:49,872
[SPEAKER_27]: So that would be much more beneficial for us to go that route, the grant has been submitted.

1709
02:13:50,813 --> 02:13:51,793
[SPEAKER_27]: And as we spoke about.

1710
02:13:52,734 --> 02:14:02,637
[SPEAKER_27]: Many times, the city, in my opinion, has been saying this for 20 years, should have full-time grant writers on staff to write these grants and bring money back to the city.

1711
02:14:02,897 --> 02:14:13,401
[SPEAKER_27]: As you mentioned, Zach, it sounds like there are other departmental members that are doing these grants, as well as their other job, as Sister Marcelino has done.

1712
02:14:14,477 --> 02:14:37,893
[SPEAKER_27]: something that it's there's a learning curve to it it's something that you need to research and get good at so if we're doing one-offs it's not as beneficial it's not as as easy for somebody to do as somebody that would be doing it all the time they'll get that grant writing uh learning curve out of the way and they'll be able to do it and be more successful

1713
02:14:38,874 --> 02:14:45,776
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, I just, again, wasting money on this consultant for something that we could do ourselves.

1714
02:14:46,956 --> 02:14:47,997
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate your time, thanks.

1715
02:14:48,017 --> 02:14:49,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can, Mr. President, if I can.

1716
02:14:49,817 --> 02:14:50,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpa.

1717
02:14:50,938 --> 02:14:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1718
02:14:51,978 --> 02:14:53,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I was trying to get to.

1719
02:14:54,158 --> 02:14:58,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because I want to make this as a motion, if it's true, especially coming to budget season.

1720
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:05,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So our chances, if we went to those other four firefighters and we went full board with this,

1721
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:15,712
[SPEAKER_05]: because this is what I was told, is that we would have a substantially better opportunity by doing that.

1722
02:15:16,032 --> 02:15:16,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1723
02:15:16,712 --> 02:15:23,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in a form of a motion, I'd like to ask the mayor, why wouldn't we look at four more firefighters to make us whole?

1724
02:15:24,014 --> 02:15:31,556
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can do that, Mr. President, because as we get into the budget season, and we lose a huge opportunity because we didn't go all the way.

1725
02:15:31,576 --> 02:15:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: We went with

1726
02:15:34,189 --> 02:15:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: We went with what 11 we said, and we needed 15 to make get us to that point.

1727
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:41,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would eliminate all that money for overtime.

1728
02:15:43,071 --> 02:15:45,252
[SPEAKER_05]: We would we would have it paid for for three years.

1729
02:15:47,293 --> 02:15:50,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I thought that's what I thought.

1730
02:15:50,493 --> 02:15:52,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm a little perplexed right now.

1731
02:15:52,814 --> 02:15:55,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the biggest points that

1732
02:15:56,789 --> 02:16:13,793
[SPEAKER_13]: going like right now with this month being budget season, if our budget drops below the 122 and we should get awarded by FEMA and they see that we went below 122, we are going to lose the money.

1733
02:16:13,913 --> 02:16:20,894
[SPEAKER_13]: They will say that the city is not invested in the personnel and they're not going to award the bad behavior of cutting personnel.

1734
02:16:21,794 --> 02:16:24,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And this wasn't like submitted in the interest of,

1735
02:16:25,695 --> 02:16:28,377
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, trying to hold anybody's feet to the fire or anything like that.

1736
02:16:28,497 --> 02:16:32,039
[SPEAKER_13]: This is, we need staffing, like we desperately need staffing.

1737
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:38,924
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not showing up under compliance to a two, I think we call it a two and a half story wood front.

1738
02:16:38,944 --> 02:16:46,669
[SPEAKER_13]: So any of the houses that are just single family homes that are two stories and an attic, we are not showing up under compliance to those fires.

1739
02:16:47,109 --> 02:16:50,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Our staff on the fire trucks every day is under compliance.

1740
02:16:50,912 --> 02:16:53,774
[SPEAKER_13]: We're supposed to have four and we only have three on every piece.

1741
02:16:54,554 --> 02:17:06,200
[SPEAKER_13]: So if God forbid something ever happened and they come in and they do the investigation afterwards, which they always do, the first thing they say is that our staffing was not up to compliance.

1742
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:10,962
[SPEAKER_27]: Senate PA 1710, they do have standards that they go by and Senate PA 1710 is what you're speaking about.

1743
02:17:10,982 --> 02:17:12,423
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a very complicated process.

1744
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:18,526
[SPEAKER_27]: This grant will go through multiple rounds and to make it past the first round is obviously your first hurdle.

1745
02:17:19,226 --> 02:17:22,768
[SPEAKER_27]: Had those four more firefighters, you got a better opportunity to get past that first round.

1746
02:17:22,948 --> 02:17:23,749
[SPEAKER_27]: Where it stands now,

1747
02:17:24,696 --> 02:17:32,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So through the chair, as a council, if we can have our president send a message to the mayor, can we adjust those numbers?

1748
02:17:32,461 --> 02:17:34,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it's too late.

1749
02:17:34,463 --> 02:17:38,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Once FEMA closes, it's like they don't accept anything after the fact.

1750
02:17:42,188 --> 02:17:44,230
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I think, sorry, and I'll go to Councilor Kiley.

1751
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:48,693
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're almost around the horseshoe here to the point that I think

1752
02:17:50,054 --> 02:17:51,635
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll speak for myself and for no one else.

1753
02:17:52,335 --> 02:17:59,080
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the reasons I ran for office here is because this city makes penny wise pound foolish decisions all the time because there's not enough money.

1754
02:18:00,461 --> 02:18:02,102
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's where we come around, right?

1755
02:18:03,373 --> 02:18:08,734
[SPEAKER_24]: we don't wanna submit 126, because then we might have to pay for four in three years.

1756
02:18:09,415 --> 02:18:15,336
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though we get three years of money, we're worried about paying for four, three years from now, because we don't have the money to pay for the four, three years from now.

1757
02:18:15,836 --> 02:18:18,057
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the larger question here, right?

1758
02:18:18,097 --> 02:18:28,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Like we can write grants, we can try to bring in more money, we can do these questions, but if we're constantly in the position of, and that's like saying, we've all talked about here tonight, that's if it doesn't go down more.

1759
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:34,742
[SPEAKER_24]: We're hoping that we'll stay at 122 for three years, because at least then we won't be more penalized.

1760
02:18:35,642 --> 02:18:39,244
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's where my frustration really comes in, in the long run.

1761
02:18:40,504 --> 02:18:45,506
[SPEAKER_24]: I can understand both positions, because the city has never raised more.

1762
02:18:45,566 --> 02:18:54,530
[SPEAKER_24]: The city's never, since 2 and 1 half in 1980 said, when I believe when we've talked about there were 150 firefighters back then, and now we're down to 140, 130, now we're down to 122.

1763
02:18:57,981 --> 02:19:04,583
[SPEAKER_24]: There's nothing in the last 40 years of city government evidence that the city's gonna say, okay, we're gonna bring the money back to go back to at least 126 or 132.

1764
02:19:04,883 --> 02:19:10,784
[SPEAKER_24]: So the mayor says, oh, well, and I mean, it comes down to this too, right?

1765
02:19:10,864 --> 02:19:17,346
[SPEAKER_24]: It sounds to me like that's not gonna be the, even if we do go back and ask for more, that's not gonna be the first thing we go back and ask for.

1766
02:19:17,446 --> 02:19:20,747
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're not gonna put in the grant and then we're never gonna get the grant, right?

1767
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:29,537
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think he'll be saying anything to say that we've disagreed on things, you and I, Mr. Jones here.

1768
02:19:30,338 --> 02:19:31,339
[SPEAKER_24]: People usually do.

1769
02:19:31,799 --> 02:19:40,448
[SPEAKER_24]: And when we usually do, and I disagree with all of my fellow councillors sometimes and members of the public, but this is where all of this stuff comes back to the core of it.

1770
02:19:41,858 --> 02:20:02,366
[SPEAKER_24]: financial mismanagement you're right well well it's it's we can say it's if you want to call financial mismanagement then it's 40 years of financial mismanagement and and a set of bad practices that this administration the previous administration and the administration before it held and i'm willing to i'm willing to to go down for that one you know but it's a it's a lack of imagination and understanding and and going and saying

1771
02:20:03,326 --> 02:20:05,067
[SPEAKER_24]: we need more money than we're raising.

1772
02:20:05,287 --> 02:20:07,508
[SPEAKER_24]: If we're never going to raise it, then we're never going to invest.

1773
02:20:07,768 --> 02:20:15,251
[SPEAKER_24]: And then you're stuck in these positions where it's actually cheaper to put $10,000 outside than bring someone inside or do the $122,000 than the $126,000.

1774
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:20,633
[SPEAKER_24]: And now I've gone on too long from the chair and probably said too much of an opinion from the chair, so I'm going to stop.

1775
02:20:20,673 --> 02:20:21,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Callahan.

1776
02:20:22,059 --> 02:20:22,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1777
02:20:23,399 --> 02:20:28,701
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm sad that we cannot have any impact over that, and it's too late.

1778
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:35,623
[SPEAKER_18]: And so all I'm saying is to you guys, but also to anyone else, don't hesitate to come to us.

1779
02:20:36,163 --> 02:20:43,685
[SPEAKER_18]: If we can put pressure and make the difference between that FEMA grant being in a better position to pass, then reach out.

1780
02:20:44,806 --> 02:20:49,347
[SPEAKER_18]: And secondly, I really wanted to talk a little bit about this question of mismanagement.

1781
02:20:50,267 --> 02:20:55,890
[SPEAKER_18]: because I think it is raised all the time, the question of wasting money.

1782
02:20:57,231 --> 02:21:00,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm curious about it, and I want to learn more.

1783
02:21:00,472 --> 02:21:06,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to ensure that we know in terms of transparency and that the community knows how money is being spent.

1784
02:21:06,636 --> 02:21:15,920
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do also think there's another question that we haven't been talking about as much about recently, which is being able to

1785
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:18,501
[SPEAKER_18]: the fire department.

1786
02:21:18,541 --> 02:21:23,482
[SPEAKER_18]: We have run departments where sorry, um, support being supportive of unions.

1787
02:21:23,522 --> 02:21:27,783
[SPEAKER_18]: We have many unions in the city that do not get contracts for years.

1788
02:21:28,544 --> 02:21:36,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Um my opinion of what has been happening this year with the fire department is that it really has demoralized

1789
02:21:43,127 --> 02:21:49,069
[SPEAKER_18]: a fan of what has been going on between the mayor and the fire department, as I said at one of the previous meetings.

1790
02:21:49,909 --> 02:22:05,193
[SPEAKER_18]: So I am interested in understanding, I really question how you guys can have a consulting firm where you're already looking into this, the mayor is doing separate consulting firm and the wisdom of that.

1791
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:11,215
[SPEAKER_18]: And from a union perspective, that it seems like you're,

1792
02:22:12,834 --> 02:22:17,178
[SPEAKER_18]: many combined years of experience is not being looked to at all.

1793
02:22:18,679 --> 02:22:31,451
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I have to say that I do really question the wisdom of this, and that I want to be supportive of the fire union, and I will leave it at that.

1794
02:22:33,332 --> 02:22:34,113
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councilor Kellyanne.

1795
02:22:34,133 --> 02:22:34,874
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further discussion?

1796
02:22:38,078 --> 02:22:39,739
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we all want the same things.

1797
02:22:39,799 --> 02:22:43,682
[SPEAKER_27]: We want to adequately protect the citizens' property and benefit.

1798
02:22:43,782 --> 02:22:47,245
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what we're here for, that's what we advocate for, and that's what we're trying to do here.

1799
02:22:47,605 --> 02:22:48,346
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1800
02:23:06,311 --> 02:23:21,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle Masolino, you should be credited for what you're doing and put on a pedestal because this is exactly what, no matter what the junk you guys have been dealing with, no matter how angry everybody's getting, you're sitting down at a desk and doing real work to make a difference.

1801
02:23:21,954 --> 02:23:29,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I feel like I sit here and I yell and we get mad at each other and then you go home and you say, what did I just accomplish?

1802
02:23:30,076 --> 02:23:30,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do anything.

1803
02:23:31,556 --> 02:23:38,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to make sure that I acknowledge for one, I know I feel that my counselors feel the same thing that you're doing.

1804
02:23:39,838 --> 02:23:44,081
[SPEAKER_05]: they're doing what we should all be doing, and that's putting your nose down and going to work and getting it done.

1805
02:23:44,661 --> 02:23:56,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just hope that in the end, we're sitting here and we name the new Marcelino Fire Station after you, because the whole staff is going to be staffed by your grants.

1806
02:23:57,149 --> 02:23:57,789
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my hope.

1807
02:23:57,869 --> 02:23:58,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but thank you.

1808
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: She was hired on the same program.

1809
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:02,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

1810
02:24:02,672 --> 02:24:03,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1811
02:24:03,032 --> 02:24:03,613
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1812
02:24:03,673 --> 02:24:04,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1813
02:24:04,773 --> 02:24:05,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, so thank you.

1814
02:24:05,794 --> 02:24:07,195
[SPEAKER_05]: The chief didn't want to put in for them.

1815
02:24:08,697 --> 02:24:09,598
[SPEAKER_17]: appreciate that.

1816
02:24:10,078 --> 02:24:10,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1817
02:24:10,638 --> 02:24:11,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1818
02:24:11,279 --> 02:24:18,525
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate the time in the effort as always, and I think, you know, just to echo what Councilor Kellyanne said.

1819
02:24:20,046 --> 02:24:30,293
[SPEAKER_24]: We have so much work to do, and when we are taking our time and our energy at cross purposes rather than in the same direction, that's a disservice to getting the work done.

1820
02:24:30,394 --> 02:24:31,735
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think, you know,

1821
02:24:32,608 --> 02:24:41,794
[SPEAKER_24]: we can agree to disagree, but if we're moving in the same direction, and I appreciate that that is happening, that many of us are trying to do that, and if we could all do it better, we'd be in a much better position.

1822
02:24:41,814 --> 02:24:43,796
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for your work.

1823
02:24:44,076 --> 02:24:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1824
02:24:45,317 --> 02:24:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1825
02:24:45,697 --> 02:25:01,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to send the question to the mayor, if I can, on the reasoning for that, why we didn't move forward with those four other firefighters to give us a better opportunity to achieve this FEMA grant?

1826
02:25:02,418 --> 02:25:04,019
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, let me just get that down.

1827
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:19,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to request answer from mayor on FEMA grant being submitted for 11 firefighters instead of 15 firefighters.

1828
02:25:19,406 --> 02:25:20,166
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1829
02:25:20,886 --> 02:25:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: For better outcome grant process.

1830
02:25:26,229 --> 02:25:30,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know why she wouldn't do the four unless she has a secret she's not telling us.

1831
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:38,067
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, so on the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1832
02:25:38,347 --> 02:25:40,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

1833
02:25:43,431 --> 02:25:44,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Callaghan.

1834
02:25:44,492 --> 02:25:44,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1835
02:25:46,333 --> 02:25:47,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

1836
02:25:47,394 --> 02:25:47,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1837
02:25:49,176 --> 02:25:50,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lazzaro.

1838
02:25:50,677 --> 02:25:50,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1839
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:53,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lemming.

1840
02:25:53,739 --> 02:25:54,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1841
02:25:56,041 --> 02:25:57,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1842
02:25:57,422 --> 02:25:57,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1843
02:25:58,983 --> 02:25:59,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Tang.

1844
02:26:00,305 --> 02:26:00,485
Yes.

1845
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:02,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr McGiven.

1846
02:26:02,061 --> 02:26:02,861
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes 70 from him.

1847
02:26:02,981 --> 02:26:09,867
[SPEAKER_24]: The negative motion passes 24 dash 079 resolution request update on the crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

1848
02:26:10,087 --> 02:26:11,067
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Scarpelli.

1849
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:15,351
[SPEAKER_05]: The I just wanted to

1850
02:26:25,058 --> 02:26:28,741
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hearing some issues with the Crystal Campbell fountain.

1851
02:26:28,841 --> 02:26:31,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there have been some movement.

1852
02:26:32,723 --> 02:26:35,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they tested the computer to get the fountain moving.

1853
02:26:37,507 --> 02:26:40,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're hoping to get it going for yesterday's marathon.

1854
02:26:40,749 --> 02:26:43,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it didn't it didn't come to fruition.

1855
02:26:44,671 --> 02:26:49,655
[SPEAKER_05]: There is talking to Mr. McGiven talking to former counselors, there is a concern.

1856
02:26:50,435 --> 02:26:54,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope to be a mediation immediate for that for this process that

1857
02:26:55,118 --> 02:27:10,272
[SPEAKER_05]: When Mayor McGlynn did the fundraising for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, he made sure that no matter what his existence would be in Medford, he would leave it into a trust with an organization that would oversee the funding.

1858
02:27:11,584 --> 02:27:18,307
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think the fear was it would raise all this money, and then when the city needed in bad times, it will be forgotten.

1859
02:27:19,147 --> 02:27:21,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some confusion.

1860
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:29,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked to Mr. McGiven that there was words that, there was word going back and forth that the reason why they couldn't do it is because they weren't releasing the funding.

1861
02:27:30,052 --> 02:27:39,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to former counselors that said the funding would have been released, but they wanted more of a detailed itemized breakdown for what that funding is, because that's what the trust asked for.

1862
02:27:40,337 --> 02:27:42,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and unfortunately, that didn't happen.

1863
02:27:42,778 --> 02:27:48,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe the city move forward to make the changes needed to fix it on their own.

1864
02:27:49,720 --> 02:28:02,303
[SPEAKER_05]: The other piece of that is what people are really upset about when you've been around, you saw the original garden with the fountain on the lights on, and then all of the sunflowers and crystals name.

1865
02:28:02,604 --> 02:28:03,584
[SPEAKER_05]: She loves sunflowers.

1866
02:28:04,304 --> 02:28:05,505
[SPEAKER_05]: and they planted flowers.

1867
02:28:05,906 --> 02:28:12,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was an amazing area and it was so peaceful and a lot of people really took ownership of that.

1868
02:28:12,533 --> 02:28:22,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's been some, there's something going on between the people running the trust and the relationship with the mayor and trying to have trust there.

1869
02:28:22,944 --> 02:28:49,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So I talked to Mr. McGiven to reach out that if they want me or any of the council to be involved to try to mediate this, to try to make sure that ultimately the trust is there to fix the garden and keep the garden, the planting of the plants funded through the trust and the city also understanding that just do your due diligence, presents what they're asking for if it's three quotes,

1870
02:28:50,657 --> 02:28:51,818
[SPEAKER_05]: they know what they're paying for.

1871
02:28:52,218 --> 02:28:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So legally, they can lease that money.

1872
02:28:54,841 --> 02:28:56,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's what that's where we are.

1873
02:28:56,763 --> 02:28:58,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are close.

1874
02:28:58,384 --> 02:29:04,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that I did talk to a few dbw members that were there when they were testing the computer for the fountain.

1875
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,671
[SPEAKER_05]: But I

1876
02:29:05,911 --> 02:29:17,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're still a ways away before seeing what that garden deserves to be with the lights, the fountain, the colorful water that changes colors, and then the garden that goes around.

1877
02:29:17,797 --> 02:29:18,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important.

1878
02:29:18,697 --> 02:29:20,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for your time, Mr. President.

1879
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:39,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask for meeting with Mr. McGiven, myself in the trust, or anybody else in the council would like to join us to try to find a resolution to do what this trust was intended to do, and that's keep the garden in Crystal's honor, because we can't forget that.

1880
02:29:42,113 --> 02:29:43,193
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a special person.

1881
02:29:44,413 --> 02:29:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Her family was great people.

1882
02:29:46,394 --> 02:29:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife ran the Boston Marathon for five years in her name with her friends from UMass Boston.

1883
02:29:54,915 --> 02:29:57,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And that garden did mean a lot to their family.

1884
02:29:58,476 --> 02:30:06,377
[SPEAKER_05]: In the worst time of their lives, the city of Method gave them something that they could always go to and feel that crystal spirit was still there.

1885
02:30:06,417 --> 02:30:09,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's gotta be something done and we have to figure it out.

1886
02:30:09,718 --> 02:30:10,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's figure that out.

1887
02:30:11,098 --> 02:30:11,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1888
02:30:11,878 --> 02:30:14,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1889
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:22,103
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the DPW Commissioner, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro.

1890
02:30:22,123 --> 02:30:27,265
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Callahan, Councillor Saint.

1891
02:30:28,045 --> 02:30:29,726
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just had a question.

1892
02:30:29,746 --> 02:30:34,128
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems that no one really is in charge of making sure that this happens.

1893
02:30:34,775 --> 02:30:40,378
[SPEAKER_18]: No one at the trust is in charge, no one at DPW is in charge, and this sort of has just gone on because nobody's been focusing on it.

1894
02:30:40,438 --> 02:30:44,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any way to get somebody to, it's their responsibility to focus on it, or is that, you know?

1895
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:46,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what we're asking for.

1896
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:58,666
[SPEAKER_05]: We're asking for a sit down with it, whether it's mediation, where we're setting, because I think there's a lack of trust on the trust side because of the lack of support from central administration.

1897
02:30:58,686 --> 02:31:01,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Tim, I think Tim's doing the best he can.

1898
02:31:01,707 --> 02:31:12,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think maybe another elective fit body that comes into place says, hey, let's support this trust and make sure the funding and the processes used the way it was intended to.

1899
02:31:13,098 --> 02:31:18,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, like I said, I think Mayor McGlynn did this for the sole purpose of the money not disappearing and being used somewhere else.

1900
02:31:19,124 --> 02:31:24,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And people forget that people actually donated thousands of dollars to go directly to that.

1901
02:31:24,890 --> 02:31:30,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and it's important to see that last year was the 10th year anniversary.

1902
02:31:30,672 --> 02:31:39,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that family members and friends from UMass and the running team, they really wanted to be here to do the celebration to kick off the marathon, and they couldn't do it last year.

1903
02:31:39,875 --> 02:31:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was super disappointing.

1904
02:31:42,015 --> 02:31:47,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and there's a lot of people put a lot of hard work to make sure that happened in a short period of time.

1905
02:31:47,057 --> 02:31:47,577
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember,

1906
02:31:48,257 --> 02:31:58,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at the time, as soon as this happened, me and McGlynn really started moving quickly and getting funding for, you know, third parties to come in and donate a lot of money to make this happen.

1907
02:31:58,942 --> 02:32:00,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1908
02:32:01,363 --> 02:32:01,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1909
02:32:02,064 --> 02:32:02,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell her say.

1910
02:32:04,773 --> 02:32:12,094
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this on the agenda and going beyond that and doing the research for our council.

1911
02:32:14,355 --> 02:32:20,516
[SPEAKER_26]: What happened on one Boston day so many years ago was such a tragedy in our community.

1912
02:32:20,616 --> 02:32:22,996
[SPEAKER_26]: And I really felt it very strongly.

1913
02:32:23,056 --> 02:32:25,217
[SPEAKER_26]: It's something that we were around for.

1914
02:32:25,737 --> 02:32:31,598
[SPEAKER_26]: And we created this wonderful thing to memorialize Crystal Campbell.

1915
02:32:32,918 --> 02:32:39,823
[SPEAKER_26]: you know, to let it go by the wayside is such a, you know, honestly, it's kind of a disgrace on our part.

1916
02:32:40,604 --> 02:32:53,114
[SPEAKER_26]: I, you know, I think a lot of residents and I were, you know, have been, you know, this is one of those issues where people ask once in a while, and it slips through the cracks when we don't unify our forces on it.

1917
02:32:54,415 --> 02:32:57,357
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, the way that we did when this was first made.

1918
02:32:57,477 --> 02:33:01,260
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember actually, even for the dedication, I was in the string ensemble playing for it.

1919
02:33:03,181 --> 02:33:10,462
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, I, you know, a lot of residents have been asking, and I've been wondering too about the trust and, you know, what was going on in that end.

1920
02:33:10,662 --> 02:33:13,903
[SPEAKER_26]: It's super helpful that, you know, you've given us context for that.

1921
02:33:13,963 --> 02:33:17,564
[SPEAKER_26]: And so, um, you know, I think this is just the thing of accountability.

1922
02:33:18,304 --> 02:33:28,226
[SPEAKER_26]: It's, it's, if you, you know, I think the rules are written out pretty clearly, and as long as we hold ourselves accountable to it, as long as city administration is holding that trust, we should be able to do it.

1923
02:33:28,426 --> 02:33:29,046
[SPEAKER_26]: It shouldn't be a problem.

1924
02:33:29,286 --> 02:33:30,246
[SPEAKER_26]: It shouldn't be a problem, right?

1925
02:33:31,106 --> 02:33:33,287
[SPEAKER_26]: and evidently we've fallen flat.

1926
02:33:33,487 --> 02:33:35,827
[SPEAKER_26]: And so I thank you for your efforts.

1927
02:33:36,267 --> 02:33:37,127
[SPEAKER_26]: I totally support this.

1928
02:33:37,647 --> 02:33:43,389
[SPEAKER_26]: As much as we can do as a council to build, to be the ones who are accountable, I would support that.

1929
02:33:45,829 --> 02:33:46,169
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1930
02:33:46,189 --> 02:33:46,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1931
02:33:46,529 --> 02:33:51,010
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro to refer to the DPW Commissioner.

1932
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:52,370
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment?

1933
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:55,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Any comment by members of the public?

1934
02:33:56,131 --> 02:33:57,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Casta, any name and address for the record, please?

1935
02:33:57,791 --> 02:33:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your kindness.

1936
02:33:58,872 --> 02:33:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time, sir.

1937
02:34:00,811 --> 02:34:01,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1938
02:34:01,672 --> 02:34:02,853
[SPEAKER_06]: How much time do I have?

1939
02:34:02,873 --> 02:34:09,759
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to buy me one of those.

1940
02:34:09,779 --> 02:34:14,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everyone had a great Patriots Day yesterday.

1941
02:34:16,305 --> 02:34:22,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it wasn't for those Patriots, we wouldn't have a democratic republic, if we can keep it.

1942
02:34:25,851 --> 02:34:27,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday, I walked by the fountain.

1943
02:34:28,032 --> 02:34:30,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see any H2O water action.

1944
02:34:30,974 --> 02:34:33,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the festivities at the old cemetery.

1945
02:34:34,776 --> 02:34:40,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a sad thing that happened to me on my way to this forum.

1946
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, last November, I was here questioning the councilors, but they didn't answer because they did not have to, they said.

1947
02:34:49,685 --> 02:34:52,967
[SPEAKER_06]: But City Councilor Caviello told us

1948
02:34:54,363 --> 02:35:00,749
[SPEAKER_06]: the city, that the city has funds in place to fix the Crystal Campbell waterfall.

1949
02:35:01,369 --> 02:35:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just for her, it's for the other three dead people and the hundreds of injured and maimed people for life from all over the world.

1950
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:22,107
[SPEAKER_06]: But sadly, after many years, the Marathon Memorial Fountain is still not working.

1951
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a damn shame on who.

1952
02:35:28,364 --> 02:35:28,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I need names.

1953
02:35:30,085 --> 02:35:39,434
[SPEAKER_06]: McGlynn spent lots of hours, he gathered tens of thousands of dollars, and I guess he started a trust.

1954
02:35:40,035 --> 02:35:46,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe McGlynn, Michael, can come here and tell us what he did.

1955
02:35:47,422 --> 02:35:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: He should be concerned.

1956
02:35:49,895 --> 02:35:52,597
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can tell us how to rectify this problem.

1957
02:35:53,358 --> 02:36:05,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, the developers of that font were not that stupid to have it to a point in order to replace whatever the issue is, computer, the pump, Van Halen, whatever.

1958
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:08,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But hopefully, you don't have to start ripping up cement.

1959
02:36:09,771 --> 02:36:13,494
[SPEAKER_06]: This is typical of Method USA 0215.

1960
02:36:14,876 --> 02:36:17,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a damn shame.

1961
02:36:18,118 --> 02:36:18,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Can someone

1962
02:36:20,131 --> 02:36:23,093
[SPEAKER_06]: tell me how this is gonna get rectified, anyone.

1963
02:36:25,215 --> 02:36:29,238
[SPEAKER_05]: In my discussions with everyone, the trust is in place.

1964
02:36:29,579 --> 02:36:46,452
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a person in charge of the trust that is in charge of all the money, that has criteria set in place that when the funding needs to be addressed for the planting of the flowers, any upkeep of the fountain, that the city who's in charge of the site

1965
02:36:47,293 --> 02:36:58,442
[SPEAKER_05]: presents the trust with a breakdown, a financial breakdown, that's reasonable to what the trust rules were, so they can then cut them the check.

1966
02:36:59,022 --> 02:37:10,231
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, I think there's, I think the person you gotta talk to is go across the hall, talk to the mayor's office, and ask what their role is with this, Mr. Castaneda.

1967
02:37:10,731 --> 02:37:13,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna give you 30 more seconds, but if you can,

1968
02:37:14,574 --> 02:37:16,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's what I was told.

1969
02:37:16,876 --> 02:37:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So working with Mr. McGiven, he's been working his tail off on his own trying to find funding and city funds.

1970
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:24,921
[SPEAKER_05]: There are funds though there.

1971
02:37:25,601 --> 02:37:29,704
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that we can get I'm not going to stop until this is done.

1972
02:37:29,804 --> 02:37:34,927
[SPEAKER_05]: So I now that I've been invested in it, I'm hoping to meet with the trust and sit down with them.

1973
02:37:34,967 --> 02:37:37,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that Councilor Caviello has worked his tail off

1974
02:37:38,069 --> 02:37:47,952
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, probably he has to try to make this happen, but for some reason, you know, you have money there and you have people that are willing to spend it, but it has to be spent in a certain way.

1975
02:37:48,473 --> 02:37:52,934
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some non-transparent people, I should say, that maybe don't want to go that route.

1976
02:37:53,014 --> 02:37:54,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that's the issue right now.

1977
02:37:54,975 --> 02:37:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: It's putting people in a room.

1978
02:37:56,335 --> 02:38:00,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's me and Tim and the trust people and saying, okay, how do we make this work?

1979
02:38:00,857 --> 02:38:04,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring in, you know, a mediator to say, how do we make this work?

1980
02:38:04,658 --> 02:38:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Because ultimately,

1981
02:38:06,579 --> 02:38:09,001
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't want to release the funds because this is their funds.

1982
02:38:09,441 --> 02:38:14,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the rules that they were entrusted with when they were given control of these funds.

1983
02:38:14,884 --> 02:38:16,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So and I can't blame them.

1984
02:38:16,065 --> 02:38:18,787
[SPEAKER_05]: This is this is what they signed on for.

1985
02:38:18,827 --> 02:38:21,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping to get it done, Mr. Kessler.

1986
02:38:21,268 --> 02:38:22,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise I want it.

1987
02:38:22,529 --> 02:38:23,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it done myself.

1988
02:38:23,489 --> 02:38:26,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a damn shame.

1989
02:38:27,132 --> 02:38:33,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get Mr. Ask Mr. McGlynn, Michael, to come down here and tell us the real score?

1990
02:38:33,936 --> 02:38:34,937
[SPEAKER_06]: You know,

1991
02:38:36,004 --> 02:38:41,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he still has the clout after being here for like two decades, you know?

1992
02:38:41,748 --> 02:38:44,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you reach out to him?

1993
02:38:45,871 --> 02:38:46,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1994
02:38:47,292 --> 02:38:56,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not a big computer person, but if the computer's the issue, why can't we just have the fountain run as a Boston Public Garden fountain?

1995
02:38:56,819 --> 02:38:59,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to computerize each little jet.

1996
02:38:59,821 --> 02:39:01,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make it so complicated.

1997
02:39:02,703 --> 02:39:03,164
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1998
02:39:05,066 --> 02:39:16,370
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councillor Sarpelli to refer, Mr. Leonard, do you want to jump in on this one?

1999
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:23,153
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to the mechanics and getting the mechanical problems resolved, that would happen if we had pride.

2000
02:39:24,164 --> 02:39:27,327
[SPEAKER_20]: I recall a number of years ago when that event happened.

2001
02:39:28,067 --> 02:39:31,910
[SPEAKER_20]: I recall being out over there, a major event, the public was all there.

2002
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:34,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Lee C. Hughes, I think from Channel 4, was present.

2003
02:39:35,874 --> 02:39:36,774
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor was there.

2004
02:39:37,475 --> 02:39:38,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Mike McGlynn spoke about it.

2005
02:39:38,776 --> 02:39:42,279
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I hear things about the past administrations, I look

2006
02:39:43,769 --> 02:39:49,895
[SPEAKER_20]: at the things that those past administrations accomplished, things that caused the city to feel proud about itself.

2007
02:39:50,415 --> 02:39:52,437
[SPEAKER_20]: And there was a following event when it was opened.

2008
02:39:52,737 --> 02:39:54,959
[SPEAKER_20]: There were hundreds, if not a thousand people out there.

2009
02:39:55,319 --> 02:39:56,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Lee C. Hughes was back again.

2010
02:39:56,701 --> 02:39:59,023
[SPEAKER_20]: People felt pride.

2011
02:39:59,924 --> 02:40:05,349
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you felt the pride, the mechanics of getting that money would happen like that.

2012
02:40:05,669 --> 02:40:06,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2013
02:40:08,011 --> 02:40:08,391
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2014
02:40:09,713 --> 02:40:19,520
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Callaghan, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro, to refer to DPW.

2015
02:40:21,261 --> 02:40:22,121
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2016
02:40:24,483 --> 02:40:25,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Callaghan.

2017
02:40:25,704 --> 02:40:25,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2018
02:40:27,245 --> 02:40:28,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Collins.

2019
02:40:28,646 --> 02:40:28,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2020
02:40:29,686 --> 02:40:30,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lazzaro.

2021
02:40:30,967 --> 02:40:31,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2022
02:40:32,228 --> 02:40:33,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Lemming.

2023
02:40:33,649 --> 02:40:34,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2024
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:36,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Scarpelli.

2025
02:40:36,771 --> 02:40:36,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2026
02:40:37,810 --> 02:40:38,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Sang?

2027
02:40:38,591 --> 02:40:38,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2028
02:40:39,552 --> 02:40:40,252
[SPEAKER_15]: President Beers?

2029
02:40:40,413 --> 02:40:40,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2030
02:40:40,693 --> 02:40:44,697
[SPEAKER_24]: Seventy per minute on the negative motion passes.

2031
02:40:44,717 --> 02:40:51,423
[SPEAKER_24]: 24-080, Personnel Ordinance Amendment, Supervisor of Water and Sewer, to Honorable President and Members of the Medford City Council.

2032
02:40:51,804 --> 02:40:55,968
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend the City Council approve the following amendment.

2033
02:40:56,388 --> 02:41:00,412
[SPEAKER_24]: The revised ordinance is Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved.

2034
02:41:00,812 --> 02:41:09,575
[SPEAKER_24]: the city's classification and compensation plan, formally included as Article 2, Section 6631 to 6640, by adopting the following language.

2035
02:41:09,595 --> 02:41:16,396
[SPEAKER_24]: The language of PW 18 shall be amended to remove the following position, and the language of PW 19 be amended to include the following position.

2036
02:41:16,937 --> 02:41:23,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Supervisor of Water and Sewer, the city has had this position posted at PW 18 for months and has not received any qualified applications.

2037
02:41:23,418 --> 02:41:26,379
[SPEAKER_24]: This proposed classification change would not require a supplemental appropriation.

2038
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:27,200
[SPEAKER_24]: Respectfully submitted.

2039
02:41:29,588 --> 02:41:37,515
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a proposal to move the supervisor of water and sewer position from PW 18 in the city's compensation plan to PW 19.

2040
02:41:38,095 --> 02:41:49,165
[SPEAKER_24]: The justification is that this position has been posted since the beginning of this position was included in the fiscal 24 budget and posted for months and there have not been qualified applicants.

2041
02:41:50,006 --> 02:41:52,568
[SPEAKER_24]: And as noted, this would not require supplemental appropriation.

2042
02:41:52,588 --> 02:41:54,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there any discussion on the paper?

2043
02:41:56,104 --> 02:41:57,486
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins to present.

2044
02:41:58,187 --> 02:42:00,111
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Vice President Collins and Councillor Scarpelli.

2045
02:42:00,131 --> 02:42:00,451
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2046
02:42:01,353 --> 02:42:02,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Barras.

2047
02:42:04,718 --> 02:42:09,901
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we had a robust discussion about the water and sewer department earlier in the evening.

2048
02:42:09,921 --> 02:42:14,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the compensation and classification study was brought up.

2049
02:42:14,744 --> 02:42:29,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, as one counselor, I'm very much looking forward to the season whenever that arrives, when we can take a holistic look and see the analysis that we know is being worked on with the Collins Center in consultation with the city staff.

2050
02:42:29,893 --> 02:42:31,274
[SPEAKER_09]: to get that overall picture of.

2051
02:42:31,755 --> 02:42:41,943
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that some of these roles have salaries that are no longer competitive with our neighboring communities, maybe have not been for a long time.

2052
02:42:44,084 --> 02:42:57,815
[SPEAKER_09]: The point of this, the ultimate point of making sure that our positions are kind of accurately and up-to-date compensation-wise salaried, is to make sure that we are as competitive as any other municipality at attracting the best talent.

2053
02:42:59,821 --> 02:43:02,082
[SPEAKER_09]: because of the downstream effects that that has on our residents.

2054
02:43:03,462 --> 02:43:11,166
[SPEAKER_09]: All that to say, it's not my preference to do these CAF changes one at a time, but we also know that this position is incredibly critical.

2055
02:43:12,106 --> 02:43:17,388
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a point of inflection for our water infrastructure, and I don't want us to lose any time at all.

2056
02:43:17,488 --> 02:43:19,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it's just a couple of weeks, that could make the difference.

2057
02:43:19,969 --> 02:43:24,291
[SPEAKER_09]: If making this position more competitive will bring somebody on faster, I think we should do that.

2058
02:43:24,591 --> 02:43:27,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna motion to approve for first reading.

2059
02:43:27,725 --> 02:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion of Councillor Collins to approve the first reading seconded by Councillor Callahan.

2060
02:43:31,347 --> 02:43:32,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Councillor Scarpa.

2061
02:43:33,368 --> 02:43:43,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I was informed by the union representatives representation that I don't know if we without legal representation here to guide us.

2062
02:43:45,523 --> 02:43:47,545
[SPEAKER_05]: position is an arbitration.

2063
02:43:47,885 --> 02:43:53,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's being heard in arbitration because the position was a union position.

2064
02:43:53,991 --> 02:43:55,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's posted as a non union position.

2065
02:43:56,833 --> 02:44:09,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't as much as I wanted, and I was going to follow up with, you know, also asking for an increase in the calf, if this is where we're doing it for the city solicitor, so we can get to a rate that

2066
02:44:09,765 --> 02:44:31,498
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to be appealing for someone because it's obviously not working and this is the mayor controlling the dialogue everyone again so she sees the need here but as city solicitor she controls the dialogue kp law so she's not going to raise the cap we we did request that as part of the budget right no i i know that was the mayor replied to me in an email that she will get us a paper to increase that cap

2067
02:44:31,658 --> 02:44:34,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I know, but what I'm saying is we asked for that, we still haven't seen it.

2068
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:57,028
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an issue with the water department, but again, I think the biggest question right now is if we can wait till the next meeting to move this forward, get some legal representation on this, because I don't, if it's an arbitration, that's going against my beliefs as a union supporter, and I can't, if we vote on this, I couldn't support it.

2069
02:44:57,588 --> 02:44:58,629
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we'd have to wait.

2070
02:44:59,189 --> 02:45:11,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, I'd ask the table for one week until we get some clarity from legal about voting on something that's in arbitration that is non-union, but was once in union position.

2071
02:45:11,696 --> 02:45:12,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's haven't been negotiated out.

2072
02:45:13,417 --> 02:45:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a slippery slope for us.

2073
02:45:14,818 --> 02:45:22,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that the vote is in place, but I would maybe think of holding it off for the next meeting and getting some clarity.

2074
02:45:23,939 --> 02:45:25,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be my recommendation.

2075
02:45:25,119 --> 02:45:25,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2076
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:26,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2077
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a motion or an amendment?

2078
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:29,500
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion's already in.

2079
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:32,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just, my, if... We can amend the motion.

2080
02:45:32,621 --> 02:45:40,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would motion to table it to the next meeting to get clarity for legal representation about voting on an arbitration.

2081
02:45:41,863 --> 02:45:44,583
[SPEAKER_23]: There's, Vice President Collins.

2082
02:45:46,944 --> 02:45:51,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to defer to other suggestions at this time, but what's on my mind is,

2083
02:45:55,340 --> 02:45:57,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I said earlier, I feel a sense of urgency around this.

2084
02:45:57,521 --> 02:46:00,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I would prefer not to wait two weeks to take the first vote.

2085
02:46:00,543 --> 02:46:07,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like an advantage here is that we can ask for information and if it's relevant, we

2086
02:46:08,766 --> 02:46:10,706
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the third reading to take an additional vote on.

2087
02:46:10,726 --> 02:46:10,946
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

2088
02:46:11,066 --> 02:46:22,549
[SPEAKER_24]: So I, since there were too much on the floor, I wanted to give enough time for you to kind of just suss out if there was a compromise motion here, given that there isn't a compromise motion, there's a motion of the table on the floor that is undebatable and takes precedence.

2089
02:46:22,569 --> 02:46:24,129
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to cut debate off at this point.

2090
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:27,129
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion of the table of Councillor Scarpelli, is there a second?

2091
02:46:28,510 --> 02:46:30,110
[SPEAKER_24]: A second by Councillor Callahan.

2092
02:46:31,290 --> 02:46:32,670
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2093
02:46:34,091 --> 02:46:34,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor Callahan.

2094
02:46:35,311 --> 02:46:35,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2095
02:46:36,854 --> 02:46:38,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor VP Collins?

2096
02:46:39,697 --> 02:46:39,857
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2097
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:43,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Zaro?

2098
02:46:44,041 --> 02:46:44,221
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2099
02:46:47,444 --> 02:46:48,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Lemming?

2100
02:46:49,025 --> 02:46:49,306
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

02:46:52,048 --> 02:46:53,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scapelli?

2102
02:46:53,249 --> 02:46:53,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

02:46:55,051 --> 02:46:55,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Sang?

02:46:58,174 --> 02:46:59,215
[SPEAKER_15]: President Villescaz?

2106
02:46:59,295 --> 02:46:59,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2107
02:47:05,987 --> 02:47:06,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me tell you something.

2108
02:47:07,228 --> 02:47:09,770
[SPEAKER_24]: If you say yes, I'm getting dinner by 50 people.

2109
02:47:09,950 --> 02:47:12,172
[SPEAKER_24]: No, but that's because we can keep talking about it.

2110
02:47:12,332 --> 02:47:14,915
[SPEAKER_24]: So let's keep going.

2111
02:47:15,976 --> 02:47:16,976
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion fails.

2112
02:47:17,297 --> 02:47:18,398
[SPEAKER_24]: Three affirmative, four negative.

2113
02:47:18,418 --> 02:47:18,998
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion fails.

2114
02:47:19,018 --> 02:47:20,279
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Vice President Collins.

2115
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:32,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to, I actually don't know if there's a way to attach a B paper to an ordinance, but I would like the information on this union issue attached to the, sorry,

2116
02:47:34,591 --> 02:47:38,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't actually know if there's a way to attach a B paper to this particular vote, like we do with resolutions.

2117
02:47:38,853 --> 02:47:40,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like the answer to Councillor Scarpaoli's question.

2118
02:47:40,933 --> 02:47:47,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I would prefer to vote on this tonight, but I'd be happy to put your question as a B paper to the vote, if that is an option.

2119
02:47:47,576 --> 02:47:49,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We could vote yes on this one.

2120
02:47:53,258 --> 02:47:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you vote yes on one of the three readings?

2121
02:47:55,079 --> 02:47:55,999
Well, I would vote yes.

2122
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take it.

2123
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:57,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I would vote no.

2124
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:59,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I would wait for my three readings.

2125
02:47:59,881 --> 02:47:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2126
02:48:00,001 --> 02:48:00,201
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2127
02:48:02,687 --> 02:48:09,382
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I hear you and I just wanted I just didn't motion to table is a tough instrument that this allows debate but I so I had to handle it procedurally.

2128
02:48:11,724 --> 02:48:14,105
[SPEAKER_24]: My, it sounds like I'm the swing on this.

2129
02:48:15,546 --> 02:48:26,390
[SPEAKER_24]: My personal preference would be, given the fact that there's not a representative of the administration here tonight to answer our questions, that we request a representative of the administration to appear at our next meeting with the answer to this question.

2130
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:27,871
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's just my personal preference.

2131
02:48:28,291 --> 02:48:31,852
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, I would tend to agree with you, Councilor Collins.

2132
02:48:31,872 --> 02:48:36,694
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know that there's a way to, it sounds like there's general agreement that we would advance this pending the answer to that question.

2133
02:48:37,675 --> 02:48:37,935
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2134
02:48:39,055 --> 02:48:39,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor?

2135
02:48:44,209 --> 02:48:52,917
[SPEAKER_26]: motion to invite Council to the next meeting to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question and to table this until that next meeting.

2136
02:48:53,358 --> 02:48:57,381
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, motion to, maybe we can get the answer in advance.

2137
02:48:58,042 --> 02:49:05,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so motion to request an answer on the question, on Councilor Scarpelli's question about

2138
02:49:06,874 --> 02:49:15,622
[SPEAKER_24]: voting on this while the position is in arbitration and request representative administration at the next meeting and put this on the table for April 30th.

2139
02:49:32,013 --> 02:49:32,993
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

2140
02:49:33,994 --> 02:49:34,714
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, yes.

[SPEAKER_24]: So on the motion of Councilor saying to, um, request a response from Council on on the question about this position being an arbitration, and if that impacts our vote.

[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.

[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scapelli?

2153
02:50:12,376 --> 02:50:12,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2154
02:50:13,916 --> 02:50:14,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Sang?

2155
02:50:14,836 --> 02:50:15,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2156
02:50:16,097 --> 02:50:16,777
[SPEAKER_15]: President Behrs?

2157
02:50:16,857 --> 02:50:17,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2158
02:50:17,097 --> 02:50:18,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

02:50:20,459 --> 02:50:28,002
[SPEAKER_24]: The request is made to the administration for an answer to the question and presence at our next meeting, and the item is tabled until our April 30th meeting.

2161

[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by.

2170
02:50:52,733 --> 02:50:52,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

2171
02:50:53,013 --> 02:50:54,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we want to add the ordinance?

[SPEAKER_24]: It's not eligible till next month.

2173
02:50:57,015 --> 02:50:57,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, sorry.

2174
02:50:57,616 --> 02:50:57,876
[SPEAKER_24]: You're good.

2175
02:50:59,063 --> 02:51:06,930
[SPEAKER_24]: uh, on that motion of Council Vice President Collins, seconded by Councillor saying to take from third from the table and approve for third reading.

2176
02:51:08,232 --> 02:51:08,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Any discussion?

2177
02:51:12,996 --> 02:51:15,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Any discussion in the chambers or on zoom by members of the public?

2178
02:51:19,662 --> 02:51:21,223
[SPEAKER_24]: I see a hand raised.

2179
02:51:21,263 --> 02:51:22,685
[SPEAKER_24]: I will go to Norman Kaplan.

2180
02:51:22,725 --> 02:51:24,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Name and address for the record, please.

2181
02:51:26,587 --> 02:51:28,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Norman Kaplan, Edlin Way.

2182
02:51:28,489 --> 02:51:36,495
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure exactly procedurally where we are with this draft ordinance.

2183
02:51:37,816 --> 02:51:39,198
[SPEAKER_21]: I was here at the last meeting.

2184
02:51:39,218 --> 02:51:45,243
[SPEAKER_21]: I got to speak after midnight, express some thoughts about it.

2185
02:51:46,444 --> 02:51:53,349
[SPEAKER_21]: And not really sure whether the reading encapsulates the exact

2186
02:51:54,477 --> 02:52:00,000
[SPEAKER_21]: language and wording that I was briefed on when I was here before.

2187
02:52:01,741 --> 02:52:17,931
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would like to emphasize a couple of points that I did make to see whether or not these can be incorporated in the final ordinance.

2188
02:52:23,001 --> 02:52:40,153
[SPEAKER_24]: just procedure, Norman, where we are at, uh, the language as amended and approved for first reading on March 12th was advertised in the local newspaper on April 4th, and that was, uh,

2189
02:52:41,786 --> 02:52:51,697
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, that was, that is a legal requirement under mass general law that we, that we put the text of the ordinance as approved for first reading, um, out, uh, in the advertising.

2190
02:52:51,737 --> 02:52:53,579
[SPEAKER_24]: And now we would be approving for third reading.

2191
02:52:54,140 --> 02:53:02,770
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding of the process is that if we were to amend that third reading, we would have to then start the process again, uh, reapprove it for first reading and re advertise it.

2192
02:53:05,483 --> 02:53:14,608
[SPEAKER_21]: exactly which newspaper was it advertised in because I'm not aware of any newspaper that's servicing our community.

2193
02:53:15,669 --> 02:53:21,892
[SPEAKER_24]: That was advertised in the Medford transcript and Somerville Medford and Somerville transcript and journal, or what's left of it.

2194
02:53:24,213 --> 02:53:29,576
[SPEAKER_21]: I say, well, I think it would.

2195
02:53:29,736 --> 02:53:29,756
[SPEAKER_21]: I

2196
02:53:32,155 --> 02:53:40,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I think something as important to this probably should have received more widespread publication.

2197
02:53:42,300 --> 02:53:47,462
[SPEAKER_21]: But be that as it may, I appreciate the information you've given me.

2198
02:53:47,562 --> 02:53:55,165
[SPEAKER_21]: And will there be a further publication when you talk about a third reading?

2199
02:53:55,205 --> 02:53:57,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is there going to be a further publication?

2200
02:53:58,729 --> 02:54:05,994
[SPEAKER_24]: So this vote would be a vote to put this in the ordinances and creating an ordinance and acting an ordinance.

2201
02:54:06,014 --> 02:54:07,275
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is the vote for enactment.

2202
02:54:07,835 --> 02:54:11,998
[SPEAKER_24]: I would then go to the mayor for her signature of veto and or neither.

2203
02:54:12,538 --> 02:54:20,804
[SPEAKER_24]: And if she signs it or does not veto it, then we would start the process of getting that up on the city's muni code website.

2204
02:54:21,444 --> 02:54:30,810
[SPEAKER_24]: at which point, at some point in the future, basically it'll go up as its own ordinance and then it will be codified in the city's code of ordinances online.

2205
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:43,897
[SPEAKER_21]: And what if the mayor should wish to make some revisions of her own, taking into account perhaps some commentary or suggestions from the public?

2206
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:48,280
[SPEAKER_21]: What would be the consequence of that?

2207
02:54:49,468 --> 02:54:56,310
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor could veto the ordinance which would return it to this council for further consideration.

2208
02:54:56,391 --> 02:54:59,292
[SPEAKER_24]: We could override her veto.

2209
02:54:59,612 --> 02:55:08,315
[SPEAKER_24]: We could amend the ordinance and begin the process again to go to first reading and then an advertisement and then the third reading again.

2210
02:55:09,375 --> 02:55:14,357
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually to get some further improvements on the current ordinance,

2211
02:55:15,112 --> 02:55:15,652
[SPEAKER_21]: language.

2212
02:55:16,393 --> 02:55:21,394
[SPEAKER_21]: We're really only talking about a delay of perhaps a few months.

2213
02:55:22,014 --> 02:55:28,797
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, it would be so it would probably be back to us.

2214
02:55:30,117 --> 02:55:36,701
[SPEAKER_24]: mid-May and then have to go out again for another month, so probably would be mid-June or July when it would be completed?

2215
02:55:36,721 --> 02:55:37,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2216
02:55:38,382 --> 02:55:47,627
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'm probably the last person in Medford that would like to see any delay in the enactment of a leaf blower restrictive ordinance.

2217
02:55:48,168 --> 02:55:48,568
[SPEAKER_21]: However,

2218
02:55:50,484 --> 02:55:55,086
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we really only have one chance to get this right.

2219
02:55:56,127 --> 02:56:07,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Because once it's enacted, I'm sure we're talking years, if at all, that there would ever be any revision of it.

2220
02:56:07,771 --> 02:56:13,814
[SPEAKER_21]: So to have a misstep here after all this time, I mean, I've been working on this for four years.

2221
02:56:16,102 --> 02:56:23,906
[SPEAKER_21]: To make a misstep here that would be preventable seems to me to be somewhat tragicomic, actually.

2222
02:56:23,926 --> 02:56:38,353
[SPEAKER_21]: And to be quick and blunt, I'm personally not satisfied with the extent of the restrictions, as I've said in some of my dialogue already.

2223
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:44,232
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I will have to have a dialogue with the mayor.

2224
02:56:45,933 --> 02:56:48,234
[SPEAKER_21]: I understand that the council can veto her.

2225
02:56:49,435 --> 02:56:58,701
[SPEAKER_21]: If she decides to veto, we can override it or decide to incorporate some further revisions in it.

2226
02:57:00,602 --> 02:57:02,263
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I'll just let it stand like that.

2227
02:57:02,283 --> 02:57:07,166
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I don't think I have really any other choice at this point.

2228
02:57:08,851 --> 02:57:09,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr Kaplan.

2229
02:57:09,812 --> 02:57:11,934
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate your input and comments on the process.

2230
02:57:11,994 --> 02:57:21,161
[SPEAKER_24]: And certainly if the mayor were to come back to the council with suggestions, I'm sure that the council would consider them in good faith.

2231
02:57:22,322 --> 02:57:23,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you and good night.

2232
02:57:24,544 --> 02:57:24,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2233
02:57:24,984 --> 02:57:30,109
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion.

2234
02:57:31,164 --> 02:57:36,066
[SPEAKER_24]: of Councillor Collins to approve her third reading as seconded by Councillor Saing.

2235
02:57:37,307 --> 02:57:40,588
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further comment from members of the public or members of the Council?

2236
02:57:42,849 --> 02:57:45,030
[SPEAKER_24]: Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

02:57:46,090 --> 02:57:46,991

[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_15]: President Beers.

2249
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:08,250
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one of the negative.

2250
02:58:08,550 --> 02:58:12,452
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes and the ordinance is ordained.

2251
02:58:12,552 --> 02:58:13,732
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

2252
02:58:14,252 --> 02:58:15,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Beers.

2253
02:58:15,433 --> 02:58:22,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to put forward a motion to receive and place on file the following papers that are under reports due slash deadlines.

2254
02:58:23,796 --> 02:58:24,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I can read them off.

2255
02:58:25,917 --> 02:58:26,137
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 17-606.

2256
02:58:31,118 --> 02:58:31,458
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-086, 22-007, 22-009, and 22-039.

2257
02:58:31,518 --> 02:58:36,003
[SPEAKER_09]: That motion is to receive and place all of those on file.

2258
02:58:51,146 --> 02:58:53,247
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins to take paper 17-606, 20-086, 22-007, 22-009, and 22-039.

2259
02:58:53,307 --> 02:58:53,687
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

2260
02:58:53,827 --> 02:58:55,828
[SPEAKER_24]: And receive and place on file.

2261
02:58:55,888 --> 02:58:58,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

2262
02:58:58,409 --> 02:58:59,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2263
02:59:16,516 --> 02:59:17,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CASSIDY.

2264
02:59:18,136 --> 02:59:19,657
[SPEAKER_23]: Councillor CASSIDY.

2265
02:59:19,697 --> 02:59:20,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Councillor CASSIDY.

[SPEAKER_15]: Councillor CASSIDY.

2268
02:59:47,982 --> 02:59:48,786
[SPEAKER_23]: You do that to Sylvia?

2269
02:59:52,496 --> 02:59:59,041
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one very much in the negative.

2270
02:59:59,401 --> 03:00:04,344
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion passes.

2271
03:00:04,784 --> 03:00:07,946
[SPEAKER_24]: If I may, the motion passes.

2272
03:00:08,447 --> 03:00:09,768
[SPEAKER_24]: I did receive a communication.

2273
03:00:09,948 --> 03:00:15,211
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the emailers in public comment did specifically ask me to read the email out loud.

2274
03:00:16,372 --> 03:00:17,973
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to read this email out loud.

2275
03:00:18,013 --> 03:00:20,935
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not my words, but it was a specific request.

2276
03:00:21,455 --> 03:00:24,778
[SPEAKER_24]: The subject is civility and professionalism in city council meetings.

2277
03:00:25,338 --> 03:00:35,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President Vares, Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Seng, and Councilor Lemming, I'm ready to express my appreciation for your amazing work as city councilors that represent the trust our electorate has placed in you.

2278
03:00:35,665 --> 03:00:41,489
[SPEAKER_24]: Your professionalism in handling the mob approach that a vocal minority who are attending some of the city council meetings is very deeply appreciated.

2279
03:00:41,589 --> 03:00:42,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Please keep up your excellent work.

2280
03:00:43,151 --> 03:00:46,313
[SPEAKER_24]: I would appreciate your reading my brief email out loud in the next council meeting.

2281
03:00:46,393 --> 03:00:49,495
[SPEAKER_24]: Sincerely, Munir Jumanis, PhD, physicist, educator.

2282
03:00:49,955 --> 03:00:50,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you all.

2283
03:00:50,996 --> 03:00:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I can?

2284
03:00:52,056 --> 03:00:53,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

2285
03:00:54,097 --> 03:00:55,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't gonna say anything.

2286
03:00:56,077 --> 03:01:08,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that I read those two letters and I can understand the behavior of some members of the community that act so inappropriate that they cross that line.

2287
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:18,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't stand for that myself, but I don't want to lump in the members that come to this podium that have passion for a topic.

2288
03:01:19,243 --> 03:01:26,705
[SPEAKER_05]: and make it seem like, I think like what was said earlier, that they get lumped in together.

2289
03:01:26,745 --> 03:01:39,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that personally, I've talked to some people and people have reached out to me and for one, I want to apologize because somebody reached out to me and said, Councilor Scott Pelley, you're so abrasive and so aggressive that you actually scare me.

2290
03:01:40,993 --> 03:01:54,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my personality but I can also see that so I would apologize, but I also think that we have counselors here tonight that need to publicly apologize the constituents, because of their behavior.

2291
03:01:54,691 --> 03:01:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know,

2292
03:01:56,013 --> 03:02:10,275
[SPEAKER_05]: what's good for one should be good for all because I think some of our fellow counselors maybe not understanding or feeling nervous and maybe showing, you know, a giggling or disrespectful manner to people at the at the podium.

2293
03:02:10,675 --> 03:02:11,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest with you,

2294
03:02:12,237 --> 03:02:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not to those ignorant people that do come up and cross that line.

2295
03:02:15,619 --> 03:02:21,922
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times you're seeing this behavior to people that just express themselves openly and have that right there.

2296
03:02:21,982 --> 03:02:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said to myself, if this is going to be brought up, I'm going to apologize that if I offend anybody, because at the times that I speak,

2297
03:02:32,006 --> 03:02:34,528
[SPEAKER_05]: with what they put as abrasive manner.

2298
03:02:35,649 --> 03:02:38,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's who I am as a person, I'm a loud person.

2299
03:02:39,612 --> 03:02:43,235
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're offended, I apologize that you're offended by the way I present.

2300
03:02:43,675 --> 03:02:51,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I would hope that my fellow colleagues that were praised tonight in these letters that also behaved in a manner that isn't

2301
03:02:52,862 --> 03:02:56,323
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't truly what should be expressed by a city councilor.

2302
03:02:56,703 --> 03:03:15,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope they apologize openly to the public like they've done privately, just so everybody's on the same page and everybody is expressing that type of behavior and acknowledging and saying, okay, let's move forward from here and understand that, you know, nodding your head, not paying attention.

2303
03:03:15,468 --> 03:03:20,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Because one thing I really tried to be totally honest with everybody, since I started as elected official,

2304
03:03:21,325 --> 03:03:23,467
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some pretty colorful people at that podium.

2305
03:03:24,307 --> 03:03:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen some behaviors from some of my fellow counselors that they would stand up and walk out.

2306
03:03:30,613 --> 03:03:37,738
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter how much you disrespect that person, getting up and walking out and disrespecting that person is a total disgrace for the seat.

2307
03:03:38,519 --> 03:03:39,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would never do that.

2308
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:45,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether I believe in what you're saying or don't believe what you're saying, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna listen to that person.

2309
03:03:45,834 --> 03:03:53,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there has been, you know, I've seen it myself that counselors make motions that could be represented as disrespectful.

2310
03:03:54,476 --> 03:04:01,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like the person who wrote the letters, I don't disagree with them.

2311
03:04:01,318 --> 03:04:06,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there are people that do cross the line, but that podium's there for everybody.

2312
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:08,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was said the other night in subcommittee.

2313
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:12,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That podium's set up for everybody to speak their mind.

2314
03:04:13,462 --> 03:04:14,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when they cross that line,

2315
03:04:15,933 --> 03:04:16,954
[SPEAKER_05]: they got to be held accountable.

2316
03:04:16,974 --> 03:04:18,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's something we need to talk about.

2317
03:04:18,976 --> 03:04:24,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the same breath, we should all take ownership of some pretty tough couple of weeks.

2318
03:04:24,841 --> 03:04:26,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've had some pretty intense weeks.

2319
03:04:26,903 --> 03:04:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were things that we can all agree to disagree with, but still have the mature and responses and to give the respect to the people that are at the podium.

2320
03:04:38,473 --> 03:04:41,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's what I feel.

2321
03:04:41,594 --> 03:04:45,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the letter, even though they didn't put my name in it.

2322
03:04:46,575 --> 03:04:47,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very hurt right now.

2323
03:04:48,876 --> 03:04:49,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's okay.

2324
03:04:50,516 --> 03:04:52,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have Dean to write me a letter next week.

2325
03:04:54,577 --> 03:04:55,198
[SPEAKER_24]: But thank you.

2326
03:04:55,418 --> 03:04:55,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2327
03:04:55,758 --> 03:05:07,561
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to thank Councillor Strudel for bringing up prior councils and behaviors and how I would note that everyone on this council has sat and listened to the public comment regardless of

2328
03:05:08,351 --> 03:05:09,031
[SPEAKER_24]: It's content.

2329
03:05:09,831 --> 03:05:12,392
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't mean we haven't responded in different ways.

2330
03:05:13,312 --> 03:05:21,554
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of the incidents referred to, I'll just say that some people were named and others were not when everyone reacted in the same way.

2331
03:05:22,654 --> 03:05:29,895
[SPEAKER_24]: And to be honest, I think there's a difference between a good faith misinterpretation of someone's tone and disrespect.

2332
03:05:30,015 --> 03:05:31,576
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to put that out there too.

2333
03:05:32,096 --> 03:05:34,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes I tell a joke and nobody laughs.

2334
03:05:35,537 --> 03:05:36,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that mean it was not a joke?

2335
03:05:37,237 --> 03:05:37,357
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2336
03:05:38,846 --> 03:05:43,748
[SPEAKER_24]: So, and sometimes I'm not telling a joke and people laugh, and that's just because I'm very funny.
