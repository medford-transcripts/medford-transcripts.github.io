129
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:10,001
Whereas there are thousands of pet partners therapy animal teams serving communities across the United States.

130
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:15,186
And whereas pet partners has designated April 30 as National Therapy Animal Day.

131
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:24,593
And whereas scientific research shows that interacting with therapy animals can reduce stress, relieve depression, slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure and strengthen the immune system.

And whereas therapy animal teams in the city of Medford play an essential role in improving human health and well-being through the human animal bond.

133
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:41,973
And whereas therapy animal teams interact with a variety of people in our community, including veterans, seniors, patients, students, and those approaching end of life.

141
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,407
Thank you, Madam President.

142
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:34,050
I wanted to thank a resident, Paul McCaffrey, for bringing this to my attention.

143
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:42,133
And I know we have a lot of folks in our community and around the state and the country who have benefited from animal therapy in many ways.

144
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,395
I have seen

145
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:58,506
these animals and actions in school settings, college settings after traumatic incidents, helping families deal with grief and loss, and also just everyday help that these animals can provide to people.

146
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,688
And they also happen to be lovely.

147
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:06,654
We have Lily here in attendance, and we got a little card of Lily with a few statistics.

148
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,557
I particularly like that one of Lily's favorite activities is couch surfing.

149
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,853
I think that's just great.

150
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,495
So I just wanted to thank Paul for bringing this up.

151
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:20,319
And I know I think the mayor is going to issue a proclamation as well, but it's something good that we can all celebrate.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,860
Thank you.

153
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,983
Any further comment from councilors?

154
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:28,846
Any public comment on this topic?

155
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,689
Hearing none, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

156
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,450
Paul, do you want to talk?

157
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:38,274
I want to thank the council and my fellow residents.

158
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:39,515
Paul, could you come up to the microphone?

159
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,238
Just give your name and address for the record, please.

160
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,740
Watch it, Lily.

161
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:52,668
Just your name and address for the record, please, Paul.

162
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,984
Paul McCaffrey 59 Prescott Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

163
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:05,429
I want to thank the Council and the residents of Medford for allowing us to go and visit folks every day in different, different situations.

164
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,093
You know, the, the one thing to take away from the with having therapy dogs is that

165
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,250
It's kind of a force multiplier.

166
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:23,312
Police departments and schools are using them to be kind of the first line of defense of bringing down tensions in school.

167
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:32,333
So one of the things is that you want to do before there's a tragic incident is to have dogs come in on a regular basis and make people comfortable.

168
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,874
Lilly tries every day to do that.

169
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,154
And I appreciate the council's attention to the matter.

170
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:40,735
And I hope that I can encourage more people to be therapy handlers in Medford.

171
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,143
Thank you so much, Paul.

172
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:47,864
It's a pleasure to see Lily getting so comfortable in our chambers today.

173
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:49,564
Thank you.

174
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:52,945

00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:58,146
Yes.

179
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,147
Councilor Zaro.

180
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:00,947
Yes.

181
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:02,647
Councilor Lemming.

182
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:03,727
Yes.

183
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,328
Councilor Scopelli.

184
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:06,748
Yes.

185
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:08,328
Councilor Sang.

186
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:08,628
Yes.

187
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,229
President Beers.

188
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:10,589
Yes.

189
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,504
7 in favor, none opposed, the motion passes.

190
00:10:14,524 --> 00:10:28,199
24-075 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

191
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,423
Resolution to discuss concerns dealing with the Bedford Water Department.

192
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:37,534
to be resolved by the benefit City Council discuss concerns with the Medford Water Department.

193
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:42,158
We did receive two communications from the administration and I'll go over to Councillor Scarpelli.

194
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:42,718
Thank you.

195
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,122
I appreciate bringing this forward to Council.

196
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,944
Let him indulge me with this resolution.

197
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:57,831
I know that I spoke to Mr Stone King, supervisor who has now moved on to

198
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:01,450
new community.

199
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:09,779
And he passed along a letter that he asked if I, you know, could read he shared it with everybody here.

200
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:22,572
But for this is reading for Mr. Stone King says, dear Mayor Brianna Longo Cone, I'm writing to formally resign from the position as superintendent

201
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,512
Thought it was a lot easier than that, didn't use that.

202
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:33,914
One second.

203
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:45,424
I appreciate you for indulging me.

204
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:51,449
This new thing called the cell phone, it's trying to get used to it.

205
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,491
So I apologize.

206
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:57,795
It's something to do with these delicate fingers I have.

207
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:09,785
I promise, I'm almost there.

208
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,807
Yeah, can we have the therapy dog back in?

209
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:18,888
Round two?

210
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:22,029
Can we have round two of the therapy dog, please?

211
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:25,169
Where are you, Lily?

212
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:34,392
Okay, well.

213
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,333
There we go.

214
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,994
All right, so I apologize.

215
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:46,056
He writes, I'm writing to formally resign from my position as Superintendent of Water and Sewer for the City of Medford effective April 5th, 2024.

216
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:55,859
It is with heavy heart that I submit resignation as I've greatly appreciated the opportunities and experience I've gained in my time serving the City of Medford during my tenure.

217
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,122
I have had the privilege of working under the leadership of DPW Commissioner Tim McGiven.

218
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:07,247
I must commend Commissioner McGiven for his professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of Medford.

219
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:13,752
His leadership has been a source of inspiration and guidance to me, and I am truly grateful for the support and mentorship he has provided.

220
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,035
I will strive to emulate his exemption leadership as I move forward.

221
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:27,258
Despite the admirable qualities Commissioner McGiven have found myself increasingly frustrated with the administration's lack of action addressing critical issues within the department.

222
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:32,719
The recent handling supervisor of water and sewer job posting, coupled with the

223
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:51,998
And something offers 0% costs of living increase for FY 24 has underscored and concerning absence of values you place in my position as well as the lack of priority place in the central matters, such as water main replacements, aging utility infrastructure staffing shortages and overall neglect.

224
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:53,899
of the needs of the DPW.

225
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:04,441
I have worked tirelessly to address compliances issues, modernize departmental operations to highlight the pressing concerns surrounding the water distribution system.

226
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:13,563
Regrettably, my pleas for assistance recognition of regulatory concerns and urgent calls for action seemingly fallen on deaf ears.

227
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:19,244
It is disheartening to feel ignored and undervalued in the position where the welfare of the community is at stake.

228
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:25,586
I believe that my efforts have made this positive impact, but there is still so much work to be done.

229
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:31,468
I have reached a point where I feel I have exhausted all avenues and effected meaningless change within the covered environment.

230
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:42,572
It is essential that the City refocuses its attention on critical infrastructure projects, staffing needs, and operational improvements to ensure the continued well-being of Medford and its residents.

231
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:50,559
I'm deeply concerned the residents are unaware of the alarming conditions of the water system and its critical need for substantial improvement.

232
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,906
Immediate focus and drastic change are essential to ensure the integrity of Medford water infrastructure

233
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,527
as time is running out.

234
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:05,089
I'm grateful for the opportunity to have served the city of Medford and valuable lessons I've learned along the way.

235
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:14,534
I extend my deepest appreciation to all those who have supported and collaborated with me during my time here as those contributions have been instrumental in shaping my professional growth.

236
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:22,218
I wish the city of residence the best in the future and hope necessary steps will be taken to address the challenging challenges facing DPW.

237
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,480
Thank you once again the opportunity to have been part of this community

238
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,341
Sincerely, Dan Stone King.

239
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,763
So thank you, Mr. Stone King.

240
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:37,108
I had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Stone King and I had a great conversation with Tim McGibbon.

241
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:51,069
What I find appalling and what's frightening is that whenever lately, I don't know if we've followed along with my resolutions, we've always had something come back from the administration.

242
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:51,810
Do you guys notice that?

243
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:57,155
Every day after I bring something up, like even tonight, we have something about the water department.

244
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:58,596
Why does it take?

245
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,802
Why does it take a negative resolution to make city administration move on something this important?

246
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,984
Mr. Stone King actually told me, we're not there yet.

247
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,546
But he says he wants us to think in Medford as Flint, Michigan.

248
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,087
Now we know how bad Flint, Michigan is right?

249
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,348
Now I said, Is it that bad?

250
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,669
When I talked to Tim, he says we're getting there.

251
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,313
He was very excited when ARPA came out.

252
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,616
And the first phase of ARPA was meant for what?

253
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:29,017
Infrastructure needs.

254
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,619
So they had a plan in place to really start moving things along.

255
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,722
What he told me is that we're moving at a pace of about, what is it, a quarter or half a mile?

256
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:44,547
We need three miles a year to catch up in Medford for what the aging infrastructure that we have in our water department.

257
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:46,849
What I found amazing to me is,

258
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:54,788
I don't know if people realize this, his position holds a license that you have to have to run the water department in Medford.

259
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:03,354
If you don't have the certain license, you're at serious risk of serious danger when it comes to your water quality.

260
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:07,437
So he's there having that license, which aren't many people that have that.

261
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,038
As a matter of fact,

262
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:27,420
As we speak right now, I believe Medford has hired Weston and Sampson, an outside agency, another outside company, paying them $200 an hour, an hour to sit in that office just to make sure that we have someone in place to qualify that our water is safe.

263
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:34,447
Now, all this had to be done is a conversation and fair negotiation process to say, hey, what do we need to keep you?

264
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,595
But I talked more about that.

265
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:38,476
It wasn't about the money system.

266
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:39,696
It was about the value.

267
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:45,437
He was in the position for two years, two years of vital, vital position.

268
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:48,638
So do you know how many times he spoke to the mayor twice?

269
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,979
Twice.

270
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,780
So we could say whatever we want and what's going on.

271
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:00,434
And like I said, I'm gonna say it again, because there's a bunch of issues that I'll bring up.

272
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:01,714
I want everybody to follow this along.

273
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:05,455
Because as I bring things up, all of a sudden we have resolutions from the mayor.

274
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,275
It's funny.

275
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:09,836
But these are all too late.

276
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,237
Not for Weston and Sampson, they're making a killing.

277
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,577
$1,600 for today, right?

278
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:15,577
Eight hour days, $200 a day, $1,600 a day.

279
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,673
Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.

280
00:18:22,094 --> 00:18:26,238
I've reached out to neighboring communities, asked them about this person with this license.

281
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:30,603
I've reached out to representatives MWRA that I know, from Medford, that hold that license.

282
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:39,011
Quote unquote, A, I would never come to Medford because the administration's a mess.

283
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,714
And B, why would they leave?

284
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,216
They're making way more money where they are.

285
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,813
So this is the problem that we're having.

286
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,601
And if you're watching, every week, it keeps piling on.

287
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:52,563
It's the same thing.

288
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,266
It's a lack of leadership.

289
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,741
So Mr. Stonekin wanted to send that along.

290
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,203
I know I had a great discussion with Tim McGibbon.

291
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,225
Tim did send over a letter.

292
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,126
Everybody received the letter.

293
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,148
And I shared that with Mr. Stoneking.

294
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:15,112
And I said, well, he said, in typical fashion, nothing against Tim McGibbon and the DPW, because he works for the mayor.

295
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,787
But all this does is just delay everything.

296
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:20,847
What do they say?

297
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,747
They're starting the process now to start looking into it.

298
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,388
And they've been working on it for a couple of weeks.

299
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,628
His words were, quote unquote, it's just talk.

300
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,329
That's what he's felt for two years.

301
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:31,929
It's just talk.

302
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,149
And I appreciate Tim.

303
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:35,510
Listen, I know it's not Tim McGibbon.

304
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,250
I talked to Tim.

305
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,530
His hands are tied.

306
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,611
We had a great discussion.

307
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,691
And I understand his frustration.

308
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,412
But we are where we are.

309
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,443
So I thought I'd share another happy Medford story with everybody.

310
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:52,826
And I know that council bears.

311
00:19:53,266 --> 00:20:00,573
I know that he sent you have some administration, they sent some some messages to the city council.

312
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,274
Do you have that?

313
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:01,955
Do you want me to read it?

314
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,576
I can read it.

315
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:02,976
All right.

316
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:03,336
Thank you.

317
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,500
And I also have the message here.

318
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,781
And I do want to note that.

319
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:13,125
We did have some of this discussion last budget season.

320
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:19,492
We voted down the retained earnings to make sure that that funding was going to address infrastructure needs.

321
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,715
That was the 1st time in a long time that that had happened.

322
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,897
But we do have this response from.

323
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:26,024
Commissioner McGivern.

324
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:28,386
It's dated April 11th.

325
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:34,832
As you know, Dan Stone King, our former water superintendent, decided to leave the city of Medford for what he felt was a better opportunity.

326
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:40,556
Dan was a valuable member of the DPW leadership team and contributed significant improvements to the water and sewer division.

327
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:46,742
Dan's presentation of the state of the city's water system did not provide you with information on what steps and plans that the DPW

328
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,565
with the support of the mayor have already taken to address our aging water system.

329
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,668
His letter unfortunately only focused on issues he felt were not getting enough attention.

330
00:20:54,688 --> 00:21:02,675
It is worth balancing the minimal information he provided with a summary of actions that have taken place since I've been appointed leader of the DPW and before as city engineer.

331
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:11,062
It is important to highlight that the City of Medford purchases water from the MWRA and was responsible for distributing it to the ratepayers through a system of pipes, valves and meters.

332
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:16,407
As part of this distribution, we regularly provide water quality testing to demonstrate the safety of our distribution system.

333
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:21,671
The latest published information on Medford's water quality can be found at the MWRA website linked below.

334
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:30,219
This site is updated regularly with our testing information and ratepayers also receive a consumer confidence report from the MWRA in June that provides greater detail.

335
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:36,373
The web address is www.mwra.com, annual, water report, 2022 results, pdf, medford.pdf.

336
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:53,241
The city of Medford experienced a huge surge of roadway building and building development in the early part of the 20th century, so many of our water distribution pipes installed at that time were nearing the expected lifetime age of 75 to 100 years, with some lasting 120 years.

337
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:58,884
Knowing this fact, we completed an evaluation of our utility assets in 2020 when I was city engineer.

338
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:05,447
This study included, among other things, identifying the age, material, and quantity of our water distribution pipes based on the city's records.

339
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:08,688
This allowed the DPW to understand the needs of our water system,

340
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,889
and helped us identify steps to prepare for an increase in water main replacements throughout the city.

341
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:24,934
When I became commissioner, we had recently suffered the loss of our longtime water superintendent, Dave Proctor, and I was tasked with finding a new person who could help us improve our water operations, assess our capital needs, and lead new initiatives to prepare

342
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,476
for increasing our capacity to replace our aging water mains.

343
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:33,079
Mr. Stone King helped the DPW prepare a strategy that started in the 2024 budget.

344
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:42,185
The goal of the strategy is to increase in-house and contracted water main relay capacity and align the development of the DPW capital improvement project to the needs of the system.

345
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:50,312
We met with Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern in April of 2023 to discuss the strategy and steps we believe needed to be addressed in the FY24 budget.

346
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:57,078
This resulted in the mayor beginning to formulate a communication plan, which is under development, as well as additions to the water and sewer operating budget.

347
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:05,286
These additions included a water supervisor position with an additional water quality coordinator and a deputy commissioner to oversee the operations of DPW.

348
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:14,109
The water supervisor proposition is in front of you tonight to increase the compensation scale as it has been a significant challenge to attract a qualified candidate at the current scale.

349
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,612
We also included a plan to engage a consultant to help us develop a long-term rate study and indirect cost study.

350
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:22,393
We are currently working on these studies with Weston and Sampson.

351
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:27,135
These studies are critical to inform important decisions the City of Medford will need to make in the coming years.

352
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:35,118
The rate study will assess the needs of the system, contribute to the development of our capital project list, and identify rate and funding scenarios for a 10-year period.

353
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:39,560
This information is critical to the long-term health and performance of our water distribution system.

354
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:47,184
Both the utility asset evaluation as well as the long-term rate study are actions that the city had not done before, which presents its own unique challenge.

355
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:55,729
We've also pursued initiatives that support these efforts, such as a hydraulic modeling of our entire system and developing a unidirectional regular flushing program.

356
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:03,232
The hydraulic modeling will help identify the cause of pressure or flow issues within the system, so those issues can be incorporated into capital projects.

357
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:09,595
There are also new initiatives related to our service lines, which are in response to new regulations that will go into effect later this year.

358
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,497
One of these initiatives is a lead service ordinance, which you'll be hearing more about shortly.

359
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:20,061
It's worth noting that this letter only summarizes the work taking place for us to prepare us for replacing our aging water infrastructure.

360
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:25,165
We also have aging pavement infrastructure, which must be coordinated with the water infrastructure work.

361
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:29,168
As you know, these infrastructure assets are not the only ones that need more attention in Medford.

362
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:40,817
since proper asset management is costly over many years, it is critically important that we work together to evaluate, prepare, and execute projects as we march towards having systems and funding in place for long-term infrastructure performance.

363
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:50,145
In closing, we certainly have a lot of work to do with our water system, but we are taking the proper steps to plan for increasing the length of water main we replace each year and increasing the water quality.

364
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:55,470
This will take time, and effective partnerships between the mayor, city council, and DPW will be critical.

365
00:24:56,718 --> 00:25:08,961
That is Mr McGivern's letter, and I will note that Mr. McGivern did answer many questions on this in the last budget, including the scope of the problem being $500 million to $1 billion long-term problem.

366
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:12,481
So that was discussed a year ago in the budget season.

367
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:23,984
I also met with Mr. Stone King and Mr. McGivern around the proposed lead service ordinance last year, and we had discussions along the lines, basically, of what Mr. McGivern just put out in this report.

368
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:35,271
And I was also asking many of the same questions that Mr McGivern was asking here, that Mr. Stoneking was asking in his letter of the mayor, which is, when are we going to know the scope and scale of this?

369
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:42,616
And they said, basically, we need the long term rate study in place now that we have looked at the, we know what our assets are.

370
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:44,357
There wasn't even an asset inventory in 2020.

371
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:45,378
That exists now.

372
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:58,782
we now we need the long term rate study to go back and say, this is what it's going to cost in the long term to rate payers to fix the system, which I think both in the last budget season and in that meeting that I had, they referred to as one of the three oldest systems in the state.

373
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,002
So that is where we are at.

374
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,764
And that is the letter from Mr. McGiven.

375
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:07,164
If I can, Mr. President.

376
00:26:07,764 --> 00:26:11,005
Councillor Scarpelli, and then Councillor Callahan, and then Vice President Collins.

377
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:13,846
I appreciate Director McGiven.

378
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:19,582
But to my fellow councillors, is this not a theme that we see?

379
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:32,972
City Hall needs to be done, we're gonna set up a committee, we're gonna look at development, we're gonna set a consultant, we're gonna look into things.

380
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:38,296
Everything is, just like Ms.

381
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,158
Stoneking said to me, it's all talk.

382
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:51,661
This is a director of DPW speaking for his boss, who's over and over again shown that nothing's getting done, zero.

383
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,942
We're not getting anything done.

384
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:57,506
We talk about multi-million dollar issues, that we had it right in our hand.

385
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,187
We had millions of dollars.

386
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:07,193
When ARPA came out, that we could still use for infrastructure needs, that we did nothing, zero.

387
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:09,355
But again,

388
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:14,251
Mr. Stonekirk writes this letter, I put it on as a resolution, what happens?

389
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:26,296
The position that hasn't gotten any movement for months comes to us tonight for a change in CAF so we can raise it, so we can get better, we can entice people to come out now, right?

390
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,318
So this is exactly what we're seeing.

391
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:31,975
What's that saying?

392
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,856
It's a dog wagging its tail.

393
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:36,496
What's that state?

394
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,477
The tail wagging its dog.

395
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:38,977
Tail wagging its dog, exactly.

396
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,377
And this is what I feel.

397
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:46,119
Honestly, sometimes it's like watching a dog chase its tail with this administration.

398
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:54,320
So we've known since the mayor's been in 2020 that we've had a huge issue here and that it was compiling.

399
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,081
But now all of a sudden,

400
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:01,942
in her 50 years, we're gonna now go into this, right?

401
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:12,890
I wish you put together a pilot program or a committee like she did with the finance, with the water department that April as well, and maybe we can get something going, but we still have seen nothing.

402
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,431
We're still seeing nothing.

403
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:17,993
This still doesn't do us any, it doesn't do anybody any good.

404
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,295
So again, I appreciate

405
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:32,661
The answer, but it just only leads to the same old lack of leadership and the same old destructing, destroyed Medford that has nothing moving forward.

406
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:33,583
So thank you.

407
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:34,865
Thank you.

408
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:38,008
We also had this from the director of communications.

409
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:39,730
Steve Smurdy.

410
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,510
Hello, counselors.

411
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,815
I want to provide some additional information regarding the city's ARPA allocations for water and sewer projects.

412
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:52,060
Since the fall of 2021, the city has invested over 4 million in 13 projects that address critical water infrastructure needs.

413
00:28:52,621 --> 00:29:01,769
Among those projects are sewer system lining, sealing and testing, DPW water meter system replacement project, lead service line replacement rebate program, infiltration and inflow

414
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:08,072
infiltration and inflow control plan, rights upon dam maintenance, Winthrop Street water main replacement.

415
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:21,798
In addition to strengthening our water sewer system, the mayor has been working with City Engineer Wartella and DPW Commissioner McGibbon to address the over 100 million backlog in street repairs due to neglect over the past few decades by identifying projects that were close to beginning construction.

416
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:26,680
The administration was able to deploy ARPA funding across multiple road infrastructure projects including

417
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:36,286
patchwork on 34 streets identified in the pavement assessment, intersection improvements at Spring Street and Central Avenue, Pinker Street Roadway and utility construction.

418
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:43,811
The mayor is also hoping to allocate $1 million in ARPA funding to continue the repair work of the city's sidewalks, as well as additional tree stump removals in 2024.

419
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:56,400
You can read more about the work already done on sidewalks and stumps on the city website, and you can view a full list of projects, as well as a dive deeper into project descriptions by visiting the city website medfordma.org.

420
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,663
slash department slash finance slash ARPA.

421
00:30:01,545 --> 00:30:02,126
Councilor Kelly.

422
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:03,207
Thank you.

423
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:07,012
So to me, these letters were a

424
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:31,237
quite frightening reminder that our water pipes are 100 years old, almost older than any other city, and that instead of over the decades spending the money that came in through our water system on the water system and replacing these pipes for decades, that that money went into the general fund.

425
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:32,938
and was spent on other things.

426
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:37,720
And so we have, for decades, not improved our water system.

427
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:47,745
We have, for decades, not improved our roads, which is why that 49% of our roads as of 2021, hard to know whether that's improved or gotten worse.

428
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:51,954
probably has gotten worse.

429
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,958
49% of our roads are in the worst two classes of roads out of five.

430
00:30:57,098 --> 00:31:00,821
That's the most expensive kinds to replace, to repair.

431
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:06,626
Our schools, which are 20 years old, have not been properly maintained for the last 20 years.

432
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:18,676
Salaries, and we talk about the salary of this particular position in the water department, but salaries across the city are not commensurate with other cities.

433
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,770
So we can't find people to fill a lot of positions.

434
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,910
It's not just that position.

435
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:26,792
There are a lot of positions we cannot find people to fill.

436
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:39,421
Previous administrations have been like 30, 40 years ago were given a city in pretty good shape and did not do the repairs that were needed.

437
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:45,586
And that has left us in a position that I'm really, they've kicked the can down the road.

438
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:50,168
And I'm trying to understand what kind of management style it would make up for.

439
00:31:50,188 --> 00:32:04,034
I mean, if $500 million is the amount to repair our water system, and we know that it's $100 million probably or more to repair the roads, get the roads back into shape, there isn't a style of management that can

440
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,379
magically make that money up here.

441
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:22,302
My thing about the management is not that I'm making any kind of statement, but my statement is about the funding that we have to do the absolute basics necessary for a city to function.

442
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:25,463
You cannot have water pipes that function.

443
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:27,903
You do not have a city, functional city.

444
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:28,984
You don't have roads.

445
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:30,524
These are the basics.

446
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:34,306
And this isn't purely the fault of this mayor.

447
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:48,656
This is something that we have kicked the can down the road for many decades until we find ourselves by doing things that were financially irresponsible, but were made taxpayers happy.

448
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:58,924
And now we're in a position where we have had that situation going on for so long that we're going straight off a cliff.

449
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:15,952
I talked to some of the engineering folks about the water systems, and they said, oh, you know, there is money coming into the water system that we can use to repair it.

450
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:19,254
But of course, that money used to go to other things.

451
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:23,057
That money has always come in, and it used to go to the general fund.

452
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:26,819
So now that money isn't going to be going to the things that it used to go to.

453
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,360
So those things will go down.

454
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:36,626
There is not enough funding to take care of the financial irresponsibility of former administrations and former city councils.

455
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:45,633
really administrations because the state councils do not have do not have hardly any effect on the budget because it's really up in the hands of the mayor.

456
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:47,934
I just want to clarify one thing.

457
00:33:48,334 --> 00:34:04,725
The common practice, as far as I was aware, was that funds that were called retained earnings, which were surplus funds gathered by rate payers in the enterprise fund that funds water and sewer, that those funds were returned to rate payers to keep rates low.

458
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,386
So it wasn't that they were in the general fund.

459
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:11,089
It's that the council, the mayor requested, the mayor, excuse me, thank you.

460
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:12,430
Thank you, please.

461
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,191
I don't want to get into this again tonight.

462
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:14,811
Thank you very much.

463
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:28,534
The council, many mayors and many councils, mayors recommended, water and sewer commissions recommended, and councils voted to return retained earnings to taxpayers on the orders of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars every year.

464
00:34:29,816 --> 00:34:32,399
And those are funds that could have gone to maintenance of the system.

465
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,982
Vice President, that's just the facts, thank you.

466
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:36,203
Vice President Collins.

467
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:40,019
Thank you, President Behrs and Councilor Scarpelli.

468
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,302
I think it's a good idea for us to have this discussion, you know, to use the word from your resolution.

469
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,503
We know we're coming up on budget.

470
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:50,244
Please don't shout from the crowd.

471
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:50,664
Thank you.

472
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,005
Please don't shout from the crowd.

473
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:52,345
Thank you.

474
00:34:54,206 --> 00:34:55,246
Please don't shout from the crowd.

475
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:55,607
Thank you.

476
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,168
Please don't shout from the crowd.

477
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:58,908
Thank you.

478
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:01,349
Thank you.

479
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:03,190
I frequently need a reminder to talk louder.

480
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,750
I appreciate it.

481
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,252
No, you shouldn't be shouting from the crowd.

482
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:06,592
Thank you.

483
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,569
but I know I'm not loud enough to talk over people.

484
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:21,052
Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate the resolution to discuss the water and sewer department, especially as we're coming right up on budget season.

485
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:28,955
This is a conversation that we're going to have anyway, and as other councilors have noted, this is a conversation that we've had every year in the past two budget cycles that I have been a part of.

486
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:37,057
you know, this is a, this has been raised as a multi-million dollar issue.

487
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:50,740
We know that it will take multi-millions of dollars to make good on this investment, to bring ourselves out of the rear of all cities and towns in Massachusetts when it comes to our water infrastructure.

488
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:57,181
I believe that Commissioner McGibbon told us during our budget hearing last year that we're one of the

489
00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:01,559
The three cities with the oldest water infrastructure in the state.

490
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,743
That's that's not a

491
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:07,745
end of the ladder that any of us want to be on.

492
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:11,647
And we know that this is multi-millions of dollars in the fixing.

493
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,908
This is many decades in the making.

494
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:30,195
One thing that I do find heartening from the letters from the administration, from letters from current and former members of DPW leadership that I think is heartening, is that there's a clear mutual respect from Commissioner McGivern and former Superintendent Stoneking.

495
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,016
That mutual respect within the DPW leadership

496
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:43,495
you know, and knowing that this is a shared priority between the DPW, between the City Council, between the administration, we know that we need to look for

497
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,496
We need to look for assets wherever we can find them with this big of an infrastructural project ahead of us.

498
00:36:52,639 --> 00:37:00,988
As was stated earlier, we were the first council to vote to keep retained earnings within the Water and Sewer Department so that it could go towards funding infrastructure repairs and improvements.

499
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,413
Obviously that is a small first step.

500
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:07,687
we have a ways to go.

501
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:18,793
I am glad for any steps in the right direction that were taken by ARPA, that were taken by Superintendent Stone King during his tenure, and that I know that Commissioner McGivern is working hard on every day.

502
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:31,140
And I think it is one of the things that rang most loudly for me from Commissioner McGivern's letter to the city council was that all of these major infrastructural efforts

503
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:37,402
between bringing our water infrastructure up to par and our roads infrastructure up to par.

504
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:42,364
You know, we got at least 500 million on the water side.

505
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:48,526
I believe it's maybe even at least 200 million if we really wanna get every road where we know residents want them.

506
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:56,448
These things have to be done in concert, be done efficiently to make sure that we're making the best use of every dollar because we have to use so many of them.

507
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:00,349
Last point I wanna make for now, I did,

508
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:10,828
Commissioner given noted the most recent report from the M. W. R. A. On the state of Medford sweater, which is from 2021 in his letter to the City Council.

509
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,209
I did follow that read through it.

510
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:17,892
I think that it's worth noting that when it comes to when it comes to our water infrastructure.

511
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:23,549
We know, because everybody has cited, that some of our pipes are 120 years old.

512
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,852
We also know that the most recent report from the MWRA is that our drinking water is safe.

513
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:33,677
And we also know that we have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure that it stays that way without interruption for all future generations.

514
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:34,337
Thank you.

515
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:36,579
Thank you.

516
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,180
Any further comment by members of the Council?

517
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:40,202
Councillor Sang?

518
00:38:41,061 --> 00:38:46,285
very briefly because I think a lot of what I would say has been covered by the three councillors who've spoken.

519
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:48,986
I think, you know,

520
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:58,440
When past administrations were looking at the water infrastructure in the city, it was easy, since everything was built around the same time, to say that we didn't need to make these investments.

521
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:06,425
But we always do need a longer-term outlook about how we're going to fund projects, even decades in the future.

522
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:11,708
It was disappointing, and it is disappointing to us that that wasn't done decades prior.

523
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:19,474
But it is, I think, a good step for us to start with that study about the rates going forward, because

524
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:20,194
that.

525
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:25,459
Such a large scale of infrastructure improvement will need a lot of communication with our residents.

526
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:33,786
And if you know, and I think it's becoming clear through this discussion through discussions in the past during the budget seasons that.

527
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,628
Money is a huge factor here.

528
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:40,291
And so if money is a big question here, we need to

529
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:46,219
something like that rate study is important.

530
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,649
Now, another thing can also be true that I think Councillor Scarpelli raised.

531
00:39:52,881 --> 00:39:59,086
we need better follow through on these reports, on these committees that are created from the administration.

532
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:06,331
For example, the classification study is something that we still haven't seen over years.

533
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,752
We were promised this years ago.

534
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:15,538
And that's something that affects the items on our agenda, like the CAF amendment.

535
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,962
to the superintendent of water role.

536
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:21,664
We need to follow up on these things.

537
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:24,506
Now as a city council, I think we've done better.

538
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:34,175
I think we've worked together, especially Councilor Scarpelli and us, we've worked together to push the administration to keep them accountable on those issues.

539
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:35,817
We need to keep doing that.

540
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:44,765
We need to keep making the historic investments that we haven't been making as a city council that we made for the first time last year in the water system.

541
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,427
And I think that's very, very clear.

542
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:48,489
I know there's lots to be said.

543
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,831
There's this is a very complex issue.

544
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,512
I think.

545
00:40:52,052 --> 00:40:59,954
a commission to begin Burns letter does actually point to a lot of substantive steps being taken in terms of, um, physical improvements to the system.

546
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:07,916
Um, not just the monetary side of things, but there's lots of follow through to, uh, to for us to hold to account.

547
00:41:11,156 --> 00:41:13,317
Thank you, Councilor saying any further comments from members of the council.

548
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:17,858
Seeing none of their emotion on the floor.

549
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:22,256
Vice President Collins, Councillor Scarpelli.

550
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:37,387
Motion to receive and place on file by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins.

551
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,409
Is there any public participation on the matter?

552
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,690
I see one hand on Zoom and one person in the chamber.

553
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,532
We'll go to the chamber first.

554
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:45,033
Name and address for the record, please.

555
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,015
Yes, sir.

556
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:47,456
Robert Jones, 5 St.

557
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:49,818
Mary Street.

558
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:51,619
I'm a little confused at this point.

559
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,863
The water sewer account is an enterprise fund.

560
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,724
You touched upon it, President Beas.

561
00:41:57,904 --> 00:41:58,564
Yes.

562
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:06,190
Which means that for anybody that doesn't know, the receipts of the water and sewer bills go into an enterprise fund.

563
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,533
It's a separate fund, and it has to be used for that purpose.

564
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,096
traditionally, we've had a surplus.

565
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:22,484
I don't recall at all that we talked about sending the excess back to the ratepayers, but it's an account that traditionally runs at a surplus.

566
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:27,067
So I'm not sure why we haven't been reinvesting that into the system where it should be.

567
00:42:28,168 --> 00:42:31,130
And Councilor Scott Pelli touched on something else.

568
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:39,276
We do studies, we do scope of work, we hire consultants, we do everything but actually fix the problem.

569
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:49,374
I've heard about all these plans and other studies that, but not actually replacing the pipe.

570
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:53,640
Sounds like we had a good guy that just got frustrated and left.

571
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:55,809
We need to actually do the work.

572
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:57,311
The city is famous for it.

573
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:01,735
When you have something, you need to update it and maintain it, or it's going to break down.

574
00:43:02,075 --> 00:43:03,837
We should have been doing that throughout the years.

575
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,159
Now we can do it a little bit at a time.

576
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,822
Take the surplus every year, replace the pipe.

577
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:10,844
I don't think we need another consultant study.

578
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:11,665
Thank you.

579
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:12,886
Thank you.

580
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:14,968
Go to Maureen on Zoom.

581
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,850
Name and address for the record, please.

582
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,390
Maureen.

583
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:22,962
Maureen Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.

584
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:33,567
This is an issue that's close to my heart because I've been in health care my whole entire life, and this is a serious health care issue.

585
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:53,816
And there's been lots of discussion about how for many years, I actually heard the word decades now, the city of Medford administration and city council has been aware that there's a major infrastructure problem regarding water and sewer.

586
00:43:55,357 --> 00:44:00,658
I've never received any money back on my taxes on my water and sewer bill.

587
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:04,444
but they go up every year.

588
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:09,646
So could someone address where that money is going?

589
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:24,091
And second of all, is there a committee or a formal arrangement between the mayor and other committees to look at

590
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:35,835
sources such as state funding or as federal funding because I feel that we're on the edge of the slippery slope here.

591
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:44,282
I've heard four or five times tonight the MWRA has tested our water and said that it's safe.

592
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:49,986
What if the next time they test it, it is not safe?

593
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:52,208
I'd like some answers please.

594
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:53,309
Thank you very much.

595
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:56,608
Thank you, Maureen.

596
00:44:56,628 --> 00:45:00,035
Name and address for the record, please.

597
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,415
Donna Silva, 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway.

598
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,977
I have a photo which I'd like to show.

599
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,879
I don't know how to, can we show this?

600
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,621
Zach, can you put this up on?

601
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,902
If you email it to me, I can probably put it up.

602
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,806
Okay, well, I'm gonna turn it here, and I don't know if you can see it.

603
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:21,267
So can the council see it?

604
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:25,490
These are my filters on my water system.

605
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,074
I have a house system, a home water system, and two filters.

606
00:45:31,434 --> 00:45:32,875
They're supposed to last six months.

607
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:34,755
This is what your kids are drinking.

608
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,616
This is what they're drinking.

609
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:39,517
This is what you're drinking, okay?

610
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:40,958
They're black.

611
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:42,318
Well, I shouldn't say that.

612
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:44,059
They're not black, they're dark brown.

613
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,579
And that's only three months.

614
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,061
And the one on the other side is only one month.

615
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:56,944
So when they say the water is safe, I don't understand that.

616
00:45:59,551 --> 00:45:59,851
Do you?

617
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:00,832
Anybody?

618
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:02,194
Yes, I don't.

619
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:03,876
The water is not safe.

620
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:04,556
Can you see this?

621
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:06,839
I mean, I can't speak to the filters.

622
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:08,901
The MWRA tests the water.

623
00:46:10,363 --> 00:46:11,263
They determine that it's safe.

624
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:12,244
They test the water.

625
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:20,807
So maybe 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway, maybe we have bad pipes on my street.

626
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:29,811
When I called the city, what they told me to do, that they were going to do, is they were going to open one of the fire hydrants.

627
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,872
And by doing that, it would push the water through.

628
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:39,155
But then I was told that we were at the end, so it was a dead zone, which then they said, no, it wasn't.

629
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,317
and that the water would flood through.

630
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:42,778
It hasn't changed.

631
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:44,460
I've had this system for years.

632
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,444
It's gross, isn't it?

633
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,545
I know I saw your face.

634
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:48,925
Gross.

635
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:49,566
Gross.

636
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:50,367
That's what we drink.

637
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,228
That's what we drink.

638
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:56,253
So if the MWRA wants to say our water is fine,

639
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:58,147
And we wanna believe it?

640
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:00,248
Okay, I don't.

641
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:03,528
So I spent a few thousand dollars to put the system in.

642
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:08,970
Well, not really, it wasn't that much money, but with the filters buying them all the time, I'm probably up to that by now.

643
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,091
And I have a reverse osmosis system for my drinking water.

644
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:15,611
And I advise that if you can afford it, to do it.

645
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:17,692
Thank you.

646
00:47:18,192 --> 00:47:18,512
Thank you.

647
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,020
Any further comment?

648
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,141
Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record, please.

649
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:26,604
Yes, Andrew Castaneda, Cushin Street, Medford, Mass.

650
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:34,630
I just heard that Asian water pipes are over 100 years old, I believe.

651
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,852
Between 75 and 120 are many of the water pipes.

652
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,673
I believe Boston is even older.

653
00:47:41,454 --> 00:47:43,256
I don't think they've replaced all their pipes.

654
00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:52,764
And someone spoke and said it would cost like a half a billion dollars to replace all the new water pipes with new water pipes.

655
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:58,870
I mean, how many overrides or dead exclusions would that take?

656
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,972
It would be more than a half a billion.

657
00:48:00,992 --> 00:48:06,397
As a matter of fact, I think as we go now, if it ain't bust, don't fix it.

658
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:09,019
And we just repair when there's a leak.

659
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,364
I don't know of anyone that's not having access to fresh water, whether it's polluted or not, I have no clue.

660
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:19,427
But it seems like, I never heard a complaint from anyone, and I talked to a lot of people.

661
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:21,649
They seem to, everybody seems to have water.

662
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:31,377
And I would like to see the potholes filled from the Crystal Campbell fountain, which ain't working, the day after Patriots Day, after many years.

663
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:43,057
going from right there on Riverside Ave going towards Route 93, I have to negotiate five or six bad potholes.

664
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:52,826
I think we should just concentrate, first of all, on the potholes, or as Councilor DelaRusso called them, potholers.

665
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:55,688
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

666
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,351
Any further discussion?

667
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:03,944
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Collins, to receive and place on file.

668
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,104
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

669
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,146
Councillor CUMMING.

670
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:17,386
Yes.

671
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:20,107
Vice President Collins.

672
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:20,407
Yes.

673
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,108
Councillor Lozano.

674
00:49:23,368 --> 00:49:23,608
Yes.

675
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:25,708
Councillor Lemming.

676
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:26,728
Yes.

677
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,289
Councillor Scarpelli.

678
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:29,409
Yes.

679
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:31,888
Councilor Sang?

680
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:32,048
Yes.

681
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:33,849
President Beers?

682
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:36,170
Yes, I'm in affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

683
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:37,891
President Beers?

684
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:39,072
24-076 offered by Councilor Sperpelli.

685
00:49:39,092 --> 00:49:40,833
President Beers?

686
00:49:40,913 --> 00:49:41,954
Yes, Vice President Collins.

687
00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:43,255
I apologize for interrupting.

688
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,337
I would like to motion to take public participation out of order.

689
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:50,740
I understand we have a member of the audience who can't stay very late, but would like to speak during public participation.

690
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,585
Sure, public participation on the motion of Vice President Collins to take public participation, seconded by?

691
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,080
Councillor Saing, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

692
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,864
Councillor Callaghan?

693
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:09,164
Yes.

694
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:11,405
Vice President Collins?

695
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:11,645
Yes.

696
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:13,607
Councillor Lazzaro?

697
00:50:13,787 --> 00:50:14,067
Yes.

698
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:15,868
Councillor Fleming?

699
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:16,908
Yes.

700
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,190
Councillor Scapelli?

701
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:19,310
Yes.

702
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,890
Councilor saying President bears.

703
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:23,271
Yes 74.

704
00:50:23,391 --> 00:50:25,834
Another negative motion passes public participation.

705
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:29,539
We received two public comment emails and I'm also vice president Collins.

706
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,562
If you have someone who'd like to speak in public participation.

707
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:32,984
Thank you, President bears.

708
00:50:33,004 --> 00:50:35,848
I was informed that there's a former member of the council who would like to speak.

709
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:36,769
Sure.

710
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,788
Mr. President, members of the council.

711
00:50:57,948 --> 00:50:58,328
Welcome.

712
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:07,652
I'm a little bit jealous, a lot jealous, because at one time I sat in one of those seats for eight years, but now no one even knows my name, not even me.

713
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:16,696
But anyway, I'm here tonight because I had the opportunity when I was in politics

714
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:26,278
To serve with Jack McGlynn in the legislature and to serve with Jack McGlynn, we both had simultaneous elections to serve up here in the city council.

715
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:32,822
Both were distinct honors for me, and I'm very proud of my service to the city of Medford.

716
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:40,868
I apologize for my dress today, but I haven't been well, and I sort of had to come out of the bed to get here.

717
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:43,690
But Jack McGlynn,

718
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:50,685
was a member of the Ghost Army, the so-called Ghost Army.

719
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:59,311
They would be over here and they would be making noises from over there to try to make the Germans know that they were around.

720
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:02,233
Jacques Moulin never mentioned that to me.

721
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:04,074
He never mentioned it at all.

722
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:11,159
I knew him for 30, 40 years, but he never said I was in the service and I was in the Ghost Army.

723
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,101
It was a ghost service to me.

724
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:21,127
So I'm here to let you know that all heroes don't come from afar, from distance.

725
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,428
Some of our heroes live right amongst us.

726
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:30,891
I haven't spoken in this council chamber for over 40 years, close to 40 years anyway.

727
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:36,713
And I'm so proud that I had the opportunity to serve with an honorable man.

728
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:40,155
I sometimes didn't disagree with Jack McClain.

729
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:42,568
I wouldn't agree with all of you.

730
00:52:42,588 --> 00:52:46,649
I wouldn't agree with myself again if I had the opportunity to go back.

731
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,730
But he kept his nose clean.

732
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:52,930
He was an honorable man.

733
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:58,971
He played it close to the vest, and I was more outspoken, I guess.

734
00:53:02,132 --> 00:53:06,293
But don't look too far to see who your heroes are.

735
00:53:06,813 --> 00:53:08,853
They live on Lapham Street on Costello.

736
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:13,473
Jack McGlynn was a true American hero.

737
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:15,113
He served in the war.

738
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:17,814
I think I'm getting choked up here.

739
00:53:19,054 --> 00:53:21,435
That ghost army was really something to think about.

740
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:29,957
What heroes they were making noise over here to get the Germans to come and look when they were really over here.

741
00:53:32,398 --> 00:53:37,539
I am not going to take much of your time just to let you know that I think that

742
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,160
We are very honored to have such a decent man in our midst.

743
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,621
And his wife was terrific.

744
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:47,585
Helen, I used to call her the first lady of Medford all the time.

745
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:48,986
She was terrific.

746
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:53,850
Jack McGlynn was an honorable man, even though I didn't sometimes agree with him.

747
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,112
Maybe I wasn't so honorable, I don't know.

748
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,616
But you ought to be so proud to be sitting in those seats.

749
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:06,923
I look back at my days in the legislature and my days sitting over there with great pride.

750
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:12,789
When the people of the city vote for you and say, take care of our business, that really means something.

751
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,351
It means they trust you.

752
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:17,935
It means they want you to do the right thing by them.

753
00:54:19,577 --> 00:54:20,398
And I'm sure you will.

754
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:25,860
It was an honor to sit here, it's an honor to speak here tonight.

755
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:34,204
I'm not gonna take any more of your time, except to let you know that I feel that sometimes honorable people don't get mentioned enough.

756
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:38,146
Jack Wicklin was an honorable man, whether I agreed with him or not.

757
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:42,328
Agreeing with me didn't make you honorable or dishonorable.

758
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,049
It meant that we just agreed or we didn't agree.

759
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,151
But in those days, seats were different.

760
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,880
The council has changed.

761
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:54,821
They had pews over here, rows.

762
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,282
And I wish they were back, to be very frank.

763
00:54:58,182 --> 00:54:59,022
I wish they were back.

764
00:55:01,523 --> 00:55:05,744
I don't know what else to say, but I hate to give this microphone up after all these years.

765
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:10,466
I'm not going to give it up.

766
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:13,466
I want to take it with me.

767
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:14,147
Well.

768
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:19,658
When you get elected, that's an honor.

769
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:20,318
It really is.

770
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:21,018
Think about it.

771
00:55:21,498 --> 00:55:31,261
Think about the thousands of people who put their necks beside your name because they wanted you to be here speaking for them and not listening to Kavanaugh.

772
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:39,803
But I enjoyed my days here, and I enjoyed my days in the legislature, and I enjoyed being a representative of the people.

773
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:42,286
And I'm sure that you all do also.

774
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:44,351
So with that, I'm out of here.

775
00:55:45,032 --> 00:55:46,155
See you in 40 years again.

776
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,698
Thank you very much.

777
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:49,021
If I can, Mr. President.

778
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:23,426
Yeah, if I can, Judge Kavanaugh, if you can, if you honor me just for a moment, it takes a great man to know a great man.

779
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:27,247
So I think that it's important that Medford knows that.

780
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:44,672
You know, talk about a legend.

781
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:49,395
He's uh Judge Kavanaugh is is uh someone we should all be proud of.

782
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:53,999
So, sometimes what he just said, sometimes I get offended now.

783
00:56:54,039 --> 00:57:01,845
Some of my behavior sometimes when you have honorable people like that approach the bench and um I remember as a young man,

784
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:11,429
to speak on behalf of another great man.

785
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:20,451
We're losing our heroes, and the gentleman who's leaving the chamber right now is one of those people, so we should give him what he deserves.

786
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:22,051
Thank you.

787
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,392
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

788
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:38,913
the first person I canvassed this summer.

789
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,134
I went to his house, and he was the first person I spoke to.

790
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:45,356
And he gave me really, really good advice.

791
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:48,277
He said to make sure that you earn votes.

792
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:50,778
You don't just ask for them, you have to earn them.

793
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:52,679
So I appreciated that.

794
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:53,840
We had a nice chat.

795
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,340
Thank you, Councillor Zara.

796
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,301
I appreciate you being here.

797
00:57:58,027 --> 00:58:24,200
And just for folks watching and to note once again what Judge Kavanaugh was saying, we did dedicate and commemorate our last meeting in honor of Jack McGlynn and his service in the Ghost Army, which as folks can look up online, was made up of a few thousand folks who looked like 50,000 and made the German Nazi armies.

798
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:34,402
think that there were mass mobilizations in one place or the other, but they had tanks, blow up tanks, and there was a signal core sending false radio transmissions.

799
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:36,063
It's impressive.

800
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:47,547
And I'll just reiterate my favorite anecdote from that was when Mayor Mike McGlynn, Jack McGlynn's son, got a call from a newspaper after some documents had been declassified in the 1990s.

801
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:53,970
And he called his dad and he said, dad, what's this ghost army that they called about?

802
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,131
The newspaper's calling, he said, who called you about that?

803
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:03,995
He wanted to call the Pentagon and make sure that there hadn't been a leak of classified information.

804
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,995
He hadn't told his own son 50 years later.

805
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:10,197
And I think that speaks to the humility of that role.

806
00:59:10,237 --> 00:59:16,020
And they were honored with the, excuse me, they were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal, that entire unit, all the units.

807
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:24,061
Public participation, is there anyone else who would like to participate for public participation in the chambers?

808
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:29,103
Just in general, there is, of course, participation on the additional items on the agenda.

809
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:33,564
Seeing none of the chambers, we do have one on Zoom.

810
00:59:33,624 --> 00:59:35,505
I see a hand, Bill Giglio.

811
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:38,766
Name and address for the record, please.

812
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:41,547
Hi, Bill Giglio, Winterspeed.

813
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:42,948
I just have three very quick things.

814
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:47,671
I didn't get my hand raised quick enough on the first resolution about the pet therapy.

815
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:50,173
That's really, really, really good thing.

816
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:51,374
It's worked for me in the past.

817
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:54,416
And I've known it to work for a lot of people.

818
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:55,677
And that's a really great thing.

819
00:59:55,697 --> 00:59:56,918
So I appreciate you putting that through.

820
00:59:57,978 --> 01:00:11,223
Second, Winter Street was freshly repaved about, I don't know, a year or so ago, and parts of it, especially where I live down by the high school, are already being dug up, and it's being patched, and now it obviously already looks horrible.

821
01:00:11,243 --> 01:00:13,104
Does anybody happen to know what's going on?

822
01:00:13,144 --> 01:00:16,845
I know you might not know what's going on, but does anybody happen to know why it's being dug up already?

823
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:26,161
I don't know why, but I do know that under the city's rules, any reopenings within five years of a repaving require curb-to-curb repaving.

824
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:30,945
So if you want to email me, let me know where that's being temporarily patched.

825
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:37,911
I can let you know when their plans are to do a full curb-to-curb repaving, because that is the city rule on that.

826
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:39,610
Okay, that's great.

827
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:40,111
Thank you very much.

828
01:00:40,572 --> 01:00:46,439
And also getting back I know on the first thing on the on the body cams from earlier.

829
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,261
It was a very good meeting.

830
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:52,267
I just want to say, Chief Buckley put on a great presentation very thorough.

831
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:55,351
Unfortunately, at the end he got he got bombarded.

832
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:56,932
with a bunch of nonsense.

833
01:00:56,992 --> 01:00:59,613
And I just, I honestly think it was unnecessary.

834
01:00:59,713 --> 01:01:02,315
And I would honestly love to see that subcommittee.

835
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,476
I mean, he was visibly upset.

836
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:06,838
He was called a lot of unnecessary things.

837
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:17,104
And I think maybe like an apology, maybe a written apology or some sort of formal apology to Chief Buckley would really be in line, in my personal opinion.

838
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:17,824
Thank you.

839
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:19,032
Thank you.

840
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:19,873
I appreciate that.

841
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:35,805
And I know that members of the committee did speak to the chief after, you know, one of the public participation rules, the most recent Supreme Judicial Court ruling is that we cannot prevent anyone from, we cannot regulate the content of any public participation.

842
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:42,710
So people are able to say whatever they think, other than they can't be swearing or, you know, being vulgar.

843
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,671
But other than that,

844
01:01:44,271 --> 01:02:05,340
We can't regulate the content of what anyone's saying, so while I understand the frustration when public comments may not be what folks want to hear, and I understand the Chief's frustration at public comments that he did not want to hear, the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that people can say what they want to say, and the only rules that we can set are around how long folks have to speak and when they can speak.

845
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:15,403
Well, if they did speak to him after that, I'd like to say I appreciate that, because it was a little, you know, my opinion, a lot of it was uncalled for, and if they spoke to him after, I appreciate that.

846
01:02:15,423 --> 01:02:15,743
Thank you.

847
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:17,364
Thank you very much.

848
01:02:18,746 --> 01:02:22,389
Any further public participation before we resume the agenda?

849
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:29,194
We did have two public comment emails.

850
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:31,616
Is there a motion on the public comment emails to enter them into the record?

851
01:02:31,636 --> 01:02:32,577
So moved.

852
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:38,412
on the motion of Councillor Collins to enter public comment emails into the record, seconded by Councillor Callaghan.

853
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:44,174
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

854
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:49,015
Councillor Callaghan.

855
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:49,415
Yes.

856
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:50,816
Yes.

857
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:53,316
Vice President Collins.

858
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:53,816
Yes.

859
01:02:54,517 --> 01:02:55,717
Councillor Lazaro.

860
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,137
Yes.

861
01:02:57,298 --> 01:02:58,158
Councillor Lemming.

862
01:02:58,738 --> 01:02:59,078
Yes.

863
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:01,479
Councillor Scapelli.

864
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:01,719
Yes.

865
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:03,375
Councilor saying yes.

866
01:03:04,255 --> 01:03:05,056
President beers.

867
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:06,617
Yes, I mean from another negative.

868
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:09,598
Those emails will be included as part of the official record of the meeting.

869
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:25,108
24-076 be resolved by the city council that we requested the city administration provide a full report involving the use of taxpayer dollars being used to fund lawsuit settlements and investigations with city of Medford, active and past employees.

870
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:29,971
Be it further resolved that the city council moved to executive session if needed to discuss sensitive funding information.

871
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:30,912
Councilor Scarpelli.

872
01:03:31,554 --> 01:03:32,454
Thank you, Mr. President.

873
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:38,437
And again, I think that there's a dialogue that's being that's that's created now.

874
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:48,580
And I hope everybody's really watching and listening because we're hearing a lot lately about lack of funding, lack of management, saying it's not mismanagement.

875
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:56,283
But what we're seeing in what the dialogue that I'm trying to show everyone is that

876
01:03:58,131 --> 01:04:04,493
We have rules in this council that any awards over $5,000 have to be approved by this council.

877
01:04:05,414 --> 01:04:14,777
We know of many, multiple, multiple hundreds of thousands of settlements that have been put out there that I've talked to different representatives that we know nothing about.

878
01:04:16,297 --> 01:04:23,240
So anytime we have these issues and we have these issues that come up and questions that come up,

879
01:04:24,522 --> 01:04:26,824
It seems like they're hidden agendas.

880
01:04:27,524 --> 01:04:32,588
We've been asking, for instance, what we paid KP Law since they've been here.

881
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,429
Now we voted on what?

882
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:39,212
$5,000 for a retainer so they can be on staff for the mayor.

883
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:40,433
Well, now that's blown up.

884
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:41,554
Now we don't know what it is.

885
01:04:41,614 --> 01:04:48,879
I know that if it goes by the trend of December, which is close to $80,000 for the month of December, that's pretty frightening.

886
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,122
And that's not including other things we know nothing about.

887
01:04:53,208 --> 01:05:07,820
So I bring this up to ask the mayor, especially before the budget season and before my colleagues asked him that what we're seeing a trend of possibly asking for taxpayers to be penalized for the lack of mismanagement and what we're seeing.

888
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:18,509
When I say lack of mismanagement, we see a mayor speaking for years at debates talking about new growth and development.

889
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:25,899
At the debate with Councilor Caviello, she spoke and saying that we have three projects ready to go that raise millions of dollars.

890
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:27,700
Those projects are gone.

891
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,204
That's why I asked, I asked for the Office of Community Development to come out because we had 40B jobs.

892
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:41,670
Remember we talked about the mismanagement of the 40B jobs and losing over 600 housing units for affordable housing.

893
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:42,740
Right?

894
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:48,085
We lost millions and millions and millions of dollars for fees, fines and new taxes.

895
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:49,166
It's called new growth.

896
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:50,487
We haven't had that.

897
01:05:51,308 --> 01:05:59,116
We had the mayor talk about Method Square, starting Method Square, shovels in the ground, bringing millions of dollars of revenue, nothing.

898
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:00,177
We've seen nothing.

899
01:06:01,621 --> 01:06:09,930
So when I say mismanagement, it's mismanagement of understanding of where we're going in the direction we're going in the city of Medford.

900
01:06:10,311 --> 01:06:12,173
We can say we didn't fund anything.

901
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,916
We can say that we're putting money into the general account.

902
01:06:15,216 --> 01:06:18,600
And the reason why we have to put in general account is because our management

903
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:25,947
isn't following through with the promises that they've made of transparency and follow through for new growth.

904
01:06:26,087 --> 01:06:27,128
We haven't seen any of it.

905
01:06:27,808 --> 01:06:29,470
This is why we're going to general fund.

906
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:38,337
This is why the money that was earmarked for one thing has to go to another thing, because we're losing that money because we're not the mismanagement of our finances in the city hall.

907
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,118
I'm gonna give you some examples that I want.

908
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:51,766
I'm asking the mayor for a report, meeting executive sessions, not to know anybody's names, but to understand that, where is this going?

909
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:55,168
We're looking for mismanagement of finance for City of Method.

910
01:06:55,709 --> 01:07:02,914
So I would like to see the dismissals of city staff, and then the lawsuits filed by that city staff.

911
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:06,076
The cost of investigating

912
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:25,959
these city staff members, the cost for hiring private investigators, this I'm even hearing, and this is what the problem is when you have lack of transparency and lack of openness, central administration, that I believe the firefighters were told to be careful because people are watching them now.

913
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:28,180
And this is this is what happens.

914
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:30,402
This is what happens because it's been done before.

915
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:37,753
There's a city, there's a DPW employee that was followed for months, months by a private investigator.

916
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:39,314
He was let go.

917
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:49,760
He's right now in active, it's in an active process right now, but they've already told him, the courts have already ruled, there was nothing wrong.

918
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,442
We wasted thousands and thousands of dollars on investigators.

919
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:58,405
We're looking at the cost of legal representation for all these cases.

920
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:03,398
Forget about the 40 B cases that you know, they could have won.

921
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:06,381
It's an automatic, you can't fight a 40 B and lose.

922
01:08:06,922 --> 01:08:15,571
All you can do is string it along a long enough time so the developers can back out because they're losing so much in funding.

923
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:16,632
Well, that's what happened.

924
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,974
One project we had,

925
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:25,470
A development company went bankrupt after four years, they're gone.

926
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,291
The 40B projects, they waited.

927
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:30,072
We know the world's the gold gym site.

928
01:08:31,212 --> 01:08:33,774
The owner spent over $12 million to keep that going.

929
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,515
Well, the investors in that job had done what now?

930
01:08:36,955 --> 01:08:38,956
They've said, you know what, enough is enough, we're moving forward.

931
01:08:39,777 --> 01:08:50,162
The project on Boston Ave that I believe they're talking about possibly putting in a mosque now, five acres putting to a mosque, lack of taxpayer money, lack of new growth.

932
01:08:50,953 --> 01:08:51,674
Think about that.

933
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,416
Understand the mismanagement and what's happening.

934
01:08:55,157 --> 01:08:56,338
That's where where's the money?

935
01:08:56,438 --> 01:08:57,599
Why is there money there?

936
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:07,088
Why are we looking now to look at a pretty pretty outrageous and intense movements to try to bring new money in through the tax payers?

937
01:09:08,564 --> 01:09:13,212
We can't do that until we see where the mismanagement is coming at City Hall.

938
01:09:13,913 --> 01:09:17,258
We see the city, the staffing that has to be paid.

939
01:09:17,318 --> 01:09:21,425
I would ask for the record that the mayor please

940
01:09:22,836 --> 01:09:29,621
inform us the cost of any consultants or per diem staff that she has in place right now, she has in the last few years.

941
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:35,986
And I say, let's say four years since you've been in office, and what we're paying out the staff that she hasn't filled.

942
01:09:36,226 --> 01:09:43,672
And it's not because it's not because people are leaving because they want to.

943
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:45,593
They're being pushed out.

944
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:47,515
You're talking about good people.

945
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:55,453
We haven't even heard the case haven't heard about about Alicia Nunley, the best finance director in the Commonwealth, I would say.

946
01:09:56,414 --> 01:10:03,600
Mike Durham, the best veterans affairs director that method has ever seen the state has ever seen gone.

947
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:07,102
You're talking about settlements that I know that we know.

948
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:14,788
Did you did you know the custodians settled on their their legal issues that they were they were given back $500,000 that the city reimbursed them.

949
01:10:17,657 --> 01:10:20,258
They were rewarded that did we vote on that?

950
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:21,079
No.

951
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:31,404
So the cost of settlements, the cities in the schools, I want to know what that what those numbers are not the people, but what the numbers are.

952
01:10:32,325 --> 01:10:40,889
And the cost of the law firms because I know it's just not KP law, you can see that when we say KP law, everybody picks on them, because they're in front of us every day.

953
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,570
Right.

954
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:48,470
We have multiple, multiple law offices that are working for the city of Medford, multiple.

955
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:57,114
And it hurts me because I see new counselors giving reports that they met with KP Law.

956
01:10:58,475 --> 01:11:06,499
It's funny because some of our counselors, Justin and I laughed the other day when Matt talked about, Counselor Lemming talked about he met with KP Law.

957
01:11:07,839 --> 01:11:10,541
I was never given, no one's ever told me we could talk to KP Law.

958
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:17,004
But I would love to know what that costs, because an in-house city solicitor is part of their salary.

959
01:11:18,344 --> 01:11:19,344
It makes it so easy.

960
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:35,407
So when we look at this resolution, this is really to get a report before the budget comes out, before we look at some drastic changes, because I don't know if people heard, but I believe the school department has $7.5 million to get leveled.

961
01:11:36,227 --> 01:11:37,468
Is that what we're hearing?

962
01:11:37,488 --> 01:11:38,448
7.5 million.

963
01:11:41,704 --> 01:11:45,827
Now, now I'm going to guarantee you everybody, the rainy day account.

964
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:49,029
Why does somebody want to bring the rainy day account in?

965
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:50,710
She's got to put the money from somewhere.

966
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,512
So she wants to take it from free cash.

967
01:11:53,532 --> 01:11:56,234
I'm going to let everybody know this is what it is because I've been here a long time.

968
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:00,056
She's going to go to free cash, call it a rainy day account and pull out.

969
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,157
Is it truly $7.5 million?

970
01:12:02,177 --> 01:12:02,518
No.

971
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,279
Everybody nervous about that?

972
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,000
Absolutely.

973
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:06,540
You should be.

974
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:07,801
That's a scary number.

975
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,263
It's still going to be a scary number.

976
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:22,402
But the mismanagement of this city, the mismanagement of the school department, the mismanagement of the finances and that office in this city has been devastating to this community.

977
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:31,386
Not only lack of new growth, but also in fraudulent and misleading and legal fees.

978
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:39,209
And again, we don't know what they are, we can only speculate.

979
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:55,763
This is why I asked the mayor to bring us a report in the executive session so my fellow councils can look at this when it comes down to understanding some of the comments that my fellow councils have made in the past about looking at different funding mechanisms.

980
01:12:56,423 --> 01:13:02,568
going back to the taxpayers and saying, hey, we need we need X amount of money $250 million for new high school.

981
01:13:03,469 --> 01:13:05,931
And I believe it was I've talked to new school committee.

982
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:17,581
I know we have some people in the audience right now that worked on this new school projects before I've talked to people in Somerville just did a new school people in Arlington to think in this climate of $7.5 million in the hole.

983
01:13:19,443 --> 01:13:25,408
that the school committee is going to come to us and ask us for $2.5 million so they can start the project.

984
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:26,710
And we don't even know.

985
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:33,035
I think it starts at 30% reimbursement of a new high school.

986
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,376
We don't even know what it's going to be.

987
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:40,716
the feasibility study $2.5 million when we don't even know if we're going to come close to this.

988
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:45,462
And from what I'm gathering from my friends that I have in the state, it's not very positive.

989
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:52,289
So the reason why I bring this up in this, this is, this is hopefully we can go to do I think it's going to happen?

990
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:52,830
Probably not.

991
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,831
We're never going to see this.

992
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:57,155
But the hope is to go on executive session with the administration

993
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:06,176
with her legal team, with the HR director, with the chief of staff with the mayor with us sit there and say, Okay, this is what we spent the last four years.

994
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:12,580
These are lawsuits that are pending, because I know there are lawsuits out there right now that they're trying to settle out of court.

995
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:14,001
I know that.

996
01:14:14,821 --> 01:14:18,824
So there's hundreds of 1000s of millions of dollars out there that still have to be spent.

997
01:14:20,105 --> 01:14:22,166
And in the meantime, we have nothing new going.

998
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,068
Oh, I take it back.

999
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:28,070
We have a music venue going on in Mystic Ave.

1000
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:34,232
You know, Mystic Ave, we're supposed to change the zoning, the gateway community is gonna come in.

1001
01:14:34,872 --> 01:14:35,692
What's the talk now?

1002
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:40,474
We have one building being talked about, one building and nothing else.

1003
01:14:42,695 --> 01:14:49,597
So I ask again, my fellow councilors, as we go through this process of looking to where the needs are in our city, we all know

1004
01:14:51,109 --> 01:14:52,050
We're fiscally strapped.

1005
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,312
We all know we're in crisis financially.

1006
01:14:56,073 --> 01:15:06,881
And possibly, if it came down and we could sit together with the administration and they can show us, they can show me that, you know what, George, this is the data.

1007
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:08,662
You know, you're right.

1008
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,864
We didn't lose millions of dollars in new tax.

1009
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:16,028
We didn't lose millions of dollars in new fees and fees in permitting.

1010
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:17,609
We didn't.

1011
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:21,756
We didn't lose millions of dollars on on settlements.

1012
01:15:21,836 --> 01:15:26,098
We didn't lose millions of dollars on on legal services.

1013
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:32,721
If they can show me that I will be the first one to vote yes on anything that you ask for an increase in taxes.

1014
01:15:33,522 --> 01:15:35,543
But until they can show us

1015
01:15:36,755 --> 01:15:39,696
that they're not mismanaging our funds, because this is what we do.

1016
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:47,139
The city council, we're in charge with a fiscal stewards of our our city's finances, with the last line of defense.

1017
01:15:47,619 --> 01:16:00,323
So unless we can prove that they can prove that all we'll be doing moving forward, and any sort of tax, any sort of override any sort of debt exclusion, it's putting more money into a hole that'll disappear.

1018
01:16:01,544 --> 01:16:01,864
Period.

1019
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,687
I think we're all smart enough to understand that.

1020
01:16:05,988 --> 01:16:08,048
So this is why I bring this resolution up, Mr. President.

1021
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:16,571
I ask the mayor to please bring this forward, that she meets with us in executive session to give us a breakdown, to prove me wrong.

1022
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:17,471
I hope she can.

1023
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:19,351
Come prove me wrong.

1024
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:21,872
Tell me we're not spending millions and millions of dollars.

1025
01:16:24,653 --> 01:16:28,974
And then we could see a way that we can find a way to fund the city the way it needs to be funded.

1026
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:32,215
But until then, these are huge questions that they need to answer.

1027
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,385
This is mismanagement.

1028
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:38,951
This isn't hundreds of years of neglect.

1029
01:16:39,472 --> 01:16:43,198
This is mismanagement from someone that's been in office now for years.

1030
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,620
She's done nothing.

1031
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,785
When neighborhood communities were in the same spot we were,

1032
01:16:49,844 --> 01:16:53,807
talk to the mayor in Malden, talk to the mayor in Somerville, talk to the mayor in Everett.

1033
01:16:54,307 --> 01:16:55,708
They had the same issues we had.

1034
01:16:56,329 --> 01:17:07,998
They used those funds to make sure they did what was right for their community first, before she started covering general accounts because she mismanaged the business of the city.

1035
01:17:08,318 --> 01:17:12,661
She's done a terrible job in the city bringing finances in the system.

1036
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:15,963
Remember, the last meeting we had was new growth was what?

1037
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,941
our new growth that we talked about.

1038
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:21,063
I know Councilor Baird says that the city assessor is going to give us a great report.

1039
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,324
I can't wait to see it.

1040
01:17:23,164 --> 01:17:25,085
But here we are, year five now.

1041
01:17:26,306 --> 01:17:27,367
Year five, she's the mayor.

1042
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:37,153
The most we've seen that was presented to us was a million dollars, new growth from fees and fines from traffic and parking.

1043
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:38,954
That was amazing to me.

1044
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:41,015
That was amazing to me.

1045
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:46,941
So I asked for this report, because I don't know, I'm sure you're all smart enough that you see what I'm trying to do here.

1046
01:17:47,422 --> 01:17:51,086
I'm trying to show my colleagues that listen, I understand what you're saying.

1047
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:53,368
And you we need we need the finances.

1048
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,693
But understanding taxation isn't always the best resolution.

1049
01:17:58,294 --> 01:18:00,796
First, let's find out what's causing this.

1050
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,384
Why aren't we bringing in new money?

1051
01:18:03,484 --> 01:18:06,906
Why are we spending so much money on things we shouldn't be?

1052
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:16,191
And then if we shows that that's not true at all, Councilor Scott Pelli, then I walk away in peace voting for whatever the city needs.

1053
01:18:16,231 --> 01:18:23,995
But right now, this right now shows poor, poor mismanagement of the finances of this community and the leadership of this community.

1054
01:18:24,235 --> 01:18:24,896
Thank you, Mr. President.

1055
01:18:26,116 --> 01:18:27,117
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelli.

1056
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,769
I'm going to go to Vice President Collins, but first I just want to say a couple things.

1057
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:36,952
Last year the budget fiscal 24 budget new growth was 2.5 million.

1058
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:47,560
And we did receive in the budget, we have meetings on the three departments tomorrow in committee of the whole, we did receive a quarter one quarter two budget to actuals document.

1059
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,200
from the administration.

1060
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,582
The law department spending as of December 31st was $172,000 out of a budget of $552,000.

1061
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:56,923
So only families spent 31% of their budget, 50% of the way through the year.

1062
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:57,943
Vice President Collins.

1063
01:18:57,963 --> 01:18:59,044
Thank you, President Baird.

1064
01:18:59,064 --> 01:18:59,524
I appreciate that.

1065
01:19:10,992 --> 01:19:12,653
Councilor Scarpelli, we've known each other for a term.

1066
01:19:12,673 --> 01:19:13,954
You know, there's a lot I agree with you about.

1067
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,135
There's some I disagree with you about.

1068
01:19:15,155 --> 01:19:16,196
That's not news to anybody.

1069
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:20,519
What I do think that we all share is that we're looking for the holistic picture.

1070
01:19:21,468 --> 01:19:30,452
and I do think that as a city council under our current charter, we're kind of always at a disadvantage because we do have the final vote on the budget.

1071
01:19:31,012 --> 01:19:31,832
We don't craft it.

1072
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:32,913
We can't add to it.

1073
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,754
We can only make line item subtractions.

1074
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:45,318
We are in a difficult and disadvantaged position to have that 30,000 foot view on the budget when we receive all of our information

1075
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:50,582
through intermediaries, through departments, through the administration, essentially second hand.

1076
01:19:51,223 --> 01:19:53,245
And I think all of us have found that challenging.

1077
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:54,526
I know that I have found it challenging.

1078
01:19:58,646 --> 01:20:00,948
There's a lot that I think is really critical as we move forward.

1079
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:09,555
We already had a conversation tonight on two major pieces of infrastructure that we know will take years to bring up to the level of condition that residents deserve.

1080
01:20:10,076 --> 01:20:13,639
And we barely even touched on the new high school, and that's another one.

1081
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,501
Residents deserve a new, better high school.

1082
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:25,009
And I think it is both true that we need to make sure we have a clear picture of why our budget is the way it is,

1083
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:43,728
in fairness to everybody, and we have to hold that it's equally crucial that we do what needs to happen so that residents have the environment and the resources and the public sector and the public staff and the city infrastructure that they deserve.

1084
01:20:44,248 --> 01:20:51,832
And I know for me, we cannot afford to wait on any avenues that can get us closer to that.

1085
01:20:51,872 --> 01:20:54,274
I also do want to note, you know, we speak about

1086
01:20:55,552 --> 01:21:03,521
what our jurisdiction is and what our jurisdiction isn't for, you know, what city resources look like and what our budget looks like.

1087
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:12,050
I also want to add, since we mentioned Mystic Avenue, it's a constant source of frustration for me that we don't have a more direct hand in the spending of city resources so that we, you know, when

1088
01:21:13,422 --> 01:21:13,502
that.

1089
01:21:13,522 --> 01:21:19,145
City staff and residents come to us bringing up particular projects and departments that we can't more directly intervene.

1090
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:31,392
But I am really proud that this council has, you know, for several terms now made it a shared goal to do what we can on the zoning ordinances side so that we can lay the foundation for rapidly improving new growth commercial

1091
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:48,604
it's not direct because developments come from developers, but we have a direct hand in laying the foundation where our commercial tax base, where new growth can flourish in the city.

1092
01:21:48,644 --> 01:21:51,666
And so I'm proud that that's one piece that we do have jurisdiction over.

1093
01:21:51,786 --> 01:22:01,954
This council is making a priority for several terms now, and we are already starting to see developers take advantage and start to take

1094
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:05,295
that's going to benefit.

1095
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:09,516
Um everything that we talk about in these chambers that deserve more investment than what we're currently getting.

1096
01:22:09,936 --> 01:22:10,236
Thank you.

1097
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:12,757
Vice President Collins Council.

1098
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:13,957
Go ahead.

1099
01:22:13,997 --> 01:22:15,658
Thank you.

1100
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:19,419
Um I definitely do believe that, uh, our city's underfunded.

1101
01:22:19,819 --> 01:22:25,001
I think it is a pretty simple math problem that when you don't fix your water price for 100 years, you don't fix your roads for decades.

1102
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,541
You don't fix your schools for 20 years.

1103
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:26,801
You don't

1104
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:34,942
for years so that those salaries are below commensurate for other cities.

1105
01:22:35,303 --> 01:22:44,331
I think that that math problem is pretty simple one, but that doesn't mean that I believe that all of our money is being spent properly and I really appreciate this resolution.

1106
01:22:44,672 --> 01:22:50,958
I think it's incredibly important that we understand and that the community also understands how money is being spent.

1107
01:22:51,777 --> 01:22:57,380
and that we are really responsible and that that money is not being wasted.

1108
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:10,685
So I really appreciate this resolution and any other resolutions that come to us having transparency and understanding the way that the city is being run and to make sure that our funds are being used well.

1109
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:13,587
Thank you.

1110
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:14,847
Any further discussion?

1111
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,449
Any comments from members of the public?

1112
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:23,075
Seeing none, is there a motion?

1113
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:24,196
Oh, sure.

1114
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:26,018
Name and address for the record, please.

1115
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,911
Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigny Road.

1116
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:32,313
I actually have a comment about public participation.

1117
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:39,818
I was confused on how it was carried out because I read the agenda and I thought the emails were going to be read aloud and that did not happen.

1118
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:42,720
So regarding this resolution, of course, I support it.

1119
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:48,183
And I have to say that in my view, this is the most productive city council meeting that I've been to.

1120
01:23:49,164 --> 01:23:56,869
I've been to the two past ones, and this is the kind of discussions that directly affect residents and that I hope that I can see more in the future.

1121
01:23:57,929 --> 01:24:02,010
I will just note that we've had many of these discussions the last two before the last two meetings.

1122
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,591
Okay, that's good.

1123
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:04,051
Yeah, sorry.

1124
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,452
I only have been to the past two.

1125
01:24:06,472 --> 01:24:15,294
So I read the two emails and I've also been, as I've mentioned, to the past two meetings, and I know what has been going on here in the city council chamber.

1126
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:20,256
So I just wanted to give my view on how I see things.

1127
01:24:21,164 --> 01:24:25,447
So I believe it's clear, most unfortunately, that the Metro community is divided.

1128
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:30,871
The City Council should strive to avoid creating further divisions among Metro neighbors.

1129
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:36,596
We should all work to build upon our similarities, rather than drift apart based on our differences.

1130
01:24:37,296 --> 01:24:43,078
Generalizations are unfair and damaging because they indiscriminately put everyone in the same bag.

1131
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:48,961
If there was a problem with the behavior of one or a few individuals, then the problem should be discussed with those individuals separately.

1132
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:58,385
Referring to a group of people as an angry mob and accusing them of being ignorant stigmatizes those that are, in fact, a group of fellow Medford neighbors.

1133
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:08,763
We should try to understand why some residents are feeling frustrated that the city's government today is a clear example of why some of us are very, very frustrated at what we're seeing.

1134
01:25:10,347 --> 01:25:23,377
I myself feel frustrated, in addition to what I've been seeing today, that the solutions proposed by this city council to address some of Medford's problems almost always rely on more government control and higher and or new taxes.

1135
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:29,461
Relying on more government control and higher taxes often leads to inefficient solutions and can stifle economic vitality.

1136
01:25:29,521 --> 01:25:33,824
To address Medford problems, we should instead consider approaches that leverage market mechanisms.

1137
01:25:33,905 --> 01:25:34,405
For instance,

1138
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:41,669
1.

1139
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:41,669
Encourage private investment through deregulation where excessive rules may deter business growth and innovation.

1140
01:25:41,689 --> 01:25:41,669
2.

1141
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:49,713
Implement a user fee structure for specific services which aligns costs directly with those who benefit, rather than a blanket tax increase.

1142
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:49,713
3.

1143
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:59,158
Foster competition in service provision like waste management or consulting services, I've been in email communication with several of you regarding this, which can increase quality and reduce costs.

1144
01:26:00,106 --> 01:26:07,609
A focus on enhancing economic freedom and reducing unnecessary governmental overhead can lead to more sustainable and effective solutions.

1145
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:19,513
I'd like to summarize by stating that I prefer a city council chamber that is full of passionate, and yes, sometimes noisy, neighbors rather than a chamber that is empty and completely silent.

1146
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:25,295
It's healthy for our local democracy to have so many residents interested in the work of the city council.

1147
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:28,196
Let's find unity in our passion for local politics.

1148
01:26:28,256 --> 01:26:28,736
Thank you very much.

1149
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:31,241
Thank you.

1150
01:26:35,544 --> 01:26:41,127
Any further discussion on the topic of the lawsuit settlements and investigations?

1151
01:26:55,981 --> 01:26:59,742
the executive session meeting with the City Council to discuss these issues and concerns.

1152
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:07,124
So motion to refer the paper to the mayor, requesting answers to the questions and an executive session, please.

1153
01:27:09,584 --> 01:27:09,884
Thank you.

1154
01:27:14,866 --> 01:27:18,907
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1155
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:20,647
We'll go to public participation.

1156
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:23,268
Mr Orlando, name and address for the record, please.

1157
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:29,974
Richard Orlando of Winford Way, Medford, Massachusetts.

1158
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:33,417
Just a very brief statement, something that came to mind.

1159
01:27:34,338 --> 01:27:37,781
And I'd just like you to think about this.

1160
01:27:38,682 --> 01:27:45,408
The city's lack of financial responsibility should not be borne by taxes to the public.

1161
01:27:46,707 --> 01:27:55,918
Unless you can demonstrate financial responsibility, being run correctly, the dropkick shouldn't be to increase tax to the people until you get the answer to those questions.

1162
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,199
That's all, thank you.

1163
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:57,680
Thank you.

1164
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:04,448
We have a question from our hand raised on Zoom.

1165
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:06,591
Maureen, name and address for the record, please.

1166
01:28:10,555 --> 01:28:13,459
I'm Donovan, 55 Ellsworth Street, Medford, Mass.

1167
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:28,537
I want to tell Councilman Scarpelli how grateful I am that he keeps bringing up the issue of transparency, because there is nothing coming from the mayor's office in City Hall.

1168
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:31,227
That's my opinion, first of all.

1169
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:39,053
And apparently that opinion is shared by others, such as another Medford resident who spoke before I did.

1170
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:47,700
Quite eloquently, I want to mention that it seems to me like the mayor is

1171
01:28:49,682 --> 01:28:55,624
kicking the can down the road in terms of filling vital positions within the city of Medford.

1172
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:57,685
We do not have a city councilor.

1173
01:28:58,485 --> 01:29:03,107
We do not have a assistance, not city councilor.

1174
01:29:03,447 --> 01:29:05,087
We do not have a city solicitor.

1175
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:08,068
We do not have an assistant city solicitor.

1176
01:29:08,888 --> 01:29:17,611
She wants to outsource the chief of the fire services and she wants to outsource the water

1177
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:25,608
key positions within the Medford water and sewer offices.

1178
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:35,354
Finally, I just want to make one comment that is very dismaying to me to watch a city counselor

1179
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:55,784
in the session right now who has been on his computer and his cell phone for the past half an hour while I sit here patiently waiting and concentrating and listening to everything, every word that all of you have to say.

1180
01:29:56,804 --> 01:30:02,186
That person should be spoken to about the inappropriateness of his behavior.

1181
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:04,026
Thank you.

1182
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:07,117
through the chair.

1183
01:30:07,237 --> 01:30:08,218
Are you referring to the chair?

1184
01:30:09,859 --> 01:30:12,000
No, I'm not referring to the chair, sir.

1185
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:18,703
I'm referring to one of the members sitting in the round table around the chair.

1186
01:30:19,644 --> 01:30:19,924
Thank you.

1187
01:30:19,964 --> 01:30:23,305
I will just note that, you know, for example, we may be managing Zoom.

1188
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:25,887
I often take notes and bring up reference documents.

1189
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:30,929
Councilor Scarpelli brings up things on his phone, researches things on his phone.

1190
01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:34,331
They're often tools to enhance our participation in the meeting.

1191
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:40,593
I respect that and admire that because you're multitasking in a difficult environment.

1192
01:30:41,053 --> 01:30:49,118
But one individual has been scrolling on his computer and typing into his cell phone the entire time.

1193
01:30:49,638 --> 01:30:54,841
And it's really an abuse of power and time in this setting.

1194
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,003
Thank you very much.

1195
01:30:57,263 --> 01:30:59,584
It's certainly not.

1196
01:31:01,825 --> 01:31:04,447
Any further comment on

1197
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:05,899
this paper.

1198
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:17,844
Seeing none on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the mayor requesting answers to the questions and an executive session seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1199
01:31:17,864 --> 01:31:19,065
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1200
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:21,606
Councillor Callahan.

1201
01:31:21,786 --> 01:31:21,966
Yes.

1202
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:25,387
Vice President Collins.

1203
01:31:25,627 --> 01:31:25,847
Yes.

1204
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,148
Councillor Lozano.

1205
01:31:28,328 --> 01:31:28,529
No.

1206
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:30,189
Councillor Lemming.

1207
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:31,310
Yes.

1208
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:33,671
Councillor Scarpelli.

1209
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:34,111
Yes.

1210
01:31:34,807 --> 01:31:35,628
Councilor Sang.

1211
01:31:35,668 --> 01:31:35,848
Yes.

1212
01:31:36,809 --> 01:31:37,569
President Beard.

1213
01:31:37,609 --> 01:31:39,050
Yes, 60 affirmative, more than negative.

1214
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:40,191
The motion passes.

1215
01:31:40,211 --> 01:31:43,554
24-077 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1216
01:31:43,594 --> 01:31:44,675
Resolution to discuss.

1217
01:31:45,155 --> 01:31:46,316
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

1218
01:31:53,762 --> 01:32:01,488
On the motion to join papers 24-077 and 24-081 by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1219
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:02,930
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1220
01:32:07,574 --> 01:32:08,555
Councillor CASSIDY.

1221
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:10,478
Councillor CASSIDY.

1222
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:26,970
Yes, seven in the affirmative.

1223
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,912
None of the negative emotion passes 24 dash 07.

1224
01:32:29,952 --> 01:32:30,952
Can I read them both?

1225
01:32:30,972 --> 01:32:31,473
Sure, sure.

1226
01:32:31,933 --> 01:32:32,273
Thank you.

1227
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:44,139
24 dash 077 by Councillor Scarpelli be resolved that the City Council discussed the possible harmful materials being stored on the MBTA commuter railway that abuts residential homes, most notably the creosote railroad ties and 24 dash 081.

1228
01:32:47,982 --> 01:33:08,520
Council President provided verbal update on efforts by Council leadership, the mayor, city staff, representative Garmelie and local residents to remove creosote Soak Railroad ties that are an environmental and health hazard along the MBTA lower line, be it further resolved that the council request immediate action by the MBTA to remove these ties from residential areas and forward a copy of this resolution by email to our state delegation.

1229
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,361
Councillor Scarpelli.

1230
01:33:10,081 --> 01:33:21,106
First, this was reached out by a few neighbors and they didn't realize, and I explained to them that Council President and a few of other my colleagues have been working tirelessly on this issue.

1231
01:33:21,126 --> 01:33:29,971
When I went out to visit and talk with them, you can blatantly smell the creosote that is, I can't see how it's not harmful.

1232
01:33:31,371 --> 01:33:35,052
And I know that you've done your due diligence, Council President, I really appreciate that.

1233
01:33:35,452 --> 01:33:40,674
I know how hard you work with the MBTA, our state delegation to make sure something moves on this.

1234
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:48,156
So I'm just gonna step away and just give you the kudos you deserve because you've worked tirelessly on this.

1235
01:33:48,496 --> 01:33:52,917
And again, we're seeing the true ignorance of our MBTA work its magic.

1236
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:53,437
So thank you.

1237
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:56,940
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli I appreciate that I can just give a brief update.

1238
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:10,090
There's been an issue ongoing for over two months now, especially behind Tyler app but along the lower line commuter rail where railroad ties soaked increase so which is a pretty toxic flammable material have been being placed within

1239
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:17,557
50 feet of homes, you know, right in a residential neighborhood, some of them nearby to a daycare in February.

1240
01:34:17,577 --> 01:34:22,642
And this is part of a program to replace the rail lines.

1241
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:24,824
You know, they have to do it for safety purposes, but.

1242
01:34:27,068 --> 01:34:45,550
In February, there was the first time these were placed there and I was just able to successfully work with Director Blake and some other folks to get the MBTA to move the ties up the line into Winchester, where they're in near the forest, you know in the DCR forest area rather than right abutting residential homes.

1243
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:56,454
And then a couple weeks ago, maybe five times as many ties came and replaced right on Tyler Avenue along the MBTA railroad line.

1244
01:34:57,615 --> 01:35:02,177
The mayor has made direct requests director Blake from traffic and transportation has made requests.

1245
01:35:02,617 --> 01:35:05,358
We've been working with director with representative Garber Lee.

1246
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:19,465
Residents have been reaching out, residents have engaged the Mass Department of Environmental Protection, and there's probably a couple hundred, 200 email chain at this point, going back and forth between dozens of people trying to get the MBTA to do this.

1247
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:24,127
And the MBTA has basically said, no, we have to replace the ties, prove that this is toxic.

1248
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,269
So it has been a frustrating.

1249
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:36,696
Again, just last week, we were out trying to get them to do something, been talking to Representative Garbally, and he's been basically getting a stonewall as well.

1250
01:35:37,277 --> 01:35:39,318
So we are continuing to try.

1251
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:42,461
The MBTA has invoked a couple of things.

1252
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,704
They basically said, if you want to prove it's toxic, call the EPA.

1253
01:35:46,104 --> 01:35:54,090
And then they've also said, we'll bring in the Federal Railroad Administration if we have to bring in the federal, because it's federal rails, we have to replace the rails.

1254
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:54,691
So they are

1255
01:35:56,152 --> 01:36:07,159
not responding in the way that you would hope of a partner in government on this issue, but we have had a lot of people working on this, and I'll continue to keep working on it as best as I can.

1256
01:36:07,419 --> 01:36:07,760
Thank you.

1257
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:10,261
Councillor Sang.

1258
01:36:10,962 --> 01:36:15,945
I wanted to thank both you, President Baird, and Councillor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

1259
01:36:18,095 --> 01:36:27,561
I was going through my inbox, and the first time we heard about this issue as a council actually was in June last year, where we did actually get a resolution on it, a temporary resolution.

1260
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:34,105
Back then, similar to what you were describing now, there was a lot of back and forth from residents, city staff.

1261
01:36:35,106 --> 01:36:40,810
I made calls, I know you made calls, a number of councillors made calls at the time, and we got a temporary solution.

1262
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,631
But then this issue came back.

1263
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:48,076
And it seems like the number of ties there is higher than ever.

1264
01:36:48,596 --> 01:36:52,801
One resident did actually, I think, bring out a pretty decent idea in asking.

1265
01:36:52,821 --> 01:36:55,904
I had to make sure I had the language for it.

1266
01:36:56,444 --> 01:36:58,386
It's somewhere deep in the email chain.

1267
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:03,872
But to ask for the actual material safety data sheet for the creosote.

1268
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:06,392
that was applied to the ties.

1269
01:37:07,033 --> 01:37:15,435
I was wondering if either of you would be amenable to adding that into the resolution as well to ask for that material safety data sheet.

1270
01:37:16,155 --> 01:37:17,375
This is a serious issue.

1271
01:37:17,715 --> 01:37:21,456
I know you in particular have worked really tirelessly on this.

1272
01:37:21,716 --> 01:37:24,797
Our state rep, Sean Garvely, has worked very hard on this as well.

1273
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:29,318
I think this is a pattern that we see from the MBTA of non-response.

1274
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:37,778
We give them so much money, we contribute, we benefit from them, and yet we want to be partners, and yet there is this non-response.

1275
01:37:38,398 --> 01:37:42,362
When we were looking at the accessibility improvements for the bus stops, that took a year.

1276
01:37:42,842 --> 01:37:52,011
When we were thinking about the Orange Line shutdown years back, our city was proactive in reaching out and saying, what can we do to facilitate traffic, and we got posted.

1277
01:37:52,651 --> 01:37:55,133
and so we really need to keep working on this.

1278
01:37:56,054 --> 01:38:05,001
We have had times in the past where we were unified as a council and reached out and worked with the city staff as well and actually did get concessions from the MBTA.

1279
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:06,462
So I hope this is the case this time.

1280
01:38:07,383 --> 01:38:14,589
Yeah, I'm certainly amenable to the amendment and did request that from the MBTA and they did not provide the document.

1281
01:38:17,111 --> 01:38:21,654
So that's an amendment from Councillor Seng to request the materials

1282
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:24,842
Could you, the safety data sheet?

1283
01:38:25,402 --> 01:38:26,523
Yeah, that's right.

1284
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:34,026
Material, yeah, okay.

1285
01:38:37,687 --> 01:38:47,572
Great, on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by, and myself as amended by Councillor Sang, as seconded by Councillor Lazaro, any further discussion by members of the council?

1286
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:53,683
Seeing none, any discussion by members of the public in person or on Zoom?

1287
01:38:57,248 --> 01:38:59,871
Seeing none in person, we'll go to Bill Giglio on Zoom.

1288
01:39:00,152 --> 01:39:01,614
Name and address for the record, please.

1289
01:39:01,634 --> 01:39:04,658
Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

1290
01:39:05,632 --> 01:39:10,237
I'm very confused about like the, the actual, where is the disconnect?

1291
01:39:10,297 --> 01:39:20,227
I mean, we have one side and by the way, thank you for doing this, but we have one side that is very adamant that it's very toxic and hazardous.

1292
01:39:20,905 --> 01:39:29,727
And then you have the MBTA who's saying it's not, there's no type, or is there any type of an emergency, anybody that can come down and test that?

1293
01:39:29,747 --> 01:39:38,629
Because if it was like any type of, you know, anything else, wouldn't it be like an emergency instead of us just requesting something and waiting on that?

1294
01:39:38,689 --> 01:39:41,290
Is there something that can be done quicker or sooner?

1295
01:39:42,771 --> 01:39:49,277
Yeah, as far as I'm aware, the Board of Health has been engaged as well in Medford, and they have sent a number of comments along.

1296
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:50,919
They've requested action by the Mass.

1297
01:39:50,979 --> 01:40:03,811
Department of Environmental Protection, and the MBTA's response has essentially been that, according to them, they don't have any proof that it's not safe and that this is a project required by the Federal Railroad Administration.

1298
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:06,873
And that's essentially been their response.

1299
01:40:06,913 --> 01:40:07,634
I mean, they have...

1300
01:40:08,695 --> 01:40:11,256
To give them some credit, they have responded to the emails.

1301
01:40:11,617 --> 01:40:15,139
Beyond that, the responses have not really been sufficient.

1302
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:16,399
Right.

1303
01:40:16,539 --> 01:40:23,963
I mean, responses are nice, but that doesn't protect the health and no pun intended.

1304
01:40:24,003 --> 01:40:31,047
So as far as the city tracks are covered, as far as us trying to fix this.

1305
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:33,669
So nothing ever comes back from the city.

1306
01:40:34,729 --> 01:40:38,011
We don't have any authority to order them to stop work.

1307
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:42,380
Right, but you did, I mean, it's obviously brought to their attention anyways.

1308
01:40:43,401 --> 01:40:44,041
Right, yeah.

1309
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:46,983
All right, that's great, then thank you guys for doing this.

1310
01:40:47,964 --> 01:40:49,185
Thank you, much appreciated.

1311
01:40:51,767 --> 01:40:53,248
Name and address for the record, please.

1312
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:59,193
Gerald Burns, 44 South Border Road, Medford.

1313
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:04,977
While you were all talking, I just looked up the EPA as far as creosote.

1314
01:41:06,747 --> 01:41:09,628
Anyway, within this, there's some basic information and things.

1315
01:41:10,209 --> 01:41:30,238
But in disposing of items treated with creosote safely, one of these items says, do not burn creosote or other preservative treated wood in a residential setting to avoid possible inhalation of toxic chemicals in the smoke and ash.

1316
01:41:30,819 --> 01:41:30,979
Yeah.

1317
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:32,160
You already read it, right?

1318
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:33,100
Yeah.

1319
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,902
A resident sent around some EPA regulations around creosote.

1320
01:41:35,962 --> 01:41:38,184
And then they said, well, these are creosote soap ties.

1321
01:41:38,644 --> 01:41:41,205
So it's a different, you know, I mean, it's just kind of a run around.

1322
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:43,627
Yeah, they haven't burned.

1323
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:47,689
So if you go down to the neighborhood, I'm not going down there.

1324
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:49,250
It's it's a brutal smell.

1325
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,632
I mean, it's persistent and pervasive.

1326
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:51,832
Yeah.

1327
01:41:51,852 --> 01:41:53,853
All right.

1328
01:41:54,153 --> 01:41:54,514
Thank you.

1329
01:41:54,694 --> 01:41:54,954
Yeah.

1330
01:41:57,876 --> 01:41:57,976
Oh,

1331
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,841
Any further discussion by members of the public on this item?

1332
01:42:04,342 --> 01:42:04,823
One more.

1333
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,424
Name and address for the record, please.

1334
01:42:09,145 --> 01:42:11,167
Don McEwen, 143 Playstead Road.

1335
01:42:11,187 --> 01:42:16,710
We just looked up on the internet about creosol and the health effects.

1336
01:42:17,191 --> 01:42:22,114
The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has determined that coal

1337
01:42:23,396 --> 01:42:29,925
For coal tar, creosol is a problem and a human carcinogen.

1338
01:42:30,426 --> 01:42:30,767
Yep.

1339
01:42:32,549 --> 01:42:33,390
That's what we sent.

1340
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:42,760
Yeah.

1341
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:46,542
A few piles.

1342
01:42:47,363 --> 01:42:48,804
I mean, it's hundreds.

1343
01:42:49,524 --> 01:42:50,745
I know I live across the street.

1344
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:51,426
You see it, right.

1345
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:52,967
So I see that I smell it.

1346
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:53,487
Yeah.

1347
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:54,428
So we're trying.

1348
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:56,089
I just want everybody to know the reach out to myself.

1349
01:42:56,109 --> 01:42:56,409
Yeah.

1350
01:42:56,609 --> 01:43:00,031
I mean, the council bears in this in and of itself.

1351
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:00,392
I believe.

1352
01:43:00,432 --> 01:43:00,672
Yeah.

1353
01:43:00,752 --> 01:43:01,192
Staying right.

1354
01:43:01,913 --> 01:43:02,533
That's scary.

1355
01:43:02,653 --> 01:43:03,454
It's baffling.

1356
01:43:04,895 --> 01:43:10,065
We sent all the same information over and they said we have to get the project done.

1357
01:43:10,085 --> 01:43:15,154
Name and address for the record, please.

1358
01:43:16,397 --> 01:43:18,358
You know, I just want to make a quick question.

1359
01:43:18,538 --> 01:43:25,022
Is it possible to they could store these these this credit site ties inside of some sort of a trailer?

1360
01:43:25,442 --> 01:43:29,645
And when the workers go in, they can put on their masks and pull out as needed.

1361
01:43:30,205 --> 01:43:31,126
Just thinking out loud.

1362
01:43:31,606 --> 01:43:34,748
We've we've asked for a number that was Andrew Castagnetti, by the way.

1363
01:43:35,868 --> 01:43:39,410
We've asked for a number of solutions, moving them, storing them differently.

1364
01:43:40,171 --> 01:43:41,091
They're pretty solid.

1365
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:42,192
They're locked into their position.

1366
01:43:47,284 --> 01:43:48,104
Any further discussion?

1367
01:43:48,124 --> 01:43:57,328
On the motion by Councillor Scarpelli and myself, as amended by Councillor Sang, as seconded by Councillor Lazzaro, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

1368
01:44:11,534 --> 01:44:12,555
Councillor CALLAHAN.

1369
01:44:12,595 --> 01:44:12,815
Yes.

1370
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:15,276
Vice President Collins.

1371
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:15,676
Yes.

1372
01:44:17,059 --> 01:44:18,200
Councilor Lazzaro?

1373
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:18,480
Yes.

1374
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,121
Councilor Lemming?

1375
01:44:21,661 --> 01:44:21,981
Yes.

1376
01:44:23,902 --> 01:44:24,963
Councilor Scarpelli?

1377
01:44:25,243 --> 01:44:25,463
Yes.

1378
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,184
Councilor Thang?

1379
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:27,504
Yes.

1380
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:29,605
President Beers?

1381
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:30,065
Yes.

1382
01:44:30,105 --> 01:44:33,367
Having the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

1383
01:44:33,387 --> 01:44:35,047
24-078 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1384
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:43,791
Be it resolved that the City Council discuss the Mayor's request in hiring an outside consultant to review Medford Fire Department policies and procedures with additional cost to the taxpayers of Medford.

1385
01:44:43,832 --> 01:44:44,592
Councilor Scarpelli?

1386
01:44:46,398 --> 01:44:47,762
Thank you, Mr. President.

1387
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:51,175
I know that there are a few representatives from the fire department here.

1388
01:44:52,574 --> 01:44:56,457
I'm again when we're talking about mismanagement of city funds.

1389
01:44:57,098 --> 01:45:06,786
The reason why I brought this up is during the school committee meeting when they were talking about the you know what the devastating news in that financial front was.

1390
01:45:07,407 --> 01:45:19,117
And then I believe there was some conversation about possible layoffs and we talked about, you know, we're talking about, you know, police, fire teachers, most important people in our community.

1391
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:20,018
And

1392
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:40,352
Then the mayor sent this email saying that they were bringing in, I believe it's municipal solutions that were coming in, and they were going to, at a startup cost to start, almost $10,000 to bring this organization in to do a study of procedures and policies that were 60 years old.

1393
01:45:41,152 --> 01:45:47,756
I emailed the mayor, I expressed my displeasure again of wasting taxpayers' money because

1394
01:45:49,926 --> 01:46:03,320
In the normal situation, and I've talked to police officers, I've talked to directors and assistant superintendents, I've talked to other department leaders in our community, in our city structure.

1395
01:46:04,121 --> 01:46:11,629
And when they're making fundamental policy changes and procedures, it starts with the people we already pay, the professionals that are there.

1396
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:22,436
They work on those policies, and then they review it together with the administration, making sure it falls in all the criteria that's needed, and they make those necessary changes.

1397
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:24,397
So again, I bring up 60 years.

1398
01:46:25,718 --> 01:46:28,499
So the mayor responded, said, if you have any questions, contact Chief Evans.

1399
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,041
Chief Evans picked up the phone right away.

1400
01:46:31,061 --> 01:46:31,981
I really appreciate that.

1401
01:46:32,021 --> 01:46:36,443
We had a great conversation, and I respect Chief Evans.

1402
01:46:36,483 --> 01:46:38,525
I know the difficulties in, and we had a,

1403
01:46:40,046 --> 01:46:44,749
We had an agreed to disagree moment because he said, George, I'm trying to do a lot here.

1404
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:48,512
And we do have some policies that are 60 years old.

1405
01:46:50,013 --> 01:46:51,514
And I can't do everything at once.

1406
01:46:52,294 --> 01:46:59,960
And I said, Chief, first of all, in the normal situation, would you have done this with your team?

1407
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:03,382
He said he's inundated because he started this position.

1408
01:47:04,463 --> 01:47:06,204
So simple question is this chief,

1409
01:47:07,697 --> 01:47:17,491
If it's 60 years old, if there truly is policies and procedures that are 60 years old there, you can't wait another six months?

1410
01:47:18,769 --> 01:47:25,495
to save the city taxpayers money, especially when you're talking about possibly laying off firefighters.

1411
01:47:25,555 --> 01:47:29,058
But I did hear some great news that I'll also ask.

1412
01:47:29,559 --> 01:47:39,988
I'll ask our our friends from the fire department that I hopefully they give us some good news tonight because I heard some things about this possible grant that

1413
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:43,452
would absolutely save our community and I'm actually giddy about it.

1414
01:47:43,992 --> 01:47:45,614
So, but that's it.

1415
01:47:45,894 --> 01:47:47,816
That'll be that'll be something that I'm going to add on.

1416
01:47:47,856 --> 01:47:50,498
But right now, I know that today,

1417
01:47:51,676 --> 01:48:00,181
today, municipal solutions were on site meeting with I believe the deputy chiefs and starting the process already.

1418
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,482
We don't know what the final number is.

1419
01:48:02,522 --> 01:48:02,823
It could be 50,000.

1420
01:48:02,923 --> 01:48:05,464
It could be the cost of another firefighter.

1421
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:20,593
We don't know because what we did get we got a start of almost 10,000 the beginning of a study again, another year, I'm going to say it because we don't normally do this in our community and other departments.

1422
01:48:21,803 --> 01:48:28,707
When it's in the police, with the police department, they start the process with the police department and their leadership team.

1423
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:33,891
When it's in the school department, they start with their direct as a curriculum, they work it out.

1424
01:48:34,551 --> 01:48:43,997
And then if they need more clarity and more backing, then they go out to an organization and bring someone to tie that in together for maybe a minimum amount of money.

1425
01:48:44,906 --> 01:48:52,411
What we're seeing right now, shockingly, the fire department, the firefighters aren't even being looked at to do that.

1426
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:57,934
People that we've trusted, all of a sudden now, everything is under a microscope.

1427
01:48:58,855 --> 01:49:13,204
So now the mayor is bringing in municipal solutions to meet with the fire department to look at how to make these six-year-old changes and change the policies and procedures in their association, which I don't disagree with.

1428
01:49:14,602 --> 01:49:23,745
but to spend, again, mismanagement financial funding in this community is just waving its ugly face again at wasting money again.

1429
01:49:25,345 --> 01:49:40,630
So I know that you're on the forefront, Mr. Jones, and you guys have been, so if you have anything to add, I know that I wanna know how that was going, if you can, what's the practice usually with the fire department, with past chiefs?

1430
01:49:41,711 --> 01:49:42,031
What is it?

1431
01:49:43,632 --> 01:49:44,294
Oh, no, that's good.

1432
01:49:44,354 --> 01:49:45,858
That hasn't passed yet, right?

1433
01:49:45,938 --> 01:49:52,534
Well, I don't know if anyone's noticed, but given that we are having a relatively short night.

1434
01:49:53,063 --> 01:49:54,064
I haven't been putting the timer on.

1435
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:55,664
God, you haven't put up the buzzer.

1436
01:49:55,845 --> 01:49:56,765
I haven't put up the timer.

1437
01:49:56,785 --> 01:49:57,726
That's pretty good.

1438
01:49:58,486 --> 01:50:04,109
It's because it's supposed to manage when we need to manage time, and we've been good tonight about managing our time.

1439
01:50:04,449 --> 01:50:16,016
I do want to note one thing, which is when we received that email, I did request, ask the question of the mayor about whether there'll be a public report, and specifically with regards to how the council can be a collaborative part of strategic planning.

1440
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:20,178
And she said, yes, there'll be a public report, and we'll be provided with the report and recommendations.

1441
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:26,361
Before we go to members of the Fire Union, I do want to see if there's any further comment by members of the Council.

1442
01:50:29,362 --> 01:50:31,203
Seeing none, name and address for the record, please.

1443
01:50:31,463 --> 01:50:34,164
Danielle Marcelino, 11 Spencer Road, and I'm the Union Secretary.

1444
01:50:35,725 --> 01:50:39,487
So we have the same questions as far as like why they hired a third party and

1445
01:50:40,282 --> 01:50:40,482
that.

1446
01:50:40,502 --> 01:50:42,364
Um, why they picked who they picked.

1447
01:50:43,184 --> 01:50:59,416
I spoke with the chief today regarding this whole thing, and he said that so far the gentleman that is doing the survey is coming up with a lot of the same things that we had to say about the department that were critically understaffed that things need to be improved on all fronts.

1448
01:51:00,097 --> 01:51:03,459
Um and I would hope that anybody who's worth their weight in the

1449
01:51:07,651 --> 01:51:19,340
We, as the fire union, we have actually put together our own, we've solicited the company to do our own study too, just in case we need to bring up our own information.

1450
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:25,204
One of the things that we looked into was who this person was, who the company was and who they've serviced.

1451
01:51:25,324 --> 01:51:32,130
And we were told that they may have contacted or done a study in Woburn, but that isn't true.

1452
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,071
Woburn had no idea about this company.

1453
01:51:35,232 --> 01:51:35,832
In a brief,

1454
01:51:37,179 --> 01:51:40,702
survey of the gentleman that heads up their fire service area.

1455
01:51:41,122 --> 01:51:46,065
He comes from a very different universe than from what we work here in Medford.

1456
01:51:46,165 --> 01:51:51,950
We are a Metro Boston department, so we run around 12,500 runs last year.

1457
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,211
There's 106 of us right now.

1458
01:51:56,193 --> 01:51:59,155
Obviously, there's 65,000 plus residents in the city of Medford.

1459
01:52:00,095 --> 01:52:02,277
He was a career, he had a career in

1460
01:52:03,274 --> 01:52:08,617
Woodbury, Connecticut, that did 310 calls per year last year.

1461
01:52:09,937 --> 01:52:14,260
They were all an entire volunteer staff.

1462
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:21,183
And then he was also the chief in a New Hampshire department that had a census of about 5,000 residents.

1463
01:52:21,583 --> 01:52:22,524
They did 1,111 runs last year.

1464
01:52:27,286 --> 01:52:33,571
and they have two full-time members on their department staffing and everybody else is volunteer.

1465
01:52:33,631 --> 01:52:38,234
So it's just a very different format from what we run here in Medford.

1466
01:52:38,354 --> 01:52:48,902
So it's kind of confusing if they come up with something outside of, or recommendations that are different from what we do, it's kind of hard to compare because he's coming from a different universe.

1467
01:52:48,922 --> 01:52:53,385
Like I wouldn't go to California and tell the YLN firefighters how to do their job.

1468
01:52:56,414 --> 01:53:03,264
We have, like I said, we have our grant, our company that's going to be doing a similar study on safety and staffing.

1469
01:53:03,284 --> 01:53:11,737
And I mean, as far as we knew from the union was just that we got an email saying that they hoped that we would cooperate to identify

1470
01:53:12,569 --> 01:53:16,652
issues impacting services to review policies and assistant planning.

1471
01:53:16,912 --> 01:53:27,060
But we are a career fire department with 106 members that have centuries, hundreds of years of time in service collectively.

1472
01:53:27,481 --> 01:53:36,908
So I feel like we are a professional service that would be able to get together and update these policies to be able to do the right thing for our city that we are all very well versed in.

1473
01:53:37,188 --> 01:53:45,035
Now the six if I can, Mr. President, yes, the 60 year old policies that they're talking about is it's I know we have six year old policies here.

1474
01:53:45,055 --> 01:53:49,318
Like, for instance, we don't I'm milking cows can't roam free.

1475
01:53:50,219 --> 01:53:58,546
Is that the type of stuff that we're seeing in these policies that they're just useless policies that they're old, but they're still there that we just need to take out what some of the Okay.

1476
01:53:59,026 --> 01:54:08,612
Some of them have been slightly updated over the years to be able to accommodate things like we don't utilize the Lawrence Memorial anymore, obviously, if somebody got injured, that kind of thing.

1477
01:54:09,313 --> 01:54:22,020
So things have been slightly tweaked over the years, but as a whole, the policies and procedures, they do need to be revamped, but they could very well be done by us, by our senior staff and whatnot.

1478
01:54:24,282 --> 01:54:26,043
Financial mismanagement, everyone.

1479
01:54:27,538 --> 01:54:28,479
or retaliation.

1480
01:54:28,499 --> 01:54:28,899
I don't know.

1481
01:54:28,939 --> 01:54:29,579
It's one or the other.

1482
01:54:30,039 --> 01:54:37,603
It seems like every week the firefighters are here and we're bringing up something that the mayor is keeps piling on.

1483
01:54:38,104 --> 01:54:40,185
So I'm a little disappointed with that, but thank you.

1484
01:54:40,465 --> 01:54:41,325
And I'm sorry to interrupt.

1485
01:54:42,486 --> 01:54:52,031
Um, no, it's the only other, um, you know, the only other thing that we know, I do know that she was looking at the mayor was looking at

1486
01:54:52,824 --> 01:54:55,085
was a big bone of contention with the former chief, which he freed men.

1487
01:54:55,105 --> 01:54:57,706
I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1488
01:54:57,746 --> 01:54:58,846
Would try to let him settle in.

1489
01:54:58,866 --> 01:55:01,467
But, um, I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1490
01:55:01,487 --> 01:55:04,088
I don't know if she had that conversation with the current chief.

1491
01:55:04,108 --> 01:55:05,029
Would try to let him settle in.

1492
01:55:05,049 --> 01:55:05,169
But, um.

1493
01:55:06,069 --> 01:55:11,211
Things like safety, Chief Friedman was not really willing to compromise on, and obviously we aren't as well.

1494
01:55:11,311 --> 01:55:27,698
So to have another company come in and be paid by the mayor to assess our safety, our services, kind of makes me uncomfortable because if he's drawing a paycheck from her, then it might end up being that it could skew their opinion of what's necessary and what isn't.

1495
01:55:34,175 --> 01:55:34,355
Thank you.

1496
01:55:34,375 --> 01:55:35,796
Any questions for members of the council?

1497
01:55:37,156 --> 01:55:39,317
I have two, if no one else has any.

1498
01:55:40,238 --> 01:55:43,559
Number one, you mentioned a grant councilor Scarbelli, do you guys want to talk about that at all?

1499
01:55:44,099 --> 01:55:45,060
That's good news, can I?

1500
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,000
Please.

1501
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:59,986
Because I know that it's time of the year right now that the firefighters can apply for a grant that they would, I don't know what the agency is, FEMA, that FEMA would allow the city

1502
01:56:01,147 --> 01:56:12,750
to incorporate a grant for as many members to get you to even to where your staff needs to be, and they would pick up the total cost, correct me if I'm wrong, for three years.

1503
01:56:14,073 --> 01:56:14,914
for three years.

1504
01:56:15,314 --> 01:56:17,216
This will make our firefighters whole.

1505
01:56:17,597 --> 01:56:23,863
And we don't have to wait, we don't have to use a penny of this, this community's funding to make that happen.

1506
01:56:24,264 --> 01:56:26,666
When I heard I heard that I was so excited.

1507
01:56:26,706 --> 01:56:29,990
And I just I, you know, it's something it's good that we're hearing some good news.

1508
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:32,112
Can you give us an update with that?

1509
01:56:32,472 --> 01:56:35,475
So we submitted the grant, it was due on Friday, the 12th.

1510
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:36,697
We did submit

1511
01:56:37,611 --> 01:56:48,017
to FEMA, like Councilor Scabali said, it awards, it can award up to however many you ask for.

1512
01:56:48,677 --> 01:56:54,941
The point of the grant is to bring you up to compliance with certain National Fire Protection Agency regulations.

1513
01:56:55,021 --> 01:56:58,983
They pick them, and then we find the need based on what they pick for that year.

1514
01:56:59,604 --> 01:57:02,886
So based on staffing levels right now that we're at 106, we are budgeted for 122.

1515
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:03,906
Technically, we should have

1516
01:57:07,088 --> 01:57:10,510
around 132 based on the National Fire Protection Agency standards.

1517
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:27,359
So initially, we had written the grant to try to acquire 20 extra personnel, which would bring us up to standard for the response to a house fire, which is how they count it, and also the staffing on each individual piece of apparatus.

1518
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:30,841
And that would mean with overtime, what would that do to be fully staffed?

1519
01:57:31,266 --> 01:57:33,668
It would decimate over it would eliminate over time.

1520
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:35,330
Think about that.

1521
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:38,652
So currently, we stand we have, like I said, we're budgeted for 122.

1522
01:57:38,692 --> 01:57:39,493
There's this weird fine line of

1523
01:57:43,547 --> 01:58:09,126
staffing full you know staffing up to a certain point and then being over that it's like it's better to have pay over pay the overtime than it is to staff the members it's and i'm not sure what that line is but um it's hard to get over that hump into the area where now you're fully staffed and you don't need to pay the overtime it's again i don't know what number that is but this grant is beautiful because if you staff appropriately

1524
01:58:09,969 --> 01:58:16,416
It pays for the people for three whole years, and then you have to worry about it three years from now.

1525
01:58:17,398 --> 01:58:27,089
Unfortunately, the way that FEMA awards is they want to see you go from non-compliant, which we're non-compliant right now, to fully compliant, based on the number of people that we work with.

1526
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:27,529
So we're asking for 16.

1527
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:35,873
We were going to ask for 15 because we have five members that are being hired, like, you know, very shortly.

1528
01:58:37,654 --> 01:58:47,758
But I was knocked down to 11 to hire only 11 because we couldn't figure out how they were going to be funded three years from now.

1529
01:58:49,149 --> 01:58:55,535
The purpose for the grant is to spend that three years to be able to find out how you would be able to increase the funding.

1530
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:58,137
So that would get us from 111 to 122.

1531
01:58:58,417 --> 01:59:06,744
It would have gotten us the 15, well, we have five coming on, so it would have brought us up to what, 120, I think 126 was the magic number at that moment.

1532
01:59:06,844 --> 01:59:07,785
Okay, 15 plus, so 20, 106 plus 20.

1533
01:59:07,825 --> 01:59:08,886
Yes, because we have five being hired.

1534
01:59:08,906 --> 01:59:09,707
So now it's 106 plus 16.

1535
01:59:16,288 --> 01:59:19,411
It's five being hired, yeah, and then the 11 additional, I'm sorry, yeah.

1536
01:59:19,992 --> 01:59:23,315
So if I can't through the chair, I'm a little confused.

1537
01:59:23,335 --> 01:59:25,216
So where we put in- We put in for 11.

1538
01:59:27,558 --> 01:59:34,985
We put in for 11 because it was going to, the mayor specifically said she couldn't fund more than 120.

1539
01:59:38,624 --> 01:59:55,398
So we were trying to convey that at the end of the grant period was when we would have to worry about it and that there would be some attrition that would happen at the very end of the grant period that would kind of take up for the remainder, but- I don't want to interrupt, but I thought the stipulations, you have to be at that minimum.

1540
01:59:55,758 --> 02:00:01,043
You have to maintain the current staffing level, which if the grant got awarded, we would be at 111.

1541
02:00:01,343 --> 02:00:01,763
So doesn't it...

1542
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:08,064
So if we're not asking for the 15, we're asking for 11.

1543
02:00:08,204 --> 02:00:11,930
So those four can avoid us from getting this grant.

1544
02:00:12,654 --> 02:00:14,015
No, not that they can void us.

1545
02:00:14,115 --> 02:00:18,478
It's just that we're kind of undershooting, and it's not as favorable to FEMA.

1546
02:00:18,838 --> 02:00:29,086
So they're going to find a city or town that's going to overshoot and show in good faith that they're trying to make big changes in the name of safety and well-being of the city.

1547
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:37,171
So because we undershot, we're probably, it might not make it through the first round, and it might get red in the second round.

1548
02:00:37,271 --> 02:00:41,835
But usually what they want to do is first swipe, they take the people who are making the biggest jumps.

1549
02:00:42,642 --> 02:00:47,503
The additional would have been a big jump for us.

1550
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:48,684
Just so I can get the numbers straight.

1551
02:00:48,704 --> 02:00:56,546
It sounds to me like this FEMA grant based on the National Fire Protection Standards would be, they want us at 132 firefighters.

1552
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:58,166
That would be like the most ideal.

1553
02:00:58,306 --> 02:01:01,167
And that would be like the overshooting if we were shooting for 132.

1554
02:01:02,878 --> 02:01:05,399
we're budgeted for 122, we only have 106.

1555
02:01:05,499 --> 02:01:08,901
We're bringing on five, which gets us to 111.

1556
02:01:09,501 --> 02:01:14,563
And she went for another 11, which just brings us to 122, which we're already budgeted for.

1557
02:01:14,664 --> 02:01:21,707
So this would just be basically using federal money to pay for something we're already budgeting for, not trying to use it to go above the 122.

1558
02:01:21,747 --> 02:01:26,869
And that's because the concern is that after three years, how do you pay for over 122?

1559
02:01:26,909 --> 02:01:26,969
Yes.

1560
02:01:26,989 --> 02:01:27,069
Okay.

1561
02:01:27,089 --> 02:01:27,289
Yeah, sorry.

1562
02:01:31,011 --> 02:01:32,592
It takes a little bit to get into.

1563
02:01:32,832 --> 02:01:35,174
It's not as complicated as how they funded walking court.

1564
02:01:35,194 --> 02:01:37,375
Let me tell you that.

1565
02:01:37,415 --> 02:01:39,176
My last question, if you can, Mr. President.

1566
02:01:39,436 --> 02:01:39,636
Yeah.

1567
02:01:39,836 --> 02:01:47,701
So that would mean that the fight, my hope would be that the fight upon will be exempt for any cuts then, because they would have to maintain that number, correct?

1568
02:01:47,941 --> 02:01:56,064
If we were going to say they do award us, we are not allowed to show any changes in staffing.

1569
02:01:56,104 --> 02:02:00,325
So we submitted the grant on Friday and it said that the budgeted staffing was 122.

1570
02:02:00,965 --> 02:02:09,188
So going into, say awards in July, which I think it's the end of July that they start awarding, they're gonna call for us to submit our roster.

1571
02:02:09,228 --> 02:02:13,349
If our roster or budget is lower than the 122, then they can pull the funding.

1572
02:02:13,509 --> 02:02:14,050
They can pull the award.

1573
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,670
That's good to know.

1574
02:02:15,472 --> 02:02:20,619
But again, we've heard so many negative things in the last, it's good to hear something positive.

1575
02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:26,186
I know, Danielle, you've been instrumental with being the union secretary.

1576
02:02:26,206 --> 02:02:27,667
I know that you've been the busiest person.

1577
02:02:27,707 --> 02:02:31,973
I know that Bobby and Eddie want to say that they are, but I appreciate all your hard work.

1578
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:46,354
Because, because what we're doing with this is we're actually finding alternative ways to fund our firefighters and our fire department for the safety of our community and creative ways and not coming out of the tax base.

1579
02:02:46,415 --> 02:02:49,878
But so I applaud you guys that that was such that's great news.

1580
02:02:50,579 --> 02:02:50,679
And

1581
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:59,907
It went unsaid last year, excuse me, but union members wrote for another FEMA grant last year at this time for equipment and won it.

1582
02:02:59,927 --> 02:03:06,272
And they won, it was like something like 70,000 to replace the compressor that fills our SCBA bottles.

1583
02:03:06,332 --> 02:03:13,578
And then there's several other grants that are kind of, we have one that's coming in that we're waiting to hear about awards.

1584
02:03:13,598 --> 02:03:16,060
And we have another one that was awarded through the state.

1585
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,262
So this is our staff doing all this.

1586
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:22,064
We're paying someone over $10,000 to see what's right for you.

1587
02:03:22,625 --> 02:03:23,566
Just just throwing it out.

1588
02:03:23,586 --> 02:03:24,126
Yes, thank you.

1589
02:03:24,486 --> 02:03:41,980
I just wanted to clarify along those lines when you say we submitted is that the union has submitted or the union work with the chief to submit or the union staff wrote it and the chief submitted I just fired apart the whole fire staff with the exception of the chief is part of the union but we had like firefighters that worked on duty during the day.

1590
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:44,962
Yeah, got together did the research and submitted the grants.

1591
02:03:45,282 --> 02:03:47,565
Great, and it's on behalf of the fire department.

1592
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:49,507
It's on behalf of the fire department, yes.

1593
02:03:49,567 --> 02:03:49,887
Thank you.

1594
02:03:49,907 --> 02:03:54,332
If anybody wants the write-up for the two grants, the two FEMA grants, I'd be happy to send them over.

1595
02:03:54,372 --> 02:03:56,615
It took a long time, so I want people to read it.

1596
02:03:56,755 --> 02:03:57,756
I'll take it.

1597
02:04:03,559 --> 02:04:05,720
Any further comments Councilor Sang?

1598
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:08,801
I just wanted to thank you guys for being so proactive on it.

1599
02:04:09,481 --> 02:04:10,762
I would love to read the grants.

1600
02:04:10,922 --> 02:04:21,366
If there's ways for us to support, like if we can send an individual letters or a letter from Council to support the grant process, just let us know and I think we would be really, really happy to help.

1601
02:04:22,706 --> 02:04:24,127
We'll send you our budget ordinance too.

1602
02:04:24,147 --> 02:04:27,328
See what else you can do.

1603
02:04:29,042 --> 02:04:31,083
Let's see what else, what other magic they can perform.

1604
02:04:31,543 --> 02:04:33,903
Vice President Cog, what do you look like in school building?

1605
02:04:33,923 --> 02:04:36,884
Thank you, President Burris.

1606
02:04:36,924 --> 02:04:38,165
Thank you again for being here.

1607
02:04:38,405 --> 02:04:43,826
And I know from my other line of work, just a glimmer of how much work writing these grant applications is.

1608
02:04:43,866 --> 02:04:46,767
And I know this was a whole, truly a whole crew effort.

1609
02:04:46,787 --> 02:04:47,607
So thank you for that.

1610
02:04:48,007 --> 02:04:50,528
It is really interesting to get a glimpse into.

1611
02:04:51,729 --> 02:05:00,534
This other side of the work of administrating the fire department and just to echo what counselors and counselors are probably put out there you know this council is no stranger to putting together.

1612
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,862
that we can do to bolster the application.

1613
02:05:04,882 --> 02:05:14,386
I think, of course, I'm sure that in a perfect world, we'd all like to see, you know, overshooting, getting up to that, you know, maximum recommended number and using those three years to figure out how to stay there.

1614
02:05:15,326 --> 02:05:29,372
But in lieu of that, you know, it's my hope that hopefully we get great news at the end of July and in that intervening three years is when we're, you know, getting to a place of better resilience with the city's budget so that we can further escalate in a reliable way.

1615
02:05:29,552 --> 02:05:30,173
So thank you again.

1616
02:05:32,918 --> 02:05:33,138
Thank you.

1617
02:05:33,178 --> 02:05:33,919
Any further comments?

1618
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:39,244
I'd just like to say our staffing is incredibly low right now at 106.

1619
02:05:40,525 --> 02:05:48,533
It's impossible to get through shifts basically without overtime at this point, which is exhausting for firefighters.

1620
02:05:48,613 --> 02:05:54,158
I mean, you know, everybody, there was a lot of talk about our overtime budget and earlier in the year.

1621
02:05:54,298 --> 02:05:58,062
And I understand that it looks and sounds great to, you know,

1622
02:05:58,482 --> 02:05:59,404
everybody's getting overtime.

1623
02:05:59,484 --> 02:06:07,156
But the reality of it is, is that that means that we're working 24 hour shifts, and then working additional little shifts after that, that means we don't go home for 36 hours.

1624
02:06:07,717 --> 02:06:12,585
And we have so much overtime that with the old chief, we actually had to sit down

1625
02:06:13,556 --> 02:06:24,100
and discuss one of our own policies to be able to bridge the gap because we couldn't get members, people weren't signing, weren't taking overtime because they either had commitments at home and everything.

1626
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:30,123
So that means that we have to hold members, we have to hold firefighters beyond their shifts, normal shifts.

1627
02:06:30,243 --> 02:06:31,223
Mandatory overtime.

1628
02:06:31,363 --> 02:06:44,278
So then we had to actually accommodate the idea of all right, well, it's more it's actually healthier to ask a firefighter if they would want to work an additional fourth shift, then force a member to come on, you know, work three shifts, excuse me.

1629
02:06:44,758 --> 02:06:44,958
So.

1630
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:52,362
So we kind of we talked to the chief, we all agreed that it was better to like offer this out and let somebody work an additional shift.

1631
02:06:52,382 --> 02:06:58,344
So that means we have 40, we have some members that have worked 48 hours straight, but you don't go home, you're in the station for 48 hours.

1632
02:06:59,524 --> 02:07:01,885
It's a long, it's a long haul at the end of the day.

1633
02:07:01,965 --> 02:07:12,649
So at the end of the two days, so you know, trying to get more personnel to be able to increase staffing and support daily just daily shifts is huge, let alone the safety of

1634
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:17,011
the members on the fire ground, you know, responding to fires and whatnot in the city.

1635
02:07:17,531 --> 02:07:21,493
After the next five coming through, is there any more pipeline updates that you've received?

1636
02:07:22,053 --> 02:07:24,555
I don't, we don't know about the hiring now.

1637
02:07:24,675 --> 02:07:24,855
Got it.

1638
02:07:24,915 --> 02:07:26,235
All right.

1639
02:07:27,976 --> 02:07:28,897
Any further discussion?

1640
02:07:32,559 --> 02:07:34,299
We do have one person on Zoom.

1641
02:07:34,359 --> 02:07:35,960
I'll go to Maureen on Zoom.

1642
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,441
Name and address for the record please.

1643
02:07:39,975 --> 02:07:43,160
Are you done on 55 Ellsworth Street Medford mask.

1644
02:07:43,982 --> 02:07:49,130
Um, I broached this subject when I spoke a while ago, and

1645
02:07:51,991 --> 02:07:59,196
Thank you so very much to the firefighters and the union for researching this grant money.

1646
02:08:01,158 --> 02:08:10,405
And so my question is, between the fire department, the police department, the MWRA, the MBTA,

1647
02:08:14,346 --> 02:08:34,161
schools aside, I don't know who we could approach, is there any one individual working in the administration or a group of individuals working in the administration to look at or investigate those grants that are out there that the city of Medford would qualify?

1648
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:38,245
Councilman Scott Pelley keeps talking about

1649
02:08:38,945 --> 02:08:48,574
you know, transparency and, you know, we have spoken already about, you know, outsourcing jobs that could be filled within the city.

1650
02:08:48,594 --> 02:08:51,797
And it seems to me like we're spending

1651
02:08:52,915 --> 02:09:13,997
close to a million dollars a year, if not more, paying outside city solicitors, outside water resource people, and again, outsourcing the job to look at and evaluate the current Medford Fire Department and its needs.

1652
02:09:15,218 --> 02:09:16,739
There's a lot of money out there.

1653
02:09:16,879 --> 02:09:19,579
FEMA is a federal agency.

1654
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:39,645
And once again, I ask if there's anyone looking on the current administration at local state government and federal government grants that we could call upon or apply for to solve some of the money issues within the city of Medford.

1655
02:09:39,985 --> 02:09:40,365
Thank you.

1656
02:09:41,752 --> 02:09:42,253
Thank you, Maureen.

1657
02:09:42,273 --> 02:09:46,337
There are a number of people on the city staff who look at different grants.

1658
02:09:46,357 --> 02:09:51,583
We have a CDBG, which is Community Development Block Grant, and other grants manager in the planning department.

1659
02:09:51,683 --> 02:09:53,965
There's a federal funds manager in the finance department.

1660
02:09:54,966 --> 02:09:58,791
And the city actually has been historically very successful at bringing in outside grant funding.

1661
02:09:59,952 --> 02:10:01,373
And I super appreciate hearing.

1662
02:10:02,374 --> 02:10:03,435
It's a testament what you just said.

1663
02:10:03,455 --> 02:10:04,476
You've been successful in the past.

1664
02:10:04,496 --> 02:10:05,778
You're hoping to be successful again.

1665
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:10,782
Oftentimes, departments are looking for grants in their specific fields.

1666
02:10:10,922 --> 02:10:16,488
Chief Buckley's been up here before from the police department talking about grants that people on his team have looked at.

1667
02:10:18,089 --> 02:10:20,792
But, you know, in general, these grants are for

1668
02:10:21,494 --> 02:10:29,116
specific purposes and are meant for specific projects, not to supplement the city's need for operating funds.

1669
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:30,457
So that's one of the major issues.

1670
02:10:30,497 --> 02:10:40,740
I think that sounds like one of the issues you ran into here is that, you know, this grant is ideally to go beyond what the city is doing on operating funds.

1671
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:48,862
So it's while the city has brought in a lot of grants, and if you go to the city finance department page and you look at what's called the ACFR,

1672
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:51,276
comprehensive financial report.

1673
02:10:51,337 --> 02:11:07,692
You can see there's a line in there and you and in some years, the city's brought in as many as 10 million 15 million in grants, but they're generally one off like the 2 million brought in for the car park project or, you know, money brought in to hire specific staff for specific studies or specific times and not to supplement.

1674
02:11:08,959 --> 02:11:10,420
the general fund budget.

1675
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:31,569
The only money that comes to us to supplement the general fund budget is from the state Chapter 90 program, the UGA, which is the worst name, Unrestricted General Government Aid, and Chapter 70 school funding, which are generally the only thing out there where we as a city get money to fund the general fund that doesn't come from local taxes and fees.

1676
02:11:33,724 --> 02:11:48,910
Could I take the opportunity to thank you, President Beers, for focusing a lot on the creosol road MBTA ties that are out there.

1677
02:11:49,051 --> 02:11:52,592
As someone already spoke to, it's a known carcinogen.

1678
02:11:53,032 --> 02:11:55,633
And thank you for your effort there.

1679
02:11:55,693 --> 02:11:57,654
It's really appreciated by the city.

1680
02:11:57,674 --> 02:11:59,235
Thank you.

1681
02:11:59,295 --> 02:11:59,855
I appreciate it.

1682
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,561
Hopefully, we can actually solve this.

1683
02:12:06,223 --> 02:12:09,385
Any further comments, questions on the paper before us?

1684
02:12:09,585 --> 02:12:10,146
Mr. Jones.

1685
02:12:10,726 --> 02:12:11,267
Yes, sir.

1686
02:12:11,587 --> 02:12:12,568
Bob Jones, 5 St.

1687
02:12:12,588 --> 02:12:13,088
Mary Street.

1688
02:12:14,249 --> 02:12:14,910
It's amazing.

1689
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:20,274
We have a fire station on Salem Street that's been out of service for over a year.

1690
02:12:21,255 --> 02:12:25,699
We have a sidewalk and ramp area in front of West Memphis Station that I've been writing up for five years.

1691
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:31,464
But all of a sudden, we get a consultant that's going to come into the fire department and revamp our fire department.

1692
02:12:32,506 --> 02:12:35,547
completely unnecessary, as we just discussed.

1693
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:40,468
We're at the lowest point we've been in my 23 years on the job at 106 members.

1694
02:12:41,848 --> 02:12:43,808
The money should be going to a firefighter.

1695
02:12:44,288 --> 02:12:46,009
We have plenty of repairs that need to be made.

1696
02:12:46,669 --> 02:12:52,490
There is much institutional knowledge on the fire department that can do the work of this consultant.

1697
02:12:53,950 --> 02:12:57,111
We have policies and procedures that get updated every day.

1698
02:12:58,114 --> 02:12:59,434
There's something that needs to be updated.

1699
02:12:59,534 --> 02:13:01,975
It's pushed out by the chief of the administration of the training division.

1700
02:13:02,595 --> 02:13:04,095
This is completely unnecessary.

1701
02:13:05,415 --> 02:13:07,376
This goes along with the study route.

1702
02:13:07,776 --> 02:13:08,796
Let's do another study.

1703
02:13:09,376 --> 02:13:15,818
And if the study says what the union said, and everybody in the fight department said, I don't know if they're going to listen.

1704
02:13:15,918 --> 02:13:21,399
City administration maybe will listen if they hire somebody and they say the same things that we do.

1705
02:13:22,459 --> 02:13:23,999
But I think the report will be buried.

1706
02:13:24,039 --> 02:13:26,980
I'd love to get a copy of it if at all possible.

1707
02:13:28,514 --> 02:13:43,346
The other thing that I don't know if kind of glossed over it's just a Marcelino said that if we went for another four firefighters for this grant, we'd have a much better opportunity to get past the first round of funding, but the city was reluctant to do so.

1708
02:13:44,327 --> 02:13:49,872
So that would be much more beneficial for us to go that route, the grant has been submitted.

1709
02:13:50,813 --> 02:13:51,793
And as we spoke about.

1710
02:13:52,734 --> 02:14:02,637
Many times, the city, in my opinion, has been saying this for 20 years, should have full-time grant writers on staff to write these grants and bring money back to the city.

1711
02:14:02,897 --> 02:14:13,401
As you mentioned, Zach, it sounds like there are other departmental members that are doing these grants, as well as their other job, as Sister Marcelino has done.

1712
02:14:14,477 --> 02:14:37,893
something that it's there's a learning curve to it it's something that you need to research and get good at so if we're doing one-offs it's not as beneficial it's not as as easy for somebody to do as somebody that would be doing it all the time they'll get that grant writing uh learning curve out of the way and they'll be able to do it and be more successful

1713
02:14:38,874 --> 02:14:45,776
So again, I just, again, wasting money on this consultant for something that we could do ourselves.

1714
02:14:46,956 --> 02:14:47,997
I appreciate your time, thanks.

1715
02:14:48,017 --> 02:14:49,797
So if I can, Mr. President, if I can.

1716
02:14:49,817 --> 02:14:50,837
Councilor Scarpa.

1717
02:14:50,938 --> 02:14:51,518
I apologize.

1718
02:14:51,978 --> 02:14:53,018
And this is what I was trying to get to.

1719
02:14:54,158 --> 02:14:58,420
So, because I want to make this as a motion, if it's true, especially coming to budget season.

1720
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:05,982
So our chances, if we went to those other four firefighters and we went full board with this,

1721
02:15:07,090 --> 02:15:15,712
because this is what I was told, is that we would have a substantially better opportunity by doing that.

1722
02:15:16,032 --> 02:15:16,312
Correct.

1723
02:15:16,712 --> 02:15:23,214
Okay, so in a form of a motion, I'd like to ask the mayor, why wouldn't we look at four more firefighters to make us whole?

1724
02:15:24,014 --> 02:15:31,556
If we can do that, Mr. President, because as we get into the budget season, and we lose a huge opportunity because we didn't go all the way.

1725
02:15:31,576 --> 02:15:32,456
We went with

1726
02:15:34,189 --> 02:15:38,510
We went with what 11 we said, and we needed 15 to make get us to that point.

1727
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:41,131
And we would eliminate all that money for overtime.

1728
02:15:43,071 --> 02:15:45,252
We would we would have it paid for for three years.

1729
02:15:47,293 --> 02:15:50,233
Okay, I thought that's what I thought.

1730
02:15:50,493 --> 02:15:52,634
And that's why I'm a little perplexed right now.

1731
02:15:52,814 --> 02:15:55,915
So one of the biggest points that

1732
02:15:56,789 --> 02:16:13,793
going like right now with this month being budget season, if our budget drops below the 122 and we should get awarded by FEMA and they see that we went below 122, we are going to lose the money.

1733
02:16:13,913 --> 02:16:20,894
They will say that the city is not invested in the personnel and they're not going to award the bad behavior of cutting personnel.

1734
02:16:21,794 --> 02:16:24,935
And this wasn't like submitted in the interest of,

1735
02:16:25,695 --> 02:16:28,377
you know, trying to hold anybody's feet to the fire or anything like that.

1736
02:16:28,497 --> 02:16:32,039
This is, we need staffing, like we desperately need staffing.

1737
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:38,924
We are not showing up under compliance to a two, I think we call it a two and a half story wood front.

1738
02:16:38,944 --> 02:16:46,669
So any of the houses that are just single family homes that are two stories and an attic, we are not showing up under compliance to those fires.

1739
02:16:47,109 --> 02:16:50,752
Our staff on the fire trucks every day is under compliance.

1740
02:16:50,912 --> 02:16:53,774
We're supposed to have four and we only have three on every piece.

1741
02:16:54,554 --> 02:17:06,200
So if God forbid something ever happened and they come in and they do the investigation afterwards, which they always do, the first thing they say is that our staffing was not up to compliance.

1742
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:10,962
Senate PA 1710, they do have standards that they go by and Senate PA 1710 is what you're speaking about.

1743
02:17:10,982 --> 02:17:12,423
It's a very complicated process.

1744
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:18,526
This grant will go through multiple rounds and to make it past the first round is obviously your first hurdle.

1745
02:17:19,226 --> 02:17:22,768
Had those four more firefighters, you got a better opportunity to get past that first round.

1746
02:17:22,948 --> 02:17:23,749
Where it stands now,

1747
02:17:24,696 --> 02:17:32,381
So through the chair, as a council, if we can have our president send a message to the mayor, can we adjust those numbers?

1748
02:17:32,461 --> 02:17:34,123
Unfortunately, it's too late.

1749
02:17:34,463 --> 02:17:38,946
Once FEMA closes, it's like they don't accept anything after the fact.

1750
02:17:42,188 --> 02:17:44,230
I mean, I think, sorry, and I'll go to Councilor Kiley.

1751
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:48,693
I think we're almost around the horseshoe here to the point that I think

1752
02:17:50,054 --> 02:17:51,635
I'll speak for myself and for no one else.

1753
02:17:52,335 --> 02:17:59,080
One of the reasons I ran for office here is because this city makes penny wise pound foolish decisions all the time because there's not enough money.

1754
02:18:00,461 --> 02:18:02,102
And that's where we come around, right?

1755
02:18:03,373 --> 02:18:08,734
we don't wanna submit 126, because then we might have to pay for four in three years.

1756
02:18:09,415 --> 02:18:15,336
Even though we get three years of money, we're worried about paying for four, three years from now, because we don't have the money to pay for the four, three years from now.

1757
02:18:15,836 --> 02:18:18,057
And that's the larger question here, right?

1758
02:18:18,097 --> 02:18:28,680
Like we can write grants, we can try to bring in more money, we can do these questions, but if we're constantly in the position of, and that's like saying, we've all talked about here tonight, that's if it doesn't go down more.

1759
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:34,742
We're hoping that we'll stay at 122 for three years, because at least then we won't be more penalized.

1760
02:18:35,642 --> 02:18:39,244
And that's where my frustration really comes in, in the long run.

1761
02:18:40,504 --> 02:18:45,506
I can understand both positions, because the city has never raised more.

1762
02:18:45,566 --> 02:18:54,530
The city's never, since 2 and 1 half in 1980 said, when I believe when we've talked about there were 150 firefighters back then, and now we're down to 140, 130, now we're down to 122.

1763
02:18:57,981 --> 02:19:04,583
There's nothing in the last 40 years of city government evidence that the city's gonna say, okay, we're gonna bring the money back to go back to at least 126 or 132.

1764
02:19:04,883 --> 02:19:10,784
So the mayor says, oh, well, and I mean, it comes down to this too, right?

1765
02:19:10,864 --> 02:19:17,346
It sounds to me like that's not gonna be the, even if we do go back and ask for more, that's not gonna be the first thing we go back and ask for.

1766
02:19:17,446 --> 02:19:20,747
So we're not gonna put in the grant and then we're never gonna get the grant, right?

1767
02:19:23,651 --> 02:19:29,537
I don't think he'll be saying anything to say that we've disagreed on things, you and I, Mr. Jones here.

1768
02:19:30,338 --> 02:19:31,339
People usually do.

1769
02:19:31,799 --> 02:19:40,448
And when we usually do, and I disagree with all of my fellow councillors sometimes and members of the public, but this is where all of this stuff comes back to the core of it.

1770
02:19:41,858 --> 02:20:02,366
financial mismanagement you're right well well it's it's we can say it's if you want to call financial mismanagement then it's 40 years of financial mismanagement and and a set of bad practices that this administration the previous administration and the administration before it held and i'm willing to i'm willing to to go down for that one you know but it's a it's a lack of imagination and understanding and and going and saying

1771
02:20:03,326 --> 02:20:05,067
we need more money than we're raising.

1772
02:20:05,287 --> 02:20:07,508
If we're never going to raise it, then we're never going to invest.

1773
02:20:07,768 --> 02:20:15,251
And then you're stuck in these positions where it's actually cheaper to put $10,000 outside than bring someone inside or do the $122,000 than the $126,000.

1774
02:20:15,471 --> 02:20:20,633
And now I've gone on too long from the chair and probably said too much of an opinion from the chair, so I'm going to stop.

1775
02:20:20,673 --> 02:20:21,293
Councillor Callahan.

1776
02:20:22,059 --> 02:20:22,739
Thank you.

1777
02:20:23,399 --> 02:20:28,701
So I'm sad that we cannot have any impact over that, and it's too late.

1778
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:35,623
And so all I'm saying is to you guys, but also to anyone else, don't hesitate to come to us.

1779
02:20:36,163 --> 02:20:43,685
If we can put pressure and make the difference between that FEMA grant being in a better position to pass, then reach out.

1780
02:20:44,806 --> 02:20:49,347
And secondly, I really wanted to talk a little bit about this question of mismanagement.

1781
02:20:50,267 --> 02:20:55,890
because I think it is raised all the time, the question of wasting money.

1782
02:20:57,231 --> 02:21:00,452
And I'm curious about it, and I want to learn more.

1783
02:21:00,472 --> 02:21:06,235
I want to ensure that we know in terms of transparency and that the community knows how money is being spent.

1784
02:21:06,636 --> 02:21:15,920
But I do also think there's another question that we haven't been talking about as much about recently, which is being able to

1785
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:18,501
the fire department.

1786
02:21:18,541 --> 02:21:23,482
We have run departments where sorry, um, support being supportive of unions.

1787
02:21:23,522 --> 02:21:27,783
We have many unions in the city that do not get contracts for years.

1788
02:21:28,544 --> 02:21:36,265
Um my opinion of what has been happening this year with the fire department is that it really has demoralized

1789
02:21:43,127 --> 02:21:49,069
a fan of what has been going on between the mayor and the fire department, as I said at one of the previous meetings.

1790
02:21:49,909 --> 02:22:05,193
So I am interested in understanding, I really question how you guys can have a consulting firm where you're already looking into this, the mayor is doing separate consulting firm and the wisdom of that.

1791
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:11,215
And from a union perspective, that it seems like you're,

1792
02:22:12,834 --> 02:22:17,178
many combined years of experience is not being looked to at all.

1793
02:22:18,679 --> 02:22:31,451
You know, I have to say that I do really question the wisdom of this, and that I want to be supportive of the fire union, and I will leave it at that.

1794
02:22:33,332 --> 02:22:34,113
Thank you, Councilor Kellyanne.

1795
02:22:34,133 --> 02:22:34,874
Any further discussion?

1796
02:22:38,078 --> 02:22:39,739
I think we all want the same things.

1797
02:22:39,799 --> 02:22:43,682
We want to adequately protect the citizens' property and benefit.

1798
02:22:43,782 --> 02:22:47,245
That's what we're here for, that's what we advocate for, and that's what we're trying to do here.

1799
02:22:47,605 --> 02:22:48,346
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1800
02:23:06,311 --> 02:23:21,834
Danielle Masolino, you should be credited for what you're doing and put on a pedestal because this is exactly what, no matter what the junk you guys have been dealing with, no matter how angry everybody's getting, you're sitting down at a desk and doing real work to make a difference.

1801
02:23:21,954 --> 02:23:29,536
And sometimes I feel like I sit here and I yell and we get mad at each other and then you go home and you say, what did I just accomplish?

1802
02:23:30,076 --> 02:23:30,796
We didn't do anything.

1803
02:23:31,556 --> 02:23:38,727
But I want to make sure that I acknowledge for one, I know I feel that my counselors feel the same thing that you're doing.

1804
02:23:39,838 --> 02:23:44,081
they're doing what we should all be doing, and that's putting your nose down and going to work and getting it done.

1805
02:23:44,661 --> 02:23:56,368
And I just hope that in the end, we're sitting here and we name the new Marcelino Fire Station after you, because the whole staff is going to be staffed by your grants.

1806
02:23:57,149 --> 02:23:57,789
That's my hope.

1807
02:23:57,869 --> 02:23:58,610
So, but thank you.

1808
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,251
She was hired on the same program.

1809
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:02,412
Oh, really?

1810
02:24:02,672 --> 02:24:03,012
Oh, wow.

1811
02:24:03,032 --> 02:24:03,613
That's awesome.

1812
02:24:03,673 --> 02:24:04,093
Okay.

1813
02:24:04,773 --> 02:24:05,754
Well, again, so thank you.

1814
02:24:05,794 --> 02:24:07,195
The chief didn't want to put in for them.

1815
02:24:08,697 --> 02:24:09,598
appreciate that.

1816
02:24:10,078 --> 02:24:10,598
Thank you.

1817
02:24:10,638 --> 02:24:11,219
Thank you very much.

1818
02:24:11,279 --> 02:24:18,525
We appreciate the time in the effort as always, and I think, you know, just to echo what Councilor Kellyanne said.

1819
02:24:20,046 --> 02:24:30,293
We have so much work to do, and when we are taking our time and our energy at cross purposes rather than in the same direction, that's a disservice to getting the work done.

1820
02:24:30,394 --> 02:24:31,735
So I think, you know,

1821
02:24:32,608 --> 02:24:41,794
we can agree to disagree, but if we're moving in the same direction, and I appreciate that that is happening, that many of us are trying to do that, and if we could all do it better, we'd be in a much better position.

1822
02:24:41,814 --> 02:24:43,796
So thank you for your work.

1823
02:24:44,076 --> 02:24:44,416
Thank you.

1824
02:24:45,317 --> 02:24:45,617
Thank you.

1825
02:24:45,697 --> 02:25:01,428
Is there a motion to send the question to the mayor, if I can, on the reasoning for that, why we didn't move forward with those four other firefighters to give us a better opportunity to achieve this FEMA grant?

1826
02:25:02,418 --> 02:25:04,019
Okay, let me just get that down.

1827
02:25:04,319 --> 02:25:19,226
Motion to request answer from mayor on FEMA grant being submitted for 11 firefighters instead of 15 firefighters.

1828
02:25:19,406 --> 02:25:20,166
Correct.

1829
02:25:20,886 --> 02:25:25,289
For better outcome grant process.

1830
02:25:26,229 --> 02:25:30,451
I don't know why she wouldn't do the four unless she has a secret she's not telling us.

1831
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:38,067
All right, so on the motion by Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1832
02:25:38,347 --> 02:25:40,008
Madam Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

1833
02:25:43,431 --> 02:25:44,392
Councillor Callaghan.

1834
02:25:44,492 --> 02:25:44,712
Yes.

1835
02:25:46,333 --> 02:25:47,354
Vice President Collins.

1836
02:25:47,394 --> 02:25:47,614
Yes.

1837
02:25:49,176 --> 02:25:50,557
Councillor Lazzaro.

1838
02:25:50,677 --> 02:25:50,937
Yes.

1839
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:53,199
Councillor Lemming.

1840
02:25:53,739 --> 02:25:54,100
Yes.

1841
02:25:56,041 --> 02:25:57,122
Councillor Scarpelli.

1842
02:25:57,422 --> 02:25:57,662
Yes.

1843
02:25:58,983 --> 02:25:59,724
Councillor Tang.

1844
02:26:00,305 --> 02:26:00,485
Yes.

1845
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:02,041
Mr McGiven.

1846
02:26:02,061 --> 02:26:02,861
Yes 70 from him.

1847
02:26:02,981 --> 02:26:09,867
The negative motion passes 24 dash 079 resolution request update on the crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

1848
02:26:10,087 --> 02:26:11,067
Councillor Scarpelli.

1849
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:15,351
The I just wanted to

1850
02:26:25,058 --> 02:26:28,741
We're hearing some issues with the Crystal Campbell fountain.

1851
02:26:28,841 --> 02:26:31,843
I know that there have been some movement.

1852
02:26:32,723 --> 02:26:35,745
I guess they tested the computer to get the fountain moving.

1853
02:26:37,507 --> 02:26:40,248
And we're hoping to get it going for yesterday's marathon.

1854
02:26:40,749 --> 02:26:43,290
Unfortunately, it didn't it didn't come to fruition.

1855
02:26:44,671 --> 02:26:49,655
There is talking to Mr. McGiven talking to former counselors, there is a concern.

1856
02:26:50,435 --> 02:26:54,398
And I hope to be a mediation immediate for that for this process that

1857
02:26:55,118 --> 02:27:10,272
When Mayor McGlynn did the fundraising for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, he made sure that no matter what his existence would be in Medford, he would leave it into a trust with an organization that would oversee the funding.

1858
02:27:11,584 --> 02:27:18,307
because I think the fear was it would raise all this money, and then when the city needed in bad times, it will be forgotten.

1859
02:27:19,147 --> 02:27:21,168
And there's some confusion.

1860
02:27:21,208 --> 02:27:29,372
I've talked to Mr. McGiven that there was words that, there was word going back and forth that the reason why they couldn't do it is because they weren't releasing the funding.

1861
02:27:30,052 --> 02:27:39,457
I talked to former counselors that said the funding would have been released, but they wanted more of a detailed itemized breakdown for what that funding is, because that's what the trust asked for.

1862
02:27:40,337 --> 02:27:42,638
Um, and unfortunately, that didn't happen.

1863
02:27:42,778 --> 02:27:48,900
So I believe the city move forward to make the changes needed to fix it on their own.

1864
02:27:49,720 --> 02:28:02,303
The other piece of that is what people are really upset about when you've been around, you saw the original garden with the fountain on the lights on, and then all of the sunflowers and crystals name.

1865
02:28:02,604 --> 02:28:03,584
She loves sunflowers.

1866
02:28:04,304 --> 02:28:05,505
and they planted flowers.

1867
02:28:05,906 --> 02:28:12,293
I mean, it was an amazing area and it was so peaceful and a lot of people really took ownership of that.

1868
02:28:12,533 --> 02:28:22,063
So there's been some, there's something going on between the people running the trust and the relationship with the mayor and trying to have trust there.

1869
02:28:22,944 --> 02:28:49,168
So I talked to Mr. McGiven to reach out that if they want me or any of the council to be involved to try to mediate this, to try to make sure that ultimately the trust is there to fix the garden and keep the garden, the planting of the plants funded through the trust and the city also understanding that just do your due diligence, presents what they're asking for if it's three quotes,

1870
02:28:50,657 --> 02:28:51,818
they know what they're paying for.

1871
02:28:52,218 --> 02:28:54,240
So legally, they can lease that money.

1872
02:28:54,841 --> 02:28:56,703
And I think that's what that's where we are.

1873
02:28:56,763 --> 02:28:58,164
So we are close.

1874
02:28:58,384 --> 02:29:04,530
I know that I did talk to a few dbw members that were there when they were testing the computer for the fountain.

1875
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,671
But I

1876
02:29:05,911 --> 02:29:17,737
I think we're still a ways away before seeing what that garden deserves to be with the lights, the fountain, the colorful water that changes colors, and then the garden that goes around.

1877
02:29:17,797 --> 02:29:18,657
I think that's important.

1878
02:29:18,697 --> 02:29:20,578
So thank you for your time, Mr. President.

1879
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:39,000
I would ask for meeting with Mr. McGiven, myself in the trust, or anybody else in the council would like to join us to try to find a resolution to do what this trust was intended to do, and that's keep the garden in Crystal's honor, because we can't forget that.

1880
02:29:42,113 --> 02:29:43,193
She was a special person.

1881
02:29:44,413 --> 02:29:45,834
Her family was great people.

1882
02:29:46,394 --> 02:29:54,315
My wife ran the Boston Marathon for five years in her name with her friends from UMass Boston.

1883
02:29:54,915 --> 02:29:57,616
And that garden did mean a lot to their family.

1884
02:29:58,476 --> 02:30:06,377
In the worst time of their lives, the city of Method gave them something that they could always go to and feel that crystal spirit was still there.

1885
02:30:06,417 --> 02:30:09,538
So there's gotta be something done and we have to figure it out.

1886
02:30:09,718 --> 02:30:10,398
Let's figure that out.

1887
02:30:11,098 --> 02:30:11,438
Thank you.

1888
02:30:11,878 --> 02:30:14,820
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1889
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:22,103
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to refer the paper to the DPW Commissioner, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro.

1890
02:30:22,123 --> 02:30:27,265
Councillor Callahan, Councillor Saint.

1891
02:30:28,045 --> 02:30:29,726
So I just had a question.

1892
02:30:29,746 --> 02:30:34,128
It seems that no one really is in charge of making sure that this happens.

1893
02:30:34,775 --> 02:30:40,378
No one at the trust is in charge, no one at DPW is in charge, and this sort of has just gone on because nobody's been focusing on it.

1894
02:30:40,438 --> 02:30:44,819
Is there any way to get somebody to, it's their responsibility to focus on it, or is that, you know?

1895
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:46,120
I think that's what we're asking for.

1896
02:30:46,140 --> 02:30:58,666
We're asking for a sit down with it, whether it's mediation, where we're setting, because I think there's a lack of trust on the trust side because of the lack of support from central administration.

1897
02:30:58,686 --> 02:31:01,167
It's not Tim, I think Tim's doing the best he can.

1898
02:31:01,707 --> 02:31:12,658
But I think maybe another elective fit body that comes into place says, hey, let's support this trust and make sure the funding and the processes used the way it was intended to.

1899
02:31:13,098 --> 02:31:18,604
So I think, like I said, I think Mayor McGlynn did this for the sole purpose of the money not disappearing and being used somewhere else.

1900
02:31:19,124 --> 02:31:24,109
And people forget that people actually donated thousands of dollars to go directly to that.

1901
02:31:24,890 --> 02:31:30,052
So, you know, and it's important to see that last year was the 10th year anniversary.

1902
02:31:30,672 --> 02:31:39,855
And I know that family members and friends from UMass and the running team, they really wanted to be here to do the celebration to kick off the marathon, and they couldn't do it last year.

1903
02:31:39,875 --> 02:31:40,975
So it was super disappointing.

1904
02:31:42,015 --> 02:31:47,017
So, and there's a lot of people put a lot of hard work to make sure that happened in a short period of time.

1905
02:31:47,057 --> 02:31:47,577
If you remember,

1906
02:31:48,257 --> 02:31:58,902
I mean, at the time, as soon as this happened, me and McGlynn really started moving quickly and getting funding for, you know, third parties to come in and donate a lot of money to make this happen.

1907
02:31:58,942 --> 02:32:00,363
So thank you.

1908
02:32:01,363 --> 02:32:01,784
Thank you.

1909
02:32:02,064 --> 02:32:02,544
Tell her say.

1910
02:32:04,773 --> 02:32:12,094
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for putting this on the agenda and going beyond that and doing the research for our council.

1911
02:32:14,355 --> 02:32:20,516
What happened on one Boston day so many years ago was such a tragedy in our community.

1912
02:32:20,616 --> 02:32:22,996
And I really felt it very strongly.

1913
02:32:23,056 --> 02:32:25,217
It's something that we were around for.

1914
02:32:25,737 --> 02:32:31,598
And we created this wonderful thing to memorialize Crystal Campbell.

1915
02:32:32,918 --> 02:32:39,823
you know, to let it go by the wayside is such a, you know, honestly, it's kind of a disgrace on our part.

1916
02:32:40,604 --> 02:32:53,114
I, you know, I think a lot of residents and I were, you know, have been, you know, this is one of those issues where people ask once in a while, and it slips through the cracks when we don't unify our forces on it.

1917
02:32:54,415 --> 02:32:57,357
You know, the way that we did when this was first made.

1918
02:32:57,477 --> 02:33:01,260
I remember actually, even for the dedication, I was in the string ensemble playing for it.

1919
02:33:03,181 --> 02:33:10,462
Um, I, you know, a lot of residents have been asking, and I've been wondering too about the trust and, you know, what was going on in that end.

1920
02:33:10,662 --> 02:33:13,903
It's super helpful that, you know, you've given us context for that.

1921
02:33:13,963 --> 02:33:17,564
And so, um, you know, I think this is just the thing of accountability.

1922
02:33:18,304 --> 02:33:28,226
It's, it's, if you, you know, I think the rules are written out pretty clearly, and as long as we hold ourselves accountable to it, as long as city administration is holding that trust, we should be able to do it.

1923
02:33:28,426 --> 02:33:29,046
It shouldn't be a problem.

1924
02:33:29,286 --> 02:33:30,246
It shouldn't be a problem, right?

1925
02:33:31,106 --> 02:33:33,287
and evidently we've fallen flat.

1926
02:33:33,487 --> 02:33:35,827
And so I thank you for your efforts.

1927
02:33:36,267 --> 02:33:37,127
I totally support this.

1928
02:33:37,647 --> 02:33:43,389
As much as we can do as a council to build, to be the ones who are accountable, I would support that.

1929
02:33:45,829 --> 02:33:46,169
Thank you.

1930
02:33:46,189 --> 02:33:46,369
Thank you.

1931
02:33:46,529 --> 02:33:51,010
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro to refer to the DPW Commissioner.

1932
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:52,370
Any further comment?

1933
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:55,431
Any comment by members of the public?

1934
02:33:56,131 --> 02:33:57,711
Mr. Casta, any name and address for the record, please?

1935
02:33:57,791 --> 02:33:58,832
Thank you for your kindness.

1936
02:33:58,872 --> 02:33:59,952
Thank you for your time, sir.

1937
02:34:00,811 --> 02:34:01,291
You're welcome.

1938
02:34:01,672 --> 02:34:02,853
How much time do I have?

1939
02:34:02,873 --> 02:34:09,759
You need to buy me one of those.

1940
02:34:09,779 --> 02:34:14,864
I hope everyone had a great Patriots Day yesterday.

1941
02:34:16,305 --> 02:34:22,291
Because if it wasn't for those Patriots, we wouldn't have a democratic republic, if we can keep it.

1942
02:34:25,851 --> 02:34:27,632
Yesterday, I walked by the fountain.

1943
02:34:28,032 --> 02:34:30,954
I didn't see any H2O water action.

1944
02:34:30,974 --> 02:34:33,616
I went to the festivities at the old cemetery.

1945
02:34:34,776 --> 02:34:40,720
And it was a sad thing that happened to me on my way to this forum.

1946
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:48,944
First off, last November, I was here questioning the councilors, but they didn't answer because they did not have to, they said.

1947
02:34:49,685 --> 02:34:52,967
But City Councilor Caviello told us

1948
02:34:54,363 --> 02:35:00,749
the city, that the city has funds in place to fix the Crystal Campbell waterfall.

1949
02:35:01,369 --> 02:35:11,658
It's not just for her, it's for the other three dead people and the hundreds of injured and maimed people for life from all over the world.

1950
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:22,107
But sadly, after many years, the Marathon Memorial Fountain is still not working.

1951
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,402
It's a damn shame on who.

1952
02:35:28,364 --> 02:35:28,984
I need names.

1953
02:35:30,085 --> 02:35:39,434
McGlynn spent lots of hours, he gathered tens of thousands of dollars, and I guess he started a trust.

1954
02:35:40,035 --> 02:35:46,020
Well, maybe McGlynn, Michael, can come here and tell us what he did.

1955
02:35:47,422 --> 02:35:48,463
He should be concerned.

1956
02:35:49,895 --> 02:35:52,597
and you can tell us how to rectify this problem.

1957
02:35:53,358 --> 02:36:05,768
Hopefully, the developers of that font were not that stupid to have it to a point in order to replace whatever the issue is, computer, the pump, Van Halen, whatever.

1958
02:36:06,469 --> 02:36:08,891
But hopefully, you don't have to start ripping up cement.

1959
02:36:09,771 --> 02:36:13,494
This is typical of Method USA 0215.

1960
02:36:14,876 --> 02:36:17,097
This is a damn shame.

1961
02:36:18,118 --> 02:36:18,619
Can someone

1962
02:36:20,131 --> 02:36:23,093
tell me how this is gonna get rectified, anyone.

1963
02:36:25,215 --> 02:36:29,238
In my discussions with everyone, the trust is in place.

1964
02:36:29,579 --> 02:36:46,452
There's a person in charge of the trust that is in charge of all the money, that has criteria set in place that when the funding needs to be addressed for the planting of the flowers, any upkeep of the fountain, that the city who's in charge of the site

1965
02:36:47,293 --> 02:36:58,442
presents the trust with a breakdown, a financial breakdown, that's reasonable to what the trust rules were, so they can then cut them the check.

1966
02:36:59,022 --> 02:37:10,231
The problem is, I think there's, I think the person you gotta talk to is go across the hall, talk to the mayor's office, and ask what their role is with this, Mr. Castaneda.

1967
02:37:10,731 --> 02:37:13,593
So I'm gonna give you 30 more seconds, but if you can,

1968
02:37:14,574 --> 02:37:16,816
So I think that that's what I was told.

1969
02:37:16,876 --> 02:37:23,520
So working with Mr. McGiven, he's been working his tail off on his own trying to find funding and city funds.

1970
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:24,921
There are funds though there.

1971
02:37:25,601 --> 02:37:29,704
So I'm hoping that we can get I'm not going to stop until this is done.

1972
02:37:29,804 --> 02:37:34,927
So I now that I've been invested in it, I'm hoping to meet with the trust and sit down with them.

1973
02:37:34,967 --> 02:37:37,509
I know that Councilor Caviello has worked his tail off

1974
02:37:38,069 --> 02:37:47,952
you know, probably he has to try to make this happen, but for some reason, you know, you have money there and you have people that are willing to spend it, but it has to be spent in a certain way.

1975
02:37:48,473 --> 02:37:52,934
There's some non-transparent people, I should say, that maybe don't want to go that route.

1976
02:37:53,014 --> 02:37:54,935
So, but that's the issue right now.

1977
02:37:54,975 --> 02:37:55,915
It's putting people in a room.

1978
02:37:56,335 --> 02:38:00,737
And if it's me and Tim and the trust people and saying, okay, how do we make this work?

1979
02:38:00,857 --> 02:38:04,638
Bring in, you know, a mediator to say, how do we make this work?

1980
02:38:04,658 --> 02:38:05,679
Because ultimately,

1981
02:38:06,579 --> 02:38:09,001
they don't want to release the funds because this is their funds.

1982
02:38:09,441 --> 02:38:14,364
And this is the rules that they were entrusted with when they were given control of these funds.

1983
02:38:14,884 --> 02:38:16,045
So and I can't blame them.

1984
02:38:16,065 --> 02:38:18,787
This is this is what they signed on for.

1985
02:38:18,827 --> 02:38:21,248
So I'm hoping to get it done, Mr. Kessler.

1986
02:38:21,268 --> 02:38:22,309
I promise I want it.

1987
02:38:22,529 --> 02:38:23,429
I want it done myself.

1988
02:38:23,489 --> 02:38:26,952
So it's a damn shame.

1989
02:38:27,132 --> 02:38:33,916
Can we get Mr. Ask Mr. McGlynn, Michael, to come down here and tell us the real score?

1990
02:38:33,936 --> 02:38:34,937
You know,

1991
02:38:36,004 --> 02:38:41,448
Maybe he still has the clout after being here for like two decades, you know?

1992
02:38:41,748 --> 02:38:44,810
Can you reach out to him?

1993
02:38:45,871 --> 02:38:46,071
Yeah.

1994
02:38:47,292 --> 02:38:56,799
And I'm not a big computer person, but if the computer's the issue, why can't we just have the fountain run as a Boston Public Garden fountain?

1995
02:38:56,819 --> 02:38:59,161
We don't have to computerize each little jet.

1996
02:38:59,821 --> 02:39:01,302
Don't make it so complicated.

1997
02:39:02,703 --> 02:39:03,164
Thank you.

1998
02:39:05,066 --> 02:39:16,370
On the motion of Councillor Sarpelli to refer, Mr. Leonard, do you want to jump in on this one?

1999
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:23,153
In addition to the mechanics and getting the mechanical problems resolved, that would happen if we had pride.

2000
02:39:24,164 --> 02:39:27,327
I recall a number of years ago when that event happened.

2001
02:39:28,067 --> 02:39:31,910
I recall being out over there, a major event, the public was all there.

2002
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:34,893
Lee C. Hughes, I think from Channel 4, was present.

2003
02:39:35,874 --> 02:39:36,774
The mayor was there.

2004
02:39:37,475 --> 02:39:38,756
Mike McGlynn spoke about it.

2005
02:39:38,776 --> 02:39:42,279
So when I hear things about the past administrations, I look

2006
02:39:43,769 --> 02:39:49,895
at the things that those past administrations accomplished, things that caused the city to feel proud about itself.

2007
02:39:50,415 --> 02:39:52,437
And there was a following event when it was opened.

2008
02:39:52,737 --> 02:39:54,959
There were hundreds, if not a thousand people out there.

2009
02:39:55,319 --> 02:39:56,681
Lee C. Hughes was back again.

2010
02:39:56,701 --> 02:39:59,023
People felt pride.

2011
02:39:59,924 --> 02:40:05,349
And if you felt the pride, the mechanics of getting that money would happen like that.

2012
02:40:05,669 --> 02:40:06,049
Thank you.

2013
02:40:08,011 --> 02:40:08,391
Thank you.

2014
02:40:09,713 --> 02:40:19,520
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Callaghan, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro, to refer to DPW.

2015
02:40:21,261 --> 02:40:22,121
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2016
02:40:24,483 --> 02:40:25,604
Councillor Callaghan.

2017
02:40:25,704 --> 02:40:25,904
Yes.

2018
02:40:27,245 --> 02:40:28,405
Vice President Collins.

2019
02:40:28,646 --> 02:40:28,886
Yes.

2020
02:40:29,686 --> 02:40:30,927
Councillor Lazzaro.

2021
02:40:30,967 --> 02:40:31,287
Yes.

2022
02:40:32,228 --> 02:40:33,189
Councillor Lemming.

2023
02:40:33,649 --> 02:40:34,009
Yes.

2024
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:36,531
Councillor Scarpelli.

2025
02:40:36,771 --> 02:40:36,851
Yes.

2026
02:40:37,810 --> 02:40:38,571
Councilor Sang?

2027
02:40:38,591 --> 02:40:38,651
Yes.

2028
02:40:39,552 --> 02:40:40,252
President Beers?

2029
02:40:40,413 --> 02:40:40,613
Yes.

2030
02:40:40,693 --> 02:40:44,697
Seventy per minute on the negative motion passes.

2031
02:40:44,717 --> 02:40:51,423
24-080, Personnel Ordinance Amendment, Supervisor of Water and Sewer, to Honorable President and Members of the Medford City Council.

2032
02:40:51,804 --> 02:40:55,968
Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend the City Council approve the following amendment.

2033
02:40:56,388 --> 02:41:00,412
The revised ordinance is Chapter 66, entitled Personnel, Article 2, entitled Reserved.

2034
02:41:00,812 --> 02:41:09,575
the city's classification and compensation plan, formally included as Article 2, Section 6631 to 6640, by adopting the following language.

2035
02:41:09,595 --> 02:41:16,396
The language of PW 18 shall be amended to remove the following position, and the language of PW 19 be amended to include the following position.

2036
02:41:16,937 --> 02:41:23,038
Supervisor of Water and Sewer, the city has had this position posted at PW 18 for months and has not received any qualified applications.

2037
02:41:23,418 --> 02:41:26,379
This proposed classification change would not require a supplemental appropriation.

2038
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:27,200
Respectfully submitted.

2039
02:41:29,588 --> 02:41:37,515
This is a proposal to move the supervisor of water and sewer position from PW 18 in the city's compensation plan to PW 19.

2040
02:41:38,095 --> 02:41:49,165
The justification is that this position has been posted since the beginning of this position was included in the fiscal 24 budget and posted for months and there have not been qualified applicants.

2041
02:41:50,006 --> 02:41:52,568
And as noted, this would not require supplemental appropriation.

2042
02:41:52,588 --> 02:41:54,890
Is there any discussion on the paper?

2043
02:41:56,104 --> 02:41:57,486
Vice President Collins to present.

2044
02:41:58,187 --> 02:42:00,111
I'll go to Vice President Collins and Councillor Scarpelli.

2045
02:42:00,131 --> 02:42:00,451
Thank you.

2046
02:42:01,353 --> 02:42:02,054
Thank you, President Barras.

2047
02:42:04,718 --> 02:42:09,901
you know, we had a robust discussion about the water and sewer department earlier in the evening.

2048
02:42:09,921 --> 02:42:14,284
I think the compensation and classification study was brought up.

2049
02:42:14,744 --> 02:42:29,473
Personally, as one counselor, I'm very much looking forward to the season whenever that arrives, when we can take a holistic look and see the analysis that we know is being worked on with the Collins Center in consultation with the city staff.

2050
02:42:29,893 --> 02:42:31,274
to get that overall picture of.

2051
02:42:31,755 --> 02:42:41,943
We know that some of these roles have salaries that are no longer competitive with our neighboring communities, maybe have not been for a long time.

2052
02:42:44,084 --> 02:42:57,815
The point of this, the ultimate point of making sure that our positions are kind of accurately and up-to-date compensation-wise salaried, is to make sure that we are as competitive as any other municipality at attracting the best talent.

2053
02:42:59,821 --> 02:43:02,082
because of the downstream effects that that has on our residents.

2054
02:43:03,462 --> 02:43:11,166
All that to say, it's not my preference to do these CAF changes one at a time, but we also know that this position is incredibly critical.

2055
02:43:12,106 --> 02:43:17,388
This is a point of inflection for our water infrastructure, and I don't want us to lose any time at all.

2056
02:43:17,488 --> 02:43:19,509
Even if it's just a couple of weeks, that could make the difference.

2057
02:43:19,969 --> 02:43:24,291
If making this position more competitive will bring somebody on faster, I think we should do that.

2058
02:43:24,591 --> 02:43:27,312
So I'm gonna motion to approve for first reading.

2059
02:43:27,725 --> 02:43:31,267
The motion of Councillor Collins to approve the first reading seconded by Councillor Callahan.

2060
02:43:31,347 --> 02:43:32,927
Councillor Scarpa.

2061
02:43:33,368 --> 02:43:43,252
I was informed by the union representatives representation that I don't know if we without legal representation here to guide us.

2062
02:43:45,523 --> 02:43:47,545
position is an arbitration.

2063
02:43:47,885 --> 02:43:53,270
And it's being heard in arbitration because the position was a union position.

2064
02:43:53,991 --> 02:43:55,812
And it's posted as a non union position.

2065
02:43:56,833 --> 02:44:09,325
So I don't as much as I wanted, and I was going to follow up with, you know, also asking for an increase in the calf, if this is where we're doing it for the city solicitor, so we can get to a rate that

2066
02:44:09,765 --> 02:44:31,498
it's going to be appealing for someone because it's obviously not working and this is the mayor controlling the dialogue everyone again so she sees the need here but as city solicitor she controls the dialogue kp law so she's not going to raise the cap we we did request that as part of the budget right no i i know that was the mayor replied to me in an email that she will get us a paper to increase that cap

2067
02:44:31,658 --> 02:44:34,359
Right, I know, but what I'm saying is we asked for that, we still haven't seen it.

2068
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:57,028
This is an issue with the water department, but again, I think the biggest question right now is if we can wait till the next meeting to move this forward, get some legal representation on this, because I don't, if it's an arbitration, that's going against my beliefs as a union supporter, and I can't, if we vote on this, I couldn't support it.

2069
02:44:57,588 --> 02:44:58,629
and then we'd have to wait.

2070
02:44:59,189 --> 02:45:11,636
Instead, I'd ask the table for one week until we get some clarity from legal about voting on something that's in arbitration that is non-union, but was once in union position.

2071
02:45:11,696 --> 02:45:12,937
It's haven't been negotiated out.

2072
02:45:13,417 --> 02:45:14,778
I think it's a slippery slope for us.

2073
02:45:14,818 --> 02:45:22,843
So I know that the vote is in place, but I would maybe think of holding it off for the next meeting and getting some clarity.

2074
02:45:23,939 --> 02:45:25,099
That would be my recommendation.

2075
02:45:25,119 --> 02:45:25,879
Thank you, Mr. President.

2076
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:26,340
Thank you.

2077
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,460
Is that a motion or an amendment?

2078
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:29,500
The motion's already in.

2079
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:32,561
I would just, my, if... We can amend the motion.

2080
02:45:32,621 --> 02:45:40,723
Yeah, I would motion to table it to the next meeting to get clarity for legal representation about voting on an arbitration.

2081
02:45:41,863 --> 02:45:44,583
There's, Vice President Collins.

2082
02:45:46,944 --> 02:45:51,745
I'm happy to defer to other suggestions at this time, but what's on my mind is,

2083
02:45:55,340 --> 02:45:57,341
I said earlier, I feel a sense of urgency around this.

2084
02:45:57,521 --> 02:46:00,523
I would prefer not to wait two weeks to take the first vote.

2085
02:46:00,543 --> 02:46:07,626
I feel like an advantage here is that we can ask for information and if it's relevant, we

2086
02:46:08,766 --> 02:46:10,706
We have the third reading to take an additional vote on.

2087
02:46:10,726 --> 02:46:10,946
Sorry.

2088
02:46:11,066 --> 02:46:22,549
So I, since there were too much on the floor, I wanted to give enough time for you to kind of just suss out if there was a compromise motion here, given that there isn't a compromise motion, there's a motion of the table on the floor that is undebatable and takes precedence.

2089
02:46:22,569 --> 02:46:24,129
So I want to cut debate off at this point.

2090
02:46:24,889 --> 02:46:27,129
On the motion of the table of Councillor Scarpelli, is there a second?

2091
02:46:28,510 --> 02:46:30,110
A second by Councillor Callahan.

2092
02:46:31,290 --> 02:46:32,670
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2093
02:46:34,091 --> 02:46:34,991
Councillor Callahan.

2094
02:46:35,311 --> 02:46:35,451
Yes.

2095
02:46:36,854 --> 02:46:38,736
Councilor VP Collins?

2096
02:46:39,697 --> 02:46:39,857
No.

2097
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:43,720
Councilor Zaro?

2098
02:46:44,041 --> 02:46:44,221
No.

2099
02:46:47,444 --> 02:46:48,325
Councilor Lemming?

2100
02:46:49,025 --> 02:46:49,306
No.

2101
02:46:52,048 --> 02:46:53,149
Councilor Scapelli?

2102
02:46:53,249 --> 02:46:53,490
Yes.

2103
02:46:55,051 --> 02:46:55,772
Councilor Sang?

2104
02:46:56,192 --> 02:46:56,432
Yes.

2105
02:46:58,174 --> 02:46:59,215
President Villescaz?

2106
02:46:59,295 --> 02:46:59,395
Aye.

2107
02:47:05,987 --> 02:47:06,748
Let me tell you something.

2108
02:47:07,228 --> 02:47:09,770
If you say yes, I'm getting dinner by 50 people.

2109
02:47:09,950 --> 02:47:12,172
No, but that's because we can keep talking about it.

2110
02:47:12,332 --> 02:47:14,915
So let's keep going.

2111
02:47:15,976 --> 02:47:16,976
The motion fails.

2112
02:47:17,297 --> 02:47:18,398
Three affirmative, four negative.

2113
02:47:18,418 --> 02:47:18,998
Motion fails.

2114
02:47:19,018 --> 02:47:20,279
Councilor Vice President Collins.

2115
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:32,750
I'd be happy to, I actually don't know if there's a way to attach a B paper to an ordinance, but I would like the information on this union issue attached to the, sorry,

2116
02:47:34,591 --> 02:47:38,713
I don't actually know if there's a way to attach a B paper to this particular vote, like we do with resolutions.

2117
02:47:38,853 --> 02:47:40,913
I would like the answer to Councillor Scarpaoli's question.

2118
02:47:40,933 --> 02:47:47,296
I would prefer to vote on this tonight, but I'd be happy to put your question as a B paper to the vote, if that is an option.

2119
02:47:47,576 --> 02:47:49,817
We could vote yes on this one.

2120
02:47:53,258 --> 02:47:54,879
Would you vote yes on one of the three readings?

2121
02:47:55,079 --> 02:47:55,999
Well, I would vote yes.

2122
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:57,040
I would take it.

2123
02:47:57,060 --> 02:47:57,480
I would vote no.

2124
02:47:57,580 --> 02:47:59,481
I would wait for my three readings.

2125
02:47:59,881 --> 02:47:59,981
Okay.

2126
02:48:00,001 --> 02:48:00,201
All right.

2127
02:48:02,687 --> 02:48:09,382
No, I hear you and I just wanted I just didn't motion to table is a tough instrument that this allows debate but I so I had to handle it procedurally.

2128
02:48:11,724 --> 02:48:14,105
My, it sounds like I'm the swing on this.

2129
02:48:15,546 --> 02:48:26,390
My personal preference would be, given the fact that there's not a representative of the administration here tonight to answer our questions, that we request a representative of the administration to appear at our next meeting with the answer to this question.

2130
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:27,871
So that's just my personal preference.

2131
02:48:28,291 --> 02:48:31,852
You know, I would tend to agree with you, Councilor Collins.

2132
02:48:31,872 --> 02:48:36,694
I don't know that there's a way to, it sounds like there's general agreement that we would advance this pending the answer to that question.

2133
02:48:37,675 --> 02:48:37,935
All right.

2134
02:48:39,055 --> 02:48:39,916
Is there a motion on the floor?

2135
02:48:44,209 --> 02:48:52,917
motion to invite Council to the next meeting to answer Councilor Scarpelli's question and to table this until that next meeting.

2136
02:48:53,358 --> 02:48:57,381
Okay, motion to, maybe we can get the answer in advance.

2137
02:48:58,042 --> 02:49:05,349
Yeah, so motion to request an answer on the question, on Councilor Scarpelli's question about

2138
02:49:06,874 --> 02:49:15,622
voting on this while the position is in arbitration and request representative administration at the next meeting and put this on the table for April 30th.

2139
02:49:32,013 --> 02:49:32,993
I'm sorry.

2140
02:49:33,994 --> 02:49:34,714
Yeah, yes.

2141
02:49:35,154 --> 02:49:36,774
I know.

2142
02:49:36,834 --> 02:49:37,655
No, I heard you.

2143
02:49:37,675 --> 02:49:50,198
So on the motion of Councilor saying to, um, request a response from Council on on the question about this position being an arbitration, and if that impacts our vote.

2144
02:49:51,759 --> 02:49:54,139
Seconded by seconded by Councilor Callahan.

2145
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:54,980
Madam Clerk, please

2146
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:01,931
Vice President Collins?

2147
02:50:01,991 --> 02:50:02,172
No.

2148
02:50:03,872 --> 02:50:04,993
Councilor Lozaro?

2149
02:50:05,253 --> 02:50:05,473
Yes.

2150
02:50:07,133 --> 02:50:07,934
Councilor Lemming?

2151
02:50:08,794 --> 02:50:09,074
Yes.

2152
02:50:11,035 --> 02:50:12,095
Councilor Scapelli?

2153
02:50:12,376 --> 02:50:12,576
Yes.

2154
02:50:13,916 --> 02:50:14,676
Councilor Sang?

2155
02:50:14,836 --> 02:50:15,037
Yes.

2156
02:50:16,097 --> 02:50:16,777
President Behrs?

2157
02:50:16,857 --> 02:50:17,077
Yes.

2158
02:50:17,097 --> 02:50:18,498
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

2159
02:50:19,378 --> 02:50:20,399
The motion passes.

2160
02:50:20,459 --> 02:50:28,002
The request is made to the administration for an answer to the question and presence at our next meeting, and the item is tabled until our April 30th meeting.

2161
02:50:30,143 --> 02:50:30,963
Vice President Collins.

2162
02:50:31,863 --> 02:50:35,925
Motion to take paper 21057 off the table for third reading.

2163
02:50:35,945 --> 02:50:37,186
That's the leaf floor ordinance.

2164
02:50:37,446 --> 02:50:42,849
Motion by Vice President Collins to take paper 21057 off the table and approve for third reading.

2165
02:50:42,929 --> 02:50:43,649
Seconded by.

2166
02:50:43,669 --> 02:50:45,330
Second.

2167
02:50:45,370 --> 02:50:47,631
Leaf floor ordinance is eligible for third reading.

2168
02:50:48,511 --> 02:50:51,813
And the motion of Councilor Collins to take it off the table and approve for third reading.

2169
02:50:51,873 --> 02:50:52,473
Seconded by.

2170
02:50:52,733 --> 02:50:52,973
Second.

2171
02:50:53,013 --> 02:50:54,754
Do we want to add the ordinance?

2172
02:50:55,395 --> 02:50:56,755
It's not eligible till next month.

2173
02:50:57,015 --> 02:50:57,416
Oh, sorry.

2174
02:50:57,616 --> 02:50:57,876
You're good.

2175
02:50:59,063 --> 02:51:06,930
uh, on that motion of Council Vice President Collins, seconded by Councillor saying to take from third from the table and approve for third reading.

2176
02:51:08,232 --> 02:51:08,912
Any discussion?

2177
02:51:12,996 --> 02:51:15,578
Any discussion in the chambers or on zoom by members of the public?

2178
02:51:19,662 --> 02:51:21,223
I see a hand raised.

2179
02:51:21,263 --> 02:51:22,685
I will go to Norman Kaplan.

2180
02:51:22,725 --> 02:51:24,566
Name and address for the record, please.

2181
02:51:26,587 --> 02:51:28,469
Norman Kaplan, Edlin Way.

2182
02:51:28,489 --> 02:51:36,495
I'm not sure exactly procedurally where we are with this draft ordinance.

2183
02:51:37,816 --> 02:51:39,198
I was here at the last meeting.

2184
02:51:39,218 --> 02:51:45,243
I got to speak after midnight, express some thoughts about it.

2185
02:51:46,444 --> 02:51:53,349
And not really sure whether the reading encapsulates the exact

2186
02:51:54,477 --> 02:52:00,000
language and wording that I was briefed on when I was here before.

2187
02:52:01,741 --> 02:52:17,931
But I would like to emphasize a couple of points that I did make to see whether or not these can be incorporated in the final ordinance.

2188
02:52:23,001 --> 02:52:40,153
just procedure, Norman, where we are at, uh, the language as amended and approved for first reading on March 12th was advertised in the local newspaper on April 4th, and that was, uh,

2189
02:52:41,786 --> 02:52:51,697
you know, that was, that is a legal requirement under mass general law that we, that we put the text of the ordinance as approved for first reading, um, out, uh, in the advertising.

2190
02:52:51,737 --> 02:52:53,579
And now we would be approving for third reading.

2191
02:52:54,140 --> 02:53:02,770
My understanding of the process is that if we were to amend that third reading, we would have to then start the process again, uh, reapprove it for first reading and re advertise it.

2192
02:53:05,483 --> 02:53:14,608
exactly which newspaper was it advertised in because I'm not aware of any newspaper that's servicing our community.

2193
02:53:15,669 --> 02:53:21,892
That was advertised in the Medford transcript and Somerville Medford and Somerville transcript and journal, or what's left of it.

2194
02:53:24,213 --> 02:53:29,576
I say, well, I think it would.

2195
02:53:29,736 --> 02:53:29,756
I

2196
02:53:32,155 --> 02:53:40,779
I think something as important to this probably should have received more widespread publication.

2197
02:53:42,300 --> 02:53:47,462
But be that as it may, I appreciate the information you've given me.

2198
02:53:47,562 --> 02:53:55,165
And will there be a further publication when you talk about a third reading?

2199
02:53:55,205 --> 02:53:57,086
Or is there going to be a further publication?

2200
02:53:58,729 --> 02:54:05,994
So this vote would be a vote to put this in the ordinances and creating an ordinance and acting an ordinance.

2201
02:54:06,014 --> 02:54:07,275
So this is the vote for enactment.

2202
02:54:07,835 --> 02:54:11,998
I would then go to the mayor for her signature of veto and or neither.

2203
02:54:12,538 --> 02:54:20,804
And if she signs it or does not veto it, then we would start the process of getting that up on the city's muni code website.

2204
02:54:21,444 --> 02:54:30,810
at which point, at some point in the future, basically it'll go up as its own ordinance and then it will be codified in the city's code of ordinances online.

2205
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:43,897
And what if the mayor should wish to make some revisions of her own, taking into account perhaps some commentary or suggestions from the public?

2206
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:48,280
What would be the consequence of that?

2207
02:54:49,468 --> 02:54:56,310
The mayor could veto the ordinance which would return it to this council for further consideration.

2208
02:54:56,391 --> 02:54:59,292
We could override her veto.

2209
02:54:59,612 --> 02:55:08,315
We could amend the ordinance and begin the process again to go to first reading and then an advertisement and then the third reading again.

2210
02:55:09,375 --> 02:55:14,357
So actually to get some further improvements on the current ordinance,

2211
02:55:15,112 --> 02:55:15,652
language.

2212
02:55:16,393 --> 02:55:21,394
We're really only talking about a delay of perhaps a few months.

2213
02:55:22,014 --> 02:55:28,797
Yeah, it would be so it would probably be back to us.

2214
02:55:30,117 --> 02:55:36,701
mid-May and then have to go out again for another month, so probably would be mid-June or July when it would be completed?

2215
02:55:36,721 --> 02:55:37,441
Yeah.

2216
02:55:38,382 --> 02:55:47,627
I mean, I'm probably the last person in Medford that would like to see any delay in the enactment of a leaf blower restrictive ordinance.

2217
02:55:48,168 --> 02:55:48,568
However,

2218
02:55:50,484 --> 02:55:55,086
I think we really only have one chance to get this right.

2219
02:55:56,127 --> 02:56:07,031
Because once it's enacted, I'm sure we're talking years, if at all, that there would ever be any revision of it.

2220
02:56:07,771 --> 02:56:13,814
So to have a misstep here after all this time, I mean, I've been working on this for four years.

2221
02:56:16,102 --> 02:56:23,906
To make a misstep here that would be preventable seems to me to be somewhat tragicomic, actually.

2222
02:56:23,926 --> 02:56:38,353
And to be quick and blunt, I'm personally not satisfied with the extent of the restrictions, as I've said in some of my dialogue already.

2223
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:44,232
I think I will have to have a dialogue with the mayor.

2224
02:56:45,933 --> 02:56:48,234
I understand that the council can veto her.

2225
02:56:49,435 --> 02:56:58,701
If she decides to veto, we can override it or decide to incorporate some further revisions in it.

2226
02:57:00,602 --> 02:57:02,263
I think I'll just let it stand like that.

2227
02:57:02,283 --> 02:57:07,166
I mean, I don't think I have really any other choice at this point.

2228
02:57:08,851 --> 02:57:09,772
Thank you, Mr Kaplan.

2229
02:57:09,812 --> 02:57:11,934
I appreciate your input and comments on the process.

2230
02:57:11,994 --> 02:57:21,161
And certainly if the mayor were to come back to the council with suggestions, I'm sure that the council would consider them in good faith.

2231
02:57:22,322 --> 02:57:23,563
Okay, thank you and good night.

2232
02:57:24,544 --> 02:57:24,964
Thank you.

2233
02:57:24,984 --> 02:57:30,109
On the motion.

2234
02:57:31,164 --> 02:57:36,066
of Councillor Collins to approve her third reading as seconded by Councillor Saing.

2235
02:57:37,307 --> 02:57:40,588
Any further comment from members of the public or members of the Council?

2236
02:57:42,849 --> 02:57:45,030
Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2237
02:57:46,090 --> 02:57:46,991
Councillor CALLAHAN.

2238
02:57:47,251 --> 02:57:47,451
Yes.

2239
02:57:49,271 --> 02:57:50,452
Vice President Collins.

2240
02:57:50,752 --> 02:57:50,972
Yes.

2241
02:57:52,633 --> 02:57:53,893
Councillor Lozano.

2242
02:57:54,133 --> 02:57:54,374
Yes.

2243
02:57:56,034 --> 02:57:56,855
Councillor Lemming.

2244
02:57:57,375 --> 02:57:57,615
Yes.

2245
02:57:59,687 --> 02:58:00,667
Councilor Scapelli.

2246
02:58:03,028 --> 02:58:03,829
Councilor Sang.

2247
02:58:04,509 --> 02:58:04,729
Yes.

2248
02:58:06,009 --> 02:58:06,670
President Beers.

2249
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:08,250
Yes, 60 affirmative, one of the negative.

2250
02:58:08,550 --> 02:58:12,452
The motion passes and the ordinance is ordained.

2251
02:58:12,552 --> 02:58:13,732
Vice President Collins.

2252
02:58:14,252 --> 02:58:15,113
Thank you, President Beers.

2253
02:58:15,433 --> 02:58:22,576
I'd like to put forward a motion to receive and place on file the following papers that are under reports due slash deadlines.

2254
02:58:23,796 --> 02:58:24,556
I can read them off.

2255
02:58:25,917 --> 02:58:26,137
It's 17-606.

2256
02:58:31,118 --> 02:58:31,458
20-086, 22-007, 22-009, and 22-039.

2257
02:58:31,518 --> 02:58:36,003
That motion is to receive and place all of those on file.

2258
02:58:51,146 --> 02:58:53,247
Vice President Collins to take paper 17-606, 20-086, 22-007, 22-009, and 22-039.

2259
02:58:53,307 --> 02:58:53,687
Second.

2260
02:58:53,827 --> 02:58:55,828
And receive and place on file.

2261
02:58:55,888 --> 02:58:58,389
Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

2262
02:58:58,409 --> 02:58:59,789
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

2263
02:59:16,516 --> 02:59:17,996
Councillor CASSIDY.

2264
02:59:18,136 --> 02:59:19,657
Councillor CASSIDY.

2265
02:59:19,697 --> 02:59:20,597
Councillor CASSIDY.

2266
02:59:20,637 --> 02:59:21,257
Councillor CASSIDY.

2267
02:59:28,998 --> 02:59:29,738
Councillor CASSIDY.

2268
02:59:47,982 --> 02:59:48,786
You do that to Sylvia?

2269
02:59:52,496 --> 02:59:59,041
Yes, six in the affirmative, one very much in the negative.

2270
02:59:59,401 --> 03:00:04,344
The motion passes.

2271
03:00:04,784 --> 03:00:07,946
If I may, the motion passes.

2272
03:00:08,447 --> 03:00:09,768
I did receive a communication.

2273
03:00:09,948 --> 03:00:15,211
One of the emailers in public comment did specifically ask me to read the email out loud.

2274
03:00:16,372 --> 03:00:17,973
I'm going to read this email out loud.

2275
03:00:18,013 --> 03:00:20,935
It is not my words, but it was a specific request.

2276
03:00:21,455 --> 03:00:24,778
The subject is civility and professionalism in city council meetings.

2277
03:00:25,338 --> 03:00:35,225
Dear President Vares, Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan, Councilor Seng, and Councilor Lemming, I'm ready to express my appreciation for your amazing work as city councilors that represent the trust our electorate has placed in you.

2278
03:00:35,665 --> 03:00:41,489
Your professionalism in handling the mob approach that a vocal minority who are attending some of the city council meetings is very deeply appreciated.

2279
03:00:41,589 --> 03:00:42,710
Please keep up your excellent work.

2280
03:00:43,151 --> 03:00:46,313
I would appreciate your reading my brief email out loud in the next council meeting.

2281
03:00:46,393 --> 03:00:49,495
Sincerely, Munir Jumanis, PhD, physicist, educator.

2282
03:00:49,955 --> 03:00:50,416
Thank you all.

2283
03:00:50,996 --> 03:00:51,836
Mr. President, if I can?

2284
03:00:52,056 --> 03:00:53,417
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

2285
03:00:54,097 --> 03:00:55,417
I wasn't gonna say anything.

2286
03:00:56,077 --> 03:01:08,500
And I think that I read those two letters and I can understand the behavior of some members of the community that act so inappropriate that they cross that line.

2287
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:18,483
And I don't stand for that myself, but I don't want to lump in the members that come to this podium that have passion for a topic.

2288
03:01:19,243 --> 03:01:26,705
and make it seem like, I think like what was said earlier, that they get lumped in together.

2289
03:01:26,745 --> 03:01:39,688
I think that personally, I've talked to some people and people have reached out to me and for one, I want to apologize because somebody reached out to me and said, Councilor Scott Pelley, you're so abrasive and so aggressive that you actually scare me.

2290
03:01:40,993 --> 03:01:54,071
It's my personality but I can also see that so I would apologize, but I also think that we have counselors here tonight that need to publicly apologize the constituents, because of their behavior.

2291
03:01:54,691 --> 03:01:55,573
And I think that, you know,

2292
03:01:56,013 --> 03:02:10,275
what's good for one should be good for all because I think some of our fellow counselors maybe not understanding or feeling nervous and maybe showing, you know, a giggling or disrespectful manner to people at the at the podium.

2293
03:02:10,675 --> 03:02:11,476
And to be honest with you,

2294
03:02:12,237 --> 03:02:15,599
it's not to those ignorant people that do come up and cross that line.

2295
03:02:15,619 --> 03:02:21,922
A lot of times you're seeing this behavior to people that just express themselves openly and have that right there.

2296
03:02:21,982 --> 03:02:31,046
So I said to myself, if this is going to be brought up, I'm going to apologize that if I offend anybody, because at the times that I speak,

2297
03:02:32,006 --> 03:02:34,528
with what they put as abrasive manner.

2298
03:02:35,649 --> 03:02:38,151
It's who I am as a person, I'm a loud person.

2299
03:02:39,612 --> 03:02:43,235
But if you're offended, I apologize that you're offended by the way I present.

2300
03:02:43,675 --> 03:02:51,941
But at the same time, I would hope that my fellow colleagues that were praised tonight in these letters that also behaved in a manner that isn't

2301
03:02:52,862 --> 03:02:56,323
isn't truly what should be expressed by a city councilor.

2302
03:02:56,703 --> 03:03:15,448
I would hope they apologize openly to the public like they've done privately, just so everybody's on the same page and everybody is expressing that type of behavior and acknowledging and saying, okay, let's move forward from here and understand that, you know, nodding your head, not paying attention.

2303
03:03:15,468 --> 03:03:20,049
Because one thing I really tried to be totally honest with everybody, since I started as elected official,

2304
03:03:21,325 --> 03:03:23,467
We've had some pretty colorful people at that podium.

2305
03:03:24,307 --> 03:03:30,432
And I've seen some behaviors from some of my fellow counselors that they would stand up and walk out.

2306
03:03:30,613 --> 03:03:37,738
No matter how much you disrespect that person, getting up and walking out and disrespecting that person is a total disgrace for the seat.

2307
03:03:38,519 --> 03:03:39,440
And I would never do that.

2308
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:45,125
Whether I believe in what you're saying or don't believe what you're saying, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna listen to that person.

2309
03:03:45,834 --> 03:03:53,836
Now, there has been, you know, I've seen it myself that counselors make motions that could be represented as disrespectful.

2310
03:03:54,476 --> 03:04:01,278
So, like the person who wrote the letters, I don't disagree with them.

2311
03:04:01,318 --> 03:04:06,860
I think that there are people that do cross the line, but that podium's there for everybody.

2312
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:08,880
I know that was said the other night in subcommittee.

2313
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:12,421
That podium's set up for everybody to speak their mind.

2314
03:04:13,462 --> 03:04:14,642
Now, when they cross that line,

2315
03:04:15,933 --> 03:04:16,954
they got to be held accountable.

2316
03:04:16,974 --> 03:04:18,435
I think that's something we need to talk about.

2317
03:04:18,976 --> 03:04:24,821
But in the same breath, we should all take ownership of some pretty tough couple of weeks.

2318
03:04:24,841 --> 03:04:26,262
I mean, we've had some pretty intense weeks.

2319
03:04:26,903 --> 03:04:37,793
And there were things that we can all agree to disagree with, but still have the mature and responses and to give the respect to the people that are at the podium.

2320
03:04:38,473 --> 03:04:41,074
So again, that's what I feel.

2321
03:04:41,594 --> 03:04:45,975
I appreciate the letter, even though they didn't put my name in it.

2322
03:04:46,575 --> 03:04:47,976
So I'm very hurt right now.

2323
03:04:48,876 --> 03:04:49,616
But it's okay.

2324
03:04:50,516 --> 03:04:52,297
I'm going to have Dean to write me a letter next week.

2325
03:04:54,577 --> 03:04:55,198
But thank you.

2326
03:04:55,418 --> 03:04:55,738
Thank you.

2327
03:04:55,758 --> 03:05:07,561
And I do want to thank Councillor Strudel for bringing up prior councils and behaviors and how I would note that everyone on this council has sat and listened to the public comment regardless of

2328
03:05:08,351 --> 03:05:09,031
It's content.

2329
03:05:09,831 --> 03:05:12,392
It doesn't mean we haven't responded in different ways.

2330
03:05:13,312 --> 03:05:21,554
Some of the incidents referred to, I'll just say that some people were named and others were not when everyone reacted in the same way.

2331
03:05:22,654 --> 03:05:29,895
And to be honest, I think there's a difference between a good faith misinterpretation of someone's tone and disrespect.

2332
03:05:30,015 --> 03:05:31,576
So I just want to put that out there too.

2333
03:05:32,096 --> 03:05:34,736
Sometimes I tell a joke and nobody laughs.

2334
03:05:35,537 --> 03:05:36,917
Does that mean it was not a joke?

2335
03:05:37,237 --> 03:05:37,357
No.

2336
03:05:38,846 --> 03:05:43,748
So, and sometimes I'm not telling a joke and people laugh, and that's just because I'm very funny.

2337
03:05:44,048 --> 03:05:52,671
But I'm going to go to the podium, Mr. Castagnetti, and then we can wrap up this shebang unless there's other councillors who want to speak.

2338
03:05:53,391 --> 03:05:53,671
Amen.

2339
03:05:58,322 --> 03:06:00,463
Well, you've made Sylvia happy, Councilor Callahan.

2340
03:06:00,483 --> 03:06:02,244
Motion to adjourn, Councilor Callahan.

2341
03:06:02,604 --> 03:06:03,845
Oh, if I can, I apologize.

2342
03:06:04,265 --> 03:06:05,565
I'd be remiss if I didn't do this.

2343
03:06:06,426 --> 03:06:10,868
I just want to congratulate all the residents of Method that ran the Boston Marathon yesterday.

2344
03:06:11,008 --> 03:06:11,308
Oh, yes.

2345
03:06:11,628 --> 03:06:22,974
I think, especially my hero, my wife, after being sick for eight straight days on antibiotics, she woke up Sunday and said she's perfectly healthy.

2346
03:06:24,094 --> 03:06:26,656
and she ran the Boston Marathon yesterday.

2347
03:06:26,676 --> 03:06:27,757
A little disappointed.

2348
03:06:28,138 --> 03:06:29,299
She did an hour.

2349
03:06:29,939 --> 03:06:30,800
It was the worst time.

2350
03:06:30,820 --> 03:06:31,761
We're going to talk about that.

2351
03:06:31,781 --> 03:06:34,823
We're going to get her training tomorrow, get her back at it.

2352
03:06:34,923 --> 03:06:42,129
But I just wanted to tell her how proud we were of her as a husband and as a mom.

2353
03:06:42,249 --> 03:06:46,053
She ran her seventh Boston Marathon yesterday, and she killed it.

2354
03:06:46,433 --> 03:06:50,837
Councillor Scarpelli and I being a model for all marathon runners on the motion.

2355
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:59,583
to adjourn, 10-10, let's get Sylvia home, by Councillor Callaghan, seconded by Councillor Lozaro.

2356
03:06:59,823 --> 03:07:04,065

2357
03:07:04,125 --> 03:07:05,205

2358

Councillor Lozaro.

2362

Yes.

Councillor Laming.

2364
03:07:12,608 --> 03:07:13,169
Present.

Councillor Scapelli.

2366

Councillor Sagan.

2367
03:07:20,692 --> 03:07:20,792
Yes.

2368
03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:24,483
Councilor say you're okay.

2369

President is thank you Assistant City Clerk to Placido for your service this evening.

2370
03:07:29,492 --> 03:07:30,113
I vote yes.

2371
03:07:30,675 --> 03:07:33,600
Six in the affirmative one present motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

2372
03:07:33,640 --> 03:07:33,921
Thank you.
