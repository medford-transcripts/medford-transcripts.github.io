1
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone can you all hear me?

2
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:00,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

3
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:01,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm going to read the meeting agenda.

5
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,713
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to start recording or push to YouTube or oh, I see community media.

6
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start reading.

[SPEAKER_04]: She's sitting right next to me.

9
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

10
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did I put it?

11
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:27,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

12
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:40,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, please be advised that on Wednesday, June 11th at 530, there'll be a family and community engagement subcommittee meeting held through participation via zoom.

18
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will call the roll.

19
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:23,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeldt.

20
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:23,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

21
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ntapa.

22
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:26,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

23
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And Member Graham.

24
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, that's me.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Three present, zero absent.

26
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:42,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I will say that many of the people on this call have a hard stop at 6.30 because we have a school building committee meeting right after this.

27
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: because there just aren't enough hours in the month of June, apparently.

28
00:03:48,305 --> 00:04:06,092
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are here because Member Reinfeldt sent forth and received approval for a resolution that says, be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communication Subcommittee will need to discuss protocols for family-facing communications around after-school enrollment and academic transitions.

29
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:13,319
[SPEAKER_04]: This meeting will include the director of communications as well as relevant programs, program directors and school leaders.

30
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:14,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

31
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:29,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what we wanted to do was start with a discussion of, like, our current protocols and just so that we can sort of hear what the district is currently doing across these different transition points.

32
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then see if there's any public input.

33
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:35,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you are.

34
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:35,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

35
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:40,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hung up on myself and then talk about, um.

36
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:47,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Suggestions for next steps and communication plans that might smooth out some of these transitions.

37
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:52,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, before I continue member, I felt, did you have anything else you wanted to say to lead us off?

38
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just say that this is a meeting about not the content of what we say, but what.

39
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,077
[SPEAKER_05]: The processes are, or what.

40
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,691
[SPEAKER_05]: what communications go out, not necessarily what's in them.

41
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:08,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Like general topic is fine, but not getting into the details.

42
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:20,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But to say family needs this sort of information and this is appropriate for a real time communication, this communication could be archived on a website for people to reference.

43
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:23,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are those processes?

44
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,060
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they look like?

45
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the details of exactly what we're telling people about what happens when you move from middle to high school or

46
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:35,431
[SPEAKER_05]: How the lottery works, just know it the after school lottery works.

47
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:36,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just keep.

48
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have content about what the.

49
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:44,321
[SPEAKER_05]: How people need to know how the lottery works, but we don't need to get into the details.

50
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:51,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Of how it works on this call, so there will probably be a fair number of action items after this meeting.

51
00:05:51,912 --> 00:06:03,422
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's just to say what are the points and what are the points where central administration can support program directors and principals in getting messages out to a large swath of people, right?

52
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:15,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there moments when it doesn't make sense for each middle school, some things that will make sense for each middle school to communicate with the families going, but if it's generally what happens when you move to middle school,

53
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:22,419
[SPEAKER_05]: that could potentially come from a central location, or the message could be crafted centrally and sent out by individuals.

54
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:24,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

55
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Do people have questions?

56
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:41,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on the hit parade of transitions to discuss, the first one from a current protocol perspective is kindergarten registration.

57
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:47,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's been a lot of change in how we communicate about kindergarten in the last, like, handful of years.

58
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,268
[SPEAKER_04]: That warms my heart.

59
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:57,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I was hoping somebody could maybe start with kindergarten registration, and then we can just, like, run down the list of, like, current practice.

60
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

61
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And can everybody hear me?

62
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:06,681
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I just want to make sure I'm going to share some audio with member Graham.

63
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think is so Megan fiddle carries on the call.

64
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:23,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think between Megan, myself and will, we definitely moved up the timeline for kindergarten registration significantly and moved it even earlier this year.

65
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Megan, I don't know if you want to start from the very beginning of where we're generating.

66
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The list from, but our timeline, the list part.

67
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Starts in the fall and then we're usually reaching out to families come.

68
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:46,378
[SPEAKER_01]: December yeah, so, um.

69
00:07:48,152 --> 00:08:00,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting in November, we reach out to City Hall to ask for the census, the census data for all students, all kids at that point who were born from September 1st to August 31st, five years prior.

70
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:04,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So whichever students would be age eligible.

71
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:10,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our first pass to get contact information for students we don't know about otherwise.

72
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:22,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what was very successful this year was really partnering with the Medford Department of Public Health and their connectors and liaisons to really have them help us get the word out.

73
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:26,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've realized that we've got quick access to our current families,

74
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,201
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's their neighbors.

75
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,924
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their coworkers that we couldn't reach as easily.

76
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:39,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were reaching out to the connectors and liaisons through Medford City Hall, and they're the ones they actually had funding and made those lawn signs.

77
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if you've had a chance to see them, but we put out lawn signs.

78
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:44,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to really just push the information to families.

79
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:48,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that was what was successful in getting some of the families that historically

80
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:53,022
[SPEAKER_01]: have been dragging their feet and not signing up as quickly, I think we got them to sign up earlier.

81
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:58,363
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a communication success, I think, in my book, huge from where we are.

82
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:04,804
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, as far as we're having Will here on the team, we really did look at the language on our webpage.

83
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:16,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share that here or it's, you know, it's on the standing webpage for kindergarten registration to really make it accessible to all families and to have those banners pop up at really relevant times.

84
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:21,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that helped with getting our numbers earlier than they've historically been.

85
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:26,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much earlier are you seeing the numbers come in?

86
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you have like a comparison?

87
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:41,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Glusi and I were just talking about this today, and it seems like our overall number is comparable to what we had around this time last year, but it's spread out more evenly across the four schools than it was in the past.

88
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:58,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's why I'm kind of confidently saying that our targeted approach to different constituencies who speak different languages with those lawn signs and with our liaisons and connectors, I think those numbers at those schools are up.

89
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:07,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if, you know, what I didn't look at was the number in the census to see if it's a smaller class overall in Medford.

90
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,234
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

91
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:16,098
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does feel like some numbers are up, even if our kind of bottom line total number doesn't seem so much bigger.

92
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:22,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, specifically, I would say we, you know, historically, a school like the Missituck,

93
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:36,532
[SPEAKER_03]: We, at this point, at this time of year for the, since I've been up at central administration for the, since 2020, we typically have only about 30 students enrolled by this time of year.

94
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:45,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And August is very, very active for the Missittuck school, but this year we're already at 60.

95
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe 60, well, at least 60.

96
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,490
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a significant change.

97
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,392
[SPEAKER_03]: That's almost double than what we usually see.

98
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,935
[SPEAKER_03]: The other schools are showing similar patterns.

99
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,776
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts is a little less.

100
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,380
[SPEAKER_03]: than what I've seen the past five years.

101
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:17,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't wanna make any assumptions to what that might mean, but the Brooks and the McGlynn are trending as typical.

102
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:19,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

103
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:25,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once people are in, it's the building bridges and it's what's on the website, right?

104
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:30,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the kind of the, and then there's an open house in the spring and the screenings, right?

105
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:30,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are.

106
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:31,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

107
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

108
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,493
[SPEAKER_03]: We offer 3 building bridges, 2 in person, 1 virtual.

109
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually do the zoom 1 in February.

110
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's January, February, March.

111
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:49,818
[SPEAKER_03]: because the open house for all the schools is the first Wednesday in May.

112
00:11:52,159 --> 00:12:05,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And the screenings are usually, they roll a little differently from school to school, but they begin at the end of May and conclude in September.

113
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:10,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a slightly different schedule for each family.

114
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

115
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question is, are there things that we need to streamline or improve?

116
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like we've made some progress in the last few years.

117
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:37,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if anything from, for my perspective would be once the registration is complete and we have all the documentation we need, the medical, the district sends out, um, another kind of welcome email.

118
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:42,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that is attached the home to school transition form.

119
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:51,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the enrollment for students is different if they're our own meet and Megan, you can talk about how we've shifted the meet registration this year.

120
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're our own, we have a lot of data.

121
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:58,587
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of in terms of transition.

122
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:07,812
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a local Medford preschool program that they came from, we typically get their transition form.

123
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: But if students are coming to us without preschool experience or from a home-based preschool experience or a preschool experience outside of Medford, a lot of families, their business, where they work may have a preschool program, we don't often get transitional data.

124
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,987
[SPEAKER_03]: in instances like that.

125
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:44,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we do push out a home to school transition form, because the most information we can ascertain about a student helps us with class assignments and just to ease the transition process.

126
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:52,512
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an area that I think I would welcome a conversation about how to do that better.

127
00:13:54,985 --> 00:14:00,907
[SPEAKER_03]: and how to make sure we're connecting with all families to get some transitional data on their child.

128
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:04,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can tell you what we did.

129
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,095
[SPEAKER_01]: We updated both of the forms.

130
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:10,478
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the form for the centers and the form for the families.

131
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:27,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabby and I worked on those together, and we put those in front of elementary school principals and in front of kindergarten teachers to say, are you getting the information that you need so that when you get these transition forms, you can make informed decisions about how to group your students, which is really what those are best used for.

132
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:28,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we

133
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: sent all of those to all families who were registered or who even start the registration process on May 1st, as well as all the centers.

134
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:43,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gabby was really thoughtful about asking, you know, because we ask for data about how much prior education they've had.

135
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:48,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have, you know, full-time daycare, two plus hours a week daycare?

136
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:56,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So we asked that, and then if it was something, a center that we'd never heard of, we asked for more information, contact information for that center.

137
00:14:56,364 --> 00:15:01,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we reached out to them to say, you know, we're gonna be sending out this transition form, would you be willing to fill it out?

138
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:02,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them said yes.

139
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:09,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, we've been just amassing our kind of database for all of the different programs that our students have come from.

140
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:17,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we'll just send it out every May 1st to all of those centers to say, if you have a student that you know is attending Medford Public Schools, please fill this out, return it.

141
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:20,777
[SPEAKER_01]: fillable online and they can email it right back to us.

142
00:15:20,897 --> 00:15:28,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really easy and they're like trying to remove as many of those barriers as we can because the principles were telling us that is very valuable information.

143
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:40,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I was just going to ask, could that happen when they're say that that goes on a list of required documents and say this isn't essential for registration, but this is helpful to get that sooner?

144
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:47,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the big question that families have is, particularly people who haven't been in schools, is why am I giving you all this information?

145
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:51,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't, it's been a while since I filled it out.

146
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:54,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I was out of Medford for early childhood, so.

147
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember filling it out.

148
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't remember the messaging around it.

149
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:03,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, we tried to put like at the top, you know, the objective of the form.

150
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, and I think I certainly understood.

151
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:11,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking of people who are less familiar with American education systems.

152
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like a one page like here's what you can expect for the year kind of document that we could like

153
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:52,500
[SPEAKER_04]: give to the particularly the local preschools at the beginning of the year so that there's like a timeline like here's when you should think about registering your kid and here's like when there will be an open house so that people aren't like bombarding the school like I want to come take a tour right like I'm just thinking about like the active marketing that happens particularly from the charter schools to get kids into their pipeline in kindergarten

154
00:16:53,117 --> 00:17:03,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though we're starting in November, like, there are definitely families starting before November to try to understand what their options are.

155
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there was a way for us to, like, give them a, like, one-page roadmap of, like, here's what happens in the next year on your way to Medford Public Schools, and it's just this easy.

156
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:26,147
[SPEAKER_04]: With a little bit of information that helps people feel good, like, could something like that obviously could go on our website and it can go on our social media pages and things like that.

157
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:36,112
[SPEAKER_04]: But could something like that also be useful to hand to the preschool so they can pass them out to their kids so that parents.

158
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:42,498
[SPEAKER_04]: can just like be prepared, like, oh, I have to register my kid and I can do that starting in this.

159
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's always somebody who's like, when do I register my kid?

160
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when is the first day for kindergarten?

161
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, is there an open house?

162
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, all those dates, those dates all exist.

163
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, well, you know, well in advance.

164
00:17:55,542 --> 00:18:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that would be sort of an interesting experiment too, to just try to create like a one page of like, here's what it looks like.

165
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: for this year.

166
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

167
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be combining what we have into one, one pager.

168
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:23,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those, and if exact dates, days of the week are not known, but to say it's in early May or mid May, or I'd say days of the week.

169
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The first Wednesday, yeah, we can easily do something like that.

170
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:27,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like kindergarten, we know that.

171
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:32,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I know middle school open houses are a little less fixed.

172
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:35,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

173
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

174
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:37,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's an easy one.

175
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a whole slew of community members on, but does anybody else have anything they want to add before we move on from kindergarten?

176
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:58,815
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think we should move it a reasonably with all due respect to input.

177
00:18:59,555 --> 00:18:59,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

178
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: After school enrollment and lottery.

179
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can take that one too.

180
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:21,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a web page for before and after school that's got a whole section about the procedures for registering the lottery and the waitlist, how it all works.

181
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:28,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got an internal document that's got all of the sort of step-by-step just so it's done the same way every time.

182
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:35,976
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Dr. Glucy and Will and I were meeting about it before, we were saying that this seems like a great

183
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:47,692
[SPEAKER_01]: activity for the new after school task force and maybe presenting things in terms of FAQs, frequently asked questions, instead makes it just easier.

184
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:55,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't feel like it's a bunch of information coming at you that you have to chew on and figure out how to untangle, but instead it can be like

185
00:19:56,272 --> 00:20:11,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the question that this is the answer to instead of like because I you know I look at the web page and it does feel pretty dense because we're I've tried to like anticipate every question that's going to come up, but then it's like giving a bunch of answers, and it looks like a lot of information so I think an FAQ.

186
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:15,261
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a great way to present that communication.

187
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:28,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think working with the task force, they'll have a better sense of exactly which questions and what answers they're looking for and ask the questions the right way instead of me sort of wondering what questions.

188
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:31,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of sense to me.

189
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:50,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of my questions around afterschool is, I know we have done a live question and answer about, say, the middle school lottery, which I grant is a very different lottery beast, but is there some sort of real-time thing that's needed here?

190
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if it is, but...

191
00:20:54,173 --> 00:21:07,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we actually went as part of our conversation with the task force last week and the week before we are planning a night in July at the Met Republic library to kind of have that open forum more like.

192
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:18,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus groups kind of coming together among the people who join us that evening to kind of collaborate and I think part of that is developing kind of those communication.

193
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:22,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Paths I think is the is the best way to put it.

194
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:31,712
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of understanding what questions they have further and how we can best kind of gather all the thoughts to get the information to families as best as possible.

195
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:32,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So that.

196
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:37,219
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in that is in the works for for late July this summer.

197
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:44,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, I'd be interested in what the task force has to say to that.

198
00:21:44,685 --> 00:22:01,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we can simply defer to them on after school for this, the purposes of this meeting, but maybe like, you know, again, like a one pager, like, here's how after school works, which I know it does change all the time, but the same kind of thing, like, here's the lottery, here's how it works.

199
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:04,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, we've had, I've had people say, um,

200
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:08,934
[SPEAKER_04]: well, they don't tell me where I am in the line.

201
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:14,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, that's because we asked them not to.

202
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:22,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because people were badgering our staff who have to take care of kids and we needed them to be able to focus on taking care of kids.

203
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:33,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's, you know, a lot of like transition happening there, but maybe something like in a one page kind of format, again, like pretty early in the game so that if anyone,

204
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,134
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever you sort of think like, oh my God, I have to find afterschool for my kid.

205
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's some like simple way to understand how the process works would probably be very helpful, but I totally defer to what the task force has to say about that.

206
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, why don't we move on to transition from elementary to middle school?

207
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:04,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I was, oh, do we want to wait?

208
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:05,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say that.

209
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, um.

210
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:11,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this might be an area of improvement for sure.

211
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we do more for the transition from 8th to 9th.

212
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:28,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we do from 5th to 6th, with the exception of Joan Bowen and her wonderful department, who does a nice job with that transition, but I don't think there's an awful lot.

213
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen skein in terms of, like, the transition from grade 5 to grade 6, I think that is a growth area for metro public schools.

214
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:43,200
[SPEAKER_03]: But I defer to your sure.

215
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,922
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of things that we have done this year that.

216
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:58,612
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, obviously are helpful to the process is both Nick and I, um, hold our open houses, which we begin communication with the families at that point.

217
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:04,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, this year we, uh, took the.

218
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:08,836
[SPEAKER_06]: The reins of the course selection piece for world language.

219
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sent out.

220
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:14,510
[SPEAKER_06]: a communication to all families to give them a preference for world language.

221
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:20,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick and I do a lot of like individual tours.

222
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:26,273
[SPEAKER_06]: People reach out and they ask us to just kind of do a walkthrough and give some information.

223
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:39,597
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times that is families that are coming from out of district or moving to the area or from some of the, you know,

224
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:50,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Saint rays and so forth and so they're looking to transition to public school and they want some more information.

225
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:54,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do a lot of individual or 1 on 1 times with them.

226
00:24:56,376 --> 00:25:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: We do begin summer communications with the families, so I believe Nick and I both have it down to three opportunities that we send out, kind of like a newsletter of transitioning to middle school.

227
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: In the summer, in August, Nick and I both offer one-to-one 15-minute meetings that parents can sign up for.

228
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:32,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how we're going to manage that this summer with all of the HVAC, but that is an opportunity that even if we have to do it somewhere else, we will probably continue.

229
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,180
[SPEAKER_06]: On the playground?

230
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Outside in the driveway, whatever works.

231
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,764
[SPEAKER_06]: But each family can sign up.

232
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:48,750
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times they have information they want to share in order to help the transition be a more positive one or

233
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,451
[SPEAKER_06]: they need information in order to make sure that their child transitions positively.

234
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:56,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do that.

235
00:25:56,631 --> 00:26:00,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And then obviously we have orientation for students.

236
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:11,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a lot of opportunities for students or families to become familiar with what middle school is and the transition that difference.

237
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We both do a student panel at our open houses too, so that parents have an opportunity to

238
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:22,191
[SPEAKER_06]: hear directly from students and ask student questions.

239
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:28,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my, well, not my, I believe Nick's as well.

240
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:40,151
[SPEAKER_06]: have transition meetings with each elementary school where our counseling team goes and meets with the special ed and counseling teams down at the elementary level.

241
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And they bring a lot of information back for us.

242
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:57,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way we are able to make good scheduling choices, make sure that we are supporting parents in where their child will be placed, like on which side or

243
00:26:59,005 --> 00:26:59,685
[SPEAKER_06]: classes.

244
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:04,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a lot of work that happens with that.

245
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure there's things that we can improve.

246
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:11,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only thing.

247
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:12,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Jen.

248
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

249
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a nice long list.

250
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:22,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only thing for me would be an advance to that like student panel.

251
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:22,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

252
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:25,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you know how you

253
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:29,205
[SPEAKER_03]: At the middle school level, there are eighth grade.

254
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:36,951
[SPEAKER_03]: The high school will send students to the middle schools to kind of talk about the course assignments.

255
00:27:38,052 --> 00:27:54,285
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that something like that might be nice that we can do where we can have some sixth or seventh graders visit somehow, try to figure out a way to kind of just maybe give some fifth grade students a little bit more information ahead of the open house.

256
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that might be a great idea.

257
00:27:57,126 --> 00:28:11,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this year I worked with Mata and Sheila, one of the APs, and we brought some ninth graders down to the middle school to do a Q&A between them, kind of a more casual high school life really like.

258
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:18,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we could probably facilitate something similar where we bring some sixth and seventh graders down.

259
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:32,715
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I did internally, and I'm sure Nick does something similar, is I developed a peer mentor program this year so that students that work with me for the

260
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:43,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Orientation are also students that will go into homerooms throughout the year just to check in with kids, answer any questions, find out where they're at at that.

261
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And we try and put together like a little lesson that's helpful for the kids to kind of teach.

262
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:51,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And they do that during their wind block.

263
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was helpful too.

264
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:56,925
[SPEAKER_05]: These all sound great.

265
00:28:57,065 --> 00:29:04,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one piece that I think, I think these things are all happening kind of once placements have happened, once kids know where they're going.

266
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:09,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of anxiety leading up to that about not knowing what's coming.

267
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:13,999
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, again, kind of that overview of there's- The road to middle school.

268
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:19,083
[SPEAKER_05]: The road to middle school kind of thing and with the fifth grade teachers.

269
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:22,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's some inconsistency among fifth grade teachers of,

270
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:32,168
[SPEAKER_05]: How how much they're willing to take on or how much they have been able to take on in terms of prepping their kids for.

271
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,215
[SPEAKER_04]: For middle school, yeah, I mean, I think again, like, something early in the year that says.

272
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a fifth grader.

273
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:44,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great news.

274
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:48,578
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of things that are going to happen between now and the time they transition to middle school.

275
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what you can expect from us.

276
00:29:53,103 --> 00:30:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think if parents are thinking about going elsewhere for middle school, they're thinking about that in October.

277
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,494
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first opportunity to go see our middle schools officially is like May.

278
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, when you were saying you give a lot of individual tours, I guess my other question is, is there a way to have some sort of like,

279
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:29,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Combined tour night between the 2 schools where you talk about, like, middle school in a general way, the curriculum, et cetera.

280
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:34,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So that people who are interested in that piece of it early, like, October ish.

281
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,835
[SPEAKER_04]: have a place to go to get that information.

282
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:54,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe some of those, you know, families that you are entertaining on an individualized basis might even appreciate coming to something like that because they're likely to know other people in the community with kids their age, even if they don't go to school with them.

283
00:30:54,807 --> 00:31:06,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you show up and your friends are there and they're like, oh yeah, you know, my oldest went to this school or whatever, like there's some like cross-pollination that could be productive there that

284
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe would be very helpful as well.

285
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember world language being, like, basically the only choice, right, that you have on the way into middle school.

286
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:32,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't remember really learning about it, and this may have changed because it's been a couple of years, but, like, I don't remember learning about, like, did you get your choice or not until, like, schedules came out.

287
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still the case?

288
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:38,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you get a lot of questions about that outside of, like, when the schedule comes out?

289
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is still the case.

290
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:50,318
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other thing that students can opt for, and we added to the form, is if they're taking band or orchestra.

291
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:03,247
[SPEAKER_06]: We do make it clear that it's a preference, not a request, because obviously if I have 85 students who all want to take Italian, I only have

292
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,902
[SPEAKER_06]: so many sections of Italian, so obviously that would be an issue scheduling wise.

293
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:16,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it or not, no, I don't have a lot of questions about that.

294
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It was interesting during the lottery presentation that Dr. Galluzzi did this year, 90% of our questions were about extracurriculars.

295
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,269
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted to know what they could do in middle school.

296
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:34,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's well, my kids were on the front end of the lottery.

297
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So we weren't the very first lottery class, but we were pretty early in the game.

298
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And those meetings were packed because it was new.

299
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's what we do.

300
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a completely different thing.

301
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:49,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

302
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:50,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even sure.

303
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:57,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like a meeting about the lottery, if we can message it more proactively, is necessary.

304
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:03,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're going to have a meeting about middle school, like I would have a meeting about middle school, not about the lottery.

305
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're going to talk about the lottery, you should just make people aware that if they watch the lottery, there's like nothing to see.

306
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:14,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think people think there's something to see and they think they're going to learn

307
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:18,255
[SPEAKER_04]: on screen where their kid is going, and none of that is true.

308
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:26,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you just watch a bunch of people, like, passing papers around, and it's, like, sort of the craziest half hour of television of the day, you know.

309
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:31,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like, it had—things have changed.

310
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:32,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that has settled in.

311
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a process that people are familiar with.

312
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:42,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we can embrace that and not necessarily have to keep having those meetings that people seem not as interested in anymore.

313
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:49,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't just, Dr. Glusi and Will were there.

314
00:33:49,213 --> 00:33:51,874
[SPEAKER_06]: They could definitely jump in on that.

315
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:54,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But their questions weren't about the lottery.

316
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,515
[SPEAKER_06]: They were not concerned about the lottery.

317
00:33:56,575 --> 00:34:01,176
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted more information about what middle school would be like and the transition.

318
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:03,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely agree with you.

319
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:13,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if there could be something in the fall, and maybe then there's a Zoom, you probably could hit up a bunch of different parents and a bunch of different questions with a similar program.

320
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:21,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the main source of anxiety I've seen around the lottery is actually in the kids.

321
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:23,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And am I going to be separated from my friends?

322
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:40,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I think the peer-to-peer panels actually make a lot of sense here, especially as middle schoolers are doing that developmental thing where they are separating from the adults and trusting the older and wiser eighth graders before they trust.

323
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:45,810
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a legitimate concern and that's the 1 we hear over and over again.

324
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:54,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so yeah, and I think the benefit is that we do have access to the van.

325
00:34:55,097 --> 00:34:55,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

326
00:34:56,178 --> 00:35:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are fairly easy to put together where I can put a nice crew that is prepared to.

327
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: head down to each elementary school and do a quick presentation.

328
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:08,234
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure the principals would be happy to help me facilitate that.

329
00:35:09,996 --> 00:35:15,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we could even cross-pollinate and have Andrews and McGlynn students go at the same time.

330
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should go together.

331
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:20,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should have representation from both schools.

332
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:25,406
[SPEAKER_05]: The risk of that is if one kid is engaging and another one isn't, then everyone wants to do that.

333
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:30,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also anxiety about how different are these two schools and these two experiences.

334
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

335
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:45,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remind them about my eighth grader last year at graduation when she said that all her friends got the McGlynn and she got Andrews and how it was the best thing that could have happened to her.

336
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So I remind kids about that all the time.

337
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:52,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And hearing that from a kid is huge.

338
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:53,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

339
00:35:55,847 --> 00:36:04,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good question, is what we can do centrally to take some of that individual burden off of you and Nick to do.

340
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:13,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I think personalizing middle school is really important, and I don't want to lose that because it makes people feel welcome in the school that they're in.

341
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:21,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of that hand-holding before they know where they're going is good.

342
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:23,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

343
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving right along, middle to high school.

344
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:33,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have two middle to high school parents here with you today.

345
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:43,321
[SPEAKER_05]: You got two rising, and John's brother is also, you got, yeah, you got four school committee members coming into ninth, families coming into ninth grade.

346
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited.

347
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:49,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I don't think, I don't think one of them, I think one of them is going to a Catholic school.

348
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:50,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want that.

349
00:36:52,947 --> 00:37:01,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so things that we do for the transition to high school, we have our open house in the fall for eighth graders to come up to the high school.

350
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's information shared in the Karen Theater by principals and then a tour of the school.

351
00:37:08,315 --> 00:37:17,340
[SPEAKER_02]: We then have orientation in August for ninth graders, um, led by administration and primarily by students.

352
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,911
[SPEAKER_02]: We then have meet the principals night in August as well.

353
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,818
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just for parents.

354
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:32,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Other events that we hold is Course Information Night.

355
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:35,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It's held in the spring.

356
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:49,894
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, it looked much different than it normally does because we didn't have a lot of the information yet and didn't want to be in the Caron Theater with 300 parents and not having the information from the ratified contract yet.

357
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:51,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looked completely different.

358
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:56,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We will go back to more of the traditional way in the future.

359
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:07,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what else do we do so we have the high school principals, along with athletics, along with I forget who else joins.

360
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of different people that joined to go down to the middle schools to do a presentation.

361
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: This year in our senior civics class, we had a project that the seniors went down and did a presentation to eighth grade.

362
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:31,466
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year we've done that and it went really well hearing from seniors instead of from the principals.

363
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And students really enjoyed that.

364
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They also did like a, I think it was at the Andrews, right, Jen?

365
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:40,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they did like a kickball and all of that.

366
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite the event that they had down at the Andrews.

367
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to do that at the Andrews and at the McGlynn next year.

368
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:49,426
[SPEAKER_02]: This year was the pilot.

369
00:38:50,690 --> 00:39:10,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have just for the smooth transition we do have senior mentors and freshman homerooms to help that is every single day so we have our national honor society students and any other students that would like to participate to seniors per freshman homeroom that are really supposed to help them with everything new.

370
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes with being in high school.

371
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:20,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that we piloted this year and it went really well and we will continue that.

372
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,903
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do our quarterly newsletters that we send to families and to students.

373
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: We also want to send those newsletters, because a lot of it is highlighting what's happening at the high school down to eighth grade parents as the transition.

374
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:45,166
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done this yet, but as the transition happens from eighth grade to ninth grade, so that they're seeing all the things that we're doing at the high school.

375
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,488
[SPEAKER_02]: and just kind of orienting themselves with the newsletters.

376
00:39:49,229 --> 00:40:00,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, lastly, something that I do think we can do better is definitely the communication for the scheduling process for 8th to 9th grade.

377
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:05,100
[SPEAKER_02]: That usually goes through the school counseling department, and I think it's something that

378
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:13,295
[SPEAKER_02]: we can be more transparent about and share more information as to what the process looks like.

379
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:20,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the students care much, some of them, but we do get a lot of questions from parents.

380
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we can help ourselves by sending more information in newsletters in order to not get, you know, a hundred plus emails about certain things.

381
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:35,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is definitely our area of growth for the future.

382
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:45,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Presumably some questions were asked frequently in those emails that could be pulled out into some sort of FAQ.

383
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I got the email and I found it wholly without context.

384
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:53,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, you know, we did have challenges this year with

385
00:40:54,853 --> 00:41:03,078
[SPEAKER_02]: just figuring out what we were going to offer and still what we're going to offer with seven periods and teacher assignments and so forth.

386
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure what we previously did.

387
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,081
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like my first transition in between.

388
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:16,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that we can definitely be more proactive about sending out more information with the scheduling process.

389
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you've been here a lot longer than that, Marta.

390
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:22,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

391
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only on year two.

392
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just year two.

393
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will say that there's a million missed opportunities in the open house.

394
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:35,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been to several of them now.

395
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:47,217
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the vocational teams do a really great job of showcasing their students and their programs.

396
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:56,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And so any parent that is like wandering into any of those places is getting like a pretty lovely experience.

397
00:41:56,922 --> 00:42:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you come with questions about academics, like your takeaway is this is not the place for my kid.

398
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really lackluster on the academic side.

399
00:42:08,046 --> 00:42:10,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that, you know,

400
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: it's easier to be excited to see something, right?

401
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Like here's this thing that the kids built, right?

402
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Like here's this car that they're fixing.

403
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:35,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's this web, like the, the vocational side of, um, the house has like all the benefits in the world of having tangible things that people can see and, you know,

404
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Touch and feel in some cases, right?

405
00:42:39,402 --> 00:42:43,084
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes that experience really engaging, but.

406
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:52,689
[SPEAKER_04]: There we aren't the 1st school to have an open house about academics and we can certainly do better than we've done.

407
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:59,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a few years ago, I'm happy to share that email with you, but a few years ago, after Lila went through it, I sent a.

408
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:05,839
[SPEAKER_04]: really scathing email about how mortified I was at the experience.

409
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:15,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's fine, like, it wasn't the end of the world, but it was like, there were just so many opportunities where we just didn't put our best foot forward.

410
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was before your time, Marta.

411
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:22,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I imagine like there's some good nuggets in there.

412
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:28,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's the first, that is like the timing is just right for parents who are thinking about

413
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where they want to send their kid to high school and, like, we've just got this, like, golden opportunity and then we basically give everyone a map and tell them to go wander a giant building.

414
00:43:40,128 --> 00:43:42,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think, you know, I'm really big deal.

415
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to build culture within staff.

416
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So that staff volunteer for this.

417
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:47,734
[SPEAKER_02]: It's.

418
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:53,706
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging because it's not a contractual night for staff.

419
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:00,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really trying to build that as, you know, we want staff to come to highlight this.

420
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:03,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is important for us as a school community.

421
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:03,452
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

422
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:09,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think vocational, vocational teachers are there.

423
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know last year, it was there were a fair number of curriculum directors there who

424
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:37,581
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a range of ability to speak to what the day-to-day lesson is, but most of them were able to say, this is the curriculum, this is the textbook we use, and didn't really talk about what the student experience was, like what you do in class.

425
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:43,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, I could be wrong because negotiations were

426
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:49,801
[SPEAKER_04]: wild and crazy, but I did think that something shifted in the night event.

427
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll go back.

428
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:54,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We're moving forward.

429
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:56,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I need to look at that as well.

430
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how school shifted.

431
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:02,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was on the 10th, but I don't know where we landed.

432
00:45:02,095 --> 00:45:05,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was definitely discussed.

433
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:05,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotly.

434
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: At various points of time.

435
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:16,487
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is, and I think, yes, I will take all of the feedback I can, but I think that that's the challenge in such a big building is to just have the four content directors.

436
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good enough.

437
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:20,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And the coordinators is just not enough.

438
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:21,849
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we can do.

439
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:23,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

440
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think there is.

441
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:29,653
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be showcasing all of the classrooms in student work in the classrooms.

442
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:31,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

443
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think there's amazing things going on.

444
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:38,663
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere, world language, everywhere in the arts.

445
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:38,663
100%.

446
00:45:39,143 --> 00:45:41,544
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many amazing things going on.

447
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:46,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so unfortunate that we don't get to really show that off to people.

448
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:48,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a big deal.

449
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:54,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I definitely would say, I still don't know what's going on with Lucas's schedule.

450
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,368
[SPEAKER_04]: He came home and told me he picked something.

451
00:45:56,388 --> 00:45:57,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why did you pick that?

452
00:45:57,729 --> 00:45:58,609
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I don't know.

453
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:02,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still completely unclear.

454
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:05,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there another round of this?

455
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:07,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there not another round of this?

456
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So I completely support the idea of kids having a front row seat to how this is supposed to happen.

457
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:21,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we need to tell parents that that is what's happening proactively.

458
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:23,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, here's the roadmap to going to high school.

459
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:25,427
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to happen.

460
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:27,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get to approve it.

461
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,937
[SPEAKER_04]: this is how it gets finalized, et cetera, et cetera.

462
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the dates and all those good things.

463
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:37,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Like same thing, like what is that pathway that you can expect from us?

464
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: But from a scheduling perspective, I'm still personally like very unclear if his schedule is done or not done.

465
00:46:46,782 --> 00:46:50,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would echo that.

466
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:54,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other piece that's perhaps missing from parents and maybe it's the,

467
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:05,006
[SPEAKER_05]: overly involved parents like me, but wanting to know if I make this choice now, what are the consequences of that later?

468
00:47:05,646 --> 00:47:21,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're trying to say, okay, somebody says, well, I don't want to take this honors class, say, okay, but that means you won't be able to do this, or just knowing kind of the trajectory of how some of these things go, especially with what the graduation requirements are.

469
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:45,664
[SPEAKER_05]: and say, if you opt for your instrumental class, you then have to choose between language PE and one other arts class or whatever it is, just kind of that big picture and a little bit of the long-term planning of, you know, in order to take AP science, you need to make this choice.

470
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:47,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I don't think that's true in Medford.

471
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:48,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I said,

472
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take earth science, you close off AP classes.

473
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:55,568
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my high school in a completely different state.

474
00:47:55,768 --> 00:48:07,474
[SPEAKER_05]: But knowing a little bit more of the big picture of how scheduling works and what it means, because it does feel a little bit like throwing darts at a dartboard.

475
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And I recognize the challenge that we don't have the schedule and the courses for the semester.

476
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:17,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a bad example as a rising ninth grade parent.

477
00:48:18,322 --> 00:48:26,027
[SPEAKER_03]: the thread of everything we've talked about tonight, the one-pager, the roadmap, that all makes sense.

478
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:29,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are things that we can internally be working on.

479
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that MARTA has been working very closely with guidance.

480
00:48:35,733 --> 00:48:43,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they actually are making tremendous headway, to be honest, because I think they're very close to sharing a draft.

481
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:56,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Of a student schedule, which is really, I have to say, like, this year to have just gone through a completely new schedule and.

482
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratification of a teacher's contract that was not that long ago is like a herculean effort.

483
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:13,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what the communication has been this year, yes, we could provide an update and that makes sense.

484
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:25,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So that parents that have all these questions, at least to get that communication, like, this is what we're building, but this year is definitely not what is typical or what would even be at this time next year.

485
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think parents understand that.

486
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:36,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone I've talked to, and granted, I only talk to the people that I talk to or reach out to me, they understand why things were in flux.

487
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:41,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of goodwill here, just making sure that we're ahead of it.

488
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:43,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

489
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:49,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say like the messaging from the high school has never been like entirely on point.

490
00:49:50,211 --> 00:49:55,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when it, what I remember when Lila was going from eighth to ninth grade was

491
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:57,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make these selections.

492
00:49:57,588 --> 00:49:58,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make all these selections.

493
00:49:59,009 --> 00:50:00,470
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make your course selections.

494
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:08,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the choices of anything, it was her choices were like, are you going in honors or CP?

495
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:09,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

496
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:12,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Because her year, everyone did the CTE.

497
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:14,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So you weren't choosing that.

498
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't choosing to go to gym or health.

499
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You were literally choosing.

500
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: like which version of the required class you were taking which was fine but I was like it was billed as like you have to make all of these selections and this is really important and I was like there's not

501
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:34,841
[SPEAKER_04]: you're making it sound like there's choices here and there aren't.

502
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:53,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think if the high school has the parent advisory council or whatever they're called, there just might be some people willing to help pre-read some of these things to say, does this hit what parents are asking about right now?

503
00:50:53,145 --> 00:51:00,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like particularly around these transition points, it's really easy to get

504
00:51:01,322 --> 00:51:05,223
[SPEAKER_04]: stuck in, like, on thinking everyone knows your language when they don't.

505
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:10,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, because not only do they not speak school, but they also don't speak high school because they only have a middle schooler.

506
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:21,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think particularly in that transition, there might be some opportunity to ask people to help with that messaging in advance in some way that could just settle it down.

507
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:25,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also think, Marta, if you want

508
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:34,300
[SPEAKER_04]: help or support from families around, like, the course selection night or open house in terms of feedback.

509
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there's—I could think of, like, five or six people who would be more than happy to, like, have a meeting so that you're hearing that perspective from more than just me and Erica and John, right?

510
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's also a possibility because I think there's plenty of parents that would be willing to help.

511
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:58,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to also say, I think bringing in some parents to advise on that would be really helpful.

512
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:02,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some people who are very productive and kind about it.

513
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:12,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other point I think that students and families is what is the relationship with guidance?

514
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:19,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I think guidance counselors play a different role at the different levels and

515
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:29,432
[SPEAKER_05]: knowing that scheduling is going through guidance and challenges you're facing go to guidance, particularly at the high school level.

516
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:37,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned meeting the principals, and I think you said sending guidance counselors to the middle schools, was that true?

517
00:52:37,177 --> 00:52:37,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it guidance?

518
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:39,779
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was the counselors going to elementary.

519
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm wondering if there's an element of that that would help with the transition of

520
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:52,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a big question that parents often have is, who do I go to about this?

521
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I going to the principal?

522
00:52:53,661 --> 00:53:03,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I going to... Right, in elementary school, it is the teacher first and the principal, but who is it at these other levels?

523
00:53:03,507 --> 00:53:12,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be really helpful, because the relationship with guidance absolutely changes, or has the potential to change.

524
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:15,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone leans into that resource.

525
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:22,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you for the suggestions and for the support.

526
00:53:24,004 --> 00:53:31,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you if there's folks that you want to chat with, just I'm happy to send some people your way as well.

527
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:37,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last thing on our list was end of year school happenings and events.

528
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:39,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Erica?

529
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:40,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

530
00:53:40,555 --> 00:54:07,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was, that was, so I've been seeing a lot of people being taken by surprise by a field trip or the prom tickets are going to be, some of it is around expenses, some of it is around scheduling, but just knowing that these are the moving on ceremonies that every grade at the high school often has a dance and who's responsible for that to say, this is a PTO thing, this is a school led thing.

531
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:17,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think just having a heads up about what that is gonna look like is gonna be really helpful for people.

532
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:27,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot happens at the end of the year and people, I think, feel like things just suddenly get thrown onto the calendar when we actually knew these things were coming.

533
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:33,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And so being able to communicate that at every level

534
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:38,727
[SPEAKER_05]: is helpful and also around expenses.

535
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the field trip notice for Canobie Lake Park, and it's a $30 field trip, which some families panicked about that.

536
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:51,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Some families said, oh, that's fine.

537
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:55,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Some might have said, oh, if I'd known that I was going to be paying

538
00:54:57,776 --> 00:55:11,321
[SPEAKER_05]: that much for a field trip, maybe that would have been a gift that I would have given my kid at their bar mitzvah or at their as a as a milestone and so being able to plan both time and financial resources.

539
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:20,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's not always easy to say exactly how much something is going to cost or exactly when this is going to happen.

540
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:27,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I know at the high school, the dances, there was talk of a combined dance, and then there was talk of individual grades.

541
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:34,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But what that looks like, I think we know more and can tell people more in advance.

542
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably a PTO slash school collaboration.

543
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:40,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

544
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:41,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was going to say, if I can,

545
00:55:43,447 --> 00:56:00,483
[SPEAKER_08]: coming from personal experience I know so for a lot of like the field trips yeah I agree that having those sort of expectations of what something may cost what I will say with like the proms is it changes year by year, because it's based on how much the class fund raises.

546
00:56:01,685 --> 00:56:07,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that one is one that will always be kind of like a heaven full of like there might be a range but like.

547
00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:16,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is like, we were able to bring it down below a hundred for the first time because we had very successful Yankee Candles, but then it can shoot back up.

548
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:23,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I think also there's also that thing of like making sure people are involved in helping with fundraisers.

549
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:24,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

550
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:24,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

551
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:35,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is, this depends on the class fundraising, knowing that this is what we're fundraising for, or, you know, fifth graders always do a fundraiser at the Roberts.

552
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,832
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know what happened.

553
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:41,317
[SPEAKER_05]: They do fundraisers and it's, what is that for?

554
00:56:41,337 --> 00:56:49,930
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to plan, I guess, is just what I... We've had some, we've definitely had some internal conversations about calendaring.

555
00:56:50,747 --> 00:57:04,757
[SPEAKER_03]: and about communication, Jen Silva was concerned, very concerned around the amount of field trips that were planned, maybe, I don't know, either not communicated or planned suddenly.

556
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:17,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of kind of streamlining and aligning that we need to do to make that a little bit better.

557
00:57:17,546 --> 00:57:18,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say,

558
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:28,557
[SPEAKER_03]: The communication around field trips, the communication between what is a PTO event versus school-based event, that is the responsibility of a principal.

559
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:35,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having those conversations in partnership with Will to help kind of streamline that.

560
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:48,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely have been talking about a better way to do our internal calendar, too, to make sure that we're cross-checking events that are already scheduled versus ones that you want to schedule.

561
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:59,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is definitely a work in progress that I think we can smooth out a little bit better next year.

562
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:05,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely seemed like there was a lot kind of packed into the end of this year for some reason.

563
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:10,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And concerts and moving on and

564
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are done well in advance, so I think, you know, we do that was 1 of the other conversations that we had, because we do have an internal calendar for school assessment for school events for things that are happening around the district.

565
00:58:27,473 --> 00:58:34,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Suzanne fee, when it comes to the, the arts month in May, those are all done in the summer.

566
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

567
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:41,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Will and I have had conversations around how we can make that calendar.

568
00:58:42,163 --> 00:58:51,287
[SPEAKER_03]: accessible, like, to the community in a way that doesn't overwhelm people and differentiates between, like, daytime events.

569
00:58:51,647 --> 00:59:10,414
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, school assessment calendars and field trips is one part that's during the school day, but events at night and whether it's PTO or whether it's our concerts and our art shows and our plays, that's another.

570
00:59:13,355 --> 00:59:17,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And I recognize any of these calendars are going to come with a subject to change.

571
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I keep cutting miss gain off.

572
00:59:21,305 --> 00:59:27,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was just going to say, if maybe district wide, I have 2 thoughts about that 1, if we all so.

573
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about other schools, because I don't look, but I know both McGlynn and I, we have a Google calendar.

574
00:59:36,665 --> 00:59:49,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that I would say is all of our events are on there, other than a few here and there in August, like we literally put all our events for the year, and they're subject to change.

575
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:54,478
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I would say, and maybe, Will, this is something for you, is

576
00:59:57,993 --> 00:59:59,954
[SPEAKER_06]: we only see like a week at a time.

577
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:06,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if there's a way we can see further out so that they can fly through the whole year.

578
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:08,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about on the website?

579
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

580
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:09,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

581
01:00:09,756 --> 01:00:11,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

582
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:23,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would say if, if, if we started sending the message of the calendar is on the, the school websites and the, the like, and

583
01:00:24,485 --> 01:00:27,590
[SPEAKER_06]: start getting parents used to using that as a tool.

584
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:36,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I think sometimes they go to Facebook and social media and things like that, and they don't go to the primary source that would be the best information.

585
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

586
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:39,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfectly fair.

587
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:47,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an integrated, is there, I don't know how sophisticated our web stuff is, but the calendar, is there a way to filter?

588
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:52,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I have a kid at the high school and the Andrews and the Mrs. This is what we're working on.

589
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:54,052
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we're working on.

590
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:59,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So the high school has a Google calendar that you can link to your Gmail.

591
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think each school could do that.

592
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:04,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

593
01:01:05,493 --> 01:01:08,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I think we made it to the end of our agenda.

594
01:01:08,715 --> 01:01:12,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for indulging.

595
01:01:12,176 --> 01:01:15,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we did those action items along the way.

596
01:01:16,879 --> 01:01:17,199
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

597
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other comments from the group?

598
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

599
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:29,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

600
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:32,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

601
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And also adjourned by a member and Tapa seconded by a member.
