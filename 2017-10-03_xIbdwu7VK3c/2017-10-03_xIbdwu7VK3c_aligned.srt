1
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:05,728
This is the moment an hour long standoff comes to a peaceful conclusion.

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:11,652
Police seize an opportunity to rush in when a man with three knives is momentarily distracted.

3
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:12,708
He was depressed.

4
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:16,111
The drama unfolding at Columbus Elementary School in Medford.

5
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:21,994
Moments earlier, Sky 5 captures the man sitting up against a wall right in front of the school.

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,856
350 young students are inside.

7
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:29,259
He stood up, he sat down, he made no no gestures like he was going to run towards the door.

8
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,741
Patient police negotiators talked to the man.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,722
The school goes into lockdown.

10
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:42,972
We obviously lock in doors, put kids in places, put people in key strategic locations to watch doors and corridors and any other possible area where someone might get in.

11
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,033
And everyone follow that exactly.

12
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,615
Many parents rush to the school as soon as they're notified.

13
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,136
I never drove so fast from Woburn to here.

14
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,397
You know, with all the stuff going on, you never know.

15
00:00:55,217 --> 00:00:58,138
But the Columbus School did a great job after the takedown.

16
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,979
The suspect is put into an ambulance and taken to the hospital.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,622
A short time later, parents and kids are reunited after the anxious hour long lockdown.

18
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:12,704
I'm just going to take him home and you know he's only four so I don't know kind of what's going to cross his mind.

19
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:20,267
The police chief here in Medford says it's too soon to tell whether that suspect will face any criminal charges.

00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,909
