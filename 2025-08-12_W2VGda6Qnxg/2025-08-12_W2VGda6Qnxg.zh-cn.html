    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=0.191s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 看看他们昨晚在学生之夜做了什么。
 看起来很棒。
 我的父亲阿维·法根（Avi Fagan）。
 为此退休的布罗姆，所以我们非常感谢。
 对于我们的志愿者和个人，里斯和伊莱在那里。
 他们已经在卖一些书。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=18.398s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 当然，我的伴侣谢拉（Shayla），我无法全力以赴。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=22.601s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 加勒尔（Galel）坐在台阶上帮助这里的声音。
 当然还有特里·卡特（Terry Carter），这确实就是为什么所有这一切都在西梅德福社区中心发生的原因。
 这是社区中的固定要素，是一位了不起的诗人。
 一切都很好。
 哦，我忘记了谁？
 吉姆和哦，布鲁斯还为整个周末提供了一些相机作品的帮助。
 因此，即使在所有这些人中，它仍然需要许多不同的财务贡献才能实现这一切。
 如果您看我们的横幅，我们应该在那里大部分赞助商。
 梅德福社区媒体当然，西梅德福社区中心，梅德福艺术委员会和大众文化委员会，以及艺术活着的梅德福基金会。
 这也是我们在食品供应商的第一年。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=73.411s">[SPEAKER_00]</a>: 丹麦糕点屋里面。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=75.252s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 他们已经建立了令人难以置信的完全印象深刻的传播。
 在旋律之间，两组之间，去看它们。
 还有一些可能需要利用它们的人的浴室。
 是的，还有Triangle Manor，这是一家本地T衬衫公司，为所有人制作了一些惊人的衬衫，并进行了Exp Realty。
 还有几个个人赞助商，包括在我们的Patreon页面上注册的人。
 这是一个每月的签名，在整年进行果酱会议和其他演出之类的事情上确实有所不同。
 到处都有QR码，为那些在我们的Venmo中都愿意捐赠的人，他们只参加爵士梅德福音乐节，以及这个特殊的Patreon页面，这是一个很好的支持。
 很好，所以我认为全是。
 我总是觉得我忘记了一个人，但是请稍后再回来，特里·卡特（Terry Carter）会告诉您一些关于这一组和空间的信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=144.584s">[Terry Carter]</a>: 很好，谢谢，谢谢。
 乔纳森·法根（Jonathan Fagan）是梅德福爵士音乐节（Medford Jazz Festival）的协调员，也是创始人，是一位了不起的作曲家和钢琴家，也是音乐音乐的一切，所以您很快就会听到他的声音。
 这是西梅德福社区中心。
 我们从事业务已有90年了。
 我们是核心的核心
 历史悠久的非洲美洲梅德福社区，您知道，我们在神秘河上很好。
 在里约热内卢和三街上，我们有悠久的历史，以及您以后会听到的所有事情。
 但是我们希望直接进入业务，我们希望确保我们不会减少我们的时间
 我们第二天的第一幕。
 对于昨晚与我们在一起的任何人，我们与昨晚一起玩的两个小组度过了一段难以置信的时光，以及Morningsid音乐学院的Morningside的明星，这真是太棒了。
 然后，与Anita Wood和她的团队AJ和团队一起，我的意思是，我们很开心。
 他们让我在夜晚结束之前跳舞，所以一切都很好。
 所以，谢谢。
 黛比（Debbie）昨晚与Jazz Morningsis全明星赛一起演唱，很棒。
 好吧，那么，我们的第一个星期六是Recita de Samba，从与Jacob de Bandolim同名的合唱团中获取。
 这意味着在葡萄牙语中，我从来源中发现了它，
 桑巴菜的食谱，该桑巴菜是由一个小组称为的应用程序，其方法是以最纯粹的形式显示出许多巴西音乐的风味，而没有人工添加剂，我喜欢，例如电池机或电动采样。
 厨师，他们的厨房，丈夫和妻子，安娜·博尔赫斯和比尔·沃德（Ana Borges）和比尔·沃德（Bill Ward），并基于波士顿充满活力的巴西音乐界</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=276.674s">[Unidentified]</a>: 只是最好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=278.075s">[Terry Carter]</a>: 最好的Bossa Nova和Samba，以及福特，Ihecha和Coco等地区专业。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=286.162s">[Clayton]</a>: 我希望我做得很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=287.123s">[Terry Carter]</a>: 我知道我的巴西人不是。
 好的，安娜·博尔赫斯（Anna Borges）最初来自雷·佩（Recife），佩南布科（Pernambuco），她的职业生涯始于巴西利亚（Brasilia）在当地俱乐部和剧院唱歌。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=296.612s">[Unidentified]</a>: 最后，他学会了弹吉他，并在巴西利亚的一所音乐学校中注册，在那里他研究了自己的声音
 简·杜波斯（Jane Dubos）在一个研究经典和流行技术的珊瑚群体中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=309.701s">[Terry Carter]</a>: 经过多年与巴西吉他手Alosa Alcantara的密切合作，我正在转学到波士顿，音乐合作开始于
 比尔·沃德（Bill Ward），比尔·沃德（Bill Ward），比尔·沃德（Bill Ward）。
 他是钢琴家，吉他手和歌手，他深入探索了许多音乐世界。
 我喜欢那个。
 这是诗意的。
 他最初是一名爵士钢琴家，赢得了一名高中生的沮丧研究，然后在Oberlin音乐学院学习Dan Wall和Sam de Margolis。
 他13岁时获得了乔治·贝托（Giorgio Berto）的第一张记录，但不是大学
 在巴西音乐的漩涡中，这确实是富有诗意的。
 最近，他陷入了经典的钢琴宇宙，寻找波士顿大学的钢琴诠释硕士学位，并在那里与戈雅·夏隆（Goya Charon）和吉尔达·戈德斯坦（Gilda Goldstein）一起学习。
 女士们，先生们，没有进一步的ADO，背诵桑巴。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=418.078s">[Clayton]</a>: 我到达姨妈，我到达捷克姨妈
 城市，请原谅我。
 我不知道你知道如此美好的生活。
 城市，请原谅我。
 我以为我要去，我以为我要死了。
 城市，请原谅我。
 外国人
 原谅我，但我不知道你知道没有我的生活是如此美好
 我们爱你！
 祝你好运！</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=607.076s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 非常感谢。
 第一首歌是卡洛斯·维拉（Carlos Vira）的，你知道的是波巴·诺瓦（Bossa Nova）的上帝之一。
 因此，如果为时已晚，请原谅我。
 这是标题。
 我会尝试翻译。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=620.585s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 我不太擅长这一点，但我认为您会得到一些我正在唱歌的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=627.889s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 因此，下一个作品就像爵士乐的影响。
 然后是爵士乐的影响。
 因此，这就像一首我也喜欢爵士乐和独自一人的影响。
 因此，就像您在谈论拥有它时一样，但是爵士乐拥有它。
 而且您知道，您会看到如何走。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1007.231s">[Clayton]</a>: 但是我认为这只是您可以采取的动作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1014.774s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 当您恋爱时，就不可能一个人快乐。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1019.015s">[Clayton]</a>: 我不能习惯它，因为我不知道该怎么说。
 这些是来去去的小事。
 祝福，冥想，不可能一个人快乐。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1353.458s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 有时我们会争论我想唱这首歌。
 我想，我不想播放这首歌。
 我当时想，什么？
 但这没关系。
 总是。
 我去耶稣土地的桑巴山，喝光，看见山姆巴斯。
 魔术吸引了我。
 我的心出来了。
 我在巴伊亚，街头派对。
 在月亮的食堂是桑巴。
 喝灯，检查班巴斯，一个魔术师引诱我。
 我的心脏溢出。
 我在海湾，我。
 月亮派对，我会的。
 在月球食堂，你必须下去。
 这张桌子是白色的，可以平静。
 我会充满信心地鼓掌。
 我很健康，我从那里。
 哦，哦，哦。

 JoãoBosco的歌总是疯了。
 因此，这是耶稣的尘世。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1594.326s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 这是巴伊亚（Bahia）有很多非洲贡献的地方。
 这就是他描述自己在哪里的方式，并且是一首非常有力和美丽的歌曲。
 很难在星期六早上唱歌。
 歌手喜欢在晚上唱歌。
 啊，我很累。
 因此，让我们互相回去，这是Sampa。
 桑帕就像圣保罗的缩写。
 因此，这是来自Caetano Veloso，他也第一次将其描述为Sampa。
 因为这是一个，圣保罗就像纽约。
 因此，他说，关于圣保罗的美好和诗意的事情。
 这更安静。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=1663.275s">[SPEAKER_05]</a>: 我心中发生了一些事情，只有当我越过Epiranga和St. John大街时，我到这里时，我什么都没强调。
 Natura，他们的歌曲的具体诗歌，两个女孩的谨慎欲望。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/W2VGda6Qnxg&t=4626.503s">[Terry Carter]</a>:  All right.
 All right.
 Hello everybody.
 All right.
 So we had a beautiful first set.
 They said that they samba was marvelous.
 Really really good.
 And hopefully we will at least meet if not exceed your expectations for the second part of our program today.
 For those of you who don't know me or who I haven't had a chance to meet yet, my name is Terry Carter, Terry E. My mother says use the initial, that's why I gave it to you.
 So it's Terry E. Carter, E stands for Eugene.
 And I direct elder services here at the community center.
 I'm not going to talk a lot, but I do want you to know just a little bit about
 We've been in business for 90 years representing the historic African American community of West Medford and this is the second building on the site.
 The first building was little more than an old army Quonset hut that was brought here from the defunct army base in East Boston going
 way back, World War II.
 And it was set on the site and it remained our home from like 1945 to the early 2000s.
 And then it basically collapsed under its own weight.
 And we were fortunate enough over the next several years thereafter to build this building.
 And this is the current home of an organization that really, really is very near and dear to my heart.
 I grew up in West Medford.
 I'm born and raised on Jerome and Monument Streets, not too far from here.
 And so the community center, Duggar Park, where all the basketball players are, well, you know, another story for another day.
 And, let's see, Duggar Park.
 the Hervey School, Shiloh Baptist Church, a couple other places.
 If our parents didn't know where we were, they knew where to find us, okay?
 Because we were at one of those three or four places.
 But in any case, Jonathan and I, Jonathan Fagan here, who convened and founded the Jazz Fest, yeah, absolutely.
 We got together, it's going on six years ago,
 we decided that we wanted to do something project-wise, him as a musician, me as a poet, that would bring those two worlds together under the banner of jazz, because he's a splendid jazz composer, arranger, and poetry, and I'm turning into more of a lyricist as time goes by.
 I just started out as a garden variety poet, but now I can add lyricist and poet laureate to my name.
 Okay, so we're gonna start off with where we think, as a community, we start off.
 So we're gonna do a tune called Hired by the Mystic, okay?
 All right, now, everything that we do is this intersection of jazz and social justice, okay?
 Some of it might not fit your ears real easily, but I ask you to open your hearts because I speak the truth in love.
 Is that cool?
 All right, all right, very good.
 All right, let's do this.
 They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.
 Just a few streets high by the river.
 Banks turned to fly and die behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.
 Class was an irresistible force.
 Race was an immovable object.
 Perhaps it wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.
 So it was hard by the mystic we went,
 muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.
 But we named it and claimed it and made it our own.
 Even in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank, with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.
 We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.
 Like our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.
 We caught the little fishes to and became the TV multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mystic.
 We became community.
 We commanded unity.
 We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.
 As the river ebbs and flows, the tides would turn and our fortune grows.
 A few more streets become our home.
 Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.
 From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folk make more room for blacks.
 The color line recedes a bit.
 Church and school and center sit.
 The ville becomes the heart of it, hired by the mystic shore.
 Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.
 That muddy mystic most days is clean.
 The banks are freshly cut and green.
 Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.
 These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, excess, and largesse.
 Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city.
 And sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.
 And yet the river still turns and bends.
 from where it begins to where it ends.
 The only place where one could be ground in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.
 All right.
 All right, okay, now, okay, we're into it now, okay?
 We're into it.
 So this is a cool segue because...
 There were, in that ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own, there were a few institutions, especially for us kids.
 There was, of course, Duggar Park.
 There was the Hervey Schoolyard where we grew up and played on that side of town.
 There was the West Medford Community Center where all of us kids came for Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts.
 playing pool and bumper pool and ping pong and so on and so forth.
 And one of the other institutions that was particularly near and dear to our heart was right around the corner, a few streets down on Jerome Street, and it was called The Little Store.
 It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.
 a bit run down and rough around the edges.
 And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary.
 One would suspect that he didn't even like kids, but he really must have loved us.
 Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?
 He had all of it, no, seriously.
 We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.
 He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.
 Then he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.
 He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.
 Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags.
 and get to stuffin' while we were oohin' and ahin' and huffin' and puffin'.
 See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.
 Root beer barrels and pixie sticks, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips,
 He had bazooka Joe bubblegum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.
 Jawbreakers and Tootsie Rolls, sugary love for little kids souls.
 Candy necklaces to wear and bite, and waxy red lips was such a sight.
 Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes, right beside the crunchy six legs.
 Mary Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.
 Just the genuine Hershey's Kisses, all of the hits and none of the misses.
 Like kid taffy squares and Necco wafers, liquor made in Boston baked beans.
 Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea, sweet tooth swag.
 Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we would gobble up peppermint patties.
 Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.
 Chewy cow tails with creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling.
 Reese's peanut butter cups had us squealing like newborn pups.
 mica nights and orange slices, salt water taffy and tiny prices.
 Lifesavers and charms and fruity flavors.
 We grab those bags like potty favors.
 Uncles were a favorite choice, and milk duds made us all rejoice.
 Jolly ranchers and bitter honey, we always got a lot for our money.
 Talk about kids getting excited.
 Our greedy fingers could barely wait.
 You can't imagine the flame he ignited to take that candy like fish take bait.
 from cold January to chilly December.
 More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Phil storefront on Upper Jerome.
 I knew I had to write this poem.
 See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.
 All right.
 All right, all right.
 Yeah, yeah.
 We love it.
 Okay, so here's the band.
 Jonathan Fagan on the keys.
 All right.
 Greg Toro on the little sexy.
 This is not the big sexy.
 The big sexy is the really big bass.
 This is the little sexy.
 It's still very sexy, but it's a smaller bass.
 And my man, Gordon Engelgau on the traps here.
 Okay, we are the Ally Project.
 We're going to move this thing along.
 Boy, where am I?
 Yeah.
 OK, here we go.
 So I'm not going to lie or front as we say in the hood.
 The neighborhood has changed pretty dramatically, all right?
 So I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I remember it and what it's become, okay?
 So this piece is called Corner Lot.
 All right.
 standing at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan.
 Ronnie and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot.
 It's probably changed a half a dozen times since then.
 Current owner's been there for a minute.
 He's good with his hands and he knows his way around wood and tools.
 Place has been gussied up quite a bit.
 Picket fence is not quite white, but if you know, you know.
 Asian kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and roller blades.
 Didn't see much of that back in the day.
 The university sort of hit on the hell side, trying its best to be a baby Ivy.
 But the co-eds come here all the time now.
 Basketball, tennis rackets, pickleball paddles in tow, on bikes, in Benzos and roller blades.
 We used to bust ourselves up pretty good on those rickety metal skates with clunky keys and leather straps.
 Nothing a little Vaseline and Mercurochrome couldn't handle.
 How did Henley put it in Invictus?
 Oh yeah, bloody but unbowed.
 Not too many white and off-white kids hanging out here back there then.
 It was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too.
 Now they've pretty much taken over.
 Dug a park, the Rhone tennis courts, the Hervey schoolyard, and a hundred addresses on Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome.
 A host of our remembered places, so few of our original faces.
 Meanwhile, back in Ronnie and Otis' old place,
 I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant.
 He just has to speak a word.
 I guess I keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the corner lot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan.
 Across the river, it's low tide.
 The smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall.
 That was our little park, away from dugger and a lot less hectic.
 We had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball.
 We lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything.
 We'd probably wait in that water today.
 They planted some trees there many years ago.
 They're all pretty big now.
 Maple and ash, I think.
 Nobody plays baseball or football there anymore.
 But there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat Canadian geese daring pitties, pugs, and poodles to chase them all.
 I can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there.
 I can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen call little James Michael to come and eat, or little Charlie to watch us play from his folding chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run.
 I can't imagine that I'm still here.
 But Ronnie and Otis, Darryl King and Frankie French, Aaron McDaniel and Marky Davis are all gone.
 Mark was as thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with Oak for him.
 Aaron was Spud, Frankie was Fruit Man, and I was Top Cat.
 Too cool, ran to school.
 Everyone wants the corner lot now.
 A little more land and perhaps the new perspectives that angles create.
 I wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gib, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield.
 Certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color.
 Black folks built homes here, only place where they were allowed to be, where they could color inside the lines Medford once drew against the perceived discomforts of darker skin.
 We were here first.
 First firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers.
 We were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build.
 The old church is gone now.
 Nelson even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed.
 But if you know, you know.
 That corner still has a cornerstone.
 1900, and Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition.
 Two more condos in the house of the Lord.
 Two more houses that us first folk can't afford.
 Two more dismissals of the blessings of his word.
 One more holy stone rejected and ignored.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 All right, we're going to switch it up a little bit.
 You're familiar with the jazz canon.
 You know a couple of the players.
 You know Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and maybe Herbie Hancock and a few others.
 And then maybe you know John Coltrane.
 All right, so Coltrane, some of the best of the jazz standards were his compositions with that beautiful horn of his.
 And one of them was about one of his loves.
 Her name was Naima.
 And so if you know Coltrane and you know jazz a little bit, you probably have heard Naima before.
 So this is a riff, a take on Naima.
 It's called Reprise for Naima.
 He would blow this note in the midnight air, aloft in the ether it floats out there.
 Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.
 Improvisational mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe or Miles' tone poem in a silent way or Flanagan's peace at the end of the day.
 Syncopated in sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace, then out of sight.
 With heartmen crooning or bags-on vibes, trios, duets, quartets, and tribes, the blues, the ballads, the avant-garde, incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.
 Giant steps move us miles ahead.
 Cooking up bop for Harlem street cred.
 Melody's hand to the harmony wed.
 Piano's lullaby fresh in the bed.
 Rhythm rocks where the drummer led.
 Rhythm rolls where the bass man sped.
 Rhythm birthed what the saxophone bred.
 Rhythm heard what the master said.
 How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?
 How could a tortured mind deleter?
 How could the mellowed scotch be neater?
 How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue beads that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that confounds regret, create blue nights that we can't
 Coltrane's notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent riff of a lover's dream.
 Coltrane's notes are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cakes cut by the artist's knife.
 Coltrane's notes are a standard refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.
 Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart.
 A tight arrangement cuts the gloom.
 The melody says that love's in bloom.
 The harmony spirit engulfs the room.
 The bride says yes to her lyrical groom.
 The groove and the beat then jump the broom.
 The kip drum resounds with a sonic boom.
 As genius is birthed in a soul filled room.
 Musical mythology mocks, a twisted path the hero walks.
 With shield and sword the hero stalks.
 The temperance shakes her twisted locks.
 Medusa's snakes, his vision shocks.
 Holds up the mirror to stony blocks.
 The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.
 Serpents retreat and symphony talks.
 Coltrane's notes are a roller coaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command.
 Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr.
 P.C., the coolest round midnight will ever be.
 Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or a gemstone's mine.
 The sparkling glow of a lover's dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.
 Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise.
 Like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, then gladness revived in the balladeer's heart.
 Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 All right, all right.
 So we're going to stay on the jazz frontier for a minute.
 Herbie Hancock, and later Quincy Jones, they did a tune, Quincy covered it, Herbie Hancock did it for us, and it's called Tell Me a Bedtime Story.
 So we do a little riff on Tell Me a Bedtime Story, it's called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story, all right?
 It's just a sweet little jazz ditty, okay?
 Cool.
 Is this where the sandman picks up each grain, restoring the beauty and reducing the pain?
 Is this where we fly to never never land, like the troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?
 All of the mystery of hidden dreams.
 Nothing now is as it seems.
 Tell a sweet tale that sugars and creams with flashes of sardines and shining moonbeams.
 As I lay down to my slumber, paint a landscape of ochre and umber.
 Let there be a hint of romance.
 Turn up the quiet.
 Love wants to dance.
 Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of gentle breezes that summer calls, of hidden havens and wondrous spaces, of astral planes and mystical places.
 Let it be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.
 Let it resound in symphony that folds into dreamland's reverie.
 Tell me a fable of Arabian nights spread on a table of earthly delights, free from the label of anger and fights, willing and able to scale higher heights.
 Tell me a bedtime story now, as the baby rocks in the maple bough, as the blue ox puts his nose to the plow, and the sweaty farmer wipes his brow, as each green seedling happily vows to yield each fruit the ground allows, and seven dwarfs whistle a happy tune, and sleeping beauty awakens soon.
 Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.
 Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.
 This is the time when the sandman whispers and seven grooms meet seven sisters.
 And the prairie sings an ode to love as the angels release the turtle dove.
 For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God, my soul to keep.
 All right.
 Jonathan Fagan on the keys.
 Greg Toro on the bass.
 Did you hear that?
 You heard that, right?
 All right, that's Gordon Yango, guy on the drums.
 All right.
 All right, so listen, we're going to the intersection of jazz and social justice, all right?
 All right, and when I say we ain't playing, we ain't playing, but we're playing.
 Is that okay?
 All right, all right.
 So we ain't playing, but we're playing.
 Okay, this is called alienation.
 Good?
 Okay.
 All right.
 Here is a fence without a gate.
 You can't get in, you have to wait.
 You can't be foreign or somehow strange.
 This isn't your home, home on the range.
 You can't arrive in a rickety boat.
 Our castle has a treacherous moat.
 We won't host refugees at our door.
 You're not the sort we're looking for.
 Take good note, we stay on guard.
 We don't want you in our backyard.
 Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.
 You say our country's full of peril.
 But like stray cats, we think you're feral.
 We think you're prone to filth and crime.
 We don't want either at this time.
 We don't care what the nations say.
 They won't do more than hope and pray.
 Our stance is clear on human rights.
 Lock the door.
 Turn off the lights.
 You saw that statue in the bay.
 It stood for liberty until today.
 It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclasses.
 We've got militias on the border.
 They own big guns to keep the order.
 Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.
 Why do we feel that this is good?
 Why can't we share the neighborhood?
 Is it because you're black and brown?
 No, we just choose to stand our ground.
 Stay in your place.
 Deal with your issues.
 We'll send lots of coal and tissues.
 Don't form caravans and run.
 You'll find yourselves in the sight of a gun.
 There are no streets here lined with gold.
 Our eyes are closed, our hearts are cold.
 There is no flowing milk and honey.
 American skies are not that sunny.
 The fences we build keep aliens out.
 They serve to keep our faith devout.
 This land we scheme to make our own is ours, you see, and ours alone.
 As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.
 Please don't show us your anguished faces.
 We're cutting back on other races.
 We've had enough of global inclusion.
 We're ridding this country of race confusion.
 We know how to win these fights and limit all these civil rights.
 safety nets and the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late a rising tide that favors the rich that's our famous favorite campaign pitch me too movements and black lives matter in all due time your ranks will scatter you think that you shall overcome just cross this line we'll give you some
 We'll give you a taste of burning churches and black boys hung from oaks and birches.
 We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prisons.com, the corporate plantation.
 We're taking this country back to the time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield.
 We're taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.
 We're taking this homeland back to the season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs.
 When confederate flags were boldly raised, and crosses in the darkness blazed, and the land was full of racial hate, served with grits on a breakfast plate.
 You thought this worm had surely turned, and young black bodies no longer burned.
 Yet here you are again today, with the specter of prejudice winning the day.
 The MAGA caps you wear with pride, they let us know who's on your side.
 The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.
 Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.
 Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.
 You'll pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided.
 His Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull.
 You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees' abolition.
 This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power.
 And yet the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing.
 So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.
 Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt.
 Tolerance is in short supply.
 We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.
 We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.
 This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.
 To all you aliens, we don't like strange.
 No room at the inn in our home on the range.
 All right.
 Hard troops, admittedly, but troops nonetheless.
 All right, so we're gonna stay there for a minute, and then we'll try and ease up off of your feelings.
 This piece is called The Ally, and it's actually kind of the eponym for our project.
 So we're gonna do Ally for you.
 Friends become distant and strange as if you have some creeping mange.
 Family wonders why and rings their hands.
 How could you choose them over us?
 We're your blood, bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh.
 They're not like us.
 They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.
 Declarations have been made.
 Arrangements are in place.
 These are matters of our kin.
 Signs have been painted.
 You're going to be cast out.
 You're going to be shunned.
 You need to stick with your own kind.
 An ally?
 Is that what they're calling you?
 Well, it's a hard road to hoe.
 You're making strange bedfellows.
 You're casting your white pearls before swine.
 You weren't raised to behave like this.
 Our family is a proud and honored clan.
 We'll never be lower than any black man.
 There's no room for them at this table.
 There's always been two sides of the track, a right and wrong side of town, our kind and their kind, your people and those folks.
 It's going to kill your mother and your daddy's turning over in his grave.
 You want to shout out, Black Lives Matter.
 But the master plan is to make them scatter, to serve them pain on a silver platter.
 Our people own them.
 They worked this land for 200 years.
 They were our property, our Negroes.
 Hell, our Negroes to make it plain.
 You can't be out there with them.
 You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.
 They want reparations.
 Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kit to the gut.
 You don't seem to get it, son.
 This is the way the races run.
 There's not enough room for everyone.
 The time for black and brown is done.
 Show your pride and pick up your gun.
 Pick the side that has always won.
 You can't be out there with them.
 You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.
 All right.
 All right, all right.
 Yeah, yeah.
 All right, all right.
 Once again, the Allied Project.
 Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, Gordon Angle Guywin, I'm Terry Carter.
 Too cool, these bros got me sweating out here.
 Got me sweating.
 All right, okay, so we're at a couple of different spots and then we're gonna finish up.
 But let's do something nice and mellow.
 This is called Legacy, okay?
 Everybody enjoying themselves?
 All right.
 I know it's warm out there.
 I know.
 But you're braving the elements and enjoying the day, hopefully.
 Very, very good.
 It's not for you to tell your own story.
 That is the burden of your children.
 They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.
 And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.
 You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their names.
 How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?
 How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own?
 Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.
 If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.
 If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark and stoke the flames, you don't know.
 And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first.
 The good book says train up the child in the way they should go.
 Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on the hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?
 Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tacky.
 The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.
 But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees?
 Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?
 Will they care to carry?
 Will they dare to tarry?
 Will they linger at the foot of the griot?
 Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?
 We must put them on this page, where hard work earns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid.
 We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.
 This is the gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.
 Sons and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.
 They will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Wakanda, and Sanga Lolo's new tackies.
 Soon you will be the herald.
 Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.
 Let them put a running in your feet.
 With each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter.
 With the shield of abiding faith, you capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.
 You remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's bread.
 You will never abandon the community of faith.
 Though you build a thousand cities on a hill,
 drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.
 Thank you.
 All right.
 Quite a while ago, it was either my first or my second book.
 Speaking of first and second books, I've got books up there.
 There's actually a Ally Project CD, for those of you who still have a CD player.
 And it's got a lot of our music on it.
 So if you're interested, it's up there.
 We also have a book.
 Jazz Festival t-shirts, which are lovely, and our food venue, the Danish Pastry House, will still be here after we leave.
 So if you didn't get a snack and you wanna get one, come back and sit out under the tent and talk, or however the move hits you, it's all there, still there for you.
 All right, okay, so I think we're gonna do two more, and then we're gonna be done.
 All right, so.
 I love that, I love that, I love that, I love that.
 If it's not fake, if you're faking it, don't do it.
 But if it's, oh, okay, I love it, okay.
 What are we doing?
 Oh, we're doing Bobby, okay.
 All right, so a while back, on one of my early books, I think it was the second one, I have a painting in my house.
 It's called, what's it called, T?
 Oh, it's called Bobby Doesn't Live Here.
 And basically what it is is my attempt, my humble painting attempt, to kind of depict black women in all shapes and sizes, because they come in all shapes and sizes.
 And there may be one or two of them who are very, very narrow and somewhat Barbie-like, somewhat Angel Reese-like.
 But for the most part, it runs the gamut.
 So I wrote this poem called Barbie Doesn't Live Here to go with that.
 piece of artwork.
 And every once in a while, you revisit a piece of poetry and you say, well, what could I have done differently?
 Or what could I have said differently?
 So I had this notion, and it came out like this.
 And it's called, If Barbie Had a Choice.
