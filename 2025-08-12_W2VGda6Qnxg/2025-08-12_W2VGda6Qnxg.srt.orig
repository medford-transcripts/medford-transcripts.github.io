1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:02,152
[SPEAKER_06]: look at what they did last night for our student night.

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:02,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks awesome.

3
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:05,173
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad, Avi Fagan.

4
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:11,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I joke that he comes out of retirement for this, so we really appreciate it.

5
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:15,717
[SPEAKER_06]: To our volunteers and staff, Reese and Eli up there.

6
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,638
[SPEAKER_06]: They're selling some books already.

7
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And my partner Shayla, of course, who I couldn't do this whole thing without.

8
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:26,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Galel, who's sitting on the steps helping out with sound, right here.

9
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:34,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Terry Carter, who is really the reason that this whole thing is happening here at the West Medford Community Center.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,079
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a fixture in the community, an amazing poet.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,762
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and who else am I forgetting?

13
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:49,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim and oh, Bruce over there has been helping out the whole weekend as well with some of the camera work.

14
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:56,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So, even with all of these folks, it still takes a lot of different financial contributions for this all to happen.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,682
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look up at our banner, we should have most of our sponsors there.

16
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:09,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Community Media, of course the West Medford Community Center, Medford Arts Council, and the Mass Cultural Council, along with the Arts Alive Medford Foundation.

17
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,050
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our first year with food vendors as well.

18
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Danish Pastry House inside.

19
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:19,594
[SPEAKER_06]: They've set up an amazing spread and totally blown away all expectations there.

20
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:23,516
[SPEAKER_06]: In between tunes, in between groups, go check them out.

21
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:29,499
[SPEAKER_06]: There are also restrooms inside for anyone who might need to take advantage of those.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:40,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and also Triangle Manor, which is a local t-shirt company that's made some awesome shirts for everybody, and EXP Realty.

23
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,375
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a number of individual sponsors as well, including people that have signed up for our Patreon page.

24
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a monthly subscription and it really makes a difference in doing things like jam sessions and other concerts throughout the year.

25
00:01:54,283 --> 00:02:08,432
[SPEAKER_06]: There are QR codes everywhere for those of you who feel inspired to donate, both to our Venmo, which just goes to at Medford Jazz Festival, and also to that particular Patreon page, which has been a huge support.

26
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:11,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so I think that's everything.

27
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:21,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I always feel like I'm forgetting somebody with this, but yeah, please check back in later, and Terry Carter's going to tell you a little bit about this first group and about the space.

28
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,145
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you, thank you.

29
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:39,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan Fagan is a convener and founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, and he's an amazing composer and pianist and all things musical, so you'll be hearing from him soon.

30
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,176
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the West Medford Community Center.

31
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in business for 90 years now.

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,620
[SPEAKER_08]: We are the heart of the

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,187
[SPEAKER_08]: historic African-American community of Medford and you know, we're right by the Mystic River.

34
00:02:55,207 --> 00:03:02,434
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a long history of us in the river and the three streets and all of that stuff that you'll hear about a little bit more later.

35
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:10,362
[SPEAKER_08]: But we want to get right to the business and we want to make sure that we don't cut into the time for our

36
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,285
[SPEAKER_08]: our first act of day two.

37
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:28,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And for any of you who were with us last night, we had an amazing time with the two groups that played last night, with the Morningside Jazz All-Stars from Morningside Music School, who were fantastic.

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with Anita Wood and her group, AJ and the group, I mean, we just, we had a good time.

39
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: They had me dancing before the night was over, so it was all good.

40
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

41
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:48,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Debbie, who sang with the Morningside Jazz All-Stars last night, and she was fabulous.

42
00:03:50,668 --> 00:04:01,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, our first act of Saturday is Recita de Samba, taken from Jacob de Bandolim's choral of the same name.

43
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:06,777
[SPEAKER_08]: It means in Portuguese, and I just found this out, you know, from the source,

44
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:22,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Recipe for Samba, an app named for a group whose focus is to showcase many flavors of Brazilian music in their purest form, with no artificial additives, I love that, like drum machines or electric sampling.

45
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:36,034
[SPEAKER_08]: The chefs, their cuisine, a husband and wife, Ana Borges and Bill Ward, and they draw on Boston's vibrant Brazilian music scene to cook up only the finest,

46
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:37,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the finest.

47
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:45,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Finest bossa nova and samba as well as regional specialties such as fordo, ihecha, and coco.

48
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:47,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I got that right.

49
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:48,645
[SPEAKER_08]: My Brazilian isn't, you know.

50
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:56,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Anna Borges, originally from Recife, Pernambuco, began her career in Brasilia singing in local nightclubs and theaters.

51
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:03,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually she learned to play guitar and enrolled in a escola de musica de Brasilia where she studied voice with

52
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:09,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Jane DuBose Shinseng in a choral group studying both classical and popular techniques.

[SPEAKER_08]: Bill Ward, Bill Ward, Bill Ward.

00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:30,795

00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:47,968
[SPEAKER_08]: He got his first Giorgio Berto record when he was 13, but it wasn't until college that he fell

60
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:55,075
[SPEAKER_08]: deeper and deeper into the, this is really poetic, into the vortex of Brazilian music.

61

83
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:46,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like when you're talking about solo has this but jazz has that.

00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:49,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you're gonna see how it goes.

00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:54,634

01:00:23,855 --> 01:00:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Ward, Greg Toro, and Renata Malavazza.

278
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:29,637
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Anna Borges.

279
01:00:29,657 --> 01:00:32,338
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be playing next week in Harvard Square.

280
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:34,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you more if you ask.

281
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:35,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

282
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

283
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:41,202
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is West Medford.

284
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be stingy.

285
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:45,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Resheta De Samba, Bill Ward on pianos.

286
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:47,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Anna Borges on vocals.

287
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:49,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Greg Toro on bass.

288
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And tell me again.

289
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And Renato on the drums.

290
01:00:57,415 --> 01:00:57,995
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

291
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:00,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very good.

292
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:06,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're gonna take a little pause for the cause while we get set up for our act two.

293
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:14,288
[SPEAKER_08]: My strong suggestion is to go in and patronize Danish Pastry House because they're doing it big.

294
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:17,709
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of good deliciousness inside.

295
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:23,651
[SPEAKER_08]: All the sugar, all the butter on the pastry side and lots of tasty on the savory side.

296
01:01:23,711 --> 01:01:25,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, go on and make yourself.

297
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:28,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've got lemonade and they've got cold water.

298
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:29,613
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

299
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:30,073
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

300
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:31,214
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you in a few minutes.

301
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:02,115
do

302
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:41,625
Okay.

303
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,421
You.

304
01:08:09,092 --> 01:08:09,193
do

305
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:35,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew what they could do.

306
01:10:37,179 --> 01:10:46,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe that you're in love with me.

307
01:10:46,924 --> 01:10:57,250
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling everyone I know, I'm on your mind each place you go.

308
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe that you're

309
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:36,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And after all is said and done, to think that I'm the lucky one.

310
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:19,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe what they could do.

311
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:27,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't believe that you're in love with me.

312
01:13:27,356 --> 01:13:39,402
[SPEAKER_03]: You're telling everyone I know, I'm on your mind each place you go.

313
01:14:13,298 --> 01:14:19,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Is said and done To think that I'm the lucky one

314
01:15:40,877 --> 01:15:41,118
Yeah.

315
01:17:06,503 --> 01:17:07,023
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

316
01:17:07,224 --> 01:17:07,724
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

317
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody.

318
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:12,447
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

319
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had a beautiful first set.

320
01:17:15,249 --> 01:17:17,231
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that they samba was marvelous.

321
01:17:18,712 --> 01:17:19,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Really really good.

322
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:29,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully we will at least meet if not exceed your expectations for the second part of our program today.

323
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:40,252
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who don't know me or who I haven't had a chance to meet yet, my name is Terry Carter, Terry E. My mother says use the initial, that's why I gave it to you.

324
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:43,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's Terry E. Carter, E stands for Eugene.

325
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And I direct elder services here at the community center.

326
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to talk a lot, but I do want you to know just a little bit about

327
01:17:53,004 --> 01:18:02,868
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in business for 90 years representing the historic African American community of West Medford and this is the second building on the site.

328
01:18:03,248 --> 01:18:14,732
[SPEAKER_08]: The first building was little more than an old army Quonset hut that was brought here from the defunct army base in East Boston going

329
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:17,456
[SPEAKER_08]: way back, World War II.

330
01:18:18,056 --> 01:18:26,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was set on the site and it remained our home from like 1945 to the early 2000s.

331
01:18:26,819 --> 01:18:29,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it basically collapsed under its own weight.

332
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:36,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were fortunate enough over the next several years thereafter to build this building.

333
01:18:37,902 --> 01:18:44,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the current home of an organization that really, really is very near and dear to my heart.

334
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:45,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up in West Medford.

335
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:50,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm born and raised on Jerome and Monument Streets, not too far from here.

336
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:58,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the community center, Duggar Park, where all the basketball players are, well, you know, another story for another day.

337
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:03,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And, let's see, Duggar Park.

338
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:07,184
[SPEAKER_08]: the Hervey School, Shiloh Baptist Church, a couple other places.

339
01:19:08,104 --> 01:19:11,687
[SPEAKER_08]: If our parents didn't know where we were, they knew where to find us, okay?

340
01:19:11,707 --> 01:19:14,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we were at one of those three or four places.

341
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:25,455
[SPEAKER_08]: But in any case, Jonathan and I, Jonathan Fagan here, who convened and founded the Jazz Fest, yeah, absolutely.

342
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:31,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We got together, it's going on six years ago,

343
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:54,522
[SPEAKER_08]: we decided that we wanted to do something project-wise, him as a musician, me as a poet, that would bring those two worlds together under the banner of jazz, because he's a splendid jazz composer, arranger, and poetry, and I'm turning into more of a lyricist as time goes by.

344
01:19:54,542 --> 01:20:01,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I just started out as a garden variety poet, but now I can add lyricist and poet laureate to my name.

345
01:20:05,622 --> 01:20:12,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're gonna start off with where we think, as a community, we start off.

346
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:16,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna do a tune called Hired by the Mystic, okay?

347
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:23,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, now, everything that we do is this intersection of jazz and social justice, okay?

348
01:20:24,473 --> 01:20:31,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it might not fit your ears real easily, but I ask you to open your hearts because I speak the truth in love.

349
01:20:33,102 --> 01:20:33,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that cool?

350
01:20:34,342 --> 01:20:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right, very good.

351
01:20:36,183 --> 01:20:37,063
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's do this.

352
01:20:40,824 --> 01:20:43,944
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it.

353
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:47,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few streets high by the river.

354
01:20:48,565 --> 01:20:52,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Banks turned to fly and die behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

355
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Class was an irresistible force.

356
01:20:56,427 --> 01:20:58,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Race was an immovable object.

357
01:20:59,861 --> 01:21:17,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps it wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and chips had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

358
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was hard by the mystic we went,

359
01:21:22,147 --> 01:21:28,812
[SPEAKER_08]: muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

360
01:21:29,713 --> 01:21:34,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

361
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:48,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Even in the heat of summer, when the shores were parched and the soil was rank, with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

362
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:52,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

363
01:21:53,289 --> 01:21:58,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Like our own Jordan Shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

364
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:07,535
[SPEAKER_08]: We caught the little fishes to and became the TV multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mystic.

365
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:11,857
[SPEAKER_08]: We became community.

366
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:14,178
[SPEAKER_08]: We commanded unity.

367
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:19,660
[SPEAKER_08]: We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

368
01:22:25,582 --> 01:22:29,943
[SPEAKER_08]: As the river ebbs and flows, the tides would turn and our fortune grows.

369
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,524
[SPEAKER_08]: A few more streets become our home.

370
01:22:32,924 --> 01:22:35,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

371
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:41,893
[SPEAKER_08]: From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the landed folk make more room for blacks.

372
01:22:42,314 --> 01:22:44,097
[SPEAKER_08]: The color line recedes a bit.

373
01:22:44,597 --> 01:22:47,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Church and school and center sit.

374
01:22:47,622 --> 01:22:51,629
[SPEAKER_08]: The ville becomes the heart of it, hired by the mystic shore.

375
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:11,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the worm has surely turned, and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

376
01:23:12,264 --> 01:23:14,707
[SPEAKER_08]: That muddy mystic most days is clean.

377
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:18,751
[SPEAKER_08]: The banks are freshly cut and green.

378
01:23:19,752 --> 01:23:24,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

379
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:41,800
[SPEAKER_08]: These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, excess, and largesse.

380
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:49,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city.

381
01:23:49,795 --> 01:23:58,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan family.

382
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:09,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet the river still turns and bends.

383
01:24:10,286 --> 01:24:13,267
[SPEAKER_08]: from where it begins to where it ends.

384
01:24:14,047 --> 01:24:28,453
[SPEAKER_08]: The only place where one could be ground in this ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own.

385
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:33,655
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

386
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,682
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, okay, now, okay, we're into it now, okay?

387
01:24:39,382 --> 01:24:40,063
[SPEAKER_08]: We're into it.

388
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:45,406
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a cool segue because...

389
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:56,893
[SPEAKER_08]: There were, in that ancient Middlesex County town where we named it and claimed it and made it our own, there were a few institutions, especially for us kids.

390
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:58,374
[SPEAKER_08]: There was, of course, Duggar Park.

391
01:24:58,814 --> 01:25:02,717
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the Hervey Schoolyard where we grew up and played on that side of town.

392
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:09,382
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the West Medford Community Center where all of us kids came for Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts.

393
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:14,784
[SPEAKER_08]: playing pool and bumper pool and ping pong and so on and so forth.

394
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:26,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the other institutions that was particularly near and dear to our heart was right around the corner, a few streets down on Jerome Street, and it was called The Little Store.

395
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:39,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.

396
01:25:40,195 --> 01:25:42,156
[SPEAKER_08]: a bit run down and rough around the edges.

397
01:25:43,156 --> 01:25:51,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient, and a little scary.

398
01:25:52,358 --> 01:25:58,380
[SPEAKER_08]: One would suspect that he didn't even like kids, but he really must have loved us.

399
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?

400
01:26:03,129 --> 01:26:04,910
[SPEAKER_08]: He had all of it, no, seriously.

401
01:26:05,771 --> 01:26:10,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

402
01:26:13,336 --> 01:26:16,078
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd hush us up while he finished with grown folks' business.

403
01:26:16,698 --> 01:26:20,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

404
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:26,125
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

405
01:26:27,005 --> 01:26:30,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags.

406
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:37,145
[SPEAKER_08]: and get to stuffin' while we were oohin' and ahin' and huffin' and puffin'.

407
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:44,549
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

408
01:26:44,789 --> 01:26:54,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Root beer barrels and pixie sticks, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips,

409
01:26:55,335 --> 01:27:00,082
[SPEAKER_08]: He had bazooka Joe bubblegum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum.

410
01:27:00,483 --> 01:27:04,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Jawbreakers and Tootsie Rolls, sugary love for little kids souls.

411
01:27:06,481 --> 01:27:11,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Candy necklaces to wear and bite, and waxy red lips was such a sight.

412
01:27:11,585 --> 01:27:16,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Fat gum cigars and kid cigarettes, right beside the crunchy six legs.

413
01:27:16,749 --> 01:27:20,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

414
01:27:21,352 --> 01:27:26,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the genuine Hershey's Kisses, all of the hits and none of the misses.

415
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:32,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Like kid taffy squares and Necco wafers, liquor made in Boston baked beans.

416
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:38,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea, sweet tooth swag.

417
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:44,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we would gobble up peppermint patties.

418
01:27:44,528 --> 01:27:48,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.

419
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:54,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Chewy cow tails with creamy filling, but sugar babies had top filling.

420
01:27:55,055 --> 01:27:59,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Reese's peanut butter cups had us squealing like newborn pups.

421
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:05,497
[SPEAKER_08]: mica nights and orange slices, salt water taffy and tiny prices.

422
01:28:06,297 --> 01:28:08,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Lifesavers and charms and fruity flavors.

423
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,043
[SPEAKER_08]: We grab those bags like potty favors.

424
01:28:13,533 --> 01:28:17,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Uncles were a favorite choice, and milk duds made us all rejoice.

425
01:28:18,455 --> 01:28:22,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Jolly ranchers and bitter honey, we always got a lot for our money.

426
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:26,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about kids getting excited.

427
01:28:27,298 --> 01:28:29,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Our greedy fingers could barely wait.

428
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:35,261
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't imagine the flame he ignited to take that candy like fish take bait.

429
01:28:36,736 --> 01:28:40,259
[SPEAKER_08]: from cold January to chilly December.

430
01:28:40,359 --> 01:28:46,524
[SPEAKER_08]: More kinds of candy than I can remember at the Phil storefront on Upper Jerome.

431
01:28:46,544 --> 01:28:49,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew I had to write this poem.

432
01:28:49,687 --> 01:28:57,473
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

433
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

434
01:29:02,617 --> 01:29:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

435
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:05,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

436
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:07,361
[SPEAKER_08]: We love it.

437
01:29:07,562 --> 01:29:10,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so here's the band.

438
01:29:12,004 --> 01:29:13,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

439
01:29:14,886 --> 01:29:15,247
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

440
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:19,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Greg Toro on the little sexy.

441
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,130
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not the big sexy.

442
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,512
[SPEAKER_08]: The big sexy is the really big bass.

443
01:29:23,552 --> 01:29:24,913
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the little sexy.

444
01:29:24,973 --> 01:29:27,114
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still very sexy, but it's a smaller bass.

445
01:29:28,635 --> 01:29:31,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And my man, Gordon Engelgau on the traps here.

446
01:29:32,077 --> 01:29:34,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we are the Ally Project.

447
01:29:34,944 --> 01:29:36,486
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move this thing along.

448
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:39,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Boy, where am I?

449
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

450
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:42,391
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, here we go.

451
01:29:44,373 --> 01:29:52,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not going to lie or front as we say in the hood.

452
01:29:55,465 --> 01:29:58,848
[SPEAKER_08]: The neighborhood has changed pretty dramatically, all right?

453
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:06,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I remember it and what it's become, okay?

454
01:30:06,262 --> 01:30:08,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So this piece is called Corner Lot.

455
01:30:09,644 --> 01:30:09,904
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

456
01:30:32,123 --> 01:30:37,887
[SPEAKER_08]: standing at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan.

457
01:30:38,988 --> 01:30:42,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Ronnie and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot.

458
01:30:42,691 --> 01:30:45,433
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably changed a half a dozen times since then.

459
01:30:46,594 --> 01:30:48,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Current owner's been there for a minute.

460
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: He's good with his hands and he knows his way around wood and tools.

461
01:30:53,139 --> 01:30:55,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Place has been gussied up quite a bit.

462
01:30:56,241 --> 01:30:59,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Picket fence is not quite white, but if you know, you know.

463
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Asian kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and roller blades.

464
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't see much of that back in the day.

465
01:31:09,261 --> 01:31:14,662
[SPEAKER_08]: The university sort of hit on the hell side, trying its best to be a baby Ivy.

466
01:31:15,482 --> 01:31:18,323
[SPEAKER_08]: But the co-eds come here all the time now.

467
01:31:19,023 --> 01:31:26,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Basketball, tennis rackets, pickleball paddles in tow, on bikes, in Benzos and roller blades.

468
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:34,530
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to bust ourselves up pretty good on those rickety metal skates with clunky keys and leather straps.

469
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:38,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing a little Vaseline and Mercurochrome couldn't handle.

470
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: How did Henley put it in Invictus?

471
01:31:42,852 --> 01:31:44,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, bloody but unbowed.

472
01:31:45,373 --> 01:31:48,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too many white and off-white kids hanging out here back there then.

473
01:31:49,954 --> 01:31:56,156
[SPEAKER_08]: It was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too.

474
01:31:57,963 --> 01:31:59,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they've pretty much taken over.

475
01:32:00,425 --> 01:32:09,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Dug a park, the Rhone tennis courts, the Hervey schoolyard, and a hundred addresses on Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome.

476
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:15,795
[SPEAKER_08]: A host of our remembered places, so few of our original faces.

477
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, back in Ronnie and Otis' old place,

478
01:32:27,078 --> 01:32:33,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant.

479
01:32:34,084 --> 01:32:35,565
[SPEAKER_08]: He just has to speak a word.

480
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:44,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the corner lot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan.

481
01:32:47,536 --> 01:32:50,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Across the river, it's low tide.

482
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:54,502
[SPEAKER_08]: The smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall.

483
01:32:59,202 --> 01:33:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That was our little park, away from dugger and a lot less hectic.

484
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:08,205
[SPEAKER_08]: We had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball.

485
01:33:09,445 --> 01:33:14,467
[SPEAKER_08]: We lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything.

486
01:33:15,567 --> 01:33:17,548
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd probably wait in that water today.

487
01:33:19,907 --> 01:33:22,348
[SPEAKER_08]: They planted some trees there many years ago.

488
01:33:22,688 --> 01:33:24,249
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all pretty big now.

489
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:26,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Maple and ash, I think.

490
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:29,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody plays baseball or football there anymore.

491
01:33:30,552 --> 01:33:39,756
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat Canadian geese daring pitties, pugs, and poodles to chase them all.

492
01:33:50,694 --> 01:33:54,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there.

493
01:33:55,336 --> 01:34:05,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen call little James Michael to come and eat, or little Charlie to watch us play from his folding chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run.

494
01:34:06,921 --> 01:34:09,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine that I'm still here.

495
01:34:10,482 --> 01:34:17,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But Ronnie and Otis, Darryl King and Frankie French, Aaron McDaniel and Marky Davis are all gone.

496
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:32,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark was as thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with Oak for him.

497
01:34:32,044 --> 01:34:37,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron was Spud, Frankie was Fruit Man, and I was Top Cat.

498
01:34:37,552 --> 01:34:39,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Too cool, ran to school.

499
01:34:48,275 --> 01:34:50,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone wants the corner lot now.

500
01:34:50,956 --> 01:34:54,618
[SPEAKER_08]: A little more land and perhaps the new perspectives that angles create.

501
01:34:55,638 --> 01:35:04,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gib, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield.

502
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:12,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color.

503
01:35:15,948 --> 01:35:28,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Black folks built homes here, only place where they were allowed to be, where they could color inside the lines Medford once drew against the perceived discomforts of darker skin.

504
01:35:29,704 --> 01:35:31,767
[SPEAKER_08]: We were here first.

505
01:35:32,348 --> 01:35:40,939
[SPEAKER_08]: First firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers.

506
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: We were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build.

507
01:35:50,325 --> 01:35:52,186
[SPEAKER_08]: The old church is gone now.

508
01:35:53,106 --> 01:36:00,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelson even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed.

509
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:03,689
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you know, you know.

510
01:36:05,129 --> 01:36:09,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That corner still has a cornerstone.

511
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:14,452
[SPEAKER_08]: 1900, and Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition.

512
01:36:15,587 --> 01:36:18,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more condos in the house of the Lord.

513
01:36:18,848 --> 01:36:21,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more houses that us first folk can't afford.

514
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:25,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Two more dismissals of the blessings of his word.

515
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:30,352
[SPEAKER_08]: One more holy stone rejected and ignored.

516
01:36:37,715 --> 01:36:38,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

517
01:36:39,935 --> 01:36:40,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

518
01:36:42,456 --> 01:36:43,997
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to switch it up a little bit.

519
01:36:46,657 --> 01:36:48,518
[SPEAKER_08]: You're familiar with the jazz canon.

520
01:36:50,198 --> 01:36:51,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You know a couple of the players.

521
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:59,682
[SPEAKER_08]: You know Duke Ellington and Miles Davis and maybe Herbie Hancock and a few others.

522
01:37:01,763 --> 01:37:03,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe you know John Coltrane.

523
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:13,927
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Coltrane, some of the best of the jazz standards were his compositions with that beautiful horn of his.

524
01:37:14,561 --> 01:37:17,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of them was about one of his loves.

525
01:37:17,805 --> 01:37:19,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name was Naima.

526
01:37:19,788 --> 01:37:25,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you know Coltrane and you know jazz a little bit, you probably have heard Naima before.

527
01:37:25,836 --> 01:37:28,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a riff, a take on Naima.

528
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:31,604
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Reprise for Naima.

529
01:37:36,245 --> 01:37:43,711
[SPEAKER_08]: He would blow this note in the midnight air, aloft in the ether it floats out there.

530
01:37:44,492 --> 01:37:48,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Staccato cadence sets a mood of bluesy lyrical attitude.

531
01:37:49,596 --> 01:38:00,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Improvisational mystery like Monk's piano epistrophe or Miles' tone poem in a silent way or Flanagan's peace at the end of the day.

532
01:38:04,137 --> 01:38:13,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Syncopated in sharp, bright tone, a countdown to stardust, a twilight zone, like a blue train running against the night, setting the pace, then out of sight.

533
01:38:14,841 --> 01:38:27,205
[SPEAKER_08]: With heartmen crooning or bags-on vibes, trios, duets, quartets, and tribes, the blues, the ballads, the avant-garde, incredibly gorgeous, impossibly hard.

534
01:38:30,712 --> 01:38:32,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Giant steps move us miles ahead.

535
01:38:33,033 --> 01:38:35,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooking up bop for Harlem street cred.

536
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:37,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Melody's hand to the harmony wed.

537
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:39,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Piano's lullaby fresh in the bed.

538
01:38:39,695 --> 01:38:41,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm rocks where the drummer led.

539
01:38:41,576 --> 01:38:43,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm rolls where the bass man sped.

540
01:38:43,956 --> 01:38:46,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm birthed what the saxophone bred.

541
01:38:46,397 --> 01:38:48,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm heard what the master said.

542
01:38:52,876 --> 01:38:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: How could he make the bitter taste sweeter?

543
01:38:55,617 --> 01:38:57,658
[SPEAKER_08]: How could a tortured mind deleter?

544
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:59,958
[SPEAKER_08]: How could the mellowed scotch be neater?

545
01:39:00,298 --> 01:39:14,003
[SPEAKER_08]: How could the smoke from each cigarette create blue beads that cast a net, create blue beads of cascading sweat, create blue haze that confounds regret, create blue nights that we can't

546
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:15,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are a crystal scale, a velvet scream in the urban travail, the heavenly riff of a love supreme, the pungent riff of a lover's dream.

547
01:40:16,865 --> 01:40:28,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are a cozy romance, the breezy bounce of a bop and a dance, the languid lilt of stray's lush life, the cakes cut by the artist's knife.

548
01:40:29,877 --> 01:40:41,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are a standard refined, like gold in a pan or gemstones mined, the sparkling glow of a hopeful dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

549
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:55,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise, like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, the gladness removed from the balladeer's heart.

550
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:10,723
[SPEAKER_08]: A tight arrangement cuts the gloom.

551
01:41:11,283 --> 01:41:13,204
[SPEAKER_08]: The melody says that love's in bloom.

552
01:41:13,664 --> 01:41:15,565
[SPEAKER_08]: The harmony spirit engulfs the room.

553
01:41:15,926 --> 01:41:18,267
[SPEAKER_08]: The bride says yes to her lyrical groom.

554
01:41:18,647 --> 01:41:21,068
[SPEAKER_08]: The groove and the beat then jump the broom.

555
01:41:21,368 --> 01:41:24,510
[SPEAKER_08]: The kip drum resounds with a sonic boom.

556
01:41:26,991 --> 01:41:29,913
[SPEAKER_08]: As genius is birthed in a soul filled room.

557
01:41:37,012 --> 01:41:40,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Musical mythology mocks, a twisted path the hero walks.

558
01:41:40,834 --> 01:41:42,856
[SPEAKER_08]: With shield and sword the hero stalks.

559
01:41:43,136 --> 01:41:45,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The temperance shakes her twisted locks.

560
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:47,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Medusa's snakes, his vision shocks.

561
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:49,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Holds up the mirror to stony blocks.

562
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,621
[SPEAKER_08]: The harp and the horn melt icy rocks.

563
01:41:53,002 --> 01:41:55,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Serpents retreat and symphony talks.

564
01:42:05,794 --> 01:42:18,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are a roller coaster, a hallelujah and a paternoster, the glorious jolt of the maestro's hand, the saxophone titan is in command.

565
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are a crazy rhythm, the squawk of chords and playful schism, the frenetic pace of Mr.

566
01:42:26,883 --> 01:42:30,525
[SPEAKER_08]: P.C., the coolest round midnight will ever be.

567
01:42:32,811 --> 01:42:38,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are genius refined, like gold in a pan or a gemstone's mine.

568
01:42:39,296 --> 01:42:46,681
[SPEAKER_08]: The sparkling glow of a lover's dream, hot black coffee with a hint of cream.

569
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:51,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Coltrane's notes are Naima's reprise.

570
01:42:52,132 --> 01:43:04,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Like madness that brings a man to his knees, or sadness that comes when lovers part, then gladness revived in the balladeer's heart.

571
01:43:08,822 --> 01:43:09,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

572
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:11,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

573
01:43:12,989 --> 01:43:13,893
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

574
01:43:13,933 --> 01:43:17,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to stay on the jazz frontier for a minute.

575
01:43:20,351 --> 01:43:33,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Herbie Hancock, and later Quincy Jones, they did a tune, Quincy covered it, Herbie Hancock did it for us, and it's called Tell Me a Bedtime Story.

576
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:41,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do a little riff on Tell Me a Bedtime Story, it's called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story, all right?

577
01:43:43,026 --> 01:43:45,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a sweet little jazz ditty, okay?

578
01:43:46,548 --> 01:43:46,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

579
01:44:27,247 --> 01:44:34,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this where the sandman picks up each grain, restoring the beauty and reducing the pain?

580
01:44:34,758 --> 01:44:40,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this where we fly to never never land, like the troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

581
01:44:44,596 --> 01:44:46,338
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the mystery of hidden dreams.

582
01:44:46,838 --> 01:44:48,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing now is as it seems.

583
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:55,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell a sweet tale that sugars and creams with flashes of sardines and shining moonbeams.

584
01:44:57,849 --> 01:45:03,033
[SPEAKER_08]: As I lay down to my slumber, paint a landscape of ochre and umber.

585
01:45:03,434 --> 01:45:05,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Let there be a hint of romance.

586
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:07,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn up the quiet.

587
01:45:08,138 --> 01:45:09,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Love wants to dance.

588
01:45:34,510 --> 01:45:52,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a bedtime story, please, of secret gardens and pecan trees, of babbling brooks and waterfalls, of gentle breezes that summer calls, of hidden havens and wondrous spaces, of astral planes and mystical places.

589
01:45:57,468 --> 01:46:01,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

590
01:46:01,411 --> 01:46:06,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it resound in symphony that folds into dreamland's reverie.

591
01:46:08,817 --> 01:46:19,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a fable of Arabian nights spread on a table of earthly delights, free from the label of anger and fights, willing and able to scale higher heights.

592
01:46:38,828 --> 01:47:01,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a bedtime story now, as the baby rocks in the maple bough, as the blue ox puts his nose to the plow, and the sweaty farmer wipes his brow, as each green seedling happily vows to yield each fruit the ground allows, and seven dwarfs whistle a happy tune, and sleeping beauty awakens soon.

593
01:47:07,137 --> 01:47:11,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

594
01:47:12,165 --> 01:47:17,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

595
01:47:51,903 --> 01:47:58,425
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the time when the sandman whispers and seven grooms meet seven sisters.

596
01:47:59,325 --> 01:48:05,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And the prairie sings an ode to love as the angels release the turtle dove.

597
01:48:07,148 --> 01:48:14,010
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God, my soul to keep.

598
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:19,132
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

599
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

600
01:48:23,572 --> 01:48:27,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Greg Toro on the bass.

601
01:48:27,914 --> 01:48:28,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that?

602
01:48:29,374 --> 01:48:30,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You heard that, right?

603
01:48:30,895 --> 01:48:33,256
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's Gordon Yango, guy on the drums.

604
01:48:33,877 --> 01:48:34,217
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

605
01:48:37,547 --> 01:48:43,711
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so listen, we're going to the intersection of jazz and social justice, all right?

606
01:48:44,271 --> 01:48:49,915
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and when I say we ain't playing, we ain't playing, but we're playing.

607
01:48:51,156 --> 01:48:52,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

608
01:48:52,436 --> 01:48:53,017
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

609
01:48:53,417 --> 01:48:55,418
[SPEAKER_08]: So we ain't playing, but we're playing.

610
01:48:56,079 --> 01:48:58,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this is called alienation.

611
01:49:12,374 --> 01:49:12,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Good?

612
01:49:12,474 --> 01:49:12,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

613
01:49:12,574 --> 01:49:17,138
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

614
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is a fence without a gate.

615
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:21,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get in, you have to wait.

616
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:23,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be foreign or somehow strange.

617
01:49:24,203 --> 01:49:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't your home, home on the range.

618
01:49:27,666 --> 01:49:29,728
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't arrive in a rickety boat.

619
01:49:29,948 --> 01:49:31,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Our castle has a treacherous moat.

620
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:34,712
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't host refugees at our door.

621
01:49:34,732 --> 01:49:36,273
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not the sort we're looking for.

622
01:49:37,507 --> 01:49:39,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Take good note, we stay on guard.

623
01:49:39,568 --> 01:49:41,330
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want you in our backyard.

624
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:46,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the danger you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

625
01:49:47,694 --> 01:49:50,296
[SPEAKER_08]: You say our country's full of peril.

626
01:49:50,616 --> 01:49:52,678
[SPEAKER_08]: But like stray cats, we think you're feral.

627
01:49:52,898 --> 01:49:54,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We think you're prone to filth and crime.

628
01:49:54,739 --> 01:49:57,261
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want either at this time.

629
01:49:59,222 --> 01:50:00,984
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't care what the nations say.

630
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:03,686
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't do more than hope and pray.

631
01:50:04,107 --> 01:50:06,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Our stance is clear on human rights.

632
01:50:06,849 --> 01:50:07,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Lock the door.

633
01:50:08,431 --> 01:50:09,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn off the lights.

634
01:50:13,012 --> 01:50:14,934
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw that statue in the bay.

635
01:50:15,655 --> 01:50:17,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It stood for liberty until today.

636
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:22,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclasses.

637
01:50:23,464 --> 01:50:25,226
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got militias on the border.

638
01:50:25,546 --> 01:50:27,629
[SPEAKER_08]: They own big guns to keep the order.

639
01:50:27,989 --> 01:50:32,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.

640
01:50:39,388 --> 01:50:41,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we feel that this is good?

641
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't we share the neighborhood?

642
01:50:43,632 --> 01:50:45,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it because you're black and brown?

643
01:50:45,734 --> 01:50:48,477
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we just choose to stand our ground.

644
01:50:48,957 --> 01:50:49,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay in your place.

645
01:50:49,838 --> 01:50:50,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Deal with your issues.

646
01:50:50,919 --> 01:50:52,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll send lots of coal and tissues.

647
01:50:53,441 --> 01:50:55,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't form caravans and run.

648
01:50:55,944 --> 01:50:59,147
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll find yourselves in the sight of a gun.

649
01:51:02,203 --> 01:51:04,984
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no streets here lined with gold.

650
01:51:05,384 --> 01:51:08,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Our eyes are closed, our hearts are cold.

651
01:51:08,425 --> 01:51:10,865
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no flowing milk and honey.

652
01:51:11,246 --> 01:51:13,466
[SPEAKER_08]: American skies are not that sunny.

653
01:51:16,167 --> 01:51:18,688
[SPEAKER_08]: The fences we build keep aliens out.

654
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:21,389
[SPEAKER_08]: They serve to keep our faith devout.

655
01:51:21,669 --> 01:51:26,030
[SPEAKER_08]: This land we scheme to make our own is ours, you see, and ours alone.

656
01:51:27,089 --> 01:51:31,053
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

657
01:51:31,493 --> 01:51:34,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't show us your anguished faces.

658
01:51:34,676 --> 01:51:36,478
[SPEAKER_08]: We're cutting back on other races.

659
01:51:41,403 --> 01:51:43,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had enough of global inclusion.

660
01:51:43,785 --> 01:51:45,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We're ridding this country of race confusion.

661
01:51:46,288 --> 01:51:50,692
[SPEAKER_08]: We know how to win these fights and limit all these civil rights.

662
01:51:51,727 --> 01:52:15,898
[SPEAKER_08]: safety nets and the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late a rising tide that favors the rich that's our famous favorite campaign pitch me too movements and black lives matter in all due time your ranks will scatter you think that you shall overcome just cross this line we'll give you some

663
01:52:18,363 --> 01:52:22,668
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you a taste of burning churches and black boys hung from oaks and birches.

664
01:52:23,249 --> 01:52:28,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prisons.com, the corporate plantation.

665
01:52:31,992 --> 01:52:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking this country back to the time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield.

666
01:52:40,114 --> 01:52:49,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

667
01:52:49,916 --> 01:53:01,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking this homeland back to the season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs.

668
01:53:04,499 --> 01:53:16,263
[SPEAKER_08]: When confederate flags were boldly raised, and crosses in the darkness blazed, and the land was full of racial hate, served with grits on a breakfast plate.

669
01:53:19,203 --> 01:53:24,205
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought this worm had surely turned, and young black bodies no longer burned.

670
01:53:24,225 --> 01:53:29,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet here you are again today, with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

671
01:53:30,567 --> 01:53:34,875
[SPEAKER_08]: The MAGA caps you wear with pride, they let us know who's on your side.

672
01:53:35,216 --> 01:53:39,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

673
01:53:43,706 --> 01:53:50,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

674
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:56,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

675
01:53:56,893 --> 01:54:01,676
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided.

676
01:54:02,136 --> 01:54:08,299
[SPEAKER_08]: His Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull.

677
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:27,592
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls, where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees' abolition.

678
01:54:30,193 --> 01:54:35,355
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power.

679
01:54:36,016 --> 01:54:41,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing.

680
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:49,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

681
01:54:49,963 --> 01:54:55,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt.

682
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:57,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Tolerance is in short supply.

683
01:54:57,912 --> 01:55:02,858
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.

684
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:05,401
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

685
01:55:07,636 --> 01:55:12,321
[SPEAKER_08]: This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

686
01:55:12,641 --> 01:55:16,365
[SPEAKER_08]: To all you aliens, we don't like strange.

687
01:55:16,885 --> 01:55:22,211
[SPEAKER_08]: No room at the inn in our home on the range.

688
01:55:28,737 --> 01:55:29,017
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

689
01:55:35,035 --> 01:55:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Hard troops, admittedly, but troops nonetheless.

690
01:55:40,338 --> 01:55:46,741
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we're gonna stay there for a minute, and then we'll try and ease up off of your feelings.

691
01:55:48,362 --> 01:55:54,425
[SPEAKER_08]: This piece is called The Ally, and it's actually kind of the eponym for our project.

692
01:55:56,026 --> 01:55:57,207
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna do Ally for you.

693
01:56:07,918 --> 01:56:12,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Friends become distant and strange as if you have some creeping mange.

694
01:56:13,382 --> 01:56:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Family wonders why and rings their hands.

695
01:56:16,584 --> 01:56:18,566
[SPEAKER_08]: How could you choose them over us?

696
01:56:19,186 --> 01:56:22,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We're your blood, bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh.

697
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:24,210
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not like us.

698
01:56:25,131 --> 01:56:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so different, less than, not equal to, beneath.

699
01:56:30,827 --> 01:56:32,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Declarations have been made.

700
01:56:32,708 --> 01:56:33,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Arrangements are in place.

701
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:36,271
[SPEAKER_08]: These are matters of our kin.

702
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:38,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Signs have been painted.

703
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,533
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be cast out.

704
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:41,474
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be shunned.

705
01:56:41,915 --> 01:56:44,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to stick with your own kind.

706
01:56:53,712 --> 01:56:54,593
[SPEAKER_08]: An ally?

707
01:56:55,174 --> 01:56:56,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what they're calling you?

708
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:59,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a hard road to hoe.

709
01:56:59,578 --> 01:57:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making strange bedfellows.

710
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:04,123
[SPEAKER_08]: You're casting your white pearls before swine.

711
01:57:04,424 --> 01:57:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't raised to behave like this.

712
01:57:07,997 --> 01:57:11,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Our family is a proud and honored clan.

713
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,962
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll never be lower than any black man.

714
01:57:14,343 --> 01:57:16,725
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no room for them at this table.

715
01:57:17,345 --> 01:57:27,053
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always been two sides of the track, a right and wrong side of town, our kind and their kind, your people and those folks.

716
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:32,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to kill your mother and your daddy's turning over in his grave.

717
01:57:39,812 --> 01:57:42,555
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to shout out, Black Lives Matter.

718
01:57:42,855 --> 01:57:47,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But the master plan is to make them scatter, to serve them pain on a silver platter.

719
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:50,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Our people own them.

720
01:57:50,922 --> 01:57:53,064
[SPEAKER_08]: They worked this land for 200 years.

721
01:57:53,144 --> 01:57:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: They were our property, our Negroes.

722
01:57:55,727 --> 01:57:57,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, our Negroes to make it plain.

723
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,833
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be out there with them.

724
01:58:03,082 --> 01:58:12,104
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

725
01:58:17,834 --> 01:58:19,115
[SPEAKER_08]: They want reparations.

726
01:58:19,595 --> 01:58:23,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're making preparations to give them 40 acres of hell and a mule kit to the gut.

727
01:58:23,897 --> 01:58:25,598
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't seem to get it, son.

728
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:27,919
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the way the races run.

729
01:58:27,959 --> 01:58:30,780
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not enough room for everyone.

730
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:34,622
[SPEAKER_08]: The time for black and brown is done.

731
01:58:35,262 --> 01:58:37,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Show your pride and pick up your gun.

732
01:58:38,024 --> 01:58:40,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick the side that has always won.

733
01:58:42,145 --> 01:58:44,167
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be out there with them.

734
01:58:44,667 --> 01:58:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be shoulder to shoulder with the ones we need to dominate, relegate, subjugate, eliminate.

735
01:58:58,881 --> 01:58:59,242
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

736
02:04:02,632 --> 02:04:03,392
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

737
02:04:03,893 --> 02:04:05,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

738
02:04:06,314 --> 02:04:07,394
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, all right.

739
02:04:08,515 --> 02:04:10,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, the Allied Project.

740
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:14,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, Gordon Angle Guywin, I'm Terry Carter.

741
02:04:14,738 --> 02:04:17,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Too cool, these bros got me sweating out here.

742
02:04:17,839 --> 02:04:18,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Got me sweating.

743
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:24,382
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, okay, so we're at a couple of different spots and then we're gonna finish up.

744
02:04:25,603 --> 02:04:27,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's do something nice and mellow.

745
02:04:27,984 --> 02:04:30,105
[SPEAKER_08]: This is called Legacy, okay?

746
02:04:40,542 --> 02:04:41,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody enjoying themselves?

747
02:04:42,384 --> 02:04:42,744
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

748
02:04:43,185 --> 02:04:44,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's warm out there.

749
02:04:44,386 --> 02:04:45,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

750
02:04:46,628 --> 02:04:49,832
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're braving the elements and enjoying the day, hopefully.

751
02:04:50,993 --> 02:04:51,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very good.

752
02:05:19,395 --> 02:05:21,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not for you to tell your own story.

753
02:05:22,497 --> 02:05:24,318
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the burden of your children.

754
02:05:25,099 --> 02:05:28,601
[SPEAKER_08]: They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

755
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:35,906
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet, you have not gathered them up and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

756
02:05:37,026 --> 02:05:42,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their names.

757
02:05:43,543 --> 02:05:46,607
[SPEAKER_08]: How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

758
02:05:47,048 --> 02:05:51,875
[SPEAKER_08]: How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own?

759
02:06:14,488 --> 02:06:23,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

760
02:06:24,232 --> 02:06:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

761
02:06:32,596 --> 02:06:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark and stoke the flames, you don't know.

762
02:06:43,625 --> 02:06:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first.

763
02:06:58,762 --> 02:07:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: The good book says train up the child in the way they should go.

764
02:07:02,604 --> 02:07:13,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on the hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

765
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:31,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tacky.

766
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:39,144
[SPEAKER_08]: The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

767
02:07:39,184 --> 02:07:50,394
[SPEAKER_08]: But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, cites the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees?

768
02:07:52,515 --> 02:07:56,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

769
02:07:57,139 --> 02:07:58,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Will they care to carry?

770
02:07:59,061 --> 02:08:00,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Will they dare to tarry?

771
02:08:02,932 --> 02:08:04,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Will they linger at the foot of the griot?

772
02:08:04,793 --> 02:08:08,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?

773
02:08:09,477 --> 02:08:21,206
[SPEAKER_08]: We must put them on this page, where hard work earns a man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scarf at the wand of a maid.

774
02:08:28,267 --> 02:08:39,808
[SPEAKER_08]: We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

775
02:08:48,186 --> 02:08:56,872
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

776
02:08:58,373 --> 02:09:12,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Sons and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

777
02:09:15,229 --> 02:09:28,120
[SPEAKER_08]: They will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly the wonders of Wakanda, and Sanga Lolo's new tackies.

778
02:09:31,783 --> 02:09:34,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon you will be the herald.

779
02:09:34,745 --> 02:09:37,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

780
02:09:38,548 --> 02:09:41,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Let them put a running in your feet.

781
02:09:46,233 --> 02:09:50,436
[SPEAKER_08]: With each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter.

782
02:09:50,876 --> 02:09:57,360
[SPEAKER_08]: With the shield of abiding faith, you capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

783
02:09:58,101 --> 02:10:04,345
[SPEAKER_08]: You remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's bread.

784
02:10:09,048 --> 02:10:12,069
[SPEAKER_08]: You will never abandon the community of faith.

785
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:15,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Though you build a thousand cities on a hill,

786
02:10:16,618 --> 02:10:28,466
[SPEAKER_08]: drawing wondrous strength from the master's touch as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.

787
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:34,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

788
02:10:35,631 --> 02:10:35,971
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

789
02:10:39,568 --> 02:10:42,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite a while ago, it was either my first or my second book.

790
02:10:42,991 --> 02:10:46,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of first and second books, I've got books up there.

791
02:10:46,494 --> 02:10:51,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a Ally Project CD, for those of you who still have a CD player.

792
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:54,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got a lot of our music on it.

793
02:10:54,122 --> 02:10:55,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're interested, it's up there.

794
02:10:56,124 --> 02:10:58,386
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a book.

795
02:10:59,666 --> 02:11:09,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Jazz Festival t-shirts, which are lovely, and our food venue, the Danish Pastry House, will still be here after we leave.

796
02:11:09,432 --> 02:11:20,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you didn't get a snack and you wanna get one, come back and sit out under the tent and talk, or however the move hits you, it's all there, still there for you.

797
02:11:20,618 --> 02:11:24,999
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, okay, so I think we're gonna do two more, and then we're gonna be done.

798
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:26,379
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so.

799
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:31,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that, I love that, I love that, I love that.

800
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,241
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not fake, if you're faking it, don't do it.

801
02:11:37,742 --> 02:11:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's, oh, okay, I love it, okay.

802
02:11:42,683 --> 02:11:43,243
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we doing?

803
02:11:44,415 --> 02:11:45,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're doing Bobby, okay.

804
02:11:46,217 --> 02:11:54,566
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so a while back, on one of my early books, I think it was the second one, I have a painting in my house.

805
02:11:55,847 --> 02:11:58,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called, what's it called, T?

806
02:11:59,031 --> 02:12:00,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's called Bobby Doesn't Live Here.

807
02:12:01,293 --> 02:12:12,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically what it is is my attempt, my humble painting attempt, to kind of depict black women in all shapes and sizes, because they come in all shapes and sizes.

808
02:12:12,857 --> 02:12:20,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And there may be one or two of them who are very, very narrow and somewhat Barbie-like, somewhat Angel Reese-like.

809
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:24,901
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, it runs the gamut.

810
02:12:26,162 --> 02:12:30,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wrote this poem called Barbie Doesn't Live Here to go with that.

811
02:12:30,723 --> 02:12:31,824
[SPEAKER_08]: piece of artwork.

812
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:38,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And every once in a while, you revisit a piece of poetry and you say, well, what could I have done differently?

813
02:12:38,170 --> 02:12:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what could I have said differently?

814
02:12:40,332 --> 02:12:43,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had this notion, and it came out like this.

815
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:46,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's called, If Barbie Had a Choice.

816
02:13:02,903 --> 02:13:03,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha.

817
02:13:17,916 --> 02:13:23,698
[SPEAKER_08]: If Barbie had a choice, I believe that from day one, she would have made it a black thing.

818
02:13:24,599 --> 02:13:29,460
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have ditched the creamsicle skin and gone with a lustrous ebony hue.

819
02:13:30,161 --> 02:13:38,044
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have spoken in an Igbo dialect with a true queen's attitude and said, to hell with you colonizers.

820
02:13:38,544 --> 02:13:44,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Package me up in a pink box with white lettering and a bunch of beachy palms and sand in the background.

821
02:13:44,786 --> 02:13:46,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I think not.

822
02:13:47,292 --> 02:13:53,613
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get these ample breasts and these curvaceous hips into that Goldie Hawn psychedelic mini.

823
02:13:54,858 --> 02:13:57,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I'ma need a little something more substantial.

824
02:13:57,759 --> 02:14:05,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'ma need copious yards of Senegalese cotton with shiny batik totems and all the colors of the motherland.

825
02:14:06,102 --> 02:14:14,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'ma need a Wakanda seamstress straight out of the Ruth Carter School to hook the thing up right and show the world what I'm working with.

826
02:14:14,305 --> 02:14:18,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I'ma need a made in Dahomey, not by Mattel and Disney.

827
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:29,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, if Bobby had a choice, Ken would have looked more like Ali or Denzel or that fine-ass dark chocolate British cat Idris Elba.

828
02:14:30,034 --> 02:14:40,779
[SPEAKER_08]: He would have been melanated, not barely suntanned, and by no means would he have seen more holiday tissue wrap than 150-grit sandpaper.

829
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:48,583
[SPEAKER_08]: He would have been swashbuckling like Marvel's T'Challa, woke like Tupac, and standing on business like Brother Malcolm.

830
02:15:04,724 --> 02:15:14,928
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have kissed that man with un-retouched, un-botoxed black girl lips, lush and full as a tropic rainforest.

831
02:15:15,908 --> 02:15:22,691
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have engulfed her man in every quaking inch of the last poet's black thighs.

832
02:15:23,031 --> 02:15:24,952
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know it, YouTube it.

833
02:15:25,732 --> 02:15:32,655
[SPEAKER_08]: She would have no need of a Brazilian butt lift, a Beverly Hills boob job, or an Adobe Photoshop session.

834
02:15:33,976 --> 02:15:38,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Mother Africa in a generous genome took care of all of that, you feel me?

835
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:50,916
[SPEAKER_07]: If Barbie had a choice, you would never have been able to buy her at Toys R Us, F.A.O.

836
02:15:50,956 --> 02:15:52,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Schwartz, or Mary Arnold's.

837
02:15:52,718 --> 02:15:57,343
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't have been a fake trophy bride, a chick on the side, or a Bonnie for Clyde.

838
02:15:57,603 --> 02:16:02,368
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't have been an American Girl Addie, a hotliner baddie, or Dance Moms Maddie.

839
02:16:02,588 --> 02:16:08,134
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't have been It Girl Margot Robbie, or Cherry Pie's Barbie, or a P. Diddy Harvey.

840
02:16:09,953 --> 02:16:15,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I'ma close the flow with a few more rhymes, just a few bronze bars to end this on time.

841
02:16:17,902 --> 02:16:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: A new newbie in Bobby wouldn't stand for nonsense.

842
02:16:21,546 --> 02:16:23,688
[SPEAKER_08]: A brother's pursuit couldn't sit on the fence.

843
02:16:23,968 --> 02:16:26,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Her womanly wows would truly be immense.

844
02:16:26,852 --> 02:16:32,398
[SPEAKER_08]: A player would just find her game too intense, with never a true shot at love's recompense.

845
02:16:33,673 --> 02:16:40,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Though he might pull up in a Bentley or Rolls, he'd lose by a landslide at a real Queens pole.

846
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:45,163
[SPEAKER_08]: A new Nubian Barbie would demand mad respect.

847
02:16:45,244 --> 02:16:47,526
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't suffer in the blues or neglect.

848
02:16:47,926 --> 02:16:50,588
[SPEAKER_08]: She'd fight for her own like a Goji elite.

849
02:16:51,209 --> 02:16:54,212
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't be tame, demure, or petite.

850
02:16:55,155 --> 02:16:57,716
[SPEAKER_08]: would be different on this I make bet.

851
02:16:58,157 --> 02:17:00,538
[SPEAKER_08]: A pimp or a hustler would not be a threat.

852
02:17:00,998 --> 02:17:06,981
[SPEAKER_08]: As fine as the print on the national debt, her beauty and wisdom would not break a sweat.

853
02:17:08,222 --> 02:17:14,145
[SPEAKER_08]: That glitzy white Barbie might have a toy jet, but she hasn't landed a soul plane yet.

854
02:17:14,945 --> 02:17:23,650
[SPEAKER_08]: My African queen makes the real kinks forget, though she might want to keep that fly pink Corvette.

855
02:17:26,141 --> 02:17:27,422
[SPEAKER_08]: You just might wanna keep that.

856
02:17:28,322 --> 02:17:29,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you might wanna keep that.

857
02:17:31,024 --> 02:17:31,404
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

858
02:17:32,204 --> 02:17:48,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're gonna end where we began and that's with family because everybody here, everybody who's here, you know, and I so appreciate, we so appreciate everyone who has braved the heat because we know it's out there to be here with us.

859
02:17:51,054 --> 02:17:53,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see if I can hopefully find it.

860
02:17:58,283 --> 02:17:59,523
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a kitchen table poem?

861
02:18:00,084 --> 02:18:00,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

862
02:18:01,524 --> 02:18:01,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

863
02:18:02,664 --> 02:18:02,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

864
02:18:09,787 --> 02:18:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

865
02:18:13,768 --> 02:18:13,988
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

866
02:18:16,317 --> 02:18:25,942
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that a lot of stuff that I've said today and that we've played today, you know, strikes different chords and resonates differently with everybody.

867
02:18:26,763 --> 02:18:36,168
[SPEAKER_08]: But this particular poem, maybe like The Little Store, really, really is going to bring back an image of the way that your home looked at some point in time.

868
02:18:36,568 --> 02:18:50,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I can almost guarantee it doesn't matter where you came from, what ethnicity, what background, at some point in time, my prayer, my hope is that your home looked like this at some point, and hopefully still does.

869
02:18:51,102 --> 02:18:53,925
[SPEAKER_08]: This piece is called Kitchen Table Poem.

870
02:18:57,788 --> 02:18:59,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody ever wants to leave.

871
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:05,884
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like the blueberry stains on mama's apron, settled and satisfied.

872
02:19:06,665 --> 02:19:12,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Good food has been eaten, fresh corn and collard greens, fried chicken and potato salad.

873
02:19:12,751 --> 02:19:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Bellies are fat and full.

874
02:19:16,855 --> 02:19:17,736
[SPEAKER_08]: This is that room.

875
02:19:18,476 --> 02:19:21,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, and girl, and are you serious right now?

876
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:23,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's real talk.

877
02:19:24,081 --> 02:19:25,042
[SPEAKER_08]: We're real people.

878
02:19:25,563 --> 02:19:26,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Family, you know what I'm saying?

879
02:19:27,584 --> 02:19:28,365
[SPEAKER_08]: We're family.

880
02:19:30,087 --> 02:19:33,590
[SPEAKER_08]: You can smell the love long before the door opens.

881
02:19:34,050 --> 02:19:36,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there's gonna be pecan pie.

882
02:19:36,592 --> 02:19:39,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sweet tea will be ice cold.

883
02:19:40,115 --> 02:19:47,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Southern folk will slip out of their northerness, accents will thicken, and the country shade will feel closer to the city soon.

884
02:19:49,123 --> 02:19:58,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll stay at that table long after the crumbs are cleared, the dishes will be all washed, the food will be put away or packed in Tupperware and Ziploc totes.

885
02:19:58,931 --> 02:20:02,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone will have a doggy bag and a story to tell.

886
02:20:03,375 --> 02:20:05,357
[SPEAKER_08]: The men will be playing big.

887
02:20:08,422 --> 02:20:35,233
[SPEAKER_08]: ♪ Slippin' on a little somethin' somethin' ♪ ♪ And talkin' big trash ♪ ♪ The smiles will be broad and the laughter will be contagious ♪ ♪ The women will be fanning and fussing ♪ ♪ Good Lord, she know she too big for that dress ♪ ♪ That ain't no Sunday saved outfit ♪ ♪ That's for Saturday night sinning ♪ ♪ You know I'm right, girl, you know I'm right ♪ Nobody ever wants to leave.

888
02:20:36,069 --> 02:20:41,253
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like black Jesus's eyes on that old print, loving and insistent.

889
02:20:42,033 --> 02:20:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul food has been shaved.

890
02:20:44,415 --> 02:20:49,098
[SPEAKER_08]: My gene has prayed down heaven and the baby sang their song.

891
02:20:50,139 --> 02:20:53,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's tickled and tranquil.

892
02:20:54,242 --> 02:20:56,283
[SPEAKER_08]: This is that room.

893
02:20:58,404 --> 02:20:59,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I really miss pap.

894
02:21:01,447 --> 02:21:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Is baby boy's cancer in remission?

895
02:21:05,597 --> 02:21:06,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Church.

896
02:21:07,157 --> 02:21:07,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It's real talk.

897
02:21:08,698 --> 02:21:09,538
[SPEAKER_08]: We're real people.

898
02:21:10,538 --> 02:21:11,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Family.

899
02:21:11,639 --> 02:21:12,599
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?

900
02:21:13,339 --> 02:21:15,260
[SPEAKER_08]: We're family.

901
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:19,241
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ally Project, ladies and gentlemen.

902
02:21:20,421 --> 02:21:22,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

903
02:21:23,302 --> 02:21:24,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Greg Toro on the bass.

904
02:21:26,370 --> 02:21:27,251
[SPEAKER_08]: He's on the run, man.

905
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:29,393
[SPEAKER_08]: He's actually got a wedding to play in a little while.

906
02:21:29,433 --> 02:21:30,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my man.

907
02:21:30,634 --> 02:21:31,815
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

908
02:21:32,315 --> 02:21:32,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this out.

909
02:21:32,876 --> 02:21:33,797
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a rogue warrior.

910
02:21:33,837 --> 02:21:38,100
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to get in his little whip, and he's going to go down to Connecticut to play a wedding.

911
02:21:38,841 --> 02:21:39,241
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

912
02:21:39,862 --> 02:21:40,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my man.

913
02:21:42,013 --> 02:21:44,675
[SPEAKER_08]: The one, the only, Gordon Angle guy on the drums.

914
02:21:45,335 --> 02:21:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:21:46,997 --> 02:21:49,218

[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back tomorrow at the Medford Jazz Festival with two additional acts.

917
02:21:55,463 --> 02:21:59,225
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have student masters from the

918
02:22:00,545 --> 02:22:07,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Berkeley Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, which is directed by Medford's own Terri-Lynn Carrington.

919
02:22:07,807 --> 02:22:10,368
[SPEAKER_08]: She won't be here, but her students will, and they can go.

920
02:22:11,668 --> 02:22:25,291
[SPEAKER_08]: One of her drummers, a young woman by the name of Ivana Cuesta, is gonna be leading that effort, and she's what Terri-Lynn Carrington was at 22, 23 years old, so you might wanna come out and check that out.

921
02:22:25,652 --> 02:22:27,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we are going to have

922
02:22:28,055 --> 02:22:31,767

[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and Donna McElroy, who was actually the chair of the voice department at Berkeley, and then we're gonna have the current chair of the harmony department at Berkeley, his name is George Russell Jr., and George on the keys, Poetry in Motion.

924
02:22:51,983 --> 02:22:58,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really, really, if you can, if your Sunday will allow, you might wanna consider a return trip because it's gonna be

925
02:22:59,019 --> 02:23:00,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Outstanding.

926
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:06,844
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we appreciate you being here with us and rocking with us throughout the day.

927
02:23:07,164 --> 02:23:08,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you're hydrated.

928
02:23:08,365 --> 02:23:11,466
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not, go on in, get some water, some iced tea.

929
02:23:11,847 --> 02:23:15,649
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're feeling a little bit peckish, go on and get a little nosh.

[SPEAKER_08]: They still have a lot of good sweets and sandwiches and pizza croissants and all this different kind of stuff that they made.
