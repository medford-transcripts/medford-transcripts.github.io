1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:01,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:02,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you all.

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Technology is wonderful when it works.

4
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I always say this.

5
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:09,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a little trouble getting in.

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Amory's like, no, no, do this.

7
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:12,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Try that.

8
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,078
[SPEAKER_09]: But we got it done.

9
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:14,918
[SPEAKER_09]: We got it done.

10
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:20,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know why this time it was different from the other 18 million times I've done Zoom.

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That's technology.

12
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,224
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so yeah, crazy, Bobby.

13
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:27,844
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

14
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:31,586
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so let's start.

15
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:33,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see 104.

16
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:34,867
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start the meeting.

17
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:41,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We always try to do some housekeeping things before we jump into the actual agenda.

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,012
[SPEAKER_09]: The approval of the minutes for the May 15th, 2024.

19
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria, how are we doing with that?

20
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:53,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have them or will they be coming to us at a later date?

21
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they will be coming to you at a later date.

22
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:57,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

23
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:02,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the last one we covered a lot of ground, so I know there was a lot of detailed information.

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,682
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I know you're really great at capturing all the nuances.

25
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:06,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.

26
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:11,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll suspend the approval of the minutes for the May 15th meeting.

27
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:13,623
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll push that to the next meeting.

28
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:19,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess let's start in the order that's on the agenda.

29
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:25,263
[SPEAKER_09]: A representative from D1 Soccer League will present two one-day license applications.

30
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,105
[SPEAKER_09]: This one intrigued me.

31
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:28,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's why it was number one.

32
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: A soccer game and a music performance.

33
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Gee, it'd be great if it was somebody really big, you know, like that

34
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:43,202
[SPEAKER_09]: That woman who's been touring all around the country and Taylor Swift, that would be awesome.

35
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Who do we have?

36
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:46,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it George?

37
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul George is my full name.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,110
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, sir?

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:51,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

40
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:51,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm well.

41
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:53,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for jumping on.

42
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,114
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said, this one intrigued us.

43
00:01:56,854 --> 00:02:06,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So can you tell us a little more about the D1 Soccer League and what the ultimate goal is to have a music performance on top of a game?

44
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:12,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't mind giving us a little background as to who you are, what the league is, and tell us a little more, please.

45
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

46
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, my name is Paul George.

47
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the vice president of the D1 Soccer League.

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been around for about 10 years.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,664
[SPEAKER_01]: We played prior in the Everett Stadium, McDonnell Stadium, but we've been at the Hall-Miller Stadium for three years now.

50
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:36,126
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a semi-pro soccer league, a bunch of college kids, retired professional players.

51
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,988
[SPEAKER_01]: We've even had a couple of our young players made it on the professional level.

52
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:41,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to

53
00:02:43,407 --> 00:03:00,852
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to create an environment where young kids or young players get a chance to have college players, college coaches come out and look at them and watch them play, as well as, like, professional players who have retired and they can't really keep up with the younger kids.

54
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,653
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that type of environment that we try to provide.

55
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:11,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to promote the league and bring it to the next level, we realized that we needed to bring in some level of entertainment.

56
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:12,816
[SPEAKER_01]: to be part of it.

57
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:26,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we're trying to do, bringing a couple of artists from... Well, I'm Haitian, so we bring in a couple of Haitian artists to, like, lure the fans in and try to, like, create this atmosphere for the players.

58
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

59
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:29,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

60
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:39,913
[SPEAKER_09]: So... So it would be a game and then some kind of a music performance after the game, or was it before the game?

61
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, kind of...

62
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:47,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is, at times, we play music on our phones.

63
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we had some DJs come in and play music for the fans.

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking to do a halftime performance and maybe a 30-minute performance after the game.

65
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:00,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

66
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:01,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

67
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:07,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do see the one-day applications.

68
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:14,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you submitted any kind of drawings for us to show us where the performance is going to be?

69
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it midfield?

70
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it in the end zone?

71
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it where the stands are?

72
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess these were all the things that were going through my mind.

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, Bobby, my other two commissioners, if you have questions also, be my guest, jump in.

74
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,347
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a sketch.

75
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

76
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Which shows the bleachers and where the alcohol would be.

77
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:43,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right, Paul?

78
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:44,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

79
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to draw.

80
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:46,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not much of an artist.

81
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried my very best to put a sketch together.

82
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,244
[SPEAKER_01]: where it would be serving the alcohol.

83
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:58,127
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the performance, it's two ideas that we have.

84
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:10,595
[SPEAKER_01]: With the permission of the field or the person who's in charge of the stadium, we would bring a stage towards the middle.

85
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:17,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We can build a stage toward the middle or we can build a stage towards the grass area.

86
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:27,819
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, I mean, we're planning on having a few hundred people there at the game, depending on how well the ticket sales are.

87
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,785
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not really put together like a kind of plan where we would have that performance in place.

88
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:35,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

89
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, any questions or thoughts on your end?

90
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, same thing.

91
00:05:44,565 --> 00:06:02,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of wondering where the performance was going to be taking place and, you know, what type of, I mean, Mr. Georges has said that possibly DJ in the past or what type of entertainment they're going to have.

92
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,138
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my concerns is that

93
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,718
[SPEAKER_08]: There's residents all around that area.

94
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got the three high-rises for the towers.

95
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:21,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got all those new apartment complexes over by Fulcanti Rink.

96
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:27,047
[SPEAKER_08]: If the entertainment is kept at a decent level for volume and

97
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of had to point the speakers away from the bleachers toward the river or toward the school, you know, that would be a little better for the residents, I would imagine.

98
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:49,776
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the license application, the one-day license application, I do see an issue with it.

99
00:06:52,647 --> 00:07:03,115
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is you check the box that you are not a registered nonprofit, and you also check all alcohol.

100
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:07,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have all alcohol unless you are a registered nonprofit.

101
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have wine and malt, but not all alcohol.

102
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:15,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see the insurance.

103
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I do see the insurances.

104
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,773
[SPEAKER_08]: from April 26, 24 to October 26, 24.

105
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:27,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have it for the dates.

106
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:40,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, unless there's somebody else that would like to speak, you know, that might have anything to say on this, this one day license.

107
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:41,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, I,

108
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm all set.

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, I just wanted to know about what type of performance there is and the volume of the performance.

110
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see that the hours, they don't go all that late anyways.

111
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it only goes to eight o'clock.

112
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:02,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

113
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:06,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, that's all I have to say.

114
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:07,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Thank you.

115
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I did see the diagram.

116
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:14,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I see where where the the adult beverages, where the refreshments were going to be served.

117
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So I saw that on the schematic there.

118
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:25,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're right, it's not going into the wee hours, as Nick would say.

119
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:30,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of satisfied with that.

120
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:35,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, because the one day licenses,

121
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:40,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as Bobby's correct, you can't have all alcohol.

122
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be beer and wine.

123
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:43,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So we get that.

124
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,416
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an easy tweak.

125
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria, does the city have any concerns with

126
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:57,526
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because I remember there were times when if there's, oh, there's going to be 250 people there.

127
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,008
[SPEAKER_09]: We want extra police details.

128
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:03,110
[SPEAKER_09]: We want, if there's a stage, well, what kind of stage is there?

129
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:10,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any concerns from the city's point regarding the setup of the musical performance?

130
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, the liquor side.

131
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,691
[SPEAKER_09]: We see that's pretty straightforward.

132
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:23,272
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the logistic side for the music performance at Hormel Stadium.

133
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Any thoughts or have you heard anything from the city?

134
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

135
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:34,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Bailey, who's the Recreation Department Director, he was going to jump on just for informational purposes.

136
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,185
[SPEAKER_02]: he's unable to now.

137
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Just notified last minute that he's unable to attend because there was an urgent issue at the task pool.

138
00:09:48,829 --> 00:10:04,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief of staff asked me to ask you guys to postpone these two-day, one-day licenses requests till we have a special meeting, hopefully in July, so we can discuss it then with Kevin present.

139
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:07,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's interesting.

140
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:21,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I was wondering if there was something more, because anytime there's a stage and there's electrical lines, and if it rains, and so it's just all the logistics that go along with that part of it.

141
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:29,497
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's the city's recommendation, Mr. Georges, we're not saying no.

142
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:41,202
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to table the request for the 17th and the 31st until the city can sit and put their heads together and think about it.

143
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It's such a unique request.

144
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you were first on the agenda.

145
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,124
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure it out.

146
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:59,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Between the licensing commission in the city and all the different departments that will weigh in on this, we'll figure it out and we'll do our best to make this happen for you.

147
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Ben.

148
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:02,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, go ahead.

149
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

150
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a question I wanted to ask Mr. George.

151
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys done this concept before with the game and with the music somewhere else?

152
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:11,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have.

153
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put this together before.

154
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:22,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, we try to get a halftime show together or that's about like seven minutes long because the players got to get back on the field.

155
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And then afterwards, we'll put in another like a 30-minute performance for the fans and then they would leave.

156
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make a stage?

157
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we built a small stage.

158
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:38,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a large stage per se, and it's towards to the side.

159
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked out pretty well.

160
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,272
[SPEAKER_01]: What city?

161
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was that at?

162
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:53,040
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done it in Cambridge, and then we've done it in Everett, and also Somerville.

163
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:53,781
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

164
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,182
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you.

165
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's good to know.

166
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:03,818
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other thing, too, is you folks do hire police details, correct?

167
00:12:04,418 --> 00:12:10,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So any event where we're serving alcohol, we'll definitely have a police detail.

168
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,521
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for safety purposes.

169
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just think it's just better anyways.

170
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:17,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Smart.

171
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Smart.

172
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:18,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

173
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, especially with this, you know, it's 600 people.

174
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,330
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to our games, like I said, we've been doing this for a long time.

175
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never had any major issues, wherever, like, violence or any fighting.

176
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:38,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biggest concern that we've dealt with is, like, cleanup.

177
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:51,982
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our issues that we've dealt with in the past, is after we have a large amount of fans and trying to get everybody to go home, and we would have to stay behind or come out the next day to claim.

178
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,721
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our obstacle.

179
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:00,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a challenge, sure.

180
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:09,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria, although the commission we take off July and August, that doesn't mean we vanish to Europe for those 60 days.

181
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:11,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're still around.

182
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,516
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's nothing that says we cannot

183
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:24,040
[SPEAKER_09]: have a quick zoom we posted to make sure the public's aware that we're having a quick zoom so we can resolve this for Mr. Georges.

184
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want you know because he's got two targets in August and I would like to get it resolved for him so he can

185
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:32,923
[SPEAKER_09]: move forward.

186
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:37,786
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing more frustrating than here and we're going to hold this and you got all the logistics.

187
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:49,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I plan big events and small events and it's maddening because sometimes things don't come together until like the last five, seven, eight days before the event.

188
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So I get it.

189
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:54,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. Georges, I'm going to kind of step

190
00:13:55,417 --> 00:14:04,181
[SPEAKER_09]: forward a bit, and I'm going to make a recommendation that we table this until the city can look into the logistics of it.

191
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:18,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if Ben and Bobby don't mind, we can have a quick Zoom meeting in July and just give our opinions on what we hear from the city.

192
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully we can make this happen for Mr. Georges.

193
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

194
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with that, Mr. Chairman.

195
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:25,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

196
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:30,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I would just say the sooner the better, so he can plan his event.

197
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,100
[SPEAKER_10]: As you said, Alan, I know you agree.

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:41,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just because it is going into summer and it's like everybody's got a million things going on and we can't just have these meetings moving all over the place.

199
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:42,321
[SPEAKER_10]: At least I can't.

200
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:45,382
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll do my best to be available.

201
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:46,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

202
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:47,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

203
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:48,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

204
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:48,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

205
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So Bobby, you second my motion?

206
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll second the motion.

207
00:14:53,119 --> 00:15:04,372
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so all in favor of tabling this until the city can investigate a little more or ask them more questions, and then we'll circle back in July.

208
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Say aye.

209
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:05,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

210
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so motion carries.

211
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Georges.

212
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It was intriguing.

213
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we put you first.

214
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,120
[SPEAKER_09]: We've never seen something like this.

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, I wish you could get Taylor Swift.

216
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be incredible.

217
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:29,782
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll get back to you in July and give you a resolution on this request.

218
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:30,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

219
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.

220
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:33,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

221
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:33,883
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

222
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:34,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Ciao.

223
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's see.

224
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Method Brewing.

225
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello.

226
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:49,639
[SPEAKER_09]: You're requesting two one-day license applications.

227
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:50,920
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I see?

228
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Event September 27th and September 28th.

229
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that sound right?

230
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

231
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:57,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

232
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell us a little about them.

233
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:20,863
[SPEAKER_06]: uh so we've got two requests uh one is for the uh there's a music i've got to work out which dates which here um it's because we've got there's a music festival and then there's the run medford as well um i think that was the music festival on top of my head uh

234
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's over the Hatshell.

235
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:35,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been happening the last few years where, again, very similar setup to what we do with the Farmers Market Concerts, where I said it's a one-day music festival.

236
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Russ Robar organizes.

237
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,633
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the Hatshell booked.

238
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.

239
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:48,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea is, I think with that one is, if I'm getting the right one, unless I'm confusing myself, which is probably gonna happen.

240
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:54,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, yeah, so one of them might be, there might be a rain date on that, if it's the right one I'm thinking of.

241
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:59,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, where again, we've obviously put the Nile Colby on these point signs up.

242
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:04,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you've got a map as well, which would be exactly the same spot we do stuff at the farmer's market as well.

243
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, yep.

244
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,458
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're getting good, real good at this, Nick.

245
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Real good at this.

246
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,520
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a little bit of practice.

247
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any questions.

248
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're very familiar with Medford Brewing.

249
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,552
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys do outstanding work, outstanding service.

250
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,232
[SPEAKER_09]: You follow all the rules.

251
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,393
[SPEAKER_09]: No fighting.

252
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as Mr. George was saying, we've never had an incident of people getting out of hand and fighting.

253
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't have any questions.

254
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:42,536
[SPEAKER_09]: My other two colleagues, anything on your mind?

255
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:47,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions or concerns with this request for two one-day license applications?

256
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm okay with it, Mr. Chairman.

257
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a quick question.

258
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,903
[SPEAKER_08]: On those September 27th and 28th, those are two different events, correct?

259
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me hang on my... It's Ron Medford still.

260
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just goes for two days.

261
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:07,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

262
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:07,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

263
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:08,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

264
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

265
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:09,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me correct.

266
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:12,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because my brain is a little bit addled now.

267
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:14,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one actually is the Ron Medford.

268
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one where one of the events.

269
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's the David McGillivray event.

270
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:23,994
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're actually technically the beer sponsor.

271
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:41,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I mentioned last mass meeting where so for the run itself we are not charging for beer that is basically that's included in the admission to the run itself where it sponsors and they've got two events going for that

272
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:46,509
[SPEAKER_06]: where I think one of them we might potentially be actually selling is more of a make sure we're covered.

273
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it last year with them, where we had one day where we were actually selling beer.

274
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:52,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think it was at Hormel.

275
00:18:53,894 --> 00:19:00,759
[SPEAKER_06]: But in truth, it was so poorly attended by beer drinkers that we probably wouldn't do it again.

276
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have to say, we'll do it just to be nice to run Medford.

277
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:07,224
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

278
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:07,984
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

279
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:09,605
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that answered my question.

280
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:10,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

281
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:17,206
[SPEAKER_09]: But either one of my fellow commissioners want to make a motion, that would be great.

282
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm also good with these, Nick.

283
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can make a motion, you guys.

284
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:40,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll make a motion to approve the two one-day licenses, first for the music festivals, September 15th, at the Condon show, and for the Run Medford community events, September 27th,

285
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:50,122
[SPEAKER_10]: and the 28th at Hormel, and then the 28th at Mentor City Hall for these requests.

286
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:52,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that motion.

287
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

288
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Bobby.

289
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:56,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

290
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:02,136
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor of moving forward on the two one-day licenses, say aye.

291
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:02,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

292
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:02,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

293
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:04,057

00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:08,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Best of luck.

298
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,379
[SPEAKER_09]: No rain, right?

299
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:09,939
[SPEAKER_09]: No rain?

300
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:10,479
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

301
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,260
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:13,981

[SPEAKER_09]: See you, sir.

306
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,042
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:16,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Ciao.

308
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:16,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

309
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:17,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Nick.

00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:17,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

311
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:18,503
[SPEAKER_09]: See you, guys.

312
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:22,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's take the next one, event them.

313
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: They're requesting a one-day license application for June 28th.

314
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

315
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:35,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Boom, boom.

316
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:36,623
[SPEAKER_11]: There I am.

317
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:37,203
[SPEAKER_11]: There he is.

318
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,384
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you, sir?

319
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:39,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Good afternoon, everybody.

320
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:40,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to see you.

321
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.

322
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about the event.

323
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:47,022
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a regular too, so tell us about the event.

324
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:48,483
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually have two.

325
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,404
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the event, they're both at Eventham Studios.

326
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:58,227
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the Friday, August, sorry, Friday, June 28th.

327
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:03,790
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a copy and paste of the Sunday gaming events that we've done at the studios.

328
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're doing one on a Friday night.

329
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Just there's been interest on doing

330
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,613
[SPEAKER_11]: them on a night one.

331
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:19,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to incorporate the occasional night gaming night there as well with the FIFA tournament as the feature for it.

332
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,841
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the one on Friday the 28th.

333
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:28,423
[SPEAKER_11]: The 29th is once again a collaboration with JJ Gonson.

334
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,724
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have that application as well.

335
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:37,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially a copy and paste of the performances that we've done at the studios as well.

336
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I see both of those.

337
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:42,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

338
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:43,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Brian.

339
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:43,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

340
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, they both look fine to me.

341
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:51,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I checked a little earlier.

342
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:53,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything looks good as usual.

343
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:53,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

344
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

345
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:01,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we have the insurance.

346
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria, we have the insurance on file.

347
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:06,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I saw that in the PDF.

348
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I do.

349
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:06,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,721
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, good.

351
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:08,301
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

352
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we have an updated one, actually.

353
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can send that as well, Daria.

354
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:13,506
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

355
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,948
[SPEAKER_11]: We just did a renewal.

356
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll send you this one.

357
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

358
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just always good to have that on file so we don't have to bug you.

359
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:22,813
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

360
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:23,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

361
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:26,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, Bobby, I don't have any questions for Brian.

362
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to make a motion?

363
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:34,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can make a motion if you like.

364
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:38,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we should do two different motions where it's two different events.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Two different days, Sean?

366
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:48,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, two different people, JJ Gonson and Yvette.

367
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:52,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the first one, we can make a motion to grant the one-day license

368
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,163
[SPEAKER_08]: for June 29th, 6 p.m.

369
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,144
[SPEAKER_08]: to 10 p.m.

370
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:01,966
[SPEAKER_08]: to J.J.

371
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:05,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Gonson being held at Event Them on Salem Street.

372
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

373
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:13,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second that motion.

374
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:14,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

375
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Bobby.

376
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:20,098
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor of moving forward with the one-day license request say aye.

377
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:21,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

378
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:22,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

379
00:23:22,463 --> 00:23:23,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's done.

380
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,547
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want, I can make a motion for the second one.

381
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:28,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's do.

382
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:48,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make a motion to grant a one-day license to the type of event, FIFA video game event to Brian at Event Them, 344 Salem Street for the hours of 5 to 9.30 PM.

383
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

384
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, you want to 2nd that and I will 2nd that.

385
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:56,907
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

386
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,568
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

387
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,530
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all in favor of approving that 1 day license say, I very good.

388
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: That 1 carries to.

389
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:07,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian, you're, you're all set with both events.

390
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:08,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

391
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

392
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I have 1 follow up question.

393
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:24,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, I, I wasn't, I wasn't aware that you, uh, that the committee takes July and August off for decades.

394
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:25,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew it was August.

395
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:27,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure about July.

396
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so we actually, August 22nd, I hadn't sent that application in, um,

397
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:43,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Or basically another collaboration with J. J. it's on a Thursday, August, 22nd, and I still submit that application.

398
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:51,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Submit it and see what happens kind of yeah, I, I would submit it and if we're going to.

399
00:24:55,207 --> 00:25:01,653
[SPEAKER_09]: rule on Mr. George's request that Hormel, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone.

400
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:02,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I shouldn't be saying that.

401
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:03,835
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not nice to say anymore.

402
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,518
[SPEAKER_09]: But Bobby, Ben, what do you think, you know, if we could do two?

403
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:08,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's fine with me.

404
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:08,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

405
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:09,079
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

406
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,259
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really reasonable.

407
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing as the event.

408
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:15,741
[SPEAKER_11]: It's essentially the same thing as the 29th.

409
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:16,342
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

410
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Same collaboration, same thing with JJ.

411
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:21,484
[SPEAKER_11]: So just setting forth the expectations.

412
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:26,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And Brian, it's not that, oh, the commission's a bunch of prima donnas.

413
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:27,626
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to work in the summer.

414
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:27,786
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

415
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:32,248
[SPEAKER_09]: But I always try to explain to people that people take vacations.

416
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:37,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fire chief, the police chief, everyone takes vacations in those months.

417
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:46,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes it's impossible to get things done because everyone is going to be on holiday, including the commissioners, too.

418
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,317
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to take our vacations, too.

419
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:53,780
[SPEAKER_09]: So logistically, it was always hard to get anything done in those two months.

420
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:01,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was the impetus as to why, eons ago, the licensing commission started taking off those two months.

421
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not a problem at all.

422
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:06,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to, I just, I wasn't sure.

423
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:08,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, cool.

424
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:09,433
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

425
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:11,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

426
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:12,917
[SPEAKER_11]: You all have a great afternoon.

427
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:13,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

428
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:14,419
[SPEAKER_11]: See you, Brian.

429
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

430
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

431
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:22,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Sandoval, we're going to skip over you.

432
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:25,472
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on a roll with the one-day license application.

433
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:33,858
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'd like to do is I'd like to jump over to the Riverside Yacht Club, and then we'll circle back to you if you don't mind.

434
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have one more from the Frisbee Group.

435
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:40,344
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

436
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:40,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

437
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:41,405
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

438
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:47,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's address the Riverside Yacht Club, their one-day license application request.

439
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:51,371
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

440
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Michael from Riverside Yacht Club.

441
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:54,712
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Michael?

442
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the Vice Commodore.

443
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:59,974
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just having a little social event on September 7th.

444
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just basically an end of the year get together, you know.

445
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:13,940
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not expecting a big crowd or anything, maybe 50 people, and a gentleman offered to bring his band.

446
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So I put in for the application.

447
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking to put them on the back deck.

448
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:22,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's about it.

449
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:26,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's nothing really elaborate or anything.

450
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:31,349
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little get together and he offered to play for us.

451
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:32,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So here I am.

452
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

453
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,091
[SPEAKER_07]: An application.

454
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:39,533
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have an entertainment license, but that's for devices only, so.

455
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't cover the actual deck too.

456
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:43,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

457
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:43,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

458
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:44,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.

459
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me, how late will the event go?

460
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:52,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only like, I put down five to 11, but it's like six to 10.

461
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a couple extra hours in for setting up and cleaning up and stuff like that.

462
00:27:56,994 --> 00:28:01,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't see it going much later than 10 o'clock anyways.

463
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:03,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're an older crowd.

464
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,463
[SPEAKER_07]: We have very few young guys down there.

465
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty low key.

466
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, he off it.

467
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:14,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

468
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:25,699
[SPEAKER_09]: When the request came in, that was my only concern about how late would it go in the evening and neighbors complaining, that's all.

469
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,661
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also why I put in the application.

470
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The neighbors are pretty good.

471
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:30,922
[SPEAKER_07]: They're nice.

472
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:32,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We get along very well with them.

473
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:38,926
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to accommodate them as best we can or exactly as much as we can.

474
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:39,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

475
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:41,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

476
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, Ben, any questions to Mike?

477
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's a question to the Commissioner.

478
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:53,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The all alcohol, so it's an all alcohol, is it?

479
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,304
[SPEAKER_10]: That wine and malt?

480
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,266
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to clarify that, Bobby?

481
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:57,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

482
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:09,211
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're a registered non-profit, which Michael checked yes, they can have an all-alcohol one-day license.

483
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:14,753
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're not a registered non-profit, they can only have wine and malt.

484
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:19,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Mr. Georges, his had non-profit too though.

485
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:24,819
[SPEAKER_08]: His did not have non-profit, I believe, if we look at it.

486
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, he's not a non-profit.

487
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

488
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm looking at too many of them next time.

489
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:35,366
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that was one of the tweaks we will address, because he's not a non-profit.

490
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:40,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So because he was checked off, he had all alcohol and wine and malt.

491
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he can't get all alcohol.

492
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make that correction in July.

493
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:45,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

494
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:46,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

495
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:48,254
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not to go on to that.

496
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:49,955
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't.

497
00:29:51,070 --> 00:30:01,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, whereas this is a fairly contained event, sometimes, Mike, we have like a diagram that shows like where things are happening.

498
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like, well, we may, you know, I mean, this is, I'm familiar with the club a little bit, so.

499
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:14,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's the clubhouse right off of 52 Ship Out.

500
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the back side is a deck.

501
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:18,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

502
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:19,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And you walk down,

503
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,310
[SPEAKER_07]: They can go down the gangplank to the boats.

504
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I could draw a quick sketch on it and show you right now.

505
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:27,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

506
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:35,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, or, you know, you can draw us a sketch because we always want to see a diagram for the file, or you could do Google Earth.

507
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:46,242
[SPEAKER_09]: and take a snapshot of the location and with a marker, you could do some tweaking in there, whatever it takes.

508
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:50,184
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't expect it to come from an engineer or an architect, nothing like that.

509
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:58,009
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do want, because we are asking everybody, so we just want to be consistent with everybody.

510
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I can draw out a quick sketch and I can leave it with Daria if you like.

511
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:10,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she can share it with us after and we'll say pending that if that if everybody's okay with that.

512
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:13,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's we just do it right on the spot.

513
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:14,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

514
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:15,628
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I agree, Ben.

515
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:16,328
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good point.

516
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,388
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been asking everybody.

517
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's be consistent.

518
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:23,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

519
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think the bar would need to stay open until 11 or the bar can just be closed at 10 or?

520
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:40,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, we're a private club and, uh, I mean, we could close the bar, but a lot of people could just go down to their boats.

521
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have refrigerators on the boat and get a beer.

522
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

523
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:49,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't really make it.

524
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:53,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, um, I am tip certified and all that.

525
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:59,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also have another gentleman that, uh, is tip certified that works on the house committee with me.

526
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:00,607
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um,

527
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:05,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we got more retired cops and state troopers down there.

528
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,783
[SPEAKER_07]: We got the fire boaters parked right there at the bottom of the gangplank.

529
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:11,924
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in and out of the bay.

530
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:13,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that we're not.

531
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:16,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We know the bigger picture down there, Mike.

532
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:17,685
[SPEAKER_09]: We agree.

533
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:20,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the risk is minimal.

534
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, we get it.

535
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:24,307
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

536
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any other questions.

537
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, Ben, if you want to make a motion.

538
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can make a motion.

539
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good as well.

540
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:34,231
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds fine.

541
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:41,154
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll just say submitting a diagram of it.

542
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:43,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll approve, you know, once you do that, we can approve it.

543
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:44,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

544
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:54,159
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll make a motion to accept the one day license for the Riverside Yacht Club for September 7th, 2024 for the event from 5pm to 11pm.

545
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:03,383
[SPEAKER_10]: PM as laid out by Mike Silvestro.

546
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Mike Silvestro?

547
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:06,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

548
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:14,868
[SPEAKER_10]: And just subject to Mike providing us a diagram of where the alcohol will be served in this event.

549
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:17,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

550
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:18,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that motion.

551
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:19,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

552
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:20,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

553
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:21,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Bobby.

554
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:30,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll approve of the one day license for the Riverside Yacht Club for September 7th.

555
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Say aye.

556
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:33,123
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

557
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:33,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

558
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:34,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

559
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:35,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, you're good.

560
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:37,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of fun.

561
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:39,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's a successful event.

562
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,108
[SPEAKER_09]: No rain, right?

563
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:41,930
[SPEAKER_07]: No rain.

564
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

565
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.

566
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get that drawing to Gary as soon as possible.

567
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

568
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:46,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

569
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,114
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

570
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:47,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

571
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:48,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.

572
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

573
00:33:49,616 --> 00:33:49,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

574
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:55,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary, did you say there was one more one-day license?

575
00:33:56,037 --> 00:34:00,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, from the, oh my God, I can't think.

576
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Glory, Boston Glory.

577
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:04,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, cool.

578
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:06,762
[SPEAKER_12]: There's two of them, yeah?

579
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:07,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I see two?

580
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:09,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

581
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:11,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Two, I believe, yeah.

582
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:12,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

583
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just grab the AD panel?

584
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:17,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, thank you.

585
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I see them.

586
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,422
[SPEAKER_09]: August 11th, right?

587
00:34:28,642 --> 00:34:29,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that one of them?

588
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,164
[SPEAKER_09]: August 11th, July 27th, yep.

589
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,205
[SPEAKER_09]: July 27th.

590
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and who do we have?

591
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay Tallerman.

592
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Jay, how are you?

593
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

594
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you again.

595
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you again.

596
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only gonna end up using one of them.

597
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:45,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that we don't know yet which round.

598
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:49,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in first place in the division.

599
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:51,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be hosting a playoff game.

600
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:59,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either going to be on the 27th or the 11th, so we won't be using both, but we thought it would be best just to get both licenses.

601
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

602
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:02,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

603
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:06,805
[SPEAKER_09]: This is exciting that you're in the playoffs, right?

604
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

605
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,467
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting at seven and two.

606
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:12,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We've beaten all of our rivals.

607
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:16,151
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably ranked number one in the whole league right now.

608
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:20,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Rankings come out today, so it's a really good season so far.

609
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, including the evil empire, right?

610
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, beat them last time.

611
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was a big one.

612
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,741
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something in the water around here.

613
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I tell ya.

614
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:36,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're very familiar with your organization, Jay.

615
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:41,036
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys run a tight ship, no incidents, no problems.

616
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:45,397
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as, Jerry, do we have the insurance on file?

617
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:50,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have, I know we have a schematic, because it's always the same.

618
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:52,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So are we good with the insurance?

619
00:35:54,594 --> 00:35:58,817
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a certificate of insurance on file that should be fine for the whole season.

620
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I do have their insurance just in general.

621
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

622
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Has it expired?

623
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,644
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it shouldn't be.

624
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be for the whole season.

625
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be good.

626
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:09,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

627
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:10,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

628
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:15,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Bobby, Ben, any questions or concerns for Jay?

629
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:18,655
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

630
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:21,914
[SPEAKER_09]: When will you know what date it is, Jay?

631
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:32,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So we won't actually know until the last weekend of the season, which is the 20th and 21st.

632
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: If our two rivals, DC and New York, both lose one more game, then it's definitely going to be the 11th.

633
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:54,251
[SPEAKER_03]: If they keep winning, then it's gonna come down to the last week of the season when we have a doubleheader in Canada that we have to win both games to lock in the 11th.

634
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:58,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping for the 11th, but we don't know for sure just yet.

635
00:36:59,433 --> 00:36:59,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

636
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, no issues.

637
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:02,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it all sounds good.

638
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Daria, is that any problem with the paperwork of like since it's two dates?

639
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:11,417
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just think as long as they let us know which date they use.

640
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:12,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

641
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:15,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, it's very similar.

642
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,570
[SPEAKER_09]: The way I'm looking at it's very similar to when we get rain dates.

643
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, we have one day and then a rain day.

644
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,491
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, in a way, that's kind of each other.

645
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, then I have no more questions.

646
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no issues with that.

647
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:27,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

648
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:28,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

649
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:28,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good with this.

650
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:30,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

651
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm all set with it.

652
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything looks good.

653
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:37,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm familiar with Jason.

654
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everything's been great the past couple of years, so I'm on board with it.

655
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we can, I can make a motion if you like.

656
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:47,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please.

657
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:54,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll make a motion to grant a one day license for either July 27th,

658
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:01,149
[SPEAKER_08]: or August 11th, depending upon how the playoffs turn out.

659
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:06,690
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's for the Boston Glory.

660
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:12,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will be from 11 a.m.

661
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,731
[SPEAKER_08]: to 4 p.m.

662
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:14,832
[SPEAKER_08]: on either date.

663
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And the location will be Hormel Stadium.

664
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good, Bobby.

665
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second the motion.

666
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

667
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:38,483
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor of approving the one-day license request for July 27th and August 11th for Boston Glory, say aye.

668
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:39,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

669
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:41,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

670
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:42,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Approved.

671
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay, good luck.

672
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:44,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

673
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:46,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Give them hell.

674
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:48,065
[SPEAKER_09]: We will.

675
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:48,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much.

676
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:49,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to you soon.

677
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:50,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

678
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:50,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

679
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:51,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

680
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:56,916
[SPEAKER_09]: One last item.

681
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:59,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Novarro, there you are, you're on mute.

682
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,693
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing his best to try to get off mute.

683
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:18,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan, I'm sorry to interrupt.

684
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Kevin Bailey jumped on.

685
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:21,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I see him on here.

686
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should probably let him know.

687
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:28,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's aware that we were just going to do it in July with him.

688
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:31,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see Kevin Bailey.

689
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:32,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see him.

690
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,387
[SPEAKER_09]: But Navarre, how are you doing?

691
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I still see you on mute.

692
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I told you technology is wonderful when it works.

693
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he just said it.

694
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,794
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

695
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,015
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

696
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:52,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to mute, Alvaro.

697
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:54,538
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

698
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, done.

699
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:56,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job.

700
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.

701
00:39:58,662 --> 00:39:59,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see you.

702
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:00,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you again.

703
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:04,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's excited.

704
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:06,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, Alita is finally coming to fruition.

705
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:08,320
[SPEAKER_09]: We're excited for you.

706
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,042
[SPEAKER_09]: The Square, the community's excited for you.

707
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Your El Tecuba is just wonderful.

708
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you have the Midas touch, sir.

709
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

710
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:25,733
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to be on the Square and keep investing, you know.

711
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,258
[SPEAKER_00]: in the square, so.

712
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:32,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for choosing MedBit for your businesses and helping the community.

713
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:42,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we dive into the application, can you tell us the concept of what you're putting in, what it consists of, what you'll be serving?

714
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:47,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you paint us a picture of what LocalEat is going to be all about?

715
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

716
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,151
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cafe.

717
00:40:54,862 --> 00:41:02,687
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be servicing pastry sandwiches and also small plates.

718
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:07,950
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want people to be able to get, if they want, a glass of wine or if they want a cocktail.

719
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,733
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're looking to do.

720
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:19,217
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tweak it a little bit in the afternoon, evening, so we can stay open and then have a little bit of

721
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:23,522
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things on the inside.

722
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:28,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's the idea that we want to do, the concept.

723
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:30,665
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

724
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:43,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So, coffees, different types of coffees or... Just one line of coffees, but, you know, not too much of extent, but we're mixing with some...

725
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,076
[SPEAKER_00]: some pastry sandwiches and some salads.

726
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:48,697
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the start of.

727
00:41:49,257 --> 00:42:02,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also small place in different, not a specific region that needs to be, but we want to have like, you know, good food so you can also have it in the evening, also probably part of the day.

728
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:07,248
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we're looking to do.

729
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:10,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it works out the idea that we have in mind.

730
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

731
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

732
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, Bobby, questions?

733
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:23,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we jump into the application, like I said, I wanted an idea of what he's putting in.

734
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:29,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all for Medford Square being a destination.

735
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,278
[SPEAKER_09]: The more the merrier.

736
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:37,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so tired of hearing about Davis Square and Malden Square, and this is what we need.

737
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:47,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know some, some, I think like last I don't remember if you did this last time people will give the menu.

738
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,610
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why they actually do.

739
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:51,332
[SPEAKER_10]: They usually do show us the menu.

740
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:51,772
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really.

741
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

742
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:56,460
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like one of the things, because you sort of evaluate it.

743
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,044
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, from what you're explaining, and it's caffeine, it was coughed the Mystic Roaster, right?

744
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:03,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

745
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:04,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

746
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:11,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, you know, and I looked at the plan, and it's like, whatever, you know, 20 seats or something like that, or less, maybe.

747
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:17,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And, I mean, it's, you know, I'm not, nothing is,

748
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,371
[SPEAKER_10]: About about this is really, you know, seem like an issue to me.

749
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:23,712
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

750
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:28,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, why don't we look into the to the actual application and yeah.

751
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:28,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

752
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:34,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're, we're, we're great with the concept, but, but Ben is correct.

753
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:42,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually we do want to see some type of a menu when 1 is drawn up a lot or if you don't mind.

754
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:52,416
[SPEAKER_09]: submit one to the city so we have one for the file is, you know, what we were saying to the Riverside Yacht Club, we'd like a drawing because we want to be consistent with everybody.

755
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:57,678
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to treat all the entities the same way so no one can say, well, why didn't you ask them?

756
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:58,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't ask them.

757
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just trying to be consistent.

758
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you do have one, you know, if you could get it over the diary so we can put it in your folder, that would be great.

759
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:08,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

760
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:11,585
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's take a look at the application.

761
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:18,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Daria, you had sent us an updated version, correct?

762
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the last few pages?

763
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:24,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, did you see the updated version?

764
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:25,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

765
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:26,646
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the difference Daria?

766
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I missed that.

767
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:32,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just small things like clicking no and yes.

768
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just missing basically.

769
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:38,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the biggest one was three months of,

770
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, our bank statements.

771
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:42,933
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

772
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:43,213
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

773
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:43,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

774
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:49,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're trying, Laura, we're trying to do our best to help ABCC.

775
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:50,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

776
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:56,979
[SPEAKER_09]: What we don't want is we don't want them going, geez, so what are they still not over there in Medford?

777
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:01,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So we we try to make sure that a completed packet is heading their way.

778
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:02,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

779
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:07,143
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so that's that we're not, you know, we're not being a pain.

780
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:20,347
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that, you know, kind of reflects on all of us, you and us, you know, if we're sending them an application that's not completed correctly, or their information is omitted, then, you know, they, like I said, they'll scratch their head and start asking questions.

781
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:22,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, and I appreciate the.

782
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Daria, that she's been helping me a lot.

783
00:45:26,535 --> 00:45:34,147
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you, I mean, this is the third one that I'm going to be applying in the city, besides in Somerville, so that I did it.

784
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:35,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have been very helpful.

785
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:37,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the process.

786
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:38,875
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

787
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:45,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I was curious, is that your business partner, Andres?

788
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's my brother.

789
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:49,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brother, yeah, yeah.

790
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:57,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We both sell the notch and the brand itself, so now we're just trying to grow the business.

791
00:45:57,977 --> 00:45:58,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.

792
00:45:59,157 --> 00:45:59,777
[SPEAKER_10]: How's business?

793
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing good, can't complain.

794
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:07,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going well, and having a different, especially in Metford,

795
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:20,611
[SPEAKER_00]: putting something that we, you know, being in Metford Square for a while now, for more than 12 years, yeah, just to see what the square is shaping, getting the shape and what needs, and the needs.

796
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:25,355
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's just, you know, hopefully it works out.

797
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:33,221
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that's a need, you know, for the community, not just for the community, for everyone who's passing by and then stopping by and then,

798
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:39,929
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as the new place that we opened in Tacuba, we thought, you know, that's something that it will be a good fit.

799
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, it's been great.

800
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,151
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of support.

801
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:48,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this one is going to go that way.

802
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:50,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Tacuba is cool.

803
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,315
[SPEAKER_09]: How's the outdoor part working out for you?

804
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:53,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Good?

805
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:55,316
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.

806
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:57,097
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kind of, as a matter of fact, we

807
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:08,068
[SPEAKER_00]: off, officially open on Sunday, like some people were sitting, my brother just went in and then, seen a few tables, sit down, and then all of a sudden some people were just, you know, passing by and sitting.

808
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:12,751
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably, by the end of the week, we hope to be like now announcing we open.

809
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,372
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see how it works with the layout of the inside.

810
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:20,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people change, you know, the reserve, they want to move out, or how we're going to be,

811
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:22,182
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, working on that.

812
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:22,883
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good.

813
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:23,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

814
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I drove by and it looked completely false.

815
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:28,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, you've got to touch.

816
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:30,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

817
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:33,126
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

818
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:34,606
[SPEAKER_09]: So application.

819
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:39,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, I've scanned through the new packet.

820
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:44,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of closes up the stuff from the first package.

821
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:46,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see any inconsistencies?

822
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:53,133
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I went over it myself when we received the update.

823
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:54,094
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks good.

824
00:47:55,235 --> 00:48:01,221
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the issues seem to have been corrected.

825
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:13,202
[SPEAKER_08]: The bank statements are on there, but if it's not satisfactory to the ABCC, the inspector will tell you, Alvaro, what you need to do.

826
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:24,767
[SPEAKER_08]: They like to see that full amount on the statements, but you can deal with that with the ABCC inspector, and I'm sure it'll be taken care of.

827
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:26,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything else, it looked fine to me.

828
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:29,748
[SPEAKER_08]: You did a nice job on the application.

829
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:32,517
[SPEAKER_08]: You did pretty well.

830
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:34,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

831
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:34,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

832
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:35,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

833
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:41,003
[SPEAKER_10]: What was your target opening date on this?

834
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,224
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on it.

835
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:46,907
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, the Fire Alarm company just called me today.

836
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,508
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty much about to wrap up.

837
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:53,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have to call, obviously, the inspection of services and so on.

838
00:48:53,592 --> 00:48:55,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all dependent on that.

839
00:48:55,413 --> 00:49:00,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And then myself just going back to the health department to get what they need from us.

840
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:04,003
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we can, I will say.

841
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:09,926
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to put a date, because if something happens, I always move forward.

842
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:10,666
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard, yeah.

843
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:13,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to open as soon as we can.

844
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:13,547
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.

845
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:13,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool.

846
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:16,569
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

847
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any other concerns or questions.

848
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:30,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of going through the bank statements too.

849
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:34,456
[SPEAKER_09]: May 1st, May 31st.

850
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:37,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

851
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good with the updated corrections to the application.

852
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:48,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria, I think you did a great job advising through the thing.

853
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,131
[SPEAKER_00]: She's great.

854
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:53,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put it on record.

855
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:55,993
[SPEAKER_00]: She's great.

856
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:58,754
[SPEAKER_00]: She really helped me a lot.

857
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:07,057
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy because I know she has a pile of work and then she still find a way to really either send an email, like remind something that is missing.

858
00:50:08,278 --> 00:50:09,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really appreciated.

859
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how difficult it is to deal with all those things, especially last minute.

860
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:25,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, and I'm looking at the, you notified the abutters, I can see all the certified mail receipt.

861
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I was on the city council agenda because Ben and I were, our commissions were being renewed.

862
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:40,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the hot, hot topics was the methadone clinic.

863
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:46,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And so many of the neighbors got up and said that they were never notified.

864
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:48,068
[SPEAKER_09]: They never got anything in the mail.

865
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:53,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was like, you know, what do you mean you didn't get anything in the mail?

866
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, do we have the

867
00:50:57,472 --> 00:51:01,853
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, all the verification that the abutters had been notified.

868
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:03,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And there they all are here.

869
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:07,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So only, you know, like I said, I'm just, it's just going through my head.

870
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:08,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm good.

871
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:16,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, Ben, you want to make a motion so we can help Elvaro move forward with Localita?

872
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Would be great.

873
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:22,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't help you at Cuban Coffee, but I'm sure you'll figure something out, so.

874
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:25,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I can make a motion on that if you guys are okay with that.

875
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

876
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:33,629
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I will make a motion to grant the sorry.

877
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:48,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just sorry I just was clicking between this, this is the all, it's a beer and wine, or spirit wine and wine cordials and cordials yeah so the beer and wine and cordials.

878
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:52,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there we go.

879
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: New license for Localito LLC at 30 Riverside Ave.

880
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:09,036
[SPEAKER_10]: When Alvaro has a menu available, please send it to the commission.

881
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:10,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I will.

882
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:12,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

883
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:13,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll keep that on the record.

884
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Daria's great.

885
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,601
[SPEAKER_10]: That's on the record already.

886
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:20,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's it.

887
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:21,876
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my motion.

888
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:22,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

889
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:23,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

890
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:25,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second the motion.

891
00:52:25,505 --> 00:52:25,845
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

892
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:32,087
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor of moving forward with this new application, say aye.

893
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:33,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

894
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:34,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

895
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:36,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Navarre, you're good.

896
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:43,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just looking to see how many licenses we have requests for beer, wine, and cordials.

897
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:46,453
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm reading the quota breakdown, it looks like there's four.

898
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:49,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to snag one of the four.

899
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:51,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll have three left.

900
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:53,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

901
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:54,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

902
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming.

903
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:55,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

904
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Best of luck.

905
00:52:57,763 --> 00:52:58,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

906
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:58,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

907
00:52:58,783 --> 00:52:59,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

908
00:52:59,103 --> 00:52:59,523
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you.

909
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:00,704
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

910
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:01,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you.

911
00:53:01,604 --> 00:53:02,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you.

912
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:03,385
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you in the place.

913
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:04,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

914
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,426
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's open.

915
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:05,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

916
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:06,546
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's open.

917
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:06,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.

918
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

919
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:09,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

920
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:16,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

921
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Kevin.

922
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Kevin, you're on mute.

923
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, how are you?

924
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:27,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, good.

925
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:46,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Kevin, what we decided to do with the soccer D, with the game and the musical performance, what we decided to do was put it on hold and let the city look into the logistics of the combined events.

926
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:51,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we told Mr. Georges is that we would get back to him in July.

927
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:56,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though this commission takes off July and August, we don't have an issue with that.

928
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:01,781
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get together for 15 minutes and do a public Zoom or something like that.

929
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:03,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was our thought.

930
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:05,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll give you guys ample time.

931
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:08,985
[SPEAKER_09]: But he wants to do a couple of events in

932
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:10,385
[SPEAKER_09]: August.

933
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:16,230
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to get an opinion to them.

934
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:24,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I was saying I've done these big events and little events and there's nothing more frustrating where you don't know whether things are going to come together until a week before.

935
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:27,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can help us out, that would be great.

936
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:42,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll, I'll reach out to the organizer and also have our facility manager who oversees home out will probably set up a meeting with him and what his plans are for the alcohol permit and stuff and hopefully we can.

937
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:45,765
[SPEAKER_05]: expedite that later on in July.

938
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:46,766
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate that.

939
00:54:47,086 --> 00:54:47,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

940
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:47,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

941
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:54,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, on the surface, you know, it looks fine to us the you know, the one the one day requests.

942
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:55,654
[SPEAKER_09]: So that looks fine.

943
00:54:55,674 --> 00:55:01,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just I am concerned about the other part of it, and how they all they meld together.

944
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:03,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So so we'll resolve this farm in July.

945
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:04,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

946
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:05,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

947
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

948
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:07,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much commissioners.

949
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:07,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for having me.

950
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

951
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

952
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:17,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary, I think we, we have everybody if I'm looking at the agenda, I think we've.

953
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:20,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking care of all the requests.

954
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:21,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

955
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:22,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

956
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:22,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

957
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:23,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

958
00:55:24,605 --> 00:55:25,626
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um.

959
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:37,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we talk about any other business that may arise, I think you had some questions you wanted us to discuss the new proposed layout for the 1 day license application.

960
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:38,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

961
00:55:39,097 --> 00:55:39,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

962
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:46,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell us how do you see it?

963
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:51,404
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be all interactive and they can just type right into it.

964
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:54,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me more about what your vision is of that.

965
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:57,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually was Bobby's.

966
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:07,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, remember he sent it to us after the last meeting, which I liked that he included payment because that was going to be easier to

967
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we have a lot of nonprofits, we still have some for profits.

968
00:56:12,878 --> 00:56:15,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are really good about paying, some of them are not.

969
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to keep that on there.

970
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:28,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they haven't paid and we know that's not checked off, I can follow up and say, you know, we can issue you, we cannot, for example, review this application until you pay us the fee first.

971
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has rain dates on there and it also has,

972
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:41,372
[SPEAKER_02]: avoiding where it says, if you're not having the one day license event, let the commission know.

973
00:56:41,392 --> 00:56:47,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But this way we can void it or whatever, you know?

974
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:58,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people do do that where they tell me, oh, I didn't have this event, but we didn't know because we weren't notified, you know, till the moment when this person is like, oh yeah, I didn't have an event on that day.

975
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's important.

976
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, what else did you?

977
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:07,838
[SPEAKER_08]: The application must be filled out completely.

978
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Not applicable.

979
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,832
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, yeah, it's not really one of those fill-in-your-own-forms.

980
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not that talented, Alan.

981
00:57:20,294 --> 00:57:21,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you'll be able to take it.

982
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,516
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I love those interactive forms.

983
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:26,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Those interactive PDFs are great.

984
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I was going to say.

985
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I can turn it into PDF.

986
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Word right now, just to have it at least drafted somewhat.

987
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if we like what we see, I can turn it into PDF.

988
00:57:37,785 --> 00:57:39,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I think that would be great.

989
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:44,710
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we, you know, I'm constantly reminded by all my nieces and nephews uncle Alan.

990
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 2024.

991
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is what I get from them all the time.

992
00:57:47,973 --> 00:57:51,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's let's get the the word document together.

993
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I Bobby I'd like to your recommendations and

994
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:07,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I think let's adopt it, let's vote to adopt it and then when Daria has time, if she can convert it to a PDF so it can be interactive for the kids, that would be great.

995
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:08,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

996
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:11,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that works.

997
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:14,137
[SPEAKER_08]: That way they could fill it out online and just submit it.

998
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:22,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, even if they, it's like the ABCC, they have them fill it out online, print it, and then submit it to Daria.

999
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:36,162
[SPEAKER_08]: They can do the same thing with this and submit their check with it at the same time, because there's a box at the bottom, fee with the line payable to City of Medford, payment to one day of application.

1000
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:40,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they submit the application, there's a check for $60.

1001
00:58:41,324 --> 00:58:47,728
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to chase, Daria doesn't have to chase people for money all the time and just make life a little easier, you know?

1002
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:48,929
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's smart.

1003
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:49,729
[SPEAKER_09]: It's smart.

1004
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:50,950
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

1005
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in favor as well.

1006
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:59,775
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, that sounds making, you know, let's get up to, to the modern, you know, way of doing these things.

1007
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:00,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, of course.

1008
00:59:00,935 --> 00:59:02,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, definitely in favor of it.

1009
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:03,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1010
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:03,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1011
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:19,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking of tying in something else with that, but I think it's better off in a separate form for caterers licenses, because they're required to notify us in the police department 48 hours in advance if they're going to have an event in the city.

1012
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we don't have to approve it.

1013
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:26,905
[SPEAKER_08]: We have jurisdiction there, but they're required to notify us.

1014
00:59:26,945 --> 00:59:29,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we can just have a small one pager

1015
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:39,353
[SPEAKER_08]: that if somebody calls the area or the police saying, well, look, we're notifying you, we're having an event that event them, like, you know, whatever.

1016
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's sure there's a form you got to fill out, just email it back to us.

1017
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:43,655
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all set.

1018
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:45,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we don't have we don't have to sit.

1019
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:50,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to come before us or anything as long as the area gets notification.

1020
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we could get.

1021
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Could that be done?

1022
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm thinking of

1023
00:59:56,308 --> 01:00:04,297
[SPEAKER_09]: When I used to work, could that be done through the city website?

1024
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:07,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Could we put language on the license commission in that section?

1025
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1026
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:09,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:10,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Do something there?

1028
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:11,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1029
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:20,592
[SPEAKER_02]: just let me know what you want and then I will have Lisa added, Lisa from our office to add it to the website.

1030
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:21,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1031
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:29,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not- Bobby, I was just thinking, you know, in residential lending, we, you know, we, oh, let's have that.

1032
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,396
[SPEAKER_09]: No, let's just put it on the website.

1033
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:36,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So when they're looking at rates, they can see all the, you know, all the narrative that associated with the programs and rates.

1034
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,280
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll come up with something for you.

1035
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1036
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, so do we need to make a motion to approve the.

1037
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:50,247
[SPEAKER_09]: The application, I think so.

1038
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:50,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1039
01:00:51,108 --> 01:00:56,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I motion just revised application.

1040
01:00:56,852 --> 01:01:01,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I make a motion to revise the, the, the, the 1 day license application.

1041
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:04,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my motion.

1042
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:07,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second it.

1043
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1044
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,391
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor, say aye.

1045
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:10,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1046
01:01:11,412 --> 01:01:11,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1047
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:12,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1048
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:21,058
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get that into print, and let's see if we can get it in a PDF, and let's start using it as soon as we can.

1049
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1050
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:27,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Commissioner, can I ask you a quick question about just the last thing?

1051
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:28,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1052
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:38,570
[SPEAKER_10]: When Brian Bailey came on, he came on, but he was coming on to talk about the soccer event or give some insight.

1053
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,030
[SPEAKER_10]: But we just didn't want to hear.

1054
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just curious why we didn't want to hear from him now.

1055
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:51,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because the other party has to be here to

1056
01:01:52,858 --> 01:02:03,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the issues are, probably you want the other part to explain, you know what I mean?

1057
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, Ben, it's a good observation.

1058
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:14,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I think by tabling the requests, now the pressure is off, so now they can kind of

1059
01:02:15,743 --> 01:02:21,186
[SPEAKER_09]: look at it differently rather than under the gun in the last half hour.

1060
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:30,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's why we took the wind out of his sails by saying, look, we're going to hold this until July when you guys can all study it.

1061
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:32,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing that's what happened.

1062
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:35,154
[SPEAKER_08]: They've never been in the city before, correct?

1063
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:36,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1064
01:02:36,675 --> 01:02:38,736
[SPEAKER_02]: For the past three years.

1065
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They have?

1066
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, I have not done the not the music event, but no, no, no, not the music event.

1067
01:02:48,653 --> 01:02:49,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1068
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:49,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1069
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:50,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1070
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:50,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1071
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:51,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1072
01:02:51,694 --> 01:02:58,857
[SPEAKER_10]: So my only comment on that, which was like a little, I don't know, disappointing or whatever you want to call it, but was that we have to have a special meeting now.

1073
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:09,422
[SPEAKER_10]: For for a reason we are not aware of yet, I guess, and so it's sort of like I know it's all Brian was trying to get on the call, but it was it's.

1074
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:17,882
[SPEAKER_10]: For the last three years, we really never end up taking any break from this and we have a lot of special meetings to sort of accommodate different things.

1075
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:25,250
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I always try to avoid that if we have to, because it's like a whole other thing to schedule.

1076
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:27,541
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1077
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:29,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my, I don't know.

1078
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:29,943
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my comment.

1079
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:31,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I get, I get it.

1080
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:41,071
[SPEAKER_09]: But rather than making, trying to make a decision today on that, when we didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle, I, I don't think that would be prudent for the, for us in the city.

1081
01:03:41,171 --> 01:03:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I agree, Ben, I don't like the idea that, you know, okay, July, August, but you know, we'll make it painless in July.

1082
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:56,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, and also the guy needs to plan his event.

1083
01:03:56,619 --> 01:03:58,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, do you have to plan your event without it?

1084
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:09,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you do, but... The village was truly an emergency at the Tufts pool that happened that involved a child, so that's why Kevin couldn't come on time.

1085
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:11,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't doubt that he had a legitimate reason.

1086
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:12,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, okay.

1087
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:14,713
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that's my only thing.

1088
01:04:14,973 --> 01:04:16,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll think about that.

1089
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:18,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

1090
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, two last things.

1091
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:25,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Dari, anything on your mind before I jump in?

1092
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,722
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.

1093
01:04:28,022 --> 01:04:29,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a lot on my mind.

1094
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,012
[SPEAKER_09]: This year is my 12th year on the commission.

1095
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:53,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoy what we do in helping the city and I enjoy my other two commissioners, but what I'd like to do is I wish to stay on the commission, but I want to

1096
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: put up the chair, either to Bobby or Ben, and see which one of you would like to take over with the new fiscal year after this month.

1097
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:10,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm staying on, but I'd like to turn the chair over

1098
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,401
[SPEAKER_09]: to either my two fellow commissioners.

1099
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:16,084
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some logic there.

1100
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:25,675
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, I retired after 42 years as a banker, and we've been doing retirement stuff, and we've been going back and forth to Florida, and I don't ever want to

1101
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:38,799
[SPEAKER_09]: um, jeopardize the city or this commission by, you know, being somewhere traveling is something enjoying my retirement and, and you go, geez, the chair is not even going to make this meeting.

1102
01:05:38,859 --> 01:05:43,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think, again, I don't think it's fair to the commission into the city.

1103
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:55,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, Ben, Bobby, I, uh, I make a motion that either one of you, you're both very smart and talented and, and you're up on, uh, one 38 and you're out and you ask it very,

1104
01:05:56,383 --> 01:06:02,686
[SPEAKER_09]: insightful questions, but I would like to offer either one of you the chair.

1105
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:06,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Ben, Bobby, any thoughts or comments?

1106
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:25,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I may, you know, as the second ranking time person here, you know, just a second, you know, I think, you know, when I appreciate you being the chair, Alan, big shoes to fill with Jim leaving.

1107
01:06:26,155 --> 01:06:29,017
[SPEAKER_10]: You've done a great job and been committed.

1108
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:30,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So do appreciate that.

1109
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:36,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, and I also was sworn in last night for another six years.

1110
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:37,061
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm here.

1111
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:46,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think with my current life of three little kids and running my business that I wouldn't be the best fit for the chair.

1112
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:52,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking about arm wrestling Bobby for it, but he may win on that one.

1113
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1114
01:06:54,433 --> 01:07:04,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, so but in real reality, I think, you know, you know, and Bob, Bobby is newer, but has just become such an expert and is so diligent with

1115
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:08,227
[SPEAKER_10]: with really a lot of things, and we all know that.

1116
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:22,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I would like to weigh in that I would definitely feel very confident in Commissioner Delfano being the new chair as you are stepping down.

1117
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:26,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my just opinion on the matter.

1118
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:27,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ben.

1119
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1120
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You're, you're, you're spot on with all your points.

1121
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:38,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Commissioner Delifano, the, uh, what say you, are you, are you up for, uh, the chair position?

1122
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:45,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, um, I don't know when Ben had them sunglasses on a minute ago, he looked like he should have been in the movies.

1123
01:07:46,673 --> 01:07:50,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just like, wow, where's he been all these years?

1124
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,172
[SPEAKER_08]: But you always go back.

1125
01:07:56,612 --> 01:07:57,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that, that's awesome.

1126
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:01,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know about the arm wrestling, Ben.

1127
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:05,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you got it all over me in that department at this stage of the game.

1128
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,422
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would be honored to accept the chair.

1129
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:11,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the time.

1130
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:17,148
[SPEAKER_08]: You two gentlemen, like Ben said, Alan, you stepped up when Jim retired.

1131
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:18,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't an easy position.

1132
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:25,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I just filled in one week when you weren't here and it isn't quite as easy as it looks.

1133
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ben had done it a couple of times and he did a great job.

1134
01:08:30,615 --> 01:08:32,016
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have the time.

1135
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:40,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I am somewhat familiar with 138 where I was in the liquor business many years ago, the sales rep.

1136
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,823
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, that's kind of how, like, I understand it a little, but we all bring something to the table.

1137
01:08:46,243 --> 01:08:55,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, Ben, you've got the, the, uh, construction, uh, knowledge, uh, and, and Alan, you've got the, uh, financial financing and stuff.

1138
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:58,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I've got a little bit of the ABCC stuff.

1139
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:00,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're a great team.

1140
01:09:00,413 --> 01:09:03,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, Daria, she just holds it all together.

1141
01:09:03,535 --> 01:09:05,076
[SPEAKER_08]: She makes us all look really good.

1142
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:08,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, um, I really enjoyed talking with Daria and

1143
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:12,044
[SPEAKER_08]: working with Daria, we seem to work fine together.

1144
01:09:12,785 --> 01:09:16,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be a good fit for the commission and I'd be honored to accept the chair.

1145
01:09:16,893 --> 01:09:17,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1146
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:21,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, I'll make a motion to

1147
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:32,918
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, appoint, uh, Commissioner Bobby Delafano as the- the new chair of the Licensing Commission, um, starting September, right?

1148
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, uh, oh, no, at the end of this- the end of this month, right, Darren?

1149
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:39,102
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the- the fiscal year ends in June, right?

1150
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:39,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1151
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1152
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:40,583
[SPEAKER_09]: June 30th, yeah.

1153
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:41,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1154
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:43,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So the beginning of the next city fiscal year.

1155
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:47,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, you wanna second?

1156
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I- I'll- I'll second that motion.

1157
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:51,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Gladly.

1158
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:52,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1159
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:52,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1160
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:53,689
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1161
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So all in favor say aye.

1162
01:09:56,715 --> 01:09:56,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1163
01:09:57,597 --> 01:09:58,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1164
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:00,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations, Bobby.

1165
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:11,637
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been great to work with and I'm just in awe at your knowledge and it's gonna be a lot of fun, a lot of fun.

1166
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:13,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations, sir.

1167
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:15,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one last item.

1168
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:22,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that control compliance checks were done throughout the city.

1169
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:32,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that everybody passed and we don't have any incidents.

1170
01:10:33,068 --> 01:10:41,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I know in the past we've always had at least one, which isn't bad when you think about how many package stores and restaurants and

1171
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:46,058
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, how many vendors or entities are out there.

1172
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:59,982
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, and this will be, Bobby will be the chair, but in the past we've had separate hearings for if a violate, if we've come across a violation.

1173
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:08,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember that some of them used to go 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes.

1174
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,625
[SPEAKER_09]: And it depended on the severity and depended on

1175
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:14,227
[SPEAKER_09]: who it was that committed the infraction.

1176
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:33,823
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess what I'm driving at is we'll find out if anyone failed the control compliance checks, and that's something that we have to think about in September when we come back and we're up and running again, and how we want to handle them, whether we want to

1177
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:45,889
[SPEAKER_09]: have a separate hearing for them, or do we ask Daria that we'll do one at a time, or I'm hoping it's none at a time, but sometimes we get-

1178
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're not fully sure how many in total.

1179
01:11:55,776 --> 01:12:02,637
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an idea of how many have not passed, but we're not completely sure.

1180
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:18,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll just kind of hang on until September when we see the final number, and then we can figure out how we want to address them, whether we want to do them on a Wednesday with a regular meeting, or we want to have a separate.

1181
01:12:18,341 --> 01:12:21,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, the three of us will come up with

1182
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:29,409
[SPEAKER_09]: something that will work for the city, for the commission, and for any of the entities that committed the infractions.

1183
01:12:30,411 --> 01:12:31,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound like a plan or no?

1184
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1185
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that sounds good.

1186
01:12:35,861 --> 01:12:50,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if even if we need to discuss this, we can legally as long as if there are any issues, we don't mention who the issues are, what licenses they were.

1187
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We can just talk in general that

1188
01:12:53,614 --> 01:13:15,297
[SPEAKER_08]: okay the city had several infractions and and this is how we're going to handle it uh why don't we start in September and we can set up this this and this we'll meet with Lieutenant Lockowitz and they and the other two officers and uh and and not discuss any names of any businesses but just what the best course of action is because I I've never

1189
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:16,418
[SPEAKER_08]: been involved.

1190
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:21,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan and Ben, both in the area, have all been involved with it before.

1191
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:24,545
[SPEAKER_08]: But since I've been on the commission, I haven't been involved.

1192
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:38,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really don't know the procedure, you know, to a T. I wouldn't feel comfortable even, you know, fining somebody or suspending somebody unless I really felt good about knowing what to do, you know.

1193
01:13:39,478 --> 01:13:39,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1194
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:44,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, like I said, it's OK that we talk about it as long as we don't mention any names.

1195
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:44,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1196
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:45,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1197
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1198
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,000
[SPEAKER_09]: No decisions.

1199
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,141
[SPEAKER_09]: No rulings.

1200
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:50,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Just table it for now then.

1201
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:51,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1202
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:51,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1203
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:54,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Just until we see the full report.

1204
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:57,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, we'll come back.

1205
01:13:57,522 --> 01:13:59,142
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back up and running in September.

1206
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:01,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it for me.

[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you want to share with us?

1210
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,591
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, nothing fun.

1211
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:15,213
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, cool.
