1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:01,292
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:02,692
Good to see you all.

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,194
Technology is wonderful when it works.

4
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,094
I always say this.

5
00:00:06,394 --> 00:00:09,556
I had a little trouble getting in.

6
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,577
Amory's like, no, no, do this.

7
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:12,257
Try that.

8
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,078
But we got it done.

9
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:14,918
We got it done.

10
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:20,361
So I don't know why this time it was different from the other 18 million times I've done Zoom.

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,402
That's technology.

12
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:27,224
OK, so yeah, crazy, Bobby.

13
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:27,844
It's crazy.

14
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:31,586
OK, so let's start.

15
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:33,446
Let's see 104.

16
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:34,867
We'll start the meeting.

17
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:41,009
We always try to do some housekeeping things before we jump into the actual agenda.

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,012
The approval of the minutes for the May 15th, 2024.

19
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,514
Daria, how are we doing with that?

20
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:53,496
Do we have them or will they be coming to us at a later date?

21
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,217
Yes, they will be coming to you at a later date.

22
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:57,038
Okay.

23
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:02,080
I know the last one we covered a lot of ground, so I know there was a lot of detailed information.

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,682
So, and I know you're really great at capturing all the nuances.

25
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:06,583
So, okay.

26
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:11,436
So we'll suspend the approval of the minutes for the May 15th meeting.

27
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:13,623
We'll push that to the next meeting.

28
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:19,497
I guess let's start in the order that's on the agenda.

29
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:25,263
A representative from D1 Soccer League will present two one-day license applications.

30
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,105
This one intrigued me.

31
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:28,726
Maybe that's why it was number one.

32
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:31,809
A soccer game and a music performance.

33
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,955
Gee, it'd be great if it was somebody really big, you know, like that

34
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:43,202
That woman who's been touring all around the country and Taylor Swift, that would be awesome.

35
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,384
Who do we have?

36
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:46,766
Is it George?

37
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,909
Paul George is my full name.

38
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,110
How are you, sir?

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:51,671
Thank you.

40
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:51,991
I'm well.

41
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:53,533
Thank you for jumping on.

42
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:56,114
As I said, this one intrigued us.

43
00:01:56,854 --> 00:02:06,639
So can you tell us a little more about the D1 Soccer League and what the ultimate goal is to have a music performance on top of a game?

44
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:12,962
So if you don't mind giving us a little background as to who you are, what the league is, and tell us a little more, please.

45
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,357
Sure.

46
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,198
So like I said, my name is Paul George.

47
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,840
I am the vice president of the D1 Soccer League.

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,500
We've been around for about 10 years.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,664
We played prior in the Everett Stadium, McDonnell Stadium, but we've been at the Hall-Miller Stadium for three years now.

50
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:36,126
We are a semi-pro soccer league, a bunch of college kids, retired professional players.

51
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,988
We've even had a couple of our young players made it on the professional level.

52
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:41,629
So we try to

53
00:02:43,407 --> 00:03:00,852
We try to create an environment where young kids or young players get a chance to have college players, college coaches come out and look at them and watch them play, as well as, like, professional players who have retired and they can't really keep up with the younger kids.

54
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,653
So it's that type of environment that we try to provide.

55
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:11,215
And trying to promote the league and bring it to the next level, we realized that we needed to bring in some level of entertainment.

56
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:12,816
to be part of it.

57
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:26,765
So this is what we're trying to do, bringing a couple of artists from... Well, I'm Haitian, so we bring in a couple of Haitian artists to, like, lure the fans in and try to, like, create this atmosphere for the players.

58
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,126
Very good.

59
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:29,827
Very good.

60
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:39,913
So... So it would be a game and then some kind of a music performance after the game, or was it before the game?

61
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,654
Like, kind of...

62
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:47,524
So what we do is, at times, we play music on our phones.

63
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,229
Last year, we had some DJs come in and play music for the fans.

64
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:59,078
But we're looking to do a halftime performance and maybe a 30-minute performance after the game.

65
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:00,564
I see.

66
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:01,465
I see.

67
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:07,509
And I do see the one-day applications.

68
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:14,854
Have you submitted any kind of drawings for us to show us where the performance is going to be?

69
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,155
Is it midfield?

70
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:17,215
Is it in the end zone?

71
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,557
Is it where the stands are?

72
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,059
I guess these were all the things that were going through my mind.

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,966
Ben, Bobby, my other two commissioners, if you have questions also, be my guest, jump in.

74
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,347
There is a sketch.

75
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,089
Yeah.

76
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,571
Which shows the bleachers and where the alcohol would be.

77
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:43,234
Is that right, Paul?

78
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:44,675
Yeah.

79
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,615
I tried to draw.

80
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:46,896
I'm not much of an artist.

81
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,978
I tried my very best to put a sketch together.

82
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,244
where it would be serving the alcohol.

83
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:58,127
But for the performance, it's two ideas that we have.

84
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:10,595
With the permission of the field or the person who's in charge of the stadium, we would bring a stage towards the middle.

85
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:17,719
We can build a stage toward the middle or we can build a stage towards the grass area.

86
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:27,819
We're not, I mean, we're planning on having a few hundred people there at the game, depending on how well the ticket sales are.

87
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,785
We have not really put together like a kind of plan where we would have that performance in place.

88
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:35,826
I see.

89
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:40,030
Bobby, any questions or thoughts on your end?

90
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,244
Yeah, same thing.

91
00:05:44,565 --> 00:06:02,756
I was kind of wondering where the performance was going to be taking place and, you know, what type of, I mean, Mr. Georges has said that possibly DJ in the past or what type of entertainment they're going to have.

92
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,138
One of my concerns is that

93
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,718
There's residents all around that area.

94
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,179
You've got the three high-rises for the towers.

95
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:21,723
You've got all those new apartment complexes over by Fulcanti Rink.

96
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:27,047
If the entertainment is kept at a decent level for volume and

97
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:39,710
kind of had to point the speakers away from the bleachers toward the river or toward the school, you know, that would be a little better for the residents, I would imagine.

98
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:49,776
But as far as the license application, the one-day license application, I do see an issue with it.

99
00:06:52,647 --> 00:07:03,115
One of them is you check the box that you are not a registered nonprofit, and you also check all alcohol.

100
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:07,758
You can't have all alcohol unless you are a registered nonprofit.

101
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,423
You can have wine and malt, but not all alcohol.

102
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:15,464
I do see the insurance.

103
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,425
I do see the insurances.

104
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,773
from April 26, 24 to October 26, 24.

105
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:27,897
So you have it for the dates.

106
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:40,528
Other than that, unless there's somebody else that would like to speak, you know, that might have anything to say on this, this one day license.

107
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:41,969
Other than that, I,

108
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,580
I think I'm all set.

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,309
Like I said, I just wanted to know about what type of performance there is and the volume of the performance.

110
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,336
I can see that the hours, they don't go all that late anyways.

111
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,958
I think it only goes to eight o'clock.

112
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:02,318
Yeah.

113
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:06,223
So yeah, that's all I have to say.

114
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:07,625
Mr. Thank you.

115
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:09,647
I did see the diagram.

116
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:14,574
I see where where the the adult beverages, where the refreshments were going to be served.

117
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:18,058
So I saw that on the schematic there.

118
00:08:20,438 --> 00:08:25,041
And you're right, it's not going into the wee hours, as Nick would say.

119
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:30,223
So I'm kind of satisfied with that.

120
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:35,346
I don't know, because the one day licenses,

121
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:40,351
You know, as Bobby's correct, you can't have all alcohol.

122
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,412
It has to be beer and wine.

123
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:43,294
So we get that.

124
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,416
That's an easy tweak.

125
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,040
Daria, does the city have any concerns with

126
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:57,526
You know, because I remember there were times when if there's, oh, there's going to be 250 people there.

127
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,008
We want extra police details.

128
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:03,110
We want, if there's a stage, well, what kind of stage is there?

129
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:10,896
Is there any concerns from the city's point regarding the setup of the musical performance?

130
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,678
Like I said, the liquor side.

131
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,691
We see that's pretty straightforward.

132
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:23,272
It's just the logistic side for the music performance at Hormel Stadium.

133
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:26,413
Any thoughts or have you heard anything from the city?

134
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,893
Yes.

135
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:34,895
Kevin Bailey, who's the Recreation Department Director, he was going to jump on just for informational purposes.

136
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,185
he's unable to now.

137
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:47,329
Just notified last minute that he's unable to attend because there was an urgent issue at the task pool.

138
00:09:48,829 --> 00:10:04,858
Chief of staff asked me to ask you guys to postpone these two-day, one-day licenses requests till we have a special meeting, hopefully in July, so we can discuss it then with Kevin present.

139
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:07,853
Okay, that's interesting.

140
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:21,574
Like I said, I was wondering if there was something more, because anytime there's a stage and there's electrical lines, and if it rains, and so it's just all the logistics that go along with that part of it.

141
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:29,497
If that's the city's recommendation, Mr. Georges, we're not saying no.

142
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:41,202
We're going to table the request for the 17th and the 31st until the city can sit and put their heads together and think about it.

143
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,522
It's such a unique request.

144
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,303
That's why you were first on the agenda.

145
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,124
We'll figure it out.

146
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:59,510
Between the licensing commission in the city and all the different departments that will weigh in on this, we'll figure it out and we'll do our best to make this happen for you.

147
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,211
I see Ben.

148
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:02,791
Ben, go ahead.

149
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,532
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,613
Just a question I wanted to ask Mr. George.

151
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,755
Have you guys done this concept before with the game and with the music somewhere else?

152
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:11,509
Yes, we have.

153
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,792
So we put this together before.

154
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:22,559
Normally, we try to get a halftime show together or that's about like seven minutes long because the players got to get back on the field.

155
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,605
And then afterwards, we'll put in another like a 30-minute performance for the fans and then they would leave.

156
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,106
Did you make a stage?

157
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,906
Yeah, we built a small stage.

158
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:38,830
It's not a large stage per se, and it's towards to the side.

159
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,531
And it worked out pretty well.

160
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:42,272
What city?

161
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,373
Where was that at?

162
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:53,040
We've done it in Cambridge, and then we've done it in Everett, and also Somerville.

163
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:53,781
OK.

164
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,182
All right, thank you.

165
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,342
Yeah, that's good to know.

166
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:03,818
The only other thing, too, is you folks do hire police details, correct?

167
00:12:04,418 --> 00:12:10,680
So any event where we're serving alcohol, we'll definitely have a police detail.

168
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,521
It's just for safety purposes.

169
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:16,102
And we just think it's just better anyways.

170
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:17,223
Smart.

171
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,023
Smart.

172
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:18,303
Yeah.

173
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:20,844
Yeah, especially with this, you know, it's 600 people.

174
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,330
When it comes to our games, like I said, we've been doing this for a long time.

175
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,773
We've never had any major issues, wherever, like, violence or any fighting.

176
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:38,456
Our biggest concern that we've dealt with is, like, cleanup.

177
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:51,982
That's our issues that we've dealt with in the past, is after we have a large amount of fans and trying to get everybody to go home, and we would have to stay behind or come out the next day to claim.

178
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,721
That's our obstacle.

179
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:00,324
Yeah, it's a challenge, sure.

180
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:09,892
Daria, although the commission we take off July and August, that doesn't mean we vanish to Europe for those 60 days.

181
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:11,893
I mean, we're still around.

182
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:15,516
So there's nothing that says we cannot

183
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:24,040
have a quick zoom we posted to make sure the public's aware that we're having a quick zoom so we can resolve this for Mr. Georges.

184
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,943
I don't want you know because he's got two targets in August and I would like to get it resolved for him so he can

185
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:32,923
move forward.

186
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:37,786
There's nothing more frustrating than here and we're going to hold this and you got all the logistics.

187
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:49,293
I mean, I plan big events and small events and it's maddening because sometimes things don't come together until like the last five, seven, eight days before the event.

188
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,834
So I get it.

189
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:54,797
So Mr. Georges, I'm going to kind of step

190
00:13:55,417 --> 00:14:04,181
forward a bit, and I'm going to make a recommendation that we table this until the city can look into the logistics of it.

191
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:18,368
And then if Ben and Bobby don't mind, we can have a quick Zoom meeting in July and just give our opinions on what we hear from the city.

192
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:21,209
And hopefully we can make this happen for Mr. Georges.

193
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,210
Yeah.

194
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:24,918
I'm fine with that, Mr. Chairman.

195
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:25,598
Okay.

196
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:30,119
Yeah, and I would just say the sooner the better, so he can plan his event.

197
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,100
As you said, Alan, I know you agree.

198
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:41,581
And then just because it is going into summer and it's like everybody's got a million things going on and we can't just have these meetings moving all over the place.

199
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:42,321
At least I can't.

200
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:45,382
So I'll do my best to be available.

201
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:46,402
Okay.

202
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:47,302
Thank you.

203
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:48,002
Yeah.

204
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:48,242
Okay.

205
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,723
So Bobby, you second my motion?

206
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:52,663
Yeah, I'll second the motion.

207
00:14:53,119 --> 00:15:04,372
All right, so all in favor of tabling this until the city can investigate a little more or ask them more questions, and then we'll circle back in July.

208
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:05,453
Say aye.

209
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:05,533
Aye.

210
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,877
Okay, so motion carries.

211
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,979
Thank you, Mr. Georges.

212
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,679
It was intriguing.

213
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,279
That's why we put you first.

214
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,120
We've never seen something like this.

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Boy, I wish you could get Taylor Swift.

216
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,261
That would be incredible.

217
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:29,782
But we'll get back to you in July and give you a resolution on this request.

218
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:30,982
Awesome.

219
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,043
Thank you, guys.

220
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:33,123
Thank you, sir.

221
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:33,883
All right.

222
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:34,063
Ciao.

223
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:39,716
Okay, let's see.

224
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:42,457
Method Brewing.

225
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:45,078
Hello, hello.

226
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:49,639
You're requesting two one-day license applications.

227
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:50,920
What do I see?

228
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,820
Event September 27th and September 28th.

229
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,521
Does that sound right?

230
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:56,581
Yep.

231
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:57,841
Okay.

232
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,622
So tell us a little about them.

233
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:20,863
uh so we've got two requests uh one is for the uh there's a music i've got to work out which dates which here um it's because we've got there's a music festival and then there's the run medford as well um i think that was the music festival on top of my head uh

234
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,884
And that's over the Hatshell.

235
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:35,391
It's been happening the last few years where, again, very similar setup to what we do with the Farmers Market Concerts, where I said it's a one-day music festival.

236
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,212
I think Russ Robar organizes.

237
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,633
He's got the Hatshell booked.

238
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,095
And yeah.

239
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:48,737
And the idea is, I think with that one is, if I'm getting the right one, unless I'm confusing myself, which is probably gonna happen.

240
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:54,841
And I think, yeah, so one of them might be, there might be a rain date on that, if it's the right one I'm thinking of.

241
00:16:55,862 --> 00:16:59,505
And again, where again, we've obviously put the Nile Colby on these point signs up.

242
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:04,888
I think you've got a map as well, which would be exactly the same spot we do stuff at the farmer's market as well.

243
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,630
Yep, yep.

244
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,458
No, you're getting good, real good at this, Nick.

245
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,739
Real good at this.

246
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,520
We had a little bit of practice.

247
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,111
I don't have any questions.

248
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,471
I mean, we're very familiar with Medford Brewing.

249
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,552
You guys do outstanding work, outstanding service.

250
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,232
You follow all the rules.

251
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,393
No fighting.

252
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:36,154
I think as Mr. George was saying, we've never had an incident of people getting out of hand and fighting.

253
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,795
So I don't have any questions.

254
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:42,536
My other two colleagues, anything on your mind?

255
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:47,717
Any questions or concerns with this request for two one-day license applications?

256
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:52,679
I'm okay with it, Mr. Chairman.

257
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,820
I just have a quick question.

258
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,903
On those September 27th and 28th, those are two different events, correct?

259
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,814
Let me hang on my... It's Ron Medford still.

260
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,375
I think it just goes for two days.

261
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:07,517
Oh, OK.

262
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:07,937
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:08,358
Yeah.

264
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,139
Oh, yeah.

265
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:09,799
Let me correct.

266
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:12,483
Yeah, because my brain is a little bit addled now.

267
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:14,645
So that one actually is the Ron Medford.

268
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,208
So that one where one of the events.

269
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,651
So that's that's the David McGillivray event.

270
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:23,994
where we're actually technically the beer sponsor.

271
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:41,045
I think I mentioned last mass meeting where so for the run itself we are not charging for beer that is basically that's included in the admission to the run itself where it sponsors and they've got two events going for that

272
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:46,509
where I think one of them we might potentially be actually selling is more of a make sure we're covered.

273
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,652
We did it last year with them, where we had one day where we were actually selling beer.

274
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:52,773
Actually, I think it was at Hormel.

275
00:18:53,894 --> 00:19:00,759
But in truth, it was so poorly attended by beer drinkers that we probably wouldn't do it again.

276
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,562
But I have to say, we'll do it just to be nice to run Medford.

277
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:07,224
OK.

278
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:07,984
OK.

279
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:09,605
OK, that answered my question.

280
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:10,226
Yeah.

281
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:17,206
But either one of my fellow commissioners want to make a motion, that would be great.

282
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,988
Yeah, I'm also good with these, Nick.

283
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,129
So I can make a motion, you guys.

284
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:40,477
So I'll make a motion to approve the two one-day licenses, first for the music festivals, September 15th, at the Condon show, and for the Run Medford community events, September 27th,

285
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:50,122
and the 28th at Hormel, and then the 28th at Mentor City Hall for these requests.

286
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:52,844
I'll second that motion.

287
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:54,652
Very good.

288
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,953
Thank you, Bobby.

289
00:19:55,973 --> 00:19:56,553
Thank you, Ben.

290
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:02,136
All in favor of moving forward on the two one-day licenses, say aye.

291
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:02,776
Aye.

292
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:02,936
Aye.

293
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:04,057
Very good.

294
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:04,937
Thank you.

295
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:05,397
Thank you.

296
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:07,818
Nick, you're all set.

297
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:08,459
Best of luck.

298
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,379
No rain, right?

299
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:09,939
No rain?

300
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:10,479
No.

301
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,260
All right.

302
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,241
Thank you, sir.

303
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:13,981
Thank you.

304
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:14,561
Have a great one.

305
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:15,241
See you, sir.

306
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,042
All right.

307
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:16,142
Ciao.

308
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:16,942
Thanks.

309
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:17,282
Thank you, Nick.

310
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:17,703
Good luck.

311
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:18,503
See you, guys.

312
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:22,936
Well, let's take the next one, event them.

313
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:31,440
They're requesting a one-day license application for June 28th.

314
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,101
Let's see.

315
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:35,942
Boom, boom.

316
00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:36,623
There I am.

317
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:37,203
There he is.

318
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,384
How are you, sir?

319
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:39,584
Good afternoon, everybody.

320
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:40,084
Good to see you.

321
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,005
Good to see you.

322
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,220
Tell us about the event.

323
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:47,022
You're a regular too, so tell us about the event.

324
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:48,483
We actually have two.

325
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,404
There's the event, they're both at Eventham Studios.

326
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:58,227
We have the Friday, August, sorry, Friday, June 28th.

327
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:03,790
It's basically a copy and paste of the Sunday gaming events that we've done at the studios.

328
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,251
And we're doing one on a Friday night.

329
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,292
Just there's been interest on doing

330
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,613
them on a night one.

331
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:19,078
So we're going to incorporate the occasional night gaming night there as well with the FIFA tournament as the feature for it.

332
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,841
That is the one on Friday the 28th.

333
00:21:24,961 --> 00:21:28,423
The 29th is once again a collaboration with JJ Gonson.

334
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,724
You should have that application as well.

335
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:37,228
Essentially a copy and paste of the performances that we've done at the studios as well.

336
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,916
Yeah, I see both of those.

337
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:42,397
Yeah.

338
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:43,558
Thank you, Brian.

339
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:43,958
Yeah.

340
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,183
Yep, they both look fine to me.

341
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:51,385
I checked a little earlier.

342
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:53,247
Everything looks good as usual.

343
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:53,828
Yeah.

344
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,250
Yeah.

345
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:01,356
Yeah, we have the insurance.

346
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:03,377
Daria, we have the insurance on file.

347
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:06,040
I don't know if I saw that in the PDF.

348
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,580
Yeah, I do.

349
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeah.

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,721
OK, good.

351
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:08,301
All right.

352
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,543
Yeah, we have an updated one, actually.

353
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,285
So I can send that as well, Daria.

354
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:13,506
OK.

355
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,948
We just did a renewal.

356
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,470
So I'll send you this one.

357
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,390
Thank you.

358
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,152
It's just always good to have that on file so we don't have to bug you.

359
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:22,813
All right.

360
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:23,313
Absolutely.

361
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:26,835
Ben, Bobby, I don't have any questions for Brian.

362
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,256
Do you want to make a motion?

363
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:34,498
Yeah, I can make a motion if you like.

364
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:38,980
Maybe we should do two different motions where it's two different events.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,940
Two different days, Sean?

366
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:48,883
Well, two different people, JJ Gonson and Yvette.

367
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:52,925
I guess the first one, we can make a motion to grant the one-day license

368
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,163
for June 29th, 6 p.m.

369
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,144
to 10 p.m.

370
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:01,966
to J.J.

371
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:05,708
Gonson being held at Event Them on Salem Street.

372
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,251
Very good.

373
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:13,974
I'll second that motion.

374
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:14,894
Thank you, Ben.

375
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,215
Thank you, Bobby.

376
00:23:16,515 --> 00:23:20,098
All in favor of moving forward with the one-day license request say aye.

377
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:21,042
Hi.

378
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:22,103
Very good.

379
00:23:22,463 --> 00:23:23,804
That one's done.

380
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,547
If you want, I can make a motion for the second one.

381
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:28,668
Yeah, let's do.

382
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:48,263
I'll make a motion to grant a one-day license to the type of event, FIFA video game event to Brian at Event Them, 344 Salem Street for the hours of 5 to 9.30 PM.

383
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,125
Very good.

384
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,506
Ben, you want to 2nd that and I will 2nd that.

385
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:56,907
All right.

386
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,568
All right.

387
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,530
So, all in favor of approving that 1 day license say, I very good.

388
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,311
That 1 carries to.

389
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:07,772
Brian, you're, you're all set with both events.

390
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:08,653
Thank you very much.

391
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,333
Thank you very much.

392
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,515
I have 1 follow up question.

393
00:24:14,026 --> 00:24:24,729
Um, I, I, I wasn't, I wasn't aware that you, uh, that the committee takes July and August off for decades.

394
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:25,929
I knew it was August.

395
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:27,250
I wasn't sure about July.

396
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,412
Um, so we actually, August 22nd, I hadn't sent that application in, um,

397
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:43,946
Or basically another collaboration with J. J. it's on a Thursday, August, 22nd, and I still submit that application.

398
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:51,635
Submit it and see what happens kind of yeah, I, I would submit it and if we're going to.

399
00:24:55,207 --> 00:25:01,653
rule on Mr. George's request that Hormel, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone.

400
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:02,694
Maybe I shouldn't be saying that.

401
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:03,835
That's not nice to say anymore.

402
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,518
But Bobby, Ben, what do you think, you know, if we could do two?

403
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:08,298
Yeah, that's fine with me.

404
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:08,559
Yeah.

405
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:09,079
OK.

406
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,259
That was really reasonable.

407
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,881
It's the same thing as the event.

408
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:15,741
It's essentially the same thing as the 29th.

409
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:16,342
OK.

410
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,322
Same collaboration, same thing with JJ.

411
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:21,484
So just setting forth the expectations.

412
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:26,486
And Brian, it's not that, oh, the commission's a bunch of prima donnas.

413
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:27,626
They don't want to work in the summer.

414
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:27,786
No.

415
00:25:28,086 --> 00:25:32,248
But I always try to explain to people that people take vacations.

416
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:37,651
And the fire chief, the police chief, everyone takes vacations in those months.

417
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:46,176
And sometimes it's impossible to get things done because everyone is going to be on holiday, including the commissioners, too.

418
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:48,317
We have to take our vacations, too.

419
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:53,780
So logistically, it was always hard to get anything done in those two months.

420
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:01,204
And that was the impetus as to why, eons ago, the licensing commission started taking off those two months.

421
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,447
Yeah, not a problem at all.

422
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:06,971
I just wanted to, I just, I wasn't sure.

423
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:08,632
Okay, cool.

424
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:09,433
All right.

425
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:11,095
Thank you, sir.

426
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:12,917
You all have a great afternoon.

427
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:13,458
Thank you so much.

428
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:14,419
See you, Brian.

429
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,060
Thank you.

430
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,260
Yeah.

431
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:22,589
Mr. Sandoval, we're going to skip over you.

432
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:25,472
We're on a roll with the one-day license application.

433
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:33,858
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to jump over to the Riverside Yacht Club, and then we'll circle back to you if you don't mind.

434
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,363
And then we'll have one more from the Frisbee Group.

435
00:26:40,084 --> 00:26:40,344
OK.

436
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:40,964
Yeah.

437
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:41,405
OK.

438
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:47,590
So let's address the Riverside Yacht Club, their one-day license application request.

439
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:51,371
How you doing?

440
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,552
I'm Michael from Riverside Yacht Club.

441
00:26:53,972 --> 00:26:54,712
How are you, Michael?

442
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:56,193
I'm the Vice Commodore.

443
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:59,974
We're just having a little social event on September 7th.

444
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:05,236
It's just basically an end of the year get together, you know.

445
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:13,940
We're not expecting a big crowd or anything, maybe 50 people, and a gentleman offered to bring his band.

446
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,021
So I put in for the application.

447
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,982
We're looking to put them on the back deck.

448
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:22,524
And that's about it.

449
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:26,546
Like I said, it's nothing really elaborate or anything.

450
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:31,349
It's just a little get together and he offered to play for us.

451
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:32,670
So here I am.

452
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,130
Yeah.

453
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,091
An application.

454
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:39,533
We do have an entertainment license, but that's for devices only, so.

455
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:43,075
And that doesn't cover the actual deck too.

456
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:43,536
Correct.

457
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:43,716
Yeah.

458
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:44,656
Right, right.

459
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,458
Tell me, how late will the event go?

460
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:52,309
It's only like, I put down five to 11, but it's like six to 10.

461
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,934
I put a couple extra hours in for setting up and cleaning up and stuff like that.

462
00:27:56,994 --> 00:28:01,278
I mean, I don't see it going much later than 10 o'clock anyways.

463
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:03,220
I mean, we're an older crowd.

464
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,463
We have very few young guys down there.

465
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,545
So it's pretty low key.

466
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,327
And like I said, he off it.

467
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:14,714
Yeah.

468
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:25,699
When the request came in, that was my only concern about how late would it go in the evening and neighbors complaining, that's all.

469
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,661
That's also why I put in the application.

470
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:30,222
The neighbors are pretty good.

471
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:30,922
They're nice.

472
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:32,563
We get along very well with them.

473
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:38,926
We try to accommodate them as best we can or exactly as much as we can.

474
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:39,986
Yeah.

475
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:41,647
Okay.

476
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,638
Bobby, Ben, any questions to Mike?

477
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,581
I guess it's a question to the Commissioner.

478
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:53,123
The all alcohol, so it's an all alcohol, is it?

479
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,304
That wine and malt?

480
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,266
You need to clarify that, Bobby?

481
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:57,987
Yes.

482
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:09,211
If they're a registered non-profit, which Michael checked yes, they can have an all-alcohol one-day license.

483
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:14,753
If they're not a registered non-profit, they can only have wine and malt.

484
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:19,335
Did Mr. Georges, his had non-profit too though.

485
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:24,819
His did not have non-profit, I believe, if we look at it.

486
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,340
Oh, no, he's not a non-profit.

487
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:28,041
Right.

488
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,462
Maybe I'm looking at too many of them next time.

489
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:35,366
No, that was one of the tweaks we will address, because he's not a non-profit.

490
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:40,789
So because he was checked off, he had all alcohol and wine and malt.

491
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,411
Yeah, he can't get all alcohol.

492
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,312
We'll make that correction in July.

493
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:45,792
Yeah.

494
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:46,493
Yeah.

495
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:48,254
No, not to go on to that.

496
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:49,955
No, I don't.

497
00:29:51,070 --> 00:30:01,417
I mean, whereas this is a fairly contained event, sometimes, Mike, we have like a diagram that shows like where things are happening.

498
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:08,602
That's like, well, we may, you know, I mean, this is, I'm familiar with the club a little bit, so.

499
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:14,046
Oh yeah, it's the clubhouse right off of 52 Ship Out.

500
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,388
And then on the back side is a deck.

501
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:18,629
Yeah, right.

502
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:19,770
And you walk down,

503
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,310
They can go down the gangplank to the boats.

504
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,173
I mean, I could draw a quick sketch on it and show you right now.

505
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:27,034
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:35,523
Or, or, you know, you can draw us a sketch because we always want to see a diagram for the file, or you could do Google Earth.

507
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:46,242
and take a snapshot of the location and with a marker, you could do some tweaking in there, whatever it takes.

508
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:50,184
We don't expect it to come from an engineer or an architect, nothing like that.

509
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:58,009
But we do want, because we are asking everybody, so we just want to be consistent with everybody.

510
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,053
Like I said, I can draw out a quick sketch and I can leave it with Daria if you like.

511
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:10,506
Yeah, she can share it with us after and we'll say pending that if that if everybody's okay with that.

512
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:13,727
I mean, that's we just do it right on the spot.

513
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:14,367
Yeah.

514
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:15,628
No, I agree, Ben.

515
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:16,328
It's a good point.

516
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,388
We've been asking everybody.

517
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:20,429
So let's be consistent.

518
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:23,890
I agree.

519
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,652
Do you think the bar would need to stay open until 11 or the bar can just be closed at 10 or?

520
00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:40,670
And they said, we're a private club and, uh, I mean, we could close the bar, but a lot of people could just go down to their boats.

521
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,474
I mean, they have refrigerators on the boat and get a beer.

522
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,035
Yeah.

523
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:49,197
So it doesn't really make it.

524
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:53,801
I have, um, I am tip certified and all that.

525
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:59,086
And I also have another gentleman that, uh, is tip certified that works on the house committee with me.

526
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:00,607
So, um,

527
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:05,422
I mean, we got more retired cops and state troopers down there.

528
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,783
We got the fire boaters parked right there at the bottom of the gangplank.

529
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:11,924
They're in and out of the bay.

530
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:13,844
Yeah, that we're not.

531
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:16,805
We know the bigger picture down there, Mike.

532
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:17,685
We agree.

533
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:20,946
I mean, the risk is minimal.

534
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,026
Yeah, no, we get it.

535
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:24,307
OK.

536
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,167
I don't have any other questions.

537
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,468
Bobby, Ben, if you want to make a motion.

538
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,031
Yeah, I can make a motion.

539
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,191
I'm good as well.

540
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:34,231
That sounds fine.

541
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:41,154
And then we'll just say submitting a diagram of it.

542
00:32:41,174 --> 00:32:43,735
And then we'll approve, you know, once you do that, we can approve it.

543
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:44,755
Yeah.

544
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:54,159
So I'll make a motion to accept the one day license for the Riverside Yacht Club for September 7th, 2024 for the event from 5pm to 11pm.

545
00:32:57,261 --> 00:33:03,383
PM as laid out by Mike Silvestro.

546
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,524
Is that Mike Silvestro?

547
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:06,785
Yep.

548
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:14,868
And just subject to Mike providing us a diagram of where the alcohol will be served in this event.

549
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:17,478
Great.

550
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:18,640
I'll second that motion.

551
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:19,602
Very good.

552
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:20,623
Thank you, Ben.

553
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:21,284
Thank you, Bobby.

554
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:30,699
I'll approve of the one day license for the Riverside Yacht Club for September 7th.

555
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,260
Say aye.

556
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:33,123
All right.

557
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:33,843
Okay.

558
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:34,344
Very good.

559
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:35,785
Mike, you're good.

560
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:37,486
Lots of fun.

561
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:39,007
I hope it's a successful event.

562
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,108
No rain, right?

563
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:41,930
No rain.

564
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,310
Thank you.

565
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,291
Good to see you.

566
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,653
I'll get that drawing to Gary as soon as possible.

567
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,093
Please.

568
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:46,573
Thank you.

569
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,114
All right.

570
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:47,854
Thank you very much.

571
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:48,835
Appreciate it.

572
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:49,596
Take care.

573
00:33:49,616 --> 00:33:49,776
Bye.

574
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:55,136
Gary, did you say there was one more one-day license?

575
00:33:56,037 --> 00:34:00,499
Yes, from the, oh my God, I can't think.

576
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,561
Glory, Boston Glory.

577
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:04,661
Okay, cool.

578
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:06,762
There's two of them, yeah?

579
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:07,563
Did I see two?

580
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:09,984
Yeah.

581
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:11,105
Two, I believe, yeah.

582
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:12,105
Yeah, okay.

583
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,267
Can you just grab the AD panel?

584
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:17,148
That's it, thank you.

585
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,319
Okay, I see them.

586
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,422
August 11th, right?

587
00:34:28,642 --> 00:34:29,402
Is that one of them?

588
00:34:29,422 --> 00:34:31,164
August 11th, July 27th, yep.

589
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,205
July 27th.

590
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,706
Okay, and who do we have?

591
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,588
Jay Tallerman.

592
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:38,109
Hello, Jay, how are you?

593
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:38,509
How are you?

594
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:39,430
Nice to see you again.

595
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,411
Good to see you again.

596
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,313
We're only gonna end up using one of them.

597
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:45,715
It's just that we don't know yet which round.

598
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:49,938
We are in first place in the division.

599
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:51,939
We're gonna be hosting a playoff game.

600
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:59,620
It's either going to be on the 27th or the 11th, so we won't be using both, but we thought it would be best just to get both licenses.

601
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,402
Okay.

602
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:02,382
Good.

603
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:06,805
This is exciting that you're in the playoffs, right?

604
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:07,305
Yeah.

605
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,467
We're sitting at seven and two.

606
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:12,088
We've beaten all of our rivals.

607
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:16,151
We're probably ranked number one in the whole league right now.

608
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:20,294
Rankings come out today, so it's a really good season so far.

609
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,312
Good, including the evil empire, right?

610
00:35:23,472 --> 00:35:25,395
Yeah, beat them last time.

611
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,818
Yeah, that was a big one.

612
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,741
There's something in the water around here.

613
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:29,121
I tell ya.

614
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:36,394
Well, we're very familiar with your organization, Jay.

615
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:41,036
You guys run a tight ship, no incidents, no problems.

616
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:45,397
As long as, Jerry, do we have the insurance on file?

617
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:50,759
Do we have, I know we have a schematic, because it's always the same.

618
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:52,660
So are we good with the insurance?

619
00:35:54,594 --> 00:35:58,817
There is a certificate of insurance on file that should be fine for the whole season.

620
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:02,400
I was going to say, I do have their insurance just in general.

621
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:03,922
Okay.

622
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,063
Has it expired?

623
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,644
No, it shouldn't be.

624
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,025
It should be for the whole season.

625
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,407
It should be good.

626
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:09,947
Perfect.

627
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:10,387
Okay.

628
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:15,652
Then Bobby, Ben, any questions or concerns for Jay?

629
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:18,655
No.

630
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:21,914
When will you know what date it is, Jay?

631
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:32,462
So we won't actually know until the last weekend of the season, which is the 20th and 21st.

632
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:41,369
If our two rivals, DC and New York, both lose one more game, then it's definitely going to be the 11th.

633
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:54,251
If they keep winning, then it's gonna come down to the last week of the season when we have a doubleheader in Canada that we have to win both games to lock in the 11th.

634
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:58,572
So we're hoping for the 11th, but we don't know for sure just yet.

635
00:36:59,433 --> 00:36:59,813
Okay.

636
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,553
So, yeah, no issues.

637
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:02,674
I think it all sounds good.

638
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,675
Daria, is that any problem with the paperwork of like since it's two dates?

639
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:11,417
No, I just think as long as they let us know which date they use.

640
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:12,157
Yep.

641
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:15,849
Okay, yeah, it's very similar.

642
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,570
The way I'm looking at it's very similar to when we get rain dates.

643
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,810
Look, we have one day and then a rain day.

644
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,491
So, yeah, in a way, that's kind of each other.

645
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,832
Yeah, then I have no more questions.

646
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,172
I have no issues with that.

647
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:27,692
I'm fine.

648
00:37:27,772 --> 00:37:28,252
I'm fine.

649
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:28,993
I'm good with this.

650
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:30,173
Okay, cool.

651
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:32,195
Yeah, I'm all set with it.

652
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:33,636
Everything looks good.

653
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:37,300
I'm familiar with Jason.

654
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,585
I mean, everything's been great the past couple of years, so I'm on board with it.

655
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,949
And yeah, we can, I can make a motion if you like.

656
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:47,990
Yeah, please.

657
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:54,035
Okay, I'll make a motion to grant a one day license for either July 27th,

658
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:01,149
or August 11th, depending upon how the playoffs turn out.

659
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:06,690
And that's for the Boston Glory.

660
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:12,591
And it will be from 11 a.m.

661
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,731
to 4 p.m.

662
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:14,832
on either date.

663
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,913
And the location will be Hormel Stadium.

664
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,139
Very good, Bobby.

665
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,660
I'll second the motion.

666
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,780
Thank you, Ben.

667
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:38,483
All in favor of approving the one-day license request for July 27th and August 11th for Boston Glory, say aye.

668
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:39,603
Aye.

669
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:41,163
Very good.

670
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:42,644
Approved.

671
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:43,964
Jay, good luck.

672
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:44,964
Thank you.

673
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:46,825
Give them hell.

674
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:48,065
We will.

675
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:48,805
Thanks so much.

676
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:49,465
Talk to you soon.

677
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:50,265
Aye.

678
00:38:50,446 --> 00:38:50,966
Thank you, sir.

679
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:51,886
Aye.

680
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:56,916
One last item.

681
00:38:56,936 --> 00:38:59,925
Novarro, there you are, you're on mute.

682
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:16,693
He's doing his best to try to get off mute.

683
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:18,834
Alan, I'm sorry to interrupt.

684
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:20,536
I think Kevin Bailey jumped on.

685
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:21,797
I see him on here.

686
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,379
I think we should probably let him know.

687
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:28,902
I don't know if he's aware that we were just going to do it in July with him.

688
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:31,944
I do see Kevin Bailey.

689
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:32,705
I don't see him.

690
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:35,387
But Navarro, how are you doing?

691
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,708
I still see you on mute.

692
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,953
I told you technology is wonderful when it works.

693
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,971
Yeah, he just said it.

694
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,794
There you go.

695
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:51,015
There you go.

696
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:52,476
Back to mute, Alvaro.

697
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:54,538
There we go.

698
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,319
Yep, done.

699
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:56,340
Good job.

700
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:58,041
Thank you all.

701
00:39:58,662 --> 00:39:59,342
Good to see you.

702
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:00,864
Good to see you again.

703
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:04,297
So it's excited.

704
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:06,759
Look, Alita is finally coming to fruition.

705
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:08,320
We're excited for you.

706
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,042
The Square, the community's excited for you.

707
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,824
Your El Tecuba is just wonderful.

708
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:16,566
I think you have the Midas touch, sir.

709
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,968
Yeah.

710
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:25,733
We're happy to be on the Square and keep investing, you know.

711
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,258
in the square, so.

712
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:32,841
Thank you for choosing MedBit for your businesses and helping the community.

713
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:42,067
Before we dive into the application, can you tell us the concept of what you're putting in, what it consists of, what you'll be serving?

714
00:40:43,228 --> 00:40:47,090
Can you paint us a picture of what LocalEat is going to be all about?

715
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,190
Sure.

716
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,151
It is a cafe.

717
00:40:54,862 --> 00:41:02,687
that we're going to be servicing pastry sandwiches and also small plates.

718
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:07,950
So we want people to be able to get, if they want, a glass of wine or if they want a cocktail.

719
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,733
That's what we're looking to do.

720
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:19,217
You know, tweak it a little bit in the afternoon, evening, so we can stay open and then have a little bit of

721
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:23,522
of different things on the inside.

722
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:28,644
So, you know, that's the idea that we want to do, the concept.

723
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:30,665
I see.

724
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:43,970
So, coffees, different types of coffees or... Just one line of coffees, but, you know, not too much of extent, but we're mixing with some...

725
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,076
some pastry sandwiches and some salads.

726
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:48,697
This is just the start of.

727
00:41:49,257 --> 00:42:02,405
And then also small place in different, not a specific region that needs to be, but we want to have like, you know, good food so you can also have it in the evening, also probably part of the day.

728
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:07,248
But that's what we're looking to do.

729
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:10,370
So hopefully it works out the idea that we have in mind.

730
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:11,330
Cool.

731
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,791
Cool.

732
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,072
Ben, Bobby, questions?

733
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:23,550
Before we jump into the application, like I said, I wanted an idea of what he's putting in.

734
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:29,296
I'm all for Medford Square being a destination.

735
00:42:30,517 --> 00:42:31,278
The more the merrier.

736
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:37,844
I'm so tired of hearing about Davis Square and Malden Square, and this is what we need.

737
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:47,090
Yeah, I know some, some, I think like last I don't remember if you did this last time people will give the menu.

738
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,610
That's why they actually do.

739
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:51,332
They usually do show us the menu.

740
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:51,772
No, really.

741
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,993
Yeah.

742
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:56,460
It's kind of like one of the things, because you sort of evaluate it.

743
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,044
But, I mean, from what you're explaining, and it's caffeine, it was coughed the Mystic Roaster, right?

744
00:43:03,224 --> 00:43:03,564
Right.

745
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:04,164
Yep.

746
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:11,129
So, I mean, you know, and I looked at the plan, and it's like, whatever, you know, 20 seats or something like that, or less, maybe.

747
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:17,692
And, I mean, it's, you know, I'm not, nothing is,

748
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,371
About about this is really, you know, seem like an issue to me.

749
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:23,712
So.

750
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:28,296
So, yeah, why don't we look into the to the actual application and yeah.

751
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:28,897
Yeah.

752
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:34,623
So we're, we're, we're great with the concept, but, but Ben is correct.

753
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:42,150
Usually we do want to see some type of a menu when 1 is drawn up a lot or if you don't mind.

754
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:52,416
submit one to the city so we have one for the file is, you know, what we were saying to the Riverside Yacht Club, we'd like a drawing because we want to be consistent with everybody.

755
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:57,678
We're trying to treat all the entities the same way so no one can say, well, why didn't you ask them?

756
00:43:57,818 --> 00:43:58,699
You didn't ask them.

757
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,940
So we're just trying to be consistent.

758
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,743
So when you do have one, you know, if you could get it over the diary so we can put it in your folder, that would be great.

759
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:08,443
Okay.

760
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:11,585
So let's take a look at the application.

761
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:18,363
I saw Daria, you had sent us an updated version, correct?

762
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,444
Like the last few pages?

763
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:24,825
Bobby, did you see the updated version?

764
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:25,145
Yeah.

765
00:44:25,365 --> 00:44:26,646
What was the difference Daria?

766
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:27,826
Sorry, I missed that.

767
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:32,408
It was just small things like clicking no and yes.

768
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:34,608
That was just missing basically.

769
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:38,790
Then the biggest one was three months of,

770
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,073
Oh, my God, our bank statements.

771
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:42,933
There you go.

772
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:43,213
OK.

773
00:44:43,653 --> 00:44:43,873
So.

774
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:49,956
Yeah, we're trying, Laura, we're trying to do our best to help ABCC.

775
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:50,997
Sure.

776
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:56,979
What we don't want is we don't want them going, geez, so what are they still not over there in Medfit?

777
00:44:56,999 --> 00:45:01,481
So we we try to make sure that a completed packet is heading their way.

778
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:02,322
So yeah.

779
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:07,143
You know, so that's that we're not, you know, we're not being a pain.

780
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:20,347
It's just that, you know, kind of reflects on all of us, you and us, you know, if we're sending them an application that's not completed correctly, or their information is omitted, then, you know, they, like I said, they'll scratch their head and start asking questions.

781
00:45:20,987 --> 00:45:22,228
Oh, no, and I appreciate the.

782
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,914
Daria, that she's been helping me a lot.

783
00:45:26,535 --> 00:45:34,147
And all of you, I mean, this is the third one that I'm going to be applying in the city, besides in Somerville, so that I did it.

784
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:35,850
And they all have been very helpful.

785
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:37,753
And I understand the process.

786
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:38,875
OK, thank you.

787
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:45,793
I was curious, is that your business partner, Andres?

788
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,233
Yeah, that's my brother.

789
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:49,014
Your brother, yeah, yeah.

790
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:57,457
We both sell the notch and the brand itself, so now we're just trying to grow the business.

791
00:45:57,977 --> 00:45:58,537
Yeah, great.

792
00:45:59,157 --> 00:45:59,777
How's business?

793
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,438
It's doing good, can't complain.

794
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:07,840
Everything is going well, and having a different, especially in Metford,

795
00:46:08,762 --> 00:46:20,611
putting something that we, you know, being in Metford Square for a while now, for more than 12 years, yeah, just to see what the square is shaping, getting the shape and what needs, and the needs.

796
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:25,355
So we think it's just, you know, hopefully it works out.

797
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:33,221
We think that's a need, you know, for the community, not just for the community, for everyone who's passing by and then stopping by and then,

798
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:39,929
The same as the new place that we opened in Tacuba, we thought, you know, that's something that it will be a good fit.

799
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,950
And so far, it's been great.

800
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,151
So a lot of support.

801
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:48,013
So hopefully this one is going to go that way.

802
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:50,814
Tacuba is cool.

803
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,315
How's the outdoor part working out for you?

804
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:53,575
Good?

805
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:55,316
It's good.

806
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:57,097
We just kind of, as a matter of fact, we

807
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:08,068
off, officially open on Sunday, like some people were sitting, my brother just went in and then, seen a few tables, sit down, and then all of a sudden some people were just, you know, passing by and sitting.

808
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:12,751
We probably, by the end of the week, we hope to be like now announcing we open.

809
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,372
We want to see how it works with the layout of the inside.

810
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:20,015
Some people change, you know, the reserve, they want to move out, or how we're going to be,

811
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:22,182
you know, working on that.

812
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:22,883
But it's good.

813
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:23,783
Yeah, I know.

814
00:47:24,123 --> 00:47:26,524
I drove by and it looked completely false.

815
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:28,724
So again, you've got to touch.

816
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:30,665
Yeah.

817
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:33,126
All right.

818
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:34,606
So application.

819
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:39,128
Bobby, I've scanned through the new packet.

820
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:44,429
It kind of closes up the stuff from the first package.

821
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:46,450
Did you see any inconsistencies?

822
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:53,133
No, I went over it myself when we received the update.

823
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:54,094
It looks good.

824
00:47:55,235 --> 00:48:01,221
All of the issues seem to have been corrected.

825
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:13,202
The bank statements are on there, but if it's not satisfactory to the ABCC, the inspector will tell you, Alvaro, what you need to do.

826
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:24,767
They like to see that full amount on the statements, but you can deal with that with the ABCC inspector, and I'm sure it'll be taken care of.

827
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:26,727
Everything else, it looked fine to me.

828
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:29,748
You did a nice job on the application.

829
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:32,517
You did pretty well.

830
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:34,018
Thank you.

831
00:48:34,818 --> 00:48:34,918
Yeah.

832
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:35,319
You're welcome.

833
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:41,003
What was your target opening date on this?

834
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,224
We're working on it.

835
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:46,907
As a matter of fact, the Fire Alarm company just called me today.

836
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,508
They're pretty much about to wrap up.

837
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:53,311
I think they have to call, obviously, the inspection of services and so on.

838
00:48:53,592 --> 00:48:55,333
So it's all dependent on that.

839
00:48:55,413 --> 00:49:00,897
And then myself just going back to the health department to get what they need from us.

840
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:04,003
As soon as we can, I will say.

841
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:09,926
It's hard for me to put a date, because if something happens, I always move forward.

842
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:10,666
It's hard, yeah.

843
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:13,007
And we want to open as soon as we can.

844
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:13,547
That's for sure.

845
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:13,988
Yeah, cool.

846
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:16,569
OK.

847
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,869
I don't have any other concerns or questions.

848
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:30,953
I'm kind of going through the bank statements too.

849
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:34,456
May 1st, May 31st.

850
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:37,679
Okay.

851
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,345
I'm good with the updated corrections to the application.

852
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:48,570
Daria, I think you did a great job advising through the thing.

853
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,131
She's great.

854
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:53,372
I want to put it on record.

855
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:55,993
She's great.

856
00:49:57,634 --> 00:49:58,754
She really helped me a lot.

857
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:07,057
It's not easy because I know she has a pile of work and then she still find a way to really either send an email, like remind something that is missing.

858
00:50:08,278 --> 00:50:09,378
And it's really appreciated.

859
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,261
I know how difficult it is to deal with all those things, especially last minute.

860
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:25,439
Yeah, no, and I'm looking at the, you notified the abutters, I can see all the certified mail receipt.

861
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,482
I was on the city council agenda because Ben and I were, our commissions were being renewed.

862
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:40,085
And one of the hot, hot topics was the methadone clinic.

863
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:46,087
And so many of the neighbors got up and said that they were never notified.

864
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:48,068
They never got anything in the mail.

865
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:53,210
And so I was like, you know, what do you mean you didn't get anything in the mail?

866
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,672
So I said, do we have the

867
00:50:57,472 --> 00:51:01,853
you know, all the verification that the abutters had been notified.

868
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:03,334
And there they all are here.

869
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:07,395
So only, you know, like I said, I'm just, it's just going through my head.

870
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:08,915
So I'm good.

871
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:16,277
Bobby, Ben, you want to make a motion so we can help Elvaro move forward with Localita?

872
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,178
Would be great.

873
00:51:17,298 --> 00:51:22,599
I can't help you at Cuban Coffee, but I'm sure you'll figure something out, so.

874
00:51:22,919 --> 00:51:25,420
I can make a motion on that if you guys are okay with that.

875
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,006
Sure.

876
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:33,629
All right, so I will make a motion to grant the sorry.

877
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:48,896
I'm just sorry I just was clicking between this, this is the all, it's a beer and wine, or spirit wine and wine cordials and cordials yeah so the beer and wine and cordials.

878
00:51:50,764 --> 00:51:52,185
Okay, there we go.

879
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:59,330
New license for Localito LLC at 30 Riverside Ave.

880
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:09,036
When Alvaro has a menu available, please send it to the commission.

881
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:10,457
I will.

882
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:12,118
Thank you.

883
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:13,919
I'll keep that on the record.

884
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,600
Daria's great.

885
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,601
That's on the record already.

886
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:20,953
I think that's it.

887
00:52:21,034 --> 00:52:21,876
That's my motion.

888
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:22,999
Very good.

889
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:23,501
Thank you, Ben.

890
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:25,144
I'll second the motion.

891
00:52:25,505 --> 00:52:25,845
OK.

892
00:52:27,225 --> 00:52:32,087
All in favor of moving forward with this new application, say aye.

893
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:33,167
Aye.

894
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:34,008
Very good.

895
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:36,129
Navarro, you're good.

896
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:43,031
I was just looking to see how many licenses we have requests for beer, wine, and cordials.

897
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:46,453
If I'm reading the quota breakdown, it looks like there's four.

898
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:49,054
So you're going to snag one of the four.

899
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:51,194
So we'll have three left.

900
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:53,581
Good.

901
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:54,601
Thank you, sir.

902
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:55,562
Thank you for coming.

903
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:55,862
Thank you.

904
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,142
Best of luck.

905
00:52:57,763 --> 00:52:58,143
Thank you.

906
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:58,743
Thank you.

907
00:52:58,783 --> 00:52:59,083
Thank you.

908
00:52:59,103 --> 00:52:59,523
All of you.

909
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:00,704
All right.

910
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:01,384
I see you.

911
00:53:01,604 --> 00:53:02,044
I see you.

912
00:53:02,124 --> 00:53:03,385
All of you in the place.

913
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:04,465
Yeah.

914
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,426
When it's open.

915
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:05,966
Thank you.

916
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:06,546
When it's open.

917
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:06,946
Yes, sir.

918
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,967
Appreciate it.

919
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:09,247
Bye.

920
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:16,930
Bye.

921
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,150
I see Kevin.

922
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,531
Kevin, you're on mute.

923
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,341
Hi, how are you?

924
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:27,861
Good, good.

925
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:46,433
Kevin, what we decided to do with the soccer D, with the game and the musical performance, what we decided to do was put it on hold and let the city look into the logistics of the combined events.

926
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:51,635
And what we told Mr. Georges is that we would get back to him in July.

927
00:53:51,816 --> 00:53:56,778
Even though this commission takes off July and August, we don't have an issue with that.

928
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:01,781
We need to get together for 15 minutes and do a public Zoom or something like that.

929
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:03,422
So that was our thought.

930
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:05,663
So we'll give you guys ample time.

931
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:08,985
But he wants to do a couple of events in

932
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:10,385
August.

933
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:16,230
So we need to get an opinion to them.

934
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:24,676
I was saying I've done these big events and little events and there's nothing more frustrating where you don't know whether things are going to come together until a week before.

935
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:27,558
So if you can help us out, that would be great.

936
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:42,863
Yeah, I'll, I'll reach out to the organizer and also have our facility manager who oversees home out will probably set up a meeting with him and what his plans are for the alcohol permit and stuff and hopefully we can.

937
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:45,765
expedite that later on in July.

938
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:46,766
So I appreciate that.

939
00:54:47,086 --> 00:54:47,386
Thank you.

940
00:54:47,426 --> 00:54:47,807
Okay, cool.

941
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:54,333
And you know, on the surface, you know, it looks fine to us the you know, the one the one day requests.

942
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:55,654
So that looks fine.

943
00:54:55,674 --> 00:55:01,099
But it's just I am concerned about the other part of it, and how they all they meld together.

944
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:03,741
So so we'll resolve this farm in July.

945
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:04,302
Yeah.

946
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:05,243
Okay.

947
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:05,403
Cool.

948
00:55:05,423 --> 00:55:07,245
Thank you so much commissioners.

949
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:07,985
Thank you for having me.

950
00:55:08,285 --> 00:55:08,566
All right.

951
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,106
Thank you.

952
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:17,919
Gary, I think we, we have everybody if I'm looking at the agenda, I think we've.

953
00:55:18,499 --> 00:55:20,281
Taking care of all the requests.

954
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:21,402
Yes.

955
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:22,162
Yep.

956
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:22,583
Cool.

957
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:23,824
Okay.

958
00:55:24,605 --> 00:55:25,626
So, um.

959
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:37,236
Before we talk about any other business that may arise, I think you had some questions you wanted us to discuss the new proposed layout for the 1 day license application.

960
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:38,557
Yes.

961
00:55:39,097 --> 00:55:39,338
Okay.

962
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:46,441
So tell us how do you see it?

963
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:51,404
It's going to be all interactive and they can just type right into it.

964
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:54,746
Tell me more about what your vision is of that.

965
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:57,128
So I actually was Bobby's.

966
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:07,435
Bobby, remember he sent it to us after the last meeting, which I liked that he included payment because that was going to be easier to

967
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:11,737
Even though we have a lot of nonprofits, we still have some for profits.

968
00:56:12,878 --> 00:56:15,120
Some of them are really good about paying, some of them are not.

969
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,561
So we want to keep that on there.

970
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:28,270
So if they haven't paid and we know that's not checked off, I can follow up and say, you know, we can issue you, we cannot, for example, review this application until you pay us the fee first.

971
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:34,575
And it also has rain dates on there and it also has,

972
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:41,372
avoiding where it says, if you're not having the one day license event, let the commission know.

973
00:56:41,392 --> 00:56:47,699
But this way we can void it or whatever, you know?

974
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:58,030
Because a lot of people do do that where they tell me, oh, I didn't have this event, but we didn't know because we weren't notified, you know, till the moment when this person is like, oh yeah, I didn't have an event on that day.

975
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:00,132
So I think that's important.

976
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:01,733
Bobby, what else did you?

977
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:07,838
The application must be filled out completely.

978
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,360
Not applicable.

979
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,832
But other than that, yeah, it's not really one of those fill-in-your-own-forms.

980
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,713
I'm not that talented, Alan.

981
00:57:20,294 --> 00:57:21,615
Maybe you'll be able to take it.

982
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,516
No, I love those interactive forms.

983
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:26,318
Those interactive PDFs are great.

984
00:57:26,618 --> 00:57:27,559
Well, that's what I was going to say.

985
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,120
I can turn it into PDF.

986
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:34,523
It's just Word right now, just to have it at least drafted somewhat.

987
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,425
And then if we like what we see, I can turn it into PDF.

988
00:57:37,785 --> 00:57:39,106
I, I think that would be great.

989
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:44,710
You know, we, you know, I'm constantly reminded by all my nieces and nephews uncle Alan.

990
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:45,451
It's 2024.

991
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,893
So this is what I get from them all the time.

992
00:57:47,973 --> 00:57:51,896
So let's let's get the the word document together.

993
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,798
I Bobby I'd like to your recommendations and

994
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:07,933
I think let's adopt it, let's vote to adopt it and then when Daria has time, if she can convert it to a PDF so it can be interactive for the kids, that would be great.

995
00:58:07,953 --> 00:58:08,113
Yeah.

996
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:11,256
Yeah, that works.

997
00:58:11,336 --> 00:58:14,137
That way they could fill it out online and just submit it.

998
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:22,939
And, you know, even if they, it's like the ABCC, they have them fill it out online, print it, and then submit it to Daria.

999
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:36,162
They can do the same thing with this and submit their check with it at the same time, because there's a box at the bottom, fee with the line payable to City of Medford, payment to one day of application.

1000
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:40,364
So when they submit the application, there's a check for $60.

1001
00:58:41,324 --> 00:58:47,728
We don't have to chase, Daria doesn't have to chase people for money all the time and just make life a little easier, you know?

1002
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:48,929
No, it's smart.

1003
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:49,729
It's smart.

1004
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:50,950
I'm good.

1005
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,131
I'm in favor as well.

1006
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:59,775
No, no, that sounds making, you know, let's get up to, to the modern, you know, way of doing these things.

1007
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:00,715
Yeah, of course.

1008
00:59:00,935 --> 00:59:02,416
Yeah, no, definitely in favor of it.

1009
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:03,417
Cool.

1010
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:03,897
Okay.

1011
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:19,899
I was thinking of tying in something else with that, but I think it's better off in a separate form for caterers licenses, because they're required to notify us in the police department 48 hours in advance if they're going to have an event in the city.

1012
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,620
I mean, we don't have to approve it.

1013
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:26,905
We have jurisdiction there, but they're required to notify us.

1014
00:59:26,945 --> 00:59:29,187
So maybe we can just have a small one pager

1015
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:39,353
that if somebody calls the area or the police saying, well, look, we're notifying you, we're having an event that event them, like, you know, whatever.

1016
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:43,055
And it's sure there's a form you got to fill out, just email it back to us.

1017
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:43,655
You're all set.

1018
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:45,856
I mean, we don't have we don't have to sit.

1019
00:59:45,977 --> 00:59:50,299
It doesn't have to come before us or anything as long as the area gets notification.

1020
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,160
That's all we could get.

1021
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,220
Could that be done?

1022
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,141
You know, I'm thinking of

1023
00:59:56,308 --> 01:00:04,297
When I used to work, could that be done through the city website?

1024
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:07,720
Could we put language on the license commission in that section?

1025
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,661
Oh, yeah.

1026
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:09,923
Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:10,904
Do something there?

1028
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:11,525
Yeah.

1029
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:20,592
just let me know what you want and then I will have Lisa added, Lisa from our office to add it to the website.

1030
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:21,592
Okay.

1031
01:00:22,072 --> 01:00:29,015
So that's not- Bobby, I was just thinking, you know, in residential lending, we, you know, we, oh, let's have that.

1032
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,396
No, let's just put it on the website.

1033
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:36,679
So when they're looking at rates, they can see all the, you know, all the narrative that associated with the programs and rates.

1034
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,280
So we'll come up with something for you.

1035
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,001
Okay.

1036
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:46,284
So, okay, so do we need to make a motion to approve the.

1037
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:50,247
The application, I think so.

1038
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:50,488
Right.

1039
01:00:51,108 --> 01:00:56,652
I motion just revised application.

1040
01:00:56,852 --> 01:01:01,856
Yeah, I make a motion to revise the, the, the, the 1 day license application.

1041
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:04,338
That's my motion.

1042
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:07,329
I'll second it.

1043
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,010
Very good.

1044
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,391
All in favor, say aye.

1045
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:10,791
Aye.

1046
01:01:11,412 --> 01:01:11,532
Aye.

1047
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:12,352
Aye.

1048
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:21,058
So let's get that into print, and let's see if we can get it in a PDF, and let's start using it as soon as we can.

1049
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:21,699
Cool.

1050
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:27,646
Mr. Commissioner, can I ask you a quick question about just the last thing?

1051
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:28,967
Yeah.

1052
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:38,570
When Brian Bailey came on, he came on, but he was coming on to talk about the soccer event or give some insight.

1053
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,030
But we just didn't want to hear.

1054
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,432
I was just curious why we didn't want to hear from him now.

1055
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:51,414
I think because the other party has to be here to

1056
01:01:52,858 --> 01:02:03,380
Whatever the issues are, probably you want the other part to explain, you know what I mean?

1057
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,421
And I think, Ben, it's a good observation.

1058
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:14,483
I think by tabling the requests, now the pressure is off, so now they can kind of

1059
01:02:15,743 --> 01:02:21,186
look at it differently rather than under the gun in the last half hour.

1060
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:30,792
I think that's why we took the wind out of his sails by saying, look, we're going to hold this until July when you guys can all study it.

1061
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:32,173
I'm guessing that's what happened.

1062
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:35,154
They've never been in the city before, correct?

1063
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:36,615
Correct.

1064
01:02:36,675 --> 01:02:38,736
For the past three years.

1065
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,997
They have?

1066
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,393
Yeah, yeah, I have not done the not the music event, but no, no, no, not the music event.

1067
01:02:48,653 --> 01:02:49,293
Yeah.

1068
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:49,793
Yeah.

1069
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:50,194
Yeah.

1070
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:50,674
Yeah.

1071
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:51,514
Yes.

1072
01:02:51,694 --> 01:02:58,857
So my only comment on that, which was like a little, I don't know, disappointing or whatever you want to call it, but was that we have to have a special meeting now.

1073
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:09,422
For for a reason we are not aware of yet, I guess, and so it's sort of like I know it's all Brian was trying to get on the call, but it was it's.

1074
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:17,882
For the last three years, we really never end up taking any break from this and we have a lot of special meetings to sort of accommodate different things.

1075
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:25,250
So, you know, I always try to avoid that if we have to, because it's like a whole other thing to schedule.

1076
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:27,541
No.

1077
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:29,102
So that's my, I don't know.

1078
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:29,943
That's my comment.

1079
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:31,284
I get, I get it.

1080
01:03:31,324 --> 01:03:41,071
But rather than making, trying to make a decision today on that, when we didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle, I, I don't think that would be prudent for the, for us in the city.

1081
01:03:41,171 --> 01:03:49,777
So, and I agree, Ben, I don't like the idea that, you know, okay, July, August, but you know, we'll make it painless in July.

1082
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:56,499
Yeah, well, and also the guy needs to plan his event.

1083
01:03:56,619 --> 01:03:58,361
I mean, do you have to plan your event without it?

1084
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:09,069
I guess you do, but... The village was truly an emergency at the Tufts pool that happened that involved a child, so that's why Kevin couldn't come on time.

1085
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:11,971
I don't doubt that he had a legitimate reason.

1086
01:04:12,011 --> 01:04:12,831
Yeah, okay.

1087
01:04:13,192 --> 01:04:14,713
All right, that's my only thing.

1088
01:04:14,973 --> 01:04:16,914
I'll think about that.

1089
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:18,756
I get it.

1090
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,032
Okay, two last things.

1091
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:25,317
Dari, anything on your mind before I jump in?

1092
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,722
No, I don't think so.

1093
01:04:28,022 --> 01:04:29,185
I mean, I have a lot on my mind.

1094
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,012
This year is my 12th year on the commission.

1095
01:04:42,393 --> 01:04:53,059
I enjoy what we do in helping the city and I enjoy my other two commissioners, but what I'd like to do is I wish to stay on the commission, but I want to

1096
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:03,470
put up the chair, either to Bobby or Ben, and see which one of you would like to take over with the new fiscal year after this month.

1097
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:10,338
So I'm staying on, but I'd like to turn the chair over

1098
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,401
to either my two fellow commissioners.

1099
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:16,084
And there's some logic there.

1100
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:25,675
As you know, I retired after 42 years as a banker, and we've been doing retirement stuff, and we've been going back and forth to Florida, and I don't ever want to

1101
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:38,799
um, jeopardize the city or this commission by, you know, being somewhere traveling is something enjoying my retirement and, and you go, geez, the chair is not even going to make this meeting.

1102
01:05:38,859 --> 01:05:43,240
So I don't think, again, I don't think it's fair to the commission into the city.

1103
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:55,923
So, uh, Ben, Bobby, I, uh, I make a motion that either one of you, you're both very smart and talented and, and you're up on, uh, one 38 and you're out and you ask it very,

1104
01:05:56,383 --> 01:06:02,686
insightful questions, but I would like to offer either one of you the chair.

1105
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:06,427
So, Ben, Bobby, any thoughts or comments?

1106
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:25,375
Yeah, I may, you know, as the second ranking time person here, you know, just a second, you know, I think, you know, when I appreciate you being the chair, Alan, big shoes to fill with Jim leaving.

1107
01:06:26,155 --> 01:06:29,017
You've done a great job and been committed.

1108
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:30,217
So do appreciate that.

1109
01:06:31,918 --> 01:06:36,081
I think, you know, and I also was sworn in last night for another six years.

1110
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:37,061
So I'm here.

1111
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:46,887
I do think with my current life of three little kids and running my business that I wouldn't be the best fit for the chair.

1112
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:52,930
I was thinking about arm wrestling Bobby for it, but he may win on that one.

1113
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,112
I don't know.

1114
01:06:54,433 --> 01:07:04,868
Also, so but in real reality, I think, you know, you know, and Bob, Bobby is newer, but has just become such an expert and is so diligent with

1115
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:08,227
with really a lot of things, and we all know that.

1116
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:22,131
And so I would like to weigh in that I would definitely feel very confident in Commissioner Delfano being the new chair as you are stepping down.

1117
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:26,032
So that's my just opinion on the matter.

1118
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:27,378
Thank you, Ben.

1119
01:07:27,578 --> 01:07:27,898
Thank you.

1120
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,480
You're, you're, you're spot on with all your points.

1121
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:38,186
Um, Commissioner Delifano, the, uh, what say you, are you, are you up for, uh, the chair position?

1122
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:45,793
Well, um, I don't know when Ben had them sunglasses on a minute ago, he looked like he should have been in the movies.

1123
01:07:46,673 --> 01:07:50,596
It was just like, wow, where's he been all these years?

1124
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,172
But you always go back.

1125
01:07:56,612 --> 01:07:57,833
Look at that, that's awesome.

1126
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:01,816
And I don't know about the arm wrestling, Ben.

1127
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:05,639
I think you got it all over me in that department at this stage of the game.

1128
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,422
But I would be honored to accept the chair.

1129
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:11,164
I have the time.

1130
01:08:12,064 --> 01:08:17,148
You two gentlemen, like Ben said, Alan, you stepped up when Jim retired.

1131
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:18,689
It wasn't an easy position.

1132
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:25,493
I just filled in one week when you weren't here and it isn't quite as easy as it looks.

1133
01:08:26,553 --> 01:08:30,335
And Ben had done it a couple of times and he did a great job.

1134
01:08:30,615 --> 01:08:32,016
But I do have the time.

1135
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:40,280
I am somewhat familiar with 138 where I was in the liquor business many years ago, the sales rep.

1136
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,823
So, um, that's kind of how, like, I understand it a little, but we all bring something to the table.

1137
01:08:46,243 --> 01:08:55,109
Um, you know, Ben, you've got the, the, uh, construction, uh, knowledge, uh, and, and Alan, you've got the, uh, financial financing and stuff.

1138
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:58,511
And, you know, I've got a little bit of the ABCC stuff.

1139
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:00,332
So I think we're a great team.

1140
01:09:00,413 --> 01:09:03,474
And of course, Daria, she just holds it all together.

1141
01:09:03,535 --> 01:09:05,076
She makes us all look really good.

1142
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:08,858
So, I mean, um, I really enjoyed talking with Daria and

1143
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:12,044
working with Daria, we seem to work fine together.

1144
01:09:12,785 --> 01:09:16,552
I think it would be a good fit for the commission and I'd be honored to accept the chair.

1145
01:09:16,893 --> 01:09:17,414
Very good.

1146
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:21,442
Ben, I'll make a motion to

1147
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:32,918
uh, appoint, uh, Commissioner Bobby Delafano as the- the new chair of the Licensing Commission, um, starting September, right?

1148
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:37,221
Because, uh, oh, no, at the end of this- the end of this month, right, Darren?

1149
01:09:37,241 --> 01:09:39,102
It's the- the fiscal year ends in June, right?

1150
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:39,562
Yeah.

1151
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:39,743
Yeah.

1152
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:40,583
June 30th, yeah.

1153
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:41,063
Yeah.

1154
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:43,785
So the beginning of the next city fiscal year.

1155
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:47,008
Ben, you wanna second?

1156
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,630
I- I'll- I'll second that motion.

1157
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:51,766
Gladly.

1158
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:52,067
Yes.

1159
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:52,587
Yes.

1160
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:53,689
All right.

1161
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,593
So all in favor say aye.

1162
01:09:56,715 --> 01:09:56,855
Aye.

1163
01:09:57,597 --> 01:09:58,117
Aye.

1164
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:00,442
Congratulations, Bobby.

1165
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:11,637
You've been great to work with and I'm just in awe at your knowledge and it's gonna be a lot of fun, a lot of fun.

1166
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:13,799
So congratulations, sir.

1167
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:15,980
And then one last item.

1168
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:22,285
I understand that control compliance checks were done throughout the city.

1169
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:32,968
I'm hoping that everybody passed and we don't have any incidents.

1170
01:10:33,068 --> 01:10:41,976
I know in the past we've always had at least one, which isn't bad when you think about how many package stores and restaurants and

1171
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:46,058
you know, how many vendors or entities are out there.

1172
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:59,982
But I think, and this will be, Bobby will be the chair, but in the past we've had separate hearings for if a violate, if we've come across a violation.

1173
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:08,264
And I remember that some of them used to go 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes.

1174
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,625
And it depended on the severity and depended on

1175
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:14,227
who it was that committed the infraction.

1176
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:33,823
But I guess what I'm driving at is we'll find out if anyone failed the control compliance checks, and that's something that we have to think about in September when we come back and we're up and running again, and how we want to handle them, whether we want to

1177
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:45,889
have a separate hearing for them, or do we ask Daria that we'll do one at a time, or I'm hoping it's none at a time, but sometimes we get-

1178
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:55,756
Well, we're not fully sure how many in total.

1179
01:11:55,776 --> 01:12:02,637
We have an idea of how many have not passed, but we're not completely sure.

1180
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:18,301
So we'll just kind of hang on until September when we see the final number, and then we can figure out how we want to address them, whether we want to do them on a Wednesday with a regular meeting, or we want to have a separate.

1181
01:12:18,341 --> 01:12:21,502
Again, the three of us will come up with

1182
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:29,409
something that will work for the city, for the commission, and for any of the entities that committed the infractions.

1183
01:12:30,411 --> 01:12:31,653
Sound like a plan or no?

1184
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,260
Yes.

1185
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,621
Yeah, that sounds good.

1186
01:12:35,861 --> 01:12:50,912
And I think if even if we need to discuss this, we can legally as long as if there are any issues, we don't mention who the issues are, what licenses they were.

1187
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:52,954
We can just talk in general that

1188
01:12:53,614 --> 01:13:15,297
okay the city had several infractions and and this is how we're going to handle it uh why don't we start in September and we can set up this this and this we'll meet with Lieutenant Lockowitz and they and the other two officers and uh and and not discuss any names of any businesses but just what the best course of action is because I I've never

1189
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:16,418
been involved.

1190
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:21,682
Alan and Ben, both in the area, have all been involved with it before.

1191
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:24,545
But since I've been on the commission, I haven't been involved.

1192
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:38,978
So I really don't know the procedure, you know, to a T. I wouldn't feel comfortable even, you know, fining somebody or suspending somebody unless I really felt good about knowing what to do, you know.

1193
01:13:39,478 --> 01:13:39,759
Sure.

1194
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:44,300
And I think, like I said, it's OK that we talk about it as long as we don't mention any names.

1195
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:44,580
Yeah.

1196
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:45,580
Yeah.

1197
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,500
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,000
No decisions.

1199
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,141
No rulings.

1200
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:50,641
Just table it for now then.

1201
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:51,661
Yeah.

1202
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:51,881
Yeah.

1203
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:54,401
Just until we see the full report.

1204
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:57,082
And like I said, we'll come back.

1205
01:13:57,522 --> 01:13:59,142
We'll be back up and running in September.

1206
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:01,923
So that's it for me.

1207
01:14:02,023 --> 01:14:03,863
Dari, anything from you?

1208
01:14:03,883 --> 01:14:07,064
Any trips coming up?

1209
01:14:07,124 --> 01:14:08,444
Anything you want to share with us?

1210
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,591
No, no, nothing fun.

1211
01:14:13,272 --> 01:14:15,213
All right, cool.

1212
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:17,975
All right, so we have a motion to adjourn.

1213
01:14:23,078 --> 01:14:26,900
I'm going to make a motion to adjourn our meeting, our June meeting to 12 p.m.

1214
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,061
or to 18 p.m.

1215
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:30,222
Yeah, very good.

1216
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:31,223
I second.

1217
01:14:31,643 --> 01:14:32,183
Very good.

1218
01:14:32,243 --> 01:14:32,603
Thank you.

1219
01:14:32,623 --> 01:14:32,964
Thank you.

1220
01:14:33,024 --> 01:14:33,324
All right.

1221
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:34,925
So motion to adjourn to 18.

1222
01:14:35,025 --> 01:14:37,746
I know there was a lot to cover.

1223
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:41,168
And thank you for taking the notes.

1224
01:14:41,509 --> 01:14:42,933
And we'll be talking to you in July.

1225
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:43,595
Yes.

1226
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:44,016
Yep.

1227
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:44,658
Sounds good.

1228
01:14:44,759 --> 01:14:45,260
Thank you guys.

1229
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:46,183
Cool.

1230
01:14:46,203 --> 01:14:48,069
Thanks, everybody.

1231
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:48,892
Good to see you.

1232
01:14:48,912 --> 01:14:49,895
Congrats, Bobby.

1233
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:50,697
Okay.

1234
01:14:51,419 --> 01:14:51,921
Congrats.

1235
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:52,342
Hi.

1236
01:14:52,663 --> 01:14:52,944
Thank you.
