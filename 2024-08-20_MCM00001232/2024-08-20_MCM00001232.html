    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=0.311">Good</a>  afternoon, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1.332">Good</a>  to see you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3.293">Technology</a>  is wonderful when it works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=5.294">I</a>  always say this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=6.394">I</a>  had a little trouble getting in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=9.676">Amory's</a>  like, no, no, do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=11.677">Try</a>  that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=12.997">But</a>  we got it done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=14.278">We</a>  got it done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=14.978">So</a>  I don't know why this time it was different from the other 18 million times I've done Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=22.422">That's</a>  technology. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=24.063">OK,</a>  so yeah, crazy, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=27.264">It's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=29.225">OK,</a>  so let's start. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=31.726">Let's</a>  see 104. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=33.847">We'll</a>  start the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=36.848">We</a>  always try to do some housekeeping things before we jump into the actual agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=42.99">The</a>  approval of the minutes for the May 15th, 2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=47.713">Daria,</a>  how are we doing with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=49.554">Do</a>  we have them or will they be coming to us at a later date?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=53.836">Yes,</a>  they will be coming to you at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=56.497">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=57.078">I</a>  know the last one we covered a lot of ground, so I know there was a lot of detailed information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=62.18">So,</a>  and I know you're really great at capturing all the nuances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=65.722">So,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=66.983">So</a>  we'll suspend the approval of the minutes for the May 15th meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=71.476">We'll</a>  push that to the next meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=75.973">I</a>  guess let's start in the order that's on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=80.137">A</a>  representative from D1 Soccer League will present two one-day license applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=86.003">This</a>  one intrigued me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=87.165">Maybe</a>  that's why it was number one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=88.746">A</a>  soccer game and a music performance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=91.829">Gee,</a>  it'd be great if it was somebody really big, you know, like that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=97.395">That</a>  woman who's been touring all around the country and Taylor Swift, that would be awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=103.222">Who</a>  do we have? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=105.424">Is</a>  it George?</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=106.826">Paul</a>  George is my full name.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=110.35">How</a>  are you, sir? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=111.411">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=111.691">I'm</a>  well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=112.472">Thank</a>  you for jumping on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=114.533">As</a>  I said, this one intrigued us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=116.854">So</a>  can you tell us a little more about the D1 Soccer League and what the ultimate goal is to have a music performance on top of a game? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=126.699">So</a>  if you don't mind giving us a little background as to who you are, what the league is, and tell us a little more, please.</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=133.657">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=134.457">So</a>  like I said, my name is Paul George. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=136.318">I</a>  am the vice president of the D1 Soccer League. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=139.92">We've</a>  been around for about 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=141.86">We</a>  played prior in the Everett Stadium, McDonnell Stadium, but we've been at the Hall-Miller Stadium for three years now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=151.965">We</a>  are a semi-pro soccer league, a bunch of college kids, retired professional players. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=156.626">We've</a>  even had a couple of our young players made it on the professional level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=160.808">So</a>  we try to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=163.407">We</a>  try to create an environment where young kids or young players get a chance to have college players, college coaches come out and look at them and watch them play, as well as, like, professional players who have retired and they can't really keep up with the younger kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=180.892">So</a>  it's that type of environment that we try to provide. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=184.473">And</a>  trying to promote the league and bring it to the next level, we realized that we needed to bring in some level of entertainment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=192.055">to</a>  be part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=192.896">So</a>  this is what we're trying to do, bringing a couple of artists from... Well, I'm Haitian, so we bring in a couple of Haitian artists to, like, lure the fans in and try to, like, create this atmosphere for the players.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=208.626">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=209.306">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=210.487">So...</a>  So it would be a game and then some kind of a music performance after the game, or was it before the game? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=219.933">Like,</a>  kind of...</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=222.257">So</a>  what we do is, at times, we play music on our phones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=227.584">Last</a>  year, we had some DJs come in and play music for the fans. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=232.97">But</a>  we're looking to do a halftime performance and maybe a 30-minute performance after the game.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=240.144">I</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=241.085">I</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=243.046">And</a>  I do see the one-day applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=247.549">Have</a>  you submitted any kind of drawings for us to show us where the performance is going to be? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=254.914">Is</a>  it midfield? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=256.175">Is</a>  it in the end zone? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=257.275">Is</a>  it where the stands are? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=260.378">I</a>  guess these were all the things that were going through my mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=264.54">Ben,</a>  Bobby, my other two commissioners, if you have questions also, be my guest, jump in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=272.446">There</a>  is a sketch.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=274.788">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=276.909">Which</a>  shows the bleachers and where the alcohol would be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=279.591">Is</a>  that right, Paul?</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=283.734">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=284.875">I</a>  tried to draw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=285.635">I'm</a>  not much of an artist. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=286.976">I</a>  tried my very best to put a sketch together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=289.782">where</a>  it would be serving the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=292.684">But</a>  for the performance, it's two ideas that we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=298.928">With</a>  the permission of the field or the person who's in charge of the stadium, we would bring a stage towards the middle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=312.055">We</a>  can build a stage toward the middle or we can build a stage towards the grass area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=318.85">We're</a>  not, I mean, we're planning on having a few hundred people there at the game, depending on how well the ticket sales are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=328.7">We</a>  have not really put together like a kind of plan where we would have that performance in place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=335.446">I</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=337.688">Bobby,</a>  any questions or thoughts on your end?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=342.824">Yeah,</a>  same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=344.565">I</a>  was kind of wondering where the performance was going to be taking place and, you know, what type of, I mean, Mr. Georges has said that possibly DJ in the past or what type of entertainment they're going to have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=364.297">One</a>  of my concerns is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=368.456">There's</a>  residents all around that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=371.938">You've</a>  got the three high-rises for the towers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=374.259">You've</a>  got all those new apartment complexes over by Fulcanti Rink. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=382.444">If</a>  the entertainment is kept at a decent level for volume and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=389.023">kind</a>  of had to point the speakers away from the bleachers toward the river or toward the school, you know, that would be a little better for the residents, I would imagine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=399.77">But</a>  as far as the license application, the one-day license application, I do see an issue with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=412.647">One</a>  of them is you check the box that you are not a registered nonprofit, and you also check all alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=424.036">You</a>  can't have all alcohol unless you are a registered nonprofit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=428.379">You</a>  can have wine and malt, but not all alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=434.343">I</a>  do see the insurance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=436.024">I</a>  do see the insurances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=439.81">from</a>  April 26, 24 to October 26, 24. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=444.154">So</a>  you have it for the dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=448.718">Other</a>  than that, unless there's somebody else that would like to speak, you know, that might have anything to say on this, this one day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=461.229">Other</a>  than that, I, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=463.738">I</a>  think I'm all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=465.6">Like</a>  I said, I just wanted to know about what type of performance there is and the volume of the performance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=474.21">I</a>  can see that the hours, they don't go all that late anyways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=479.396">I</a>  think it only goes to eight o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=481.717">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=483.179">So</a>  yeah, that's all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=486.764">Mr.</a>  Thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=488.486">I</a>  did see the diagram. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=489.687">I</a>  see where where the the adult beverages, where the refreshments were going to be served. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=494.594">So</a>  I saw that on the schematic there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=500.438">And</a>  you're right, it's not going into the wee hours, as Nick would say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=505.061">So</a>  I'm kind of satisfied with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=510.244">I</a>  don't know, because the one day licenses, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=516.547">You</a>  know, as Bobby's correct, you can't have all alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=520.391">It</a>  has to be beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=521.472">So</a>  we get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=523.374">That's</a>  an easy tweak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=526.777">Daria,</a>  does the city have any concerns with <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=532.983">You</a>  know, because I remember there were times when if there's, oh, there's going to be 250 people there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=537.566">We</a>  want extra police details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=540.108">We</a>  want, if there's a stage, well, what kind of stage is there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=543.55">Is</a>  there any concerns from the city's point regarding the setup of the musical performance? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=551.436">Like</a>  I said, the liquor side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=555.29">We</a>  see that's pretty straightforward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=558.291">It's</a>  just the logistic side for the music performance at Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=564.032">Any</a>  thoughts or have you heard anything from the city?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=566.433">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=567.993">Kevin</a>  Bailey, who's the Recreation Department Director, he was going to jump on just for informational purposes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=578.144">he's</a>  unable to now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=582.706">Just</a>  notified last minute that he's unable to attend because there was an urgent issue at the task pool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=588.829">Chief</a>  of staff asked me to ask you guys to postpone these two-day, one-day licenses requests till we have a special meeting, hopefully in July, so we can discuss it then with Kevin present.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=606.551">Okay,</a>  that's interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=608.053">Like</a>  I said, I was wondering if there was something more, because anytime there's a stage and there's electrical lines, and if it rains, and so it's just all the logistics that go along with that part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=623.355">If</a>  that's the city's recommendation, Mr. Georges, we're not saying no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=629.818">We're</a>  going to table the request for the 17th and the 31st until the city can sit and put their heads together and think about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=641.242">It's</a>  such a unique request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=642.542">That's</a>  why you were first on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=646.203">We'll</a>  figure it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=648.184">Between</a>  the licensing commission in the city and all the different departments that will weigh in on this, we'll figure it out and we'll do our best to make this happen for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=661.171">I</a>  see Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=662.311">Ben,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=662.851">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=663.552">Just</a>  a question I wanted to ask Mr. George. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=666.113">Have</a>  you guys done this concept before with the game and with the music somewhere else?</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=670.868">Yes,</a>  we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=672.73">So</a>  we put this together before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=675.252">Normally,</a>  we try to get a halftime show together or that's about like seven minutes long because the players got to get back on the field. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=682.779">And</a>  then afterwards, we'll put in another like a 30-minute performance for the fans and then they would leave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=690.245">Did</a>  you make a stage? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=692.385">Yeah,</a>  we built a small stage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=693.966">It's</a>  not a large stage per se, and it's towards to the side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=699.35">And</a>  it worked out pretty well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=701.772">What</a>  city? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=702.552">Where</a>  was that at? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=706.095">We've</a>  done it in Cambridge, and then we've done it in Everett, and also Somerville.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=713.681">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=713.841">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=715.542">Yeah,</a>  that's good to know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=719.196">The</a>  only other thing, too, is you folks do hire police details, correct?</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=724.418">So</a>  any event where we're serving alcohol, we'll definitely have a police detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=731.16">It's</a>  just for safety purposes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=733.881">And</a>  we just think it's just better anyways.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=736.822">Smart.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=737.603">Smart.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=738.083">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=738.923">Yeah,</a>  especially with this, you know, it's 600 people.</p>

    <p>[Paul Georges]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=744.369">When</a>  it comes to our games, like I said, we've been doing this for a long time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=747.35">We've</a>  never had any major issues, wherever, like, violence or any fighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=753.013">Our</a>  biggest concern that we've dealt with is, like, cleanup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=758.936">That's</a>  our issues that we've dealt with in the past, is after we have a large amount of fans and trying to get everybody to go home, and we would have to stay behind or come out the next day to claim. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=774.479">That's</a>  our obstacle.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=777.181">Yeah,</a>  it's a challenge, sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=780.384">Daria,</a>  although the commission we take off July and August, that doesn't mean we vanish to Europe for those 60 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=789.952">I</a>  mean, we're still around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=792.514">So</a>  there's nothing that says we cannot <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=796.257">have</a>  a quick zoom we posted to make sure the public's aware that we're having a quick zoom so we can resolve this for Mr. Georges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=804.12">I</a>  don't want you know because he's got two targets in August and I would like to get it resolved for him so he can <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=812.363">move</a>  forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=812.964">There's</a>  nothing more frustrating than here and we're going to hold this and you got all the logistics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=818.087">I</a>  mean, I plan big events and small events and it's maddening because sometimes things don't come together until like the last five, seven, eight days before the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=829.493">So</a>  I get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=830.874">So</a>  Mr. Georges, I'm going to kind of step <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=835.417">forward</a>  a bit, and I'm going to make a recommendation that we table this until the city can look into the logistics of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=844.641">And</a>  then if Ben and Bobby don't mind, we can have a quick Zoom meeting in July and just give our opinions on what we hear from the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=858.408">And</a>  hopefully we can make this happen for Mr. Georges.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=862.07">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=863.378">I'm</a>  fine with that, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=865.258">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=865.758">Yeah,</a>  and I would just say the sooner the better, so he can plan his event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=870.259">As</a>  you said, Alan, I know you agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=872.2">And</a>  then just because it is going into summer and it's like everybody's got a million things going on and we can't just have these meetings moving all over the place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=881.661">At</a>  least I can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=883.221">So</a>  I'll do my best to be available.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=886.122">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=886.882">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=887.742">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=888.022">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=888.682">So</a>  Bobby, you second my motion? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=890.743">Yeah,</a>  I'll second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=893.119">All</a>  right, so all in favor of tabling this until the city can investigate a little more or ask them more questions, and then we'll circle back in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=904.392">Say</a>  aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=905.473">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=907.135">Okay,</a>  so motion carries. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=910.278">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Georges. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=912.919">It</a>  was intriguing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=913.719">That's</a>  why we put you first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=916.079">We've</a>  never seen something like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=918.96">Boy,</a>  I wish you could get Taylor Swift. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=920.84">That</a>  would be incredible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=922.721">But</a>  we'll get back to you in July and give you a resolution on this request. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=930.602">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=931.062">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=932.603">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=933.663">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=933.923">Ciao.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=937.976">Okay,</a>  let's see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=941.617">Method</a>  Brewing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=944.438">Hello,</a>  hello. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=945.138">You're</a>  requesting two one-day license applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=950.179">What</a>  do I see? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=951.28">Event</a>  September 27th and September 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=953.84">Does</a>  that sound right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=956.341">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=957.561">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=958.442">So</a>  tell us a little about them.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=961.171">uh</a>  so we've got two requests uh one is for the uh there's a music i've got to work out which dates which here um it's because we've got there's a music festival and then there's the run medford as well um i think that was the music festival on top of my head uh <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=982.003">And</a>  that's over the Hatshell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=984.084">It's</a>  been happening the last few years where, again, very similar setup to what we do with the Farmers Market Concerts, where I said it's a one-day music festival. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=995.411">I</a>  think Russ Robar organizes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=998.193">He's</a>  got the Hatshell booked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1000.314">And</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1003.113">And</a>  the idea is, I think with that one is, if I'm getting the right one, unless I'm confusing myself, which is probably gonna happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1009.858">And</a>  I think, yeah, so one of them might be, there might be a rain date on that, if it's the right one I'm thinking of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1015.862">And</a>  again, where again, we've obviously put the Nile Colby on these point signs up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1019.605">I</a>  think you've got a map as well, which would be exactly the same spot we do stuff at the farmer's market as well.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1025.849">Yep,</a>  yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1028.656">No,</a>  you're getting good, real good at this, Nick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1030.738">Real</a>  good at this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1032.339">We</a>  had a little bit of practice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1038.33">I</a>  don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1040.171">I</a>  mean, we're very familiar with Medford Brewing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1043.491">You</a>  guys do outstanding work, outstanding service. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1046.592">You</a>  follow all the rules. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1048.693">No</a>  fighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1049.853">I</a>  think as Mr. George was saying, we've never had an incident of people getting out of hand and fighting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1056.294">So</a>  I don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1059.415">My</a>  other two colleagues, anything on your mind? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1062.596">Any</a>  questions or concerns with this request for two one-day license applications?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1070.498">I'm</a>  okay with it, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1072.879">I</a>  just have a quick question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1075.26">On</a>  those September 27th and 28th, those are two different events, correct?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1081.87">Let</a>  me hang on my... It's Ron Medford still. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1084.854">I</a>  think it just goes for two days.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1086.776">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1087.617">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1087.957">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1088.618">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1089.159">Let</a>  me correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1089.819">Yeah,</a>  because my brain is a little bit addled now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1093.163">So</a>  that one actually is the Ron Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1094.685">So</a>  that one where one of the events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1097.228">So</a>  that's that's the David McGillivray event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1101.173">where</a>  we're actually technically the beer sponsor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1104.014">I</a>  think I mentioned last mass meeting where so for the run itself we are not charging for beer that is basically that's included in the admission to the run itself where it sponsors and they've got two events going for that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1121.745">where</a>  I think one of them we might potentially be actually selling is more of a make sure we're covered. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1127.169">We</a>  did it last year with them, where we had one day where we were actually selling beer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1131.692">Actually,</a>  I think it was at Hormel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1133.894">But</a>  in truth, it was so poorly attended by beer drinkers that we probably wouldn't do it again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1142.28">But</a>  I have to say, we'll do it just to be nice to run Medford.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1146.964">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1147.704">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1148.485">OK,</a>  that answered my question.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1150.046">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1151.584">But</a>  either one of my fellow commissioners want to make a motion, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1159.047">Yeah,</a>  I'm also good with these, Nick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1161.288">So</a>  I can make a motion, you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1163.569">So</a>  I'll make a motion to approve the two one-day licenses, first for the music festivals, September 15th, at the Condon show, and for the Run Medford community events, September 27th, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1183.615">and</a>  the 28th at Hormel, and then the 28th at Mentor City Hall for these requests.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1191.883">I'll</a>  second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1244.421">You're</a>  a regular too, so tell us about the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1247.462">We</a>  actually have two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1248.583">There's</a>  the event, they're both at Eventham Studios. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1251.944">We</a>  have the Friday, August, sorry, Friday, June 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1258.307">It's</a>  basically a copy and paste of the Sunday gaming events that we've done at the studios. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1264.35">And</a>  we're doing one on a Friday night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1266.391">Just</a>  there's been interest on doing <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1268.852">them</a>  on a night one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1270.713">So</a>  we're going to incorporate the occasional night gaming night there as well with the FIFA tournament as the feature for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1281.679">That</a>  is the one on Friday the 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1284.961">The</a>  29th is once again a collaboration with JJ Gonson. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1289.063">You</a>  should have that application as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1291.505">Essentially</a>  a copy and paste of the performances that we've done at the studios as well.</p>

J. it's on a Thursday, August, 22nd, and I still submit that application.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1486.329">Submit</a>  it and see what happens kind of yeah, I, I would submit it and if we're going to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1495.207">rule</a>  on Mr. George's request that Hormel, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1501.673">Maybe</a>  I shouldn't be saying that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1502.714">That's</a>  not nice to say anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1503.875">But</a>  Bobby, Ben, what do you think, you know, if we could do two? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1507.278">Yeah,</a>  that's fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1508.318">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1509.019">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1509.119">That</a>  was really reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1510.839">It's</a>  the same thing as the event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1513.941">It's</a>  essentially the same thing as the 29th.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1516.262">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1516.422">Same</a>  collaboration, same thing with JJ. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1518.502">So</a>  just setting forth the expectations.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1522.184">And</a>  Brian, it's not that, oh, the commission's a bunch of prima donnas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1526.506">They</a>  don't want to work in the summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1527.666">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1528.086">But</a>  I always try to explain to people that people take vacations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1533.208">And</a>  the fire chief, the police chief, everyone takes vacations in those months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1538.091">And</a>  sometimes it's impossible to get things done because everyone is going to be on holiday, including the commissioners, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1546.216">We</a>  have to take our vacations, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1548.357">So</a>  logistically, it was always hard to get anything done in those two months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1554.1">And</a>  that was the impetus as to why, eons ago, the licensing commission started taking off those two months.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1562.105">Yeah,</a>  not a problem at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1563.547">I</a>  just wanted to, I just, I wasn't sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1567.631">Okay,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1569.133">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1570.575">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1571.816">You</a>  all have a great afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1572.937">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1573.518">See</a>  you, Brian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1574.579">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1575.08">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1580.027">Mr.</a>  Sandoval, we're going to skip over you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1582.629">We're</a>  on a roll with the one-day license application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1585.492">So</a>  what I'd like to do is I'd like to jump over to the Riverside Yacht Club, and then we'll circle back to you if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1596.341">And</a>  then we'll have one more from the Frisbee Group.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1600.084">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1600.804">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1601.124">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1601.725">So</a>  let's address the Riverside Yacht Club, their one-day license application request.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1610.871">How</a>  you doing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1611.611">I'm</a>  Michael from Riverside Yacht Club.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1613.972">How</a>  are you, Michael?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1615.173">I'm</a>  the Vice Commodore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1616.773">We're</a>  just having a little social event on September 7th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1620.695">It's</a>  just basically an end of the year get together, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1625.797">We're</a>  not expecting a big crowd or anything, maybe 50 people, and a gentleman offered to bring his band. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1634.24">So</a>  I put in for the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1638.041">We're</a>  looking to put them on the back deck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1641.203">And</a>  that's about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1642.544">Like</a>  I said, it's nothing really elaborate or anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1646.586">It's</a>  just a little get together and he offered to play for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1651.389">So</a>  here I am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1653.27">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1654.35">An</a>  application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1655.731">We</a>  do have an entertainment license, but that's for devices only, so.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1660.594">And</a>  that doesn't cover the actual deck too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1663.095">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1663.576">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1663.756">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1665.377">Tell</a>  me, how late will the event go?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1668.505">It's</a>  only like, I put down five to 11, but it's like six to 10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1672.349">I</a>  put a couple extra hours in for setting up and cleaning up and stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1676.994">I</a>  mean, I don't see it going much later than 10 o'clock anyways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1681.518">I</a>  mean, we're an older crowd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1683.24">We</a>  have very few young guys down there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1687.104">So</a>  it's pretty low key. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1688.605">And</a>  like I said, he off it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1693.574">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1694.734">When</a>  the request came in, that was my only concern about how late would it go in the evening and neighbors complaining, that's all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1706.8">That's</a>  also why I put in the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1709.221">The</a>  neighbors are pretty good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1710.262">They're</a>  nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1710.982">We</a>  get along very well with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1713.543">We</a>  try to accommodate them as best we can or exactly as much as we can.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1719.246">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1721.167">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1723.015">Bobby,</a>  Ben, any questions to Mike?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1727.259">I</a>  guess it's a question to the Commissioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1729.981">The</a>  all alcohol, so it's an all alcohol, is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1733.424">That</a>  wine and malt? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1735.065">You</a>  need to clarify that, Bobby?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1737.747">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1740.528">If</a>  they're a registered non-profit, which Michael checked yes, they can have an all-alcohol one-day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1749.552">If</a>  they're not a registered non-profit, they can only have wine and malt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1756.074">Did</a>  Mr. Georges, his had non-profit too though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1761.157">His</a>  did not have non-profit, I believe, if we look at it.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1764.959">Oh,</a>  no, he's not a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1767.841">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1768.541">Maybe</a>  I'm looking at too many of them next time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1770.783">No,</a>  that was one of the tweaks we will address, because he's not a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1775.626">So</a>  because he was checked off, he had all alcohol and wine and malt.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1781.309">Yeah,</a>  he can't get all alcohol.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1783.431">We'll</a>  make that correction in July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1785.332">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1786.132">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1786.713">No,</a>  not to go on to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1789.515">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1791.07">I</a>  mean, whereas this is a fairly contained event, sometimes, Mike, we have like a diagram that shows like where things are happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1801.457">That's</a>  like, well, we may, you know, I mean, this is, I'm familiar with the club a little bit, so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1809.643">Oh</a>  yeah, it's the clubhouse right off of 52 Ship Out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1814.246">And</a>  then on the back side is a deck.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1817.929">Yeah,</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1819.009">And</a>  you walk down, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1820.448">They</a>  can go down the gangplank to the boats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1822.37">I</a>  mean, I could draw a quick sketch on it and show you right now.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1825.973">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1827.255">Or,</a>  or, you know, you can draw us a sketch because we always want to see a diagram for the file, or you could do Google Earth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1836.556">and</a>  take a snapshot of the location and with a marker, you could do some tweaking in there, whatever it takes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1846.262">We</a>  don't expect it to come from an engineer or an architect, nothing like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1850.905">But</a>  we do want, because we are asking everybody, so we just want to be consistent with everybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1859.87">Like</a>  I said, I can draw out a quick sketch and I can leave it with Daria if you like.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1865.265">Yeah,</a>  she can share it with us after and we'll say pending that if that if everybody's okay with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1870.526">I</a>  mean, that's we just do it right on the spot.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1874.127">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1874.867">No,</a>  I agree, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1875.668">It's</a>  a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1877.048">We've</a>  been asking everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1878.428">So</a>  let's be consistent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1880.869">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1886.01">Do</a>  you think the bar would need to stay open until 11 or the bar can just be closed at 10 or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1894.124">And</a>  they said, we're a private club and, uh, I mean, we could close the bar, but a lot of people could just go down to their boats. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1900.75">I</a>  mean, they have refrigerators on the boat and get a beer.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1906.375">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1907.436">So</a>  it doesn't really make it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1909.918">I</a>  have, um, I am tip certified and all that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1913.821">And</a>  I also have another gentleman that, uh, is tip certified that works on the house committee with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1919.966">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1921.201">I</a>  mean, we got more retired cops and state troopers down there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1925.702">We</a>  got the fire boaters parked right there at the bottom of the gangplank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1930.383">They're</a>  in and out of the bay.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1933.024">Yeah,</a>  that we're not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1935.044">We</a>  know the bigger picture down there, Mike. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1937.165">We</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1937.765">I</a>  mean, the risk is minimal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1941.006">Yeah,</a>  no, we get it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1944.007">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1945.607">I</a>  don't have any other questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1947.247">Bobby,</a>  Ben, if you want to make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1950.79">Yeah,</a>  I can make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1952.251">I'm</a>  good as well.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1953.471">That</a>  sounds fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1957.173">And</a>  then we'll just say submitting a diagram of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1961.174">And</a>  then we'll approve, you know, once you do that, we can approve it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1964.175">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1964.815">So</a>  I'll make a motion to accept the one day license for the Riverside Yacht Club for September 7th, 2024 for the event from 5pm to 11pm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1977.261">PM</a>  as laid out by Mike Silvestro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1983.403">Is</a>  that Mike Silvestro? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1986.164">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1987.165">And</a>  just subject to Mike providing us a diagram of where the alcohol will be served in this event.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1997.258">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=1997.699">I'll</a>  second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2100.041">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2102.142">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2103.903">This</a>  is exciting that you're in the playoffs, right?</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2106.845">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2107.465">We're</a>  sitting at seven and two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2109.647">We've</a>  beaten all of our rivals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2113.049">We're</a>  probably ranked number one in the whole league right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2116.691">Rankings</a>  come out today, so it's a really good season so far.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2120.688">Good,</a>  including the evil empire, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2123.472">Yeah,</a>  beat them last time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2125.415">Yeah,</a>  that was a big one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2126.838">There's</a>  something in the water around here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2128.761">I</a>  tell ya. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2132.433">Well,</a>  we're very familiar with your organization, Jay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2136.414">You</a>  guys run a tight ship, no incidents, no problems. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2141.916">As</a>  long as, Jerry, do we have the insurance on file? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2145.417">Do</a>  we have, I know we have a schematic, because it's always the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2150.779">So</a>  are we good with the insurance?</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2154.594">There</a>  is a certificate of insurance on file that should be fine for the whole season.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2158.837">I</a>  was going to say, I do have their insurance just in general.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2162.761">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2163.962">Has</a>  it expired? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2165.563">No,</a>  it shouldn't be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2166.664">It</a>  should be for the whole season. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2168.125">It</a>  should be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2169.567">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2170.087">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2170.728">Then</a>  Bobby, Ben, any questions or concerns for Jay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2178.314">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2179.632">When</a>  will you know what date it is, Jay?</p>

    <p>[-tCCcF67nLU_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2182.414">So</a>  we won't actually know until the last weekend of the season, which is the 20th and 21st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2193.763">If</a>  our two rivals, DC and New York, both lose one more game, then it's definitely going to be the 11th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2203.807">If</a>  they keep winning, then it's gonna come down to the last week of the season when we have a doubleheader in Canada that we have to win both games to lock in the 11th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2214.671">So</a>  we're hoping for the 11th, but we don't know for sure just yet.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2219.433">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2219.833">So,</a>  yeah, no issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2221.573">I</a>  think it all sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2222.954">Daria,</a>  is that any problem with the paperwork of like since it's two dates?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2228.816">No,</a>  I just think as long as they let us know which date they use. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2232.057">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2233.168">Okay,</a>  yeah, it's very similar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2235.889">The</a>  way I'm looking at it's very similar to when we get rain dates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2238.65">Look,</a>  we have one day and then a rain day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2241.13">So,</a>  yeah, in a way, that's kind of each other.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2243.511">Yeah,</a>  then I have no more questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2245.932">I</a>  have no issues with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2247.212">I'm</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2247.772">I'm</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2248.372">I'm</a>  good with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=2249.533">Okay,</a>  cool.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3355.346">So</a>  I actually was Bobby's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3358.549">Bobby,</a>  remember he sent it to us after the last meeting, which I liked that he included payment because that was going to be easier to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3368.915">Even</a>  though we have a lot of nonprofits, we still have some for profits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3372.878">Some</a>  of them are really good about paying, some of them are not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3375.14">So</a>  we want to keep that on there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3376.621">So</a>  if they haven't paid and we know that's not checked off, I can follow up and say, you know, we can issue you, we cannot, for example, review this application until you pay us the fee first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3389.211">And</a>  it also has rain dates on there and it also has, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3396.407">avoiding</a>  where it says, if you're not having the one day license event, let the commission know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3401.392">But</a>  this way we can void it or whatever, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3407.799">Because</a>  a lot of people do do that where they tell me, oh, I didn't have this event, but we didn't know because we weren't notified, you know, till the moment when this person is like, oh yeah, I didn't have an event on that day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3418.951">So</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3420.492">Bobby,</a>  what else did you?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3424.856">The</a>  application must be filled out completely. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3427.858">Not</a>  applicable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3433.05">But</a>  other than that, yeah, it's not really one of those fill-in-your-own-forms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3436.852">I'm</a>  not that talented, Alan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3440.294">Maybe</a>  you'll be able to take it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3441.655">No,</a>  I love those interactive forms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3443.797">Those</a>  interactive PDFs are great.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3446.618">Well,</a>  that's what I was going to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3447.579">I</a>  can turn it into PDF. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3449.62">It's</a>  just Word right now, just to have it at least drafted somewhat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3454.623">And</a>  then if we like what we see, I can turn it into PDF.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3457.785">I,</a>  I think that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3459.226">You</a>  know, we, you know, I'm constantly reminded by all my nieces and nephews uncle Alan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3464.89">It's</a>  2024. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3465.991">So</a>  this is what I get from them all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3467.973">So</a>  let's let's get the the word document together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3471.916">I</a>  Bobby I'd like to your recommendations and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3475.318">I</a>  think let's adopt it, let's vote to adopt it and then when Daria has time, if she can convert it to a PDF so it can be interactive for the kids, that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3487.953">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3490.576">Yeah,</a>  that works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3491.336">That</a>  way they could fill it out online and just submit it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3494.357">And,</a>  you know, even if they, it's like the ABCC, they have them fill it out online, print it, and then submit it to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3503.459">They</a>  can do the same thing with this and submit their check with it at the same time, because there's a box at the bottom, fee with the line payable to City of Medford, payment to one day of application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3517.042">So</a>  when they submit the application, there's a check for $60. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3521.324">We</a>  don't have to chase, Daria doesn't have to chase people for money all the time and just make life a little easier, you know?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3527.748">No,</a>  it's smart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3529.229">It's</a>  smart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3530.53">I'm</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3531.35">I'm</a>  in favor as well.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3533.471">No,</a>  no, that sounds making, you know, let's get up to, to the modern, you know, way of doing these things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3539.975">Yeah,</a>  of course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3540.935">Yeah,</a>  no, definitely in favor of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3543.117">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3543.717">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3545.025">I</a>  was thinking of tying in something else with that, but I think it's better off in a separate form for caterers licenses, because they're required to notify us in the police department 48 hours in advance if they're going to have an event in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3560.119">I</a>  mean, we don't have to approve it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3562.381">We</a>  have jurisdiction there, but they're required to notify us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3566.945">So</a>  maybe we can just have a small one pager <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3569.808">that</a>  if somebody calls the area or the police saying, well, look, we're notifying you, we're having an event that event them, like, you know, whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3579.433">And</a>  it's sure there's a form you got to fill out, just email it back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3583.075">You're</a>  all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3583.675">I</a>  mean, we don't have we don't have to sit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3585.977">It</a>  doesn't have to come before us or anything as long as the area gets notification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3590.319">That's</a>  all we could get.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3592.22">Could</a>  that be done? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3593.32">You</a>  know, I'm thinking of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3596.308">When</a>  I used to work, could that be done through the city website? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3604.357">Could</a>  we put language on the license commission in that section? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3607.74">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3608.842">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3610.183">Do</a>  something there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3610.924">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3612.668">just</a>  let me know what you want and then I will have Lisa added, Lisa from our office to add it to the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3621.312">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3622.072">So</a>  that's not- Bobby, I was just thinking, you know, in residential lending, we, you know, we, oh, let's have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3629.055">No,</a>  let's just put it on the website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3630.416">So</a>  when they're looking at rates, they can see all the, you know, all the narrative that associated with the programs and rates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3637.599">So</a>  we'll come up with something for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3640.3">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3641.621">So,</a>  okay, so do we need to make a motion to approve the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3647.265">The</a>  application, I think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3650.307">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3651.108">I</a>  motion just revised application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3656.852">Yeah,</a>  I make a motion to revise the, the, the, the 1 day license application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3663.617">That's</a>  my motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3665.948">I'll</a>  second it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3668.41">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3669.07">All</a>  in favor, say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3670.671">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3671.412">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3672.132">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3672.853">So</a>  let's get that into print, and let's see if we can get it in a PDF, and let's start using it as soon as we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3681.539">Cool.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3683.405">Mr.</a>  Commissioner, can I ask you a quick question about just the last thing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3687.666">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3689.007">When</a>  Brian Bailey came on, he came on, but he was coming on to talk about the soccer event or give some insight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3699.63">But</a>  we just didn't want to hear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3701.05">I</a>  was just curious why we didn't want to hear from him now.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3704.452">I</a>  think because the other party has to be here to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3712.858">Whatever</a>  the issues are, probably you want the other part to explain, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3723.64">And</a>  I think, Ben, it's a good observation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3726.441">I</a>  think by tabling the requests, now the pressure is off, so now they can kind of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3735.743">look</a>  at it differently rather than under the gun in the last half hour. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3741.747">I</a>  think that's why we took the wind out of his sails by saying, look, we're going to hold this until July when you guys can all study it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3750.832">I'm</a>  guessing that's what happened.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3753.173">They've</a>  never been in the city before, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3755.815">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3756.675">For</a>  the past three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3758.756">They</a>  have?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3761.69">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I have not done the not the music event, but no, no, no, not the music event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3768.653">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3769.333">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3769.833">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3770.354">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3771.114">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3771.694">So</a>  my only comment on that, which was like a little, I don't know, disappointing or whatever you want to call it, but was that we have to have a special meeting now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3780.238">For</a>  for a reason we are not aware of yet, I guess, and so it's sort of like I know it's all Brian was trying to get on the call, but it was it's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3791.055">For</a>  the last three years, we really never end up taking any break from this and we have a lot of special meetings to sort of accommodate different things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3798.223">So,</a>  you know, I always try to avoid that if we have to, because it's like a whole other thing to schedule.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3807.361">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3807.681">So</a>  that's my, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3809.142">That's</a>  my comment.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3810.423">I</a>  get, I get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3811.324">But</a>  rather than making, trying to make a decision today on that, when we didn't have all the pieces of the puzzle, I, I don't think that would be prudent for the, for us in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3821.171">So,</a>  and I agree, Ben, I don't like the idea that, you know, okay, July, August, but you know, we'll make it painless in July.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3833.517">Yeah,</a>  well, and also the guy needs to plan his event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3836.619">I</a>  mean, do you have to plan your event without it?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3838.401">I</a>  guess you do, but... The village was truly an emergency at the Tufts pool that happened that involved a child, so that's why Kevin couldn't come on time.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3849.469">I</a>  don't doubt that he had a legitimate reason. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3852.011">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3853.192">All</a>  right, that's my only thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3854.973">I'll</a>  think about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3858.295">I</a>  get it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3861.047">Okay,</a>  two last things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3863.212">Dari,</a>  anything on your mind before I jump in?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3866.84">No,</a>  I don't think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3868.022">I</a>  mean, I have a lot on my mind.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3877.39">This</a>  year is my 12th year on the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3882.393">I</a>  enjoy what we do in helping the city and I enjoy my other two commissioners, but what I'd like to do is I wish to stay on the commission, but I want to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3894.18">put</a>  up the chair, either to Bobby or Ben, and see which one of you would like to take over with the new fiscal year after this month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3904.451">So</a>  I'm staying on, but I'd like to turn the chair over <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3911.459">to</a>  either my two fellow commissioners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3913.982">And</a>  there's some logic there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3916.365">As</a>  you know, I retired after 42 years as a banker, and we've been doing retirement stuff, and we've been going back and forth to Florida, and I don't ever want to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3926.476">um,</a>  jeopardize the city or this commission by, you know, being somewhere traveling is something enjoying my retirement and, and you go, geez, the chair is not even going to make this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3938.859">So</a>  I don't think, again, I don't think it's fair to the commission into the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3943.8">So,</a>  uh, Ben, Bobby, I, uh, I make a motion that either one of you, you're both very smart and talented and, and you're up on, uh, one 38 and you're out and you ask it very, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3956.383">insightful</a>  questions, but I would like to offer either one of you the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3962.886">So,</a>  Ben, Bobby, any thoughts or comments?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3966.447">Yeah,</a>  I may, you know, as the second ranking time person here, you know, just a second, you know, I think, you know, when I appreciate you being the chair, Alan, big shoes to fill with Jim leaving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3986.155">You've</a>  done a great job and been committed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3989.057">So</a>  do appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3991.918">I</a>  think, you know, and I also was sworn in last night for another six years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3996.181">So</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=3997.081">I</a>  do think with my current life of three little kids and running my business that I wouldn't be the best fit for the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4009.425">I</a>  was thinking about arm wrestling Bobby for it, but he may win on that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4012.97">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4014.433">Also,</a>  so but in real reality, I think, you know, you know, and Bob, Bobby is newer, but has just become such an expert and is so diligent with <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4025.906">with</a>  really a lot of things, and we all know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4028.647">And</a>  so I would like to weigh in that I would definitely feel very confident in Commissioner Delfano being the new chair as you are stepping down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4042.791">So</a>  that's my just opinion on the matter.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4046.777">Thank</a>  you, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4047.578">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4047.918">You're,</a>  you're, you're spot on with all your points. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4051.301">Um,</a>  Commissioner Delifano, the, uh, what say you, are you, are you up for, uh, the chair position?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4059.848">Well,</a>  um, I don't know when Ben had them sunglasses on a minute ago, he looked like he should have been in the movies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4066.673">It</a>  was just like, wow, where's he been all these years? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4073.73">But</a>  you always go back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4076.612">Look</a>  at that, that's awesome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4078.934">And</a>  I don't know about the arm wrestling, Ben. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4081.936">I</a>  think you got it all over me in that department at this stage of the game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4085.699">But</a>  I would be honored to accept the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4090.323">I</a>  have the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4092.064">You</a>  two gentlemen, like Ben said, Alan, you stepped up when Jim retired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4097.168">It</a>  wasn't an easy position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4099.71">I</a>  just filled in one week when you weren't here and it isn't quite as easy as it looks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4106.553">And</a>  Ben had done it a couple of times and he did a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4110.615">But</a>  I do have the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4113.477">I</a>  am somewhat familiar with 138 where I was in the liquor business many years ago, the sales rep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4121.12">So,</a>  um, that's kind of how, like, I understand it a little, but we all bring something to the table. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4126.243">Um,</a>  you know, Ben, you've got the, the, uh, construction, uh, knowledge, uh, and, and Alan, you've got the, uh, financial financing and stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4135.189">And,</a>  you know, I've got a little bit of the ABCC stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4138.571">So</a>  I think we're a great team. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4140.413">And</a>  of course, Daria, she just holds it all together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4143.535">She</a>  makes us all look really good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4145.316">So,</a>  I mean, um, I really enjoyed talking with Daria and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4148.938">working</a>  with Daria, we seem to work fine together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4152.785">I</a>  think it would be a good fit for the commission and I'd be honored to accept the chair.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4156.893">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4157.795">Ben,</a>  I'll make a motion to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4162.27">uh,</a>  appoint, uh, Commissioner Bobby Delafano as the- the new chair of the Licensing Commission, um, starting September, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4172.978">Because,</a>  uh, oh, no, at the end of this- the end of this month, right, Darren? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4177.241">It's</a>  the- the fiscal year ends in June, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4179.342">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4179.582">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4179.763">June</a>  30th, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4180.783">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4181.224">So</a>  the beginning of the next city fiscal year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4185.987">Ben,</a>  you wanna second?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4187.688">I-</a>  I'll- I'll second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4191.145">Gladly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4191.806">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4192.327">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4192.607">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4194.21">So</a>  all in favor say aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4196.715">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4197.597">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4198.638">Congratulations,</a>  Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4202.35">You've</a>  been great to work with and I'm just in awe at your knowledge and it's gonna be a lot of fun, a lot of fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4212.017">So</a>  congratulations, sir. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4214.499">And</a>  then one last item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4218.302">I</a>  understand that control compliance checks were done throughout the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4226.722">I'm</a>  hoping that everybody passed and we don't have any incidents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4233.068">I</a>  know in the past we've always had at least one, which isn't bad when you think about how many package stores and restaurants and <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4242.917">you</a>  know, how many vendors or entities are out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4246.138">But</a>  I think, and this will be, Bobby will be the chair, but in the past we've had separate hearings for if a violate, if we've come across a violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4261.102">And</a>  I remember that some of them used to go 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4268.344">And</a>  it depended on the severity and depended on <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4272.365">who</a>  it was that committed the infraction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4275.648">But</a>  I guess what I'm driving at is we'll find out if anyone failed the control compliance checks, and that's something that we have to think about in September when we come back and we're up and running again, and how we want to handle them, whether we want to <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4295.302">have</a>  a separate hearing for them, or do we ask Daria that we'll do one at a time, or I'm hoping it's none at a time, but sometimes we get- <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4312.375">Well,</a>  we're not fully sure how many in total. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4315.776">We</a>  have an idea of how many have not passed, but we're not completely sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4322.697">So</a>  we'll just kind of hang on until September when we see the final number, and then we can figure out how we want to address them, whether we want to do them on a Wednesday with a regular meeting, or we want to have a separate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4338.341">Again,</a>  the three of us will come up with <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4343.117">something</a>  that will work for the city, for the commission, and for any of the entities that committed the infractions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4350.411">Sound</a>  like a plan or no?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4354.04">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4354.64">Yeah,</a>  that sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4355.861">And</a>  I think if even if we need to discuss this, we can legally as long as if there are any issues, we don't mention who the issues are, what licenses they were. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4371.112">We</a>  can just talk in general that <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4373.614">okay</a>  the city had several infractions and and this is how we're going to handle it uh why don't we start in September and we can set up this this and this we'll meet with Lieutenant Lockowitz and they and the other two officers and uh and and not discuss any names of any businesses but just what the best course of action is because I I've never <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4395.757">been</a>  involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4397.178">Alan</a>  and Ben, both in the area, have all been involved with it before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4402.323">But</a>  since I've been on the commission, I haven't been involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4404.565">So</a>  I really don't know the procedure, you know, to a T. I wouldn't feel comfortable even, you know, fining somebody or suspending somebody unless I really felt good about knowing what to do, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4419.478">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4420.459">And</a>  I think, like I said, it's OK that we talk about it as long as we don't mention any names. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4424.34">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4424.94">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4425.94">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4426.54">No</a>  decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4428.06">No</a>  rulings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4429.201">Just</a>  table it for now then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4431.521">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4431.681">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4432.221">Just</a>  until we see the full report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4434.421">And</a>  like I said, we'll come back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4437.522">We'll</a>  be back up and running in September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4440.082">So</a>  that's it for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4442.023">Dari,</a>  anything from you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4443.883">Any</a>  trips coming up? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4447.124">Anything</a>  you want to share with us? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-06-26-24&start=4450.13">No,</a>  no, nothing fun.</p>
