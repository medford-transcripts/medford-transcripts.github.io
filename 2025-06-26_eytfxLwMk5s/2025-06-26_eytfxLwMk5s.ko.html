    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=325.08s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 好吧，伟大的美国啤酒馆，正如你们所知，我想从我们所说的位置图开始，即该房产的大致位置，这里用红色虚线突出显示，占地两英亩。
 对于那些不知道该酒店确切位置的人来说，它位于神秘大道上汉考克街的另一侧，基本上位于 Atlas Liquors 和 Medford VFW 之间。
 这是神秘大道 142 号的卫星视图。
 我在那里用红色描述了它。
 目前，它与隔壁的土地共享，布莱恩的家族也拥有并管理这块土地。
 因此，我尽力定义了啤酒厂将占用的该特定批次的实际参数。
 从俯视图可以看出，主要是校车车身和储物的机械使用。
 这是后视图，所以是93年的。
 您可以再次看到矩形，它本质上是我们的批处理参数。
 前面的那栋建筑、车身、所有空间都将被拆除，其余部分将被释放。
 正如您在这张照片中看到的，该地块相当平坦。
 在后面你可以看到校车储藏室。
 从前面看，这是神秘大道的景色。
 再次强调，非常工业化，主要用于汽车存储。
 所以从神秘大道上看，在神秘大道上，正面立面图，这就是你每天看到的。
 看起来非常工业化。
 你的路上有一根巨大的电线杆，不是很令人兴奋，也不是很有吸引力。
 对不起，在街道上再远一点的地方还有另一种景色，回头看看项目或房产。
 只是，再次强调，非常工业化，在这个空间中没有什么非常有吸引力的地方。
 这当然不是我想在晚上聚集的地方。
 现在，这一切的整个起源是，你知道，我们如何改进神秘大道？
 我认为布莱恩从神秘大道一开始就怀有这样的愿景。
 而且，你知道，令人恐惧的是我们的团队和致力于此的一群人
 我认为这是第一张倒下的多米诺骨牌。
 所以，你知道，我们投入了很多心和很多精力来看到这个项目，你知道，美化神秘大道并成为未来发展的催化剂。
 所以，你知道，这是我们看到最大变化的地方。
 因此，显然，在左侧，他们看到的是现有站点，而在右侧，他们看到的是提议的站点。
 显然这是一个巨大的变化，更具吸引力。
 我不想太拘泥于确切的形象。
 这是一个概念图像。
 我们正在发展中。
 我们的预算在这方面是有限的。
 有一群人投入了自己的资金，他们在这方面投入了大量资金，还有我们的预算
 我们有局限性，因此所呈现的内容并不完全符合其应有的效果。
 这些将在该项目的设计、施工和许可阶段稍后被移除。
 但为了让你了解我们在这个特定情节中看到的戏剧性变化，这基本上是为了向你展示这一点。
 那么
 这是神秘大道前侧立面的近距离视图。
 显然，汽车不见了，公交车不见了，那座破旧的建筑不见了，你知道，有一个更具吸引力的社交空间，我们认为它可以成为神秘大道的中心，并希望，正如我们提到的，刺激街道的未来发展。
 对我们来说，正面必须具有吸引力。
 必须有一些绿色空间。
 我们在上次会议上清楚地听到了这一点，并已尽最大努力增加该地块的景观面积。
 我们希望这里的体验不会让人感觉自己身处工业场地和工业空间，所以我们希望感觉人们正在逃离这个开发项目、这座建筑。
 我认为这对于游客和顾客来说都应该是一种体验。
 和
 我认为缓冲景观和某种对建筑的欢迎自然将实现这一点。
 现在这是侧视图。
 我知道这个侧面的观点引起了理事会成员的一些担忧，我听到了你的声音并且理解，鉴于该项目的规模，它看起来非常大。
 我们所有的窗户都在顶部，我们的屋顶也在这里，这真的很酷。
 下半部分有很大的表面积，没有太多玻璃，
 你知道，原因是我们的很多让步和东西都在那堵墙上，所以窗户在那里没有任何好处。
 我不希望人们看到监狱后面、食品摊后面等等。
 但我们已经与建筑师分享了一些计划和想法，也许可以在这里种植某种绿色墙，种植一堵墙，某种标牌，以美化主入口和空间，使其更受欢迎，并将交通引导至我们位于酒店后面的主入口。
 在建筑物的后面，我们将安装一个自行车架。
 所以这将是一个更有吸引力的空间。
 但是，你知道，我认为我们正在做一些事情来美化这座建筑，而不是让它变得如此工业化和商业化。
 我们现在正在与我们的建筑师一起探讨这些想法，但我清楚地听到了你们的声音。
 我认为这是我们的团队。
 致力于使这个项目和这座建筑尽可能美丽，因为这反过来将使我们受益并邀请人们参与，这将是我们所有人都可以感到非常自豪的事情。
 这是侧面立面图。
 现在，我只想大致进入该网站。我记得在上次会议上，董事会中有人提到了网站的排名和一般内容。
 在平面图上看起来有点困难，但是尝试放大，几乎面向 93，你已经是第 12 年了。
 嗯，背面就是海拔 12。
 如果我们看前面，从神秘大道进来，你知道，你会从人行道上开出一个 10，然后你会看到一个 11。
 所以你说的是120米以上30到60厘米的台阶。
 所以，非常水平。
 毫无疑问，作为一名建筑商，我喜欢看到这样的事情。
 很多级别都没有太多挑战。
 抱歉，我不知道他为什么这么做。
 让我回去吧。
 对不起。
 抱歉，请尝试回到那个。
 开始了。
 因此，您会在场地平面图上看到一些在我们的景观平面图上看不到的东西。
 您会在前面看到这些虚线。
 在这里停车。
 这是一个拟议的渗透系统，本质上是一个雨水管理系统。
 这就是我们的排水系统的去向。
 所以，你知道，停车时间是 12 点，顶部是 12:30，下降到 11 点，下降到 11 点，然后下降到基本上
 它将所有的水输送到这里的渗透系统，装卸码头后面还有另一个渗透系统，将水输送到这里。
 这些是我们的雨水管理系统，我们的土木工程团队和梅德福市工程部正在对这些系统进行分析和研究。
 所以我们将对所有这些进行计算，但基本上是那里的表面积和水量。
 我们希望这能回答有关该地块是否水平的问题。
 确实如此。
 您还可以在这里看到，这些是离开神秘大道的公用设施，此处描述的是通往我们建筑物的公用设施。
 所以在公用事业、燃气、水、污水、排水和地下电力方面，我们的目的是把一切都放在地下。
 旅馆前面有一根电线杆。
 就在神秘大道上，该大道归公用事业公司所有，我们将尽一切努力拆除该杆并将变压器放置在景观缓冲区的某处。
 虽然没有任何保证，但这是我正在研究的事情，我希望让 Eversource、国家电网以及管理和维护这根电线杆的人与我们合作，将所有公用设施移至地下。
 我只是认为这有助于更好的发展，而且你不必看建筑物前面的杆子。
 嗯，这就是一般网站。
 我们现在将在这里讨论修订后的计划。
 让我摆脱这一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=846.16s">[Unidentified]</a>: 최고. 그러면 사과드립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=849.541s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 나는 한동안 거기에 머물고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=853.949s">[Zac Bears]</a>:  Yeah, I don't know why it's letting me scroll as it once was.
 Let me try to enlarge it for you.
 Forgive me if I'm taking extra time.
 Okay, so here is the revised landscape plan and I worked on this, basically,
 to answer most of the questions that were brought about in the last preliminary hearing and also upon receiving all the letters from the Medford Fire Department, the Public Works Department, the Engineering Department and the Traffic Department.
 So we worked on this pretty diligently and forgive us, we do have budget constraints.
 This isn't some high level architectural rendering.
 So we're doing the best we can, but when it does come to actually
 permitting phase you will get much better and clearer images and renderings but I think it still communicates our message and hopefully highlight some of the areas of concern.
 Basically, everything was designed here in the city ordinance 6.3, which was provided by the planning department office.
 Alicia and Victor were kind enough to kind of send me some of that stuff and I kind of reviewed it to the best of my ability and included all those measures in here.
 So just as an overall idea of this lot size and how much we're covering, I just kind of wanted to give you an idea and we did so in this legend up here for the zoning requirements.
 This is commercial C2.
 And basically what is required of us is 35 feet of frontage.
 We actually have about 195 feet on Mystic Ave, 15 feet setback for the building.
 From the front side and rear, we have about 140 setback to the front of the building here, 15 on this side facing Atlas Liquors, and certainly more than that on that side, and then 30 feet from the rear.
 So we well within our setbacks, the height on this structure can exceed 30 so we're going right to 30 maximum lot coverage is 50% we're going to be at about 27.5.
 And the way I calculated that is over here in the lower left hand part of the legend.
 Overall lot size we have is about 89,620.
 The landscape area, and I'm calling the landscape area just the green area I have highlighted on the plan, that alone is 9,000 square feet.
 The patio area shown at the front, which is the beer garden essentially, is about 4,400 square feet.
 And the way I understand the city ordinances, the open space clause is that open area that that's your garden should be included in that tally.
 So if you calculate the landscape plus the open area, I have 13,400 square feet, which is 15% of the overall lot coverage.
 The building area is 24,682, that is this structure here, not including the beer garden, and that calculates to about 27.5% of the overall lot coverage.
 in increasing our landscape from the previous design to this design, you know, we're more than half of what our building coverage is.
 And I think that is a really nice balance for us into, you know, bring some more green to our area.
 So a couple things I want to go over that have varied from the last meeting were some of the changes that we made and
 Certainly if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
 First and foremost, one thing we heard loud and clear was the reduction of the overall width of our roadway.
 On the original site plan, it was spec'd at about 28 feet.
 And we designed that to be above what the fire department was requiring.
 The fire department got back to us and essentially asked for 24 feet for two lane traffic, excuse me.
 And so we shrunk it to 24 feet.
 which means less asphalt for us, a little more landscape buffer.
 And I think more importantly, and to the board's point, which was an excellent point from the last meeting was to increase the pedestrian access from Mystic Avenue.
 So what we've done now by shrinking this to 24 foot roadway, we're able to fit sidewalks on both sides, coming from the South and coming from the North on Mystic Ave.
 which I think will greatly improve pedestrian access to our site.
 Now, this sidewalk you can see was added in here, the trajectory this pathway would take was across the parking lot here and through this crosswalk, and then you can see we've added a pedestrian crosswalk across the front of our building and into our main entrance.
 Now, mystic have right here there's a 15 foot easement, essentially from the state of Massachusetts because it's a it's a Massachusetts roadway.
 So, the 15 feet, basically constitutes a five foot concrete sidewalk.
 plus a six inch curb, so five and a half feet.
 And that leaves us nine and a half feet of landscape buffer.
 That is gonna be on both sides of the parking lot.
 So landscape buffer of nine and a half feet here, here's your pedestrian sidewalk, there's your curbing, same condition on the opposite side, nine and a half foot landscape or five foot sidewalk and curbing in between.
 This landscape buffer was a big thing that came about in the last meeting.
 And as it's shown here now, it's just purely lawn,
 I do have a slide that I'll show you next where we do intend to do some plantings here.
 I think small shrubs, and traditionally what I've done in the past is anything greater than 30 feet you plant a small tree.
 I think that's something we can certainly look at doing here.
 My issue here is the overhead wires.
 On the southern part of Mystic Ave, there's that telephone pole that we talked about that I hope we can move, but no guarantee.
 That is a bit of a process.
 So I think there to be expected is low shrubbery and low plants, which we're open to doing and certainly, you know, shielding a bit of our parking lots from Mystic Ave.
 But I just wanted to point out that we do have a challenge there in the telephone pole.
 So parking, parking I've highlighted on the whole development.
 The main parking lot here has 86 spots, 75 of which are regular, four are handicap and we've included now what we're calling seven EV or electric vehicle spots.
 Those seven spots are right here, one, two, three, four.
 567.
 Now we're committed, and we talked to Alicia about this, we're committed to running conduit to these areas.
 We don't have a specific charging station spec yet or anything like that.
 Again, budget constraints, but we are open to certainly running conduit to these areas and working with the City of Medford
 when it comes about, if there's opportunities for us to take advantage of some incentives or some, you know, cost breaks, we would be open to putting charging stations there.
 But for now, I think the best we can do is provide conduit to those areas.
 On the front side here, you'll see we have an additional 16 spots.
 So 14 regular, 2 handicap.
 So if you calculate the 16 spots plus these 86, you get a total of 102.
 And the traffic department confirmed this in their review is 102 spots.
 So I worked with Alicia and Victor and Amanda in the calculation of what was required for parking on this site.
 And based on the calculation of the building, whether or not you include the beer garden, it remains up in the air.
 But for the sake of this measure, we included the beer garden.
 So if you include the 24,682 plus the 4,400 of the patio area,
 you get above 29,000 square feet and if you divide that by one spot per 350 square feet is the calculation we were given by Alicia's office and you come up with
 83 spots so that would be the minimum for a development as such 83 spots and the maximum is double that number so 166 so we're offering 102 which we think is a generous little sweet spot and the reason we exceeded the 83
 was mainly because we had a community outreach reading a few months back and one thing we heard loud and clear from local neighbors, mainly on the side streets, was they were concerned that the traffic to this building would lead to people parking on the side streets and impacting their properties negatively.
 That is certainly not something we want to do and we assured the neighbors of this property that we would do
 the best we can to mitigate that and put as much parking as we saw fit on our property.
 So that's kind of how we landed at 102.
 We felt like it was a sweet spot, a little bit above what is required, but not so excessive.
 And that is mainly in response to our community outreach meeting.
 So that is the parking.
 Now around the parking you'll see we have a seven foot landscape buffer all along here, all along the parking in the edges.
 The tree plantings we've done here I did an accordance with the
 with the zoning ordinance provided by Victor's office, the landscape plan 6.3, if you look at it, any parking lot that exceeds 20 parking spaces is required to have a tree per 10 spots.
 So if you see we have 86 spots all at 90, you should have nine trees, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
 So there's 12 in that area we exceed our minimum there.
 And this doesn't really fall in it because it doesn't exceed 20 spots so therefore there's not a minimum but we still have two trees there regardless.
 So I think the tree planting that we're proposing is sufficient.
 So that's the reason behind the trees.
 The lighting again I met with Alicia and Victor and Amanda on this and
 I did the best I could.
 I put lighting in here, parking lot lighting, and it's in accordance with the city spec performance standards and zoning order in section 6.44.
 There is no very specific spec for the lighting just yet, and I'm open to working with the city and finding one and proposing some lights.
 We understand there'll be LED,
 you know, anything that's efficient is in our best interest as well.
 So I think we were going to work with the design build team and our architect to provide some sort of lighting options and then go before Alicia and show her what our thoughts are on the parking lot lighting.
 Around the beer garden here, you can see we have some string lights.
 One thing we put on here, which we heard from the board last time, permeable pavers will be used on this beer garden.
 So 4,400 square feet of permeable pavers here.
 We do intend to put some form of barrier around our patio, whether that's a reclaimed wooden fence out of pallets
 maybe perhaps old wine barrels, whiskey barrels with white rope, there's going to be some delineation there between the area in which you can drink alcohol and then obviously the parking lots and the pedestrian sidewalk.
 So we don't have a full commitment on what that barrier will be.
 It'll be low, it'll probably be four feet or so, and there'll be some plantings and shrubs in between, perhaps some planter boxes so people can still see in, but we do not want people gaining access from the parking lot that way.
 On the other side of the beer garden there, there's a 15-foot landscape buffer that kind of traverses the whole back here.
 We basically split half the building and increased that green area all the way up above 180, 200 feet of our structure.
 And the reason for that was, again, in hearing the board of increased green space, increased lawn space, you know, we see potential here of perhaps dog area or something of that nature.
 We've also added hedges alongside the Atlas Liquor property, which is along here, it's about 80 feet of hedges, I think that'll shield that parking lot from Atlas Liquors.
 A bike rack was mentioned at the last meeting.
 We have a 15 foot metal bike rack included at the front side of the building over here.
 We put it further back on the property just to hopefully deter any theft or anything like that.
 We also have two loading bays at the back of the property that was brought about by one of the departments.
 And then we've clearly identified our entrances.
 We've opened up our landscape buffer area to show the flow of traffic going to the parking lots.
 and how those concrete sidewalks are going to work.
 So I think overall, that is essentially the changes that were made on our behalf, and hopefully answering a lot of the questions and concerns from the board in the last meeting, and certainly all the letters we received from the various departments.
 One thing I wanna bring about in attention to from one of the departments was the traffic department.
 We understand that the traffic study that was provided is lacking in some areas, and the traffic department director suggested some mitigation efforts to help us get where we need to be.
 And I think our team is committed to doing our best effort in working with the town, I mean, the city to achieve those mitigation efforts.
 He provided essentially two pathways, not sure if everybody read the report,
 the first of which mitigation efforts are mainly using MassDOT because that road, Mystic Ave is a MassDOT road.
 So we would have to engage with them and offer some ideas in mitigating the traffic flow to our site.
 And I just know from experience there, it's a bit of a process working with MassDOT.
 So I don't wanna guarantee anything there, but I do certainly,
 I will make a concerted effort and I think the team is supportive of this to engage with MassDOT and share with them our thoughts and how to improve the flow for Mystic Ave.
 And I think the traffic department suggestions are certainly ways to improve the area.
 My concern is just MassDOT being responsive in a timely manner.
 and working with us, but it certainly will be an effort that we will put forth.
 Secondarily, the traffic director was kind enough to offer other mitigating efforts, which I see as totally doable on our behalf, mainly some barriers, some painting.
 I think he had planned for some crosswalk signage, which we are open to, we are certainly willing to do.
 our best interest to draw good traffic and good flow to this area.
 We don't want to cause any problems or issues on Mystic Ave, and we are committed to doing whatever it takes.
 I just tread with caution when it comes to the MassDOT.
 I do not want to over-promise and under-deliver in that regard.
 So I certainly appreciate the traffic director's suggestion for some other mitigating efforts, which we are committed to doing.
 Other than that, I don't see anything that came about from the various boards that, excuse me, from the various departments that we are not able to answer or flush out either in this meeting or some of the stormwater questions that came about from the engineering office.
 Those are all being worked on by our civil engineering team.
 And obviously when we go for permitting, stormwater permits are required.
 So we won't be able to do anything without those permits in place, irregardless.
 So I think we've sufficiently answered most of those questions.
 And to bring me just back to my slides here to give some detail on the landscape buffer, this is just something I brought from another development.
 So to give you an idea of what that Mystic Ave entrance, I know the board was curious on what our efforts are gonna be on that landscape buffer.
 And this is kind of just a general,
 idea, I guess, of what it might look like.
 I've highlighted here, a four foot max shrub height.
 And then on the bottom slide there it's, it shows you the nine and a half foot minimum buffer, and then various plantings and shrubs located and then you know for every
 10, 12, 30 feet, so we can try to plant a mature tree.
 However, I think with the current telephone pole that exists on one side, that's going to be very difficult to do.
 So I just wanted to give the board some idea of what our vision is for that landscape buffer on Mystic Ave.
 Go to the next slide here.
 Okay, so again, this is your front view.
 Something that came about, what I want to talk about next is the overall design and aesthetic of this building.
 And, you know, I think, I hope the board understands this, like I've mentioned several times before, there are budget constraints in this project.
 We've already done a lot and paid a lot of money to get to this point.
 And, you know, without knowing that we're actually going to build this thing it's hard to commit more capital to have the full architectural plan done.
 So, at this point, this is, you know, the best that I think that we can provide to the board to give you an idea of what we're trying to build and I have some slides to show you guys some what I think are successful metal prefab buildings and how they've been.
 built in some of the other areas of the country that I think are good examples of what we're trying to do.
 Something to understand, a key factor to our building is the prefab metal.
 The reason for that is twofold.
 One, cost, keep our costs down.
 Two, speed.
 We want to open this thing as soon as possible and we are committed to doing so.
 Um, and the big reason, uh, for us to doing that is obviously construction costs are constantly fluctuating.
 Uh, since the pandemic I I'm in this field and in this industry has been very difficult to gauge pricing and, uh, almost everything you put out to bid comes back over budget.
 So you're constantly, um,
 constantly trying to value engineer and also source materials from different areas.
 So, you know, something that might be visual to you today on this board might not be available to us.
 So we're just trying to give you a concept image of what we're trying to achieve.
 And I think the other other buildings that I show you will be helpful in
 and gaining some perspective of where we're coming from.
 But metal prefab building, it'll be a low pitched gable roof just like this.
 You'll have a second floor roof deck.
 You'll have as much glazing as we can get on the first floor to see into the property.
 You will have an outdoor patio.
 This is shown as concrete.
 Again, forgive us on that it is permeable pavers, but this is just purely a concept.
 We will try to carry the front facade with as much glazing as possible to again invite people in.
 So to give you an idea of the building itself, metal prefab building, likely metal cladding on the outside.
 We haven't decided on a color or anything yet, but I wanted to give you guys some real world examples of metal prefab buildings that I think are pretty successful.
 So here's one, Pacific Northwest.
 This is a wine market and hall.
 Again, if you just follow the architecture of this thing, it's a low pitched roof, gable roof.
 metal prefab building, a lot of glazing on the front.
 It's obviously on a main road.
 I'll show you another view of this same building.
 Why does it keep going back to that?
 Sorry.
 So this is the building again.
 low pitched roof.
 You can see they have solar on top, which we intend to do.
 HVAC mechanicals are on top.
 They obviously have some outside dining.
 They're on a main road.
 I know if you look at more recent images of this property, they have this landscape buffer here.
 It's very narrow.
 Ours is bigger, but these have grown into some vines.
 And so they've shielded some of that metal, corrugated metal paneling with some landscape screens, which I think is a real nice detail.
 They have some plantings in the front.
 And again, this is just kind of shows you a real world example.
 I'll give you one more.
 This is Surly Brewing.
 So this is a metal prefab building.
 Again, look at the roof pitch, very similar to ours.
 This has some second floor mezzanine, obviously some indoor outdoor feel and a fire pit in the front.
 So this is essentially trying to give, to give you some idea of, you know, our job
 is to create an experience for our customers.
 So I think that indoor outdoor feel is something that I think is going to be instrumental in our success.
 So any areas we can do that we're going to.
 So you know mainly our strong point I think is on the Mystic Ave elevation and that front beer garden.
 So we're going to do the best we can to keep it open, keep it airy.
 Obviously being in New England we have challenges with weather so
 know, a good part of the year, we won't be open out there.
 But it is in our best interest to introduce as much glass as possible and create that flow indoor and outdoor.
 So those are three real world examples of metal prefab buildings.
 You know, this one in particular, I don't particularly like the color of it.
 I think it's a little too dark, but the lighting of this space, I really do like.
 So I think, you know, that should help give some ideas to the board of what we're trying to achieve design-wise and aesthetically.
 I know the board has seen this before, but for anybody who hasn't, this is just to kind of give you an indication of what the inside is gonna be, large gathering spaces down the center of the beer hall, concessions on the outside,
 beer garden at the front, and then additional taps on the other side of the building and then bathrooms at the rear, and then we're gonna have some form of second floor mezzanine, again great for private events and maybe some home, some offices, ADA accessible bathrooms, we have an elevator, and then a roof deck off the front.
 Just to give you some idea, again, concept images, please forgive us, limited budget, but this tries to give you some idea of what the inside might look like.
 You know, don't get married to the flooring or the color scheme or anything like that.
 It's just to show you that people are congregated in a social setting in the middle of this building with a lot of glass, trying to feel escaped, I think, from the city and the hustle and bustle of Mystic Ave.
 The idea is to create an environment inviting inside as well as outside.
 I'll show you another view.
 This just shows you some of the beer vending stations down below.
 This is up looking from the mezzanine level, some form of television for sporting events, things of that nature.
 Um, and then one last view just shows you some seating.
 This is not the set of chairs we particularly have or the tables.
 It's just to kind of give you this communal aspect of, you know, um, bringing people together.
 And that's kind of what our motto is best brought together.
 And, um, we feel that this beer hall can certainly achieve that and, and, um, we're doing the best we can to, to make an inviting space.
 that people want to gather both inside and out.
 So to wrap this up, I kind of wanted to give you a gap timeline on where we're at and kind of how this project has come to date.
 We've applied for our liquor license, so we're still awaiting that.
 Site planning and permitting, we hope to get through as soon as possible.
 There are time constraints
 not only on our capital, we are being funded by Capital One through an SBA loan.
 And we have capital requirements and commitments that have certain deadlines to them.
 So, you know, we are running low on that timeline.
 And I think Brian has clearly communicated it from the beginning.
 His family who owns and manages the property, they have tenants and need to give them forewarning.
 And there's leases and things of that nature that are coming up
 to expire.
 So it is certainly critical path for us.
 We are at that juncture right now and need to move things along as best as possible.
 Our team is committed to doing it.
 We just hope the board sees it the same way in assisting us to get, we understand there's multiple steps still to be had, but this is one critical and important step that can get us on the right path.
 Again, I mentioned time, speed, the metal prefab buildings, we can move fast and it is in our intention completely to move fast.
 So if we can get swift approvals and permitting going as soon as possible, we will intend to build in the spring in May of 2023, and hopefully have one year of building and be open by spring 2024.
 Um, so that's what our team is committed to.
 And, um, you know, I hope with, um, the, the help of this board that, um, you know, you guys will see it the same way as we do and, and doing everything we can to improve Mystic Ave and make it, um, you know, a place for people to want to be and hopefully, uh, spur future development on the street.
 So I'm open to any questions from anybody.
 Uh, I hope I didn't take too much of your time.

 추가 세부정보와 문서를 제공해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 저는 우리의 정기적인 의제를 계속 진행하고 이 문제를 진행하기 전에 이 문제를 논의하거나 해결하고 싶은 시 직원을 초대하고 싶습니다.
 여자 친구</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2440.203s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 지금 뭔가를 추가하고 싶은 사람은 우승자 Alicia 외에는 아무도 모릅니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2445.286s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 그들은 고맙다는 말을 하고 싶어하지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2450.789s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 제안을 듣는 것이 좋다고 생각합니다.
 우리는 후보자와 협력하여 그들이 모든 질문에 답할 수 있도록 보장합니다.
 시는 왜 그런 항의를 찾고 있습니까?
 이 프로젝트를 만들기 위해 대규모 국제 회사가 메드포드에 오는 대신, 우리는 더 작고 더 많은 현지 회사와 협력하게 되어 기쁩니다.
 커뮤니티의 모든 사람들은 커뮤니티를 위한 무언가를 개발하려고 노력하고 있습니다. 그들이 엄격하게 말하는 것은 알지만 그것이 그들의 일이고 우리는 커뮤니티를 위한 무언가를 개발하기 위해 커뮤니티 구성원들과 협력하고 있기 때문에 그 점을 인정하고 싶습니다.
 우리와 다른 회의를 갖는 것이 가능합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2509.369s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 네, 아주 좋아요.
 게시하기 전에 일반적으로 몇 가지 질문을 하거나 최소한 몇 가지 예비 질문으로 포럼을 엽니다. 어쩌면 소매를 걷어붙이는 것이 아니라 몇 가지 예비 질문을 할 수도 있습니다.
 괜찮으시다면 이 문제는 제가 주도하고 싶지만 이만 놔두겠습니다.
 켈리 오브라이언이 여기 있습니다.
 내 생각엔
 나는 사람들의 관심을 훔치고 싶지도 않고, 훔칠 수도 없기 때문에 이 일을 하고 싶지 않습니다.
 또한 이 주제에 대해 완전한 논의를 하지 않을 것이라는 인상을 주고 싶지 않지만, 제 질문은 빠르게 언급된 도면을 사용했기 때문에 건축가와 대화하여 자세한 지침을 생각해 보는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다.
 이사회가 프로젝트를 적극적으로 진행하고 있지만 최종 승인에 필요한 모든 것을 아직 확인하지 못한 경우.
 어디세요? 어디?
 이 아이디어에 응답할 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2586.853s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 코로나바이러스 발병이 시작된 이후 건설 비용이 급격히 증가했습니다.
 제가 이 사업을 시작했을 때 2019년 예산을 작성했는데 우리가 본 수치를 믿을 수 없었습니다.
 그래서 우리는 SBA 대출에 적합한 자본으로 시작하여 지금의 위치에 이르렀습니다.
 그래서 우리는 앞으로 나아갈 돈이 없습니다.
 우리가 타임라인에 있는 위치를 고려하면 이것이 우리가 취할 수 있는 최선의 조치입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2629.852s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 물론이죠 브라이언.
 그런데 언제 이런 일이 일어날까요?
 우리가 이것을 통해 이것을 한다고 가정하자</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2653.798s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 예, 우리는 이 과정의 시작에 자금을 지원하겠다고 약속합니다.
 우리는 건설 회사 그룹으로서 지쳤습니다.
 설계하고 구축하는 능력입니다.
 그들은 이러한 회의의 모든 순간과 시로부터의 모든 서신을 받게 될 것입니다.
 그러므로 우리는 무엇이 필요한지 명확하게 알고 설계합니다.
 전통적으로 이전 개발에서는 귀하의 질문에 답변하려고 노력했으며 요청 시 전체 부지 계획을 제공하지 않는 경우 일반적으로 일련의 요청이 발행됩니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 귀하가 최종 계획을 볼 때 귀하의 모든 질문에 답하고 귀하에게 필요한 모든 것이 포함되어 있는지 확인하겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2689.598s">[Unidentified]</a>: 음 또 하나
 데이빗, 질문이 있어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2697.802s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 제발.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2699.523s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 그래서 나의 첫 번째 질문은 앞으로 나아갈 수 있도록 사이트를 계획하는 것이 었습니다.
 이것이 시 직원들에게 영향을 미칠지는 모르겠습니다.
 하지만 그렇게 할 수 있으려면 전체 계획을 신청하기 전에 지지자들과 협의해야 합니다.
 확장하는 데 필요한 모든 것을 생각해 봅시다.
 한 가지 문제가 있습니다. 체중계에서 볼 수 없습니다.
 이에 대해 언급할 수 없다고 말할 수는 없지만, 이전 지지자들과 우리가 그들에게 장소 계획으로 돌아가라고 요청하지 않고는 그것이 이루어질 수 있을지 확신할 수 없습니다.
 그래서 이것은 도시의 또 다른 문제입니다.
 계획된 공간의 크기를 모르고 진행해도 되나요?
 이것이 이전 팬 반응의 문제라고 생각하시나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2753.401s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 그래서 나는 그 질문에 대답하려고 노력할 수 있습니다, Jackie. 이사회가 혁신을 원하면 우리도 혁신을 시도할 수 있고 아마도 당신과 나는 같은 입장에 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2767.848s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 가끔 직원들과 이야기를 나누는데 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 덧붙이고 싶습니다.
 그래서 뭐?
 그들은 즉시 "오!"라고 말할 것입니다. 일부 내용을 변경하여 연락드리겠습니다.
 알았어
 옹호자들은 말하자면 이것이 필요하다고 거의 말하지 않습니다.
 이미 가지고 있다고 생각하시나요?
 그래서 표시되지 않습니다. 당신이 무엇을 찾고 있는지 모르겠습니다. 그렇죠?
 건조하고 단단한 병을 보여줍니다.
 글쎄, 요구 사항에 건조 통나무의 길이가 28피트이고 크지 않아야 한다고 명시되어 있다면 그것이 설계된 방식입니다.
 상황이 그렇게 되니까 계획에 보이나요, 안 보이나요?
 내 생각에 도전의 일부는 웹사이트 계획이 우리가 결정을 내릴 필요가 없는 것을 제공하지 않으면 웹사이트 계획을 보지 않도록 선택할 수 있다는 것입니다. 하지만 그렇게 말할 수는 없습니다. 그렇죠?
 예, 지원자는 피드백을 편집하고 남기기 위해 직접 우리에게 오는 경우가 많습니다.
 후보자들이 "아, 그래, 할 수 있어"라고 말할 위험이 있다고 생각합니다.
 네, 가능합니다.
 일부 지원자는 엔지니어가 작업을 수행하기 전에 모든 세부 사항을 확인한다고 말합니다.
 디자인과 시공이 관련되어 있기 때문에 다른 것 같아요.
 설계-시공 과정에서 건축업자는 실제로 설계를 생성하고 변경할 수 있습니다.
 대신에 입찰할 수 있는 100% 완성된 건축 그림이며, 그림의 내용에 따라 입찰해야 합니다.
 이것은 또한 다른 과정입니다.
 잘 모르겠습니다. 조금이나마 도움이 되었으면 좋겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2878.044s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 프로젝트 구축 과정에 대해 더 많은 정보를 추가하고 싶습니다.
 그렇기 때문에 오늘날의 환경에 대해 이 팀이 준 조언이 이 과정에서 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다. 이를 존중해야 하기 때문입니다.
 설계 및 건설 팀에서 무엇을 기대할 수 있습니까?
 어쨌든, 방해했다면 미안해요.
 계속하면 어떨 것 같아요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2904.085s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 정말 좋아요, 크리스티. 우리가 어디로 가는지 모르거든요.
 당신은 그것을 설명합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2912.793s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 나는 당신과 David와 같은 입장에 있다는 것을 알고 느끼고 있습니다.
 우선, 저는 한 걸음 더 나아가 주민으로서 이 프로젝트가 도시에 오게 되어 매우 기쁘다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 나는 여기를 보고 싶다.
 나는 지역 사회에 참여하게 되어 매우 기쁩니다.
 그 이상입니다.
 아시다시피, 도시를 위해 좋은 일을 하는 데 관심이 있습니다.
 그러나 나는 아직 이 제안을 결정하지 않았고 불편함을 느끼고 조언과 이 조언을 어떻게 받아들일지 찾고 있습니다. 그 수가 너무 많아서 최소한 시간을 들이지 못하는 것이 안타깝기 때문입니다.
 우리가 자주 보는 데모나 평면도.
 저는 건설이나 부동산 분야에서 일한다는 것을 알고 있지만 그렇게 할 수 있는 방법이 있습니다.
 원인을 짚어내기보다는 그 기대와 조건이 무엇인지 정확히 알아야 한다고 생각합니다.
 이는 향후 이 권장 사항을 강화하고 우리가 설정한 기대치에서 벗어날 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2996.344s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 크리스티가 말한 것을 볼 수 있습니다.
 그리고 나도 기분이 좋지 않은 것 같아.
 그 이유 중 하나가 부족한 것 같아요
 우리는 프레젠테이션의 정보를 보고 왜 그 정보의 부담이 스폰서가 아닌 우리에게 있는지 이해합니다.
 나는 이것이 위험하다고 생각한다.
 내가 말하는 것을 이해합니까?
 즉시 녹음해야 할 사항
 아니요, 개인적으로 저도 어디서부터 시작해야할지 모르겠습니다. 모든 것이 괜찮은 것 같습니다.
 아직 토지계획이 많이 남아있는 것 같아요.
 건물에 대해서는 전혀 걱정하지 않습니다.
 그리고 상황은 나아질 것입니다.
 예, 그렇습니다. 하지만 웹사이트를 계획하는 데에는 많은 노력이 필요합니다.
 내 생각엔 너한테 정말 필요할 것 같아
 조경 건축가이자 교통 건축가인 여러분은 이 계획이 아직 준비되지 않았기 때문에 실제로 작업하고 개선해야 합니다.
 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3084.433s">[Unidentified]</a>: 내 난초 진술을 어떻게 처리할 수 있을지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3106.893s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 우리가 무엇을 하게 될지는 모르겠지만, Gunn씨의 연설의 모든 세부사항은 나로 하여금 "아, 이것이 우리가 당신에게 보여줄 것이지만 그게 전부다"라고 생각하게 만들었습니다.
 우리는 그것들을 하나하나 관리해야 합니다.
 그것은 많은 것입니다.
 예산에 관한 귀하의 의견을 존중합니다.
 나는 이 일을 하는 것이 큰 회사가 아니라는 것을 안다.
 커뮤니티 회원인 것은 알지만, 세부 사항의 부족을 통제할 수 없을 뿐만 아니라 게시판에 스트레스를 주는 것도 이해하지 못합니다.
 저는 프로젝트 관리자이고 범위, 시간, 예산은 당신이 가장 잘 통제할 수 있는 세 가지 요소입니다.
 우리가 끝까지 간다면, 나는 우리의 역할이 프로젝트의 재정적 타당성을 보장하는 유일한 역할이 아니라고 말하지 않을 것입니다.
 예, 하지만 압박감이 있습니다.
 응, 알, 그거 나한테는 아주 안 좋은 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 아주 안 좋은 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 아주 안 좋은 것 같아.</p>

 내 생각에 우리의 가장 큰 두 가지 문제는 신뢰성인데, 이 두 가지를 결합하는 것이 가능한지 모르겠습니다.
 믿거나 말거나, 몇몇 게시물에서 당신이 라이브 음악을 연주할 계획이라고 적혀 있는 걸 봤어요.

 우리의 다른 질문: 배달에 관한 또 다른 질문입니다.
 부분적으로는 표준화되어 있기 때문에
 요점은 이 특정 위치에 마리화나가 있을 뿐만 아니라 도중에 일부 잘못된 배포도 있다는 것입니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3558.711s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 모르겠지만 그건 불공평하니까 무슨 말인지 아시겠어요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3561.733s">[Unidentified]</a>: 그뿐만 아니라 많은 일들이 함께 일어납니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3569.926s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 위원회와 마찬가지로 저도 마리화나 판매점 운영자에게 부지 계획을 검토하고 논의하도록 요청해야 한다고 생각합니다.
 교통부에서 상황을 언급하고 축소를 요청한 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 그러나 나는 Hamau씨가 이 수수께끼의 추가 전개를 알고 있다고 확신합니다.
 위험을 감수하고, 역량을 확장하고, 이에 대한 책임을 져야 합니다.
 나는 단지 여러분이 도시가 현재 일어나고 있는 발전에 대해 어느 정도 인식하고 있다는 것을 알아주셨으면 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3606.141s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 한 곳에 너무 많은 회사가 있기 때문에 도시에는 이러한 회사가 필요하다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 우리에게는 이러한 회사의 세수가 필요합니다.
 그래서 저는 이것이 도시에 좋다는 것을 압니다.
 나는 우리 지역사회에 너무 큰 상처를 주고 싶지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3627.096s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 지금보다는 낫고, 툭툭이나 버스 정류장보다 낫습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3630.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 마치... 음, 정말 큰 발전이군요, 할머니.
 구체적인 질문이 있는 것 같아요.
 왼쪽에 사진이 있는 것으로 알고 있습니다. 전신주가 있는 곳에 실제로 버스 정류장이 있습니다.
 사실 이 기둥에는 버스 정류장과 보행자 표지판이 있는 것 같아요.
 그래서 나는 알고 싶다
 계획에 버스 정류장이 포함된 경우 교차로를 교체하시겠습니까, 아니면 대중교통을 더 많이 이용하실 예정입니까?
 그 교차로가 어디에 있는지에 대한 당신의 계획을 실제로 말할 수는 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3668.897s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 우리는 그들이 원하는 도시가 무엇인지 물었지만 교차로를 추가하고 심지어 깜박이는 신호등을 추가하고 거기에 다른 도시를 추가하기로 동의했습니다.
 예, 우리는 우리 사이트에서 크로스오버를 실행할 수 있지만 이 비밀과 관련된 모든 것은 Massdot에 속하므로 이는 Massdot의 승인이며 나는 당신이 당신의 의견을 표현하고 당신이 떠나는 사람을 떠날 것이라고 그들에게 말할 것을 제안합니다.
 문제
 아마도 당신의 노력이 Masdot에 도움이 될 것입니다.
 아시다시피 그들은 주 전역에 걸쳐 장기적인 자본 개선 계획을 가지고 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 그것은 단지 이 특정 문제에 초점을 맞추는 문제일 뿐입니다.
 내 생각에 가장 큰 이유는 도시 조사 때문인 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3723.043s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 네, 그곳이 가장 위험한 곳이니까요, 건널목도 위험하지만 정말 위험한 곳이거든요. 누군가 핸콕 로드로 내려갔다면 최선의 대처 방법을 몰랐어도 괜찮았을 텐데요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3743.756s">[Victor Schrader]</a>: 네, 고칠 수 있어요.
 빅터 슈레이더입니다.
 해당 지역에 포크가 있지만 블록 중앙에 있습니다.
 이곳은 이상한 곳이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3753.961s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 글쎄, 사람들은 항상 그들 앞에 주차합니다.
 그래서 길을 건너면 보스턴에서 오는 차들이 당신을 보지 못합니다. 왜냐하면 항상 당신 앞에 미니밴이나 무언가가 주차되어 있기 때문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3767.86s">[Victor Schrader]</a>: 예, 아이디어는 핸콕 강 교차로에 더 가깝게 옮기는 것인데, 이는 지역 사회에 적합합니다.
 예, 이는 교통 패턴에 적합하지만 프로젝트에 사람들이 접근할 수 있는 거리 접근성을 더 많이 제공합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3788.954s">[Unidentified]</a>: 글쎄, 내 생각엔 그게 그들에게 문제인 것 같아.
 그게 우리의 주요 관심사입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3795.639s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 오늘밤 질문해주셔서 감사합니다.
 매우 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3802.544s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 데이빗, 이쪽은 크리스티예요.
 부서장이 왜 여기에 있는지 물어봐도 될까요?
 그들은 보통 회의에 들어오면서 "토드 블랙은 어디 있지?"라고 묻습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3813.893s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 귀하의 질문에 답변해 드리기 위해 말씀드리는 것입니다.
 나는 실제로 이 질문을 Amanda에게 물었고 그녀는 TDD가 오늘 저녁에 도시와 또 다른 회의가 있어서 참석할 수 없을 것이라고 말했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3827.868s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 그곳에 있는 동안 그는 그들의 진술 중 일부에 동의하거나 특히 그의 편지를 설명하는 데 도움을 주면서 많은 도움을 줍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3842.778s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 분명히.
 아만다, 오늘 밤에 우리와 함께하고 싶은 사람이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3851.399s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 더 이상 손이 보이지 않습니다.
 그래서 다른 일을 할게요. 우리가 이야기를 나누고 있는 동안 나는 한두 사람이 길을 걷고 있는 것을 발견했습니다.
 그래서 우리에게 여론이 있다면 손이 올라가는 것을 볼 수 있을 것입니다.
 Caleb Bachman, 얘기 좀 할까요? 기록을 위해 이름과 주소를 제공해 주실 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3870.78s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 제 이름은 Kayla Duckman이고 604 Fulton Street 근처에 살고 있습니다.
 그냥 하고 싶은 말은... 안녕하세요, 안녕하세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3877.486s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 환영. 귀하의 의견에 감사드리며 공유해 주셔서 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3880.568s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 먼저 말씀드리고 싶은 것은 어떤 분들이 제가 이 프로젝트를 지지한다고 하면 좋은 생각이고 메드포드의 성장에 정말 좋은 일이라고 생각한다는 것입니다.
 이게 지역 프로젝트인지는 모르겠지만 정말 흥미롭네요.
 그래서 계획을 볼 때 그 모습을 보니 반갑습니다.
 그건 그렇고, 나는 조경가입니다.
 회의에 앞서 계획을 검토하고 많은 질문을 했는데 대부분 답변을 받았습니다.
 나는 거리의 절반이 작동하지 않을 수도 있다고 생각하더라도 보도와 같은 것에 대해 이야기하고 싶습니다.
 예, 거기 있습니다.
 그래서 당신은 그들에 대해 생각합니다.
 예, 동의합니다. 예 예 평소보다 적습니다.
 그리고 웹사이트 레이아웃 검토 과정에서 전문적인 모습을 보여주세요.
 우리는 종종 이러한 프로젝트에 대한 추가 정보를 제공합니다.
 따라서 다시 말하지만, 신청서를 제출할 때 확인해야 할 사항을 포함해야 한다는 위원회의 견해에는 그다지 위안이 되지 않습니다.
 그러니 별로 추가되지 않을 거예요
 사실, 제가 메모한 것 중 하나는 우리가 디자인을 나중에 할 것이라는 것입니다.
 앞으로 우리는 디자인을 위한 돈을 갖게 될 것입니다.
 글쎄, 내 질문은: 왜 회의나 사전 면허 청문회 전에 이것을 할 수 없습니까?
 이것은 반격이 되어서는 안 됩니다.
 이것이 당신의 빚을 갚는 것과 관련이 있는지는 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3979.408s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 우리는 노력할 가치가 없다면 대출을 받고 싶지 않습니다.
 응 알았어.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3985.37s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 예, 이해할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3987.36s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 이것이 내가 말해야 할 것입니다.
 네, 도움이 됩니다.
 감사합니다
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3995.087s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 청중 중 다른 사람이 같은 의견을 가지고 있다면 손을 들거나 채팅에 메시지를 남길 수 있습니다.
 모두에게 1분 정도 시간을 드리겠습니다.
 이 작업을 할 때 이메일을 확인합니다.
 그래서 더 이상 제안이 표시되지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4020.742s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 네, 아주 좋아요.
 이것으로 회의의 공개 논평 섹션을 마칩니다.
 그런 다음 회의로 돌아가서 프로젝트 팀의 추가 질문에 대해 논의하고 답변할 수 있습니다.
 도움을 주고 일을 더 쉽게 만들기 위해 이 기능을 켤 수 있나요? 다른 상담사에게 연락할 수 있나요?
 아니면 상관하지 않는다면요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4051.257s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 귀속.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4052.258s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 최고.
 의회가(그리고 원탁에 참석한 사람들로부터 들은 것 같습니다) 회의를 계속하면서 이 프로젝트에 대해 어느 정도 지원을 제공할 수 있다면 아마도 그렇게 할 수 있을 것입니다.
 우리는 11월 10일에 회의가 예정되어 있으며 세부 사항을 논의하기 위해 그 회의나 프로젝트의 다음 단계가 완료되는 회의까지 계속 만날 것이라는 것을 기억합니다. 그러나 그것은 우리가 결정할 수 있는 일입니다.
 이렇게 하면 브라이언과 그의 팀은 자신감을 갖고 앞으로 나아갈 수 있습니다.
 승인은 사이트 사용에 대한 기본 지원을 제공하는 이사회를 대신하여 서명할 수 있는 편지입니다.
 사람들은 이것에 대해 어떻게 느낄 수 있습니까? 가기 전에 한 접시 주문해야 할 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4113.307s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 다른 질문을 하거나 다음과 같은 다른 질문을 해도 될까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4124.153s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 특정 부지 계획 없이 부지 계획을 승인할 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4133.658s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 말씀드리자면, 저는 실제로 그 반대를 찾고 있습니다.
 어떤 조건을 포기할 수 있나요?
 뭔가가 있어야 하는데 한계가 있으면 안다고 할 수 있다.
 우리가 논의한 내용을 반영하는 계획을 보여주시면 특정 상황에서 부지 계획 검토를 면제할 수 있으므로 특별 허가를 승인하고 발급해 드립니다. 사실 나는 책을 집어들고 페이지를 넘기기 시작했다.
 보다.
 그러므로 이사회는 원하는 것을 희생할 수 있다고 말할 수 있습니다.
 그런 다음 후보자에게 성과 요구 사항에서 면제가 필요합니까?
 그들은 우리 땅을 보고 이렇게 말합니다. 아니요, 우리는 모든 것을 존중할 수 있습니다.
 당신에게는 무엇이든 희생할 수 있는 힘이 있기 때문에 우리는 어떤 희생도 요구하지 않습니다.
 우리는 숲에 있어요
 실패하면 성능 기준에 따라 평가를 받고, 우리는 절대 뒤돌아보지 않고 '저게 현장 계획이 아니었나?
 맞습니다. 공인 건축가, 조경사 또는 전문 엔지니어가 설계한 것이 아닙니다.
 사실 이 부분은 그들이 풀어달라고 요구하는 부분이고, 사전에 계획한 사람은 아무도 없었다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4220.031s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 질문은 공식적으로 받나요?
 그랬기 때문이죠.
 내가 해냈어.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4228.567s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 하지만 그런 다음 이 결정은 귀하의 책임이 아니라 우리의 책임이라는 이전 진술로 돌아가겠습니다.
 나는 이것으로 인해 매우 편안함을 느낍니다.</p>

 우리는 모든 세부 사항에 주의를 기울이지만 나열된 건축가의 작업에는 주의를 기울이지 않기 때문입니다. 등.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4285.865s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 우리는 사이트 계획을 개발했다고 말할 수 있습니다.

 그들은 업무를 효과적으로 조정합니다.
 단순히 그 장면을 큰 이미지로 확대해 여러분이 알고 있는 시리즈에서 보실 수 있도록 하고 최대한 자세히 설명해 드렸습니다.
 아시다시피, 조경가는 우리가 사용하는 풀이나 관목의 정확한 크기를 정하지 않고 단지 제가 생각하는 가장 중요한 부분, 가장 중요한 계획, 가장 중요한 계획, 가장 중요한 계획을 설계합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4554.916s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 예, 교통 연구가 있습니다.
 그러나 Todd가 편지에서 언급했듯이 그는 프로젝트의 범위가 충분히 크지 않다고 생각했습니다.

 나는 이것이 하나의 교차로에만 적용된다고 생각합니다.
 Todd는 후보자가 편입 연구에 무엇을 포함해야 하는지 결정하기 위해 항상 자신에게 와서 함께 작업한다고 언급했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4587.216s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 그래서 제가 말하는 내용은 아주 명확하고 제 예약은 현재 트래픽, 사이트 트래픽, 풍경이라는 점을 아실 것이라고 말씀드리고 싶습니다.
 물론 나는 이 프로젝트를 좋아하고 그것이 완료되기를 정말로 원하지만 조경가에게 적합하지 않다고 생각하는 것들이 있습니다. 저는 엔지니어는 아니지만 모범 사례가 없는 것 같아서 눈에 띄는 것들이 있습니다.
 그냥, 이런 것들이 나를 불편하게 만드는 것뿐이에요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4641.953s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 내가 그랬던 것처럼 여기로 조금 내려오고 싶었다면 3년 동안 그렇게 했고 엔지니어들이 토양을 테스트하고 굴착 등 모든 것을 했습니다.
 그러면 건축가와 엔지니어는 건물의 최적 위치에 의존하게 됩니다.
 그런 다음 토양 조건과 여러분이 알고 있는 모든 것이 여기에 훌륭한 기반을 두고 있기 때문에 우리는 그곳에서 일합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4672.396s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 자, 몇 가지를 언급하겠습니다.
 거기에 도착하기 전에 말해주세요. 왜냐하면 제가 하고 싶은 것은 우리가 우리에게 중요한 모든 것을 보는 동안, 심지어 우리가 보지 못하는 것까지 보는 동안 우리가 항상 여기에 머물도록 강요하지 않을 무언가를 생각해 낼 수 있는지 알아보는 것뿐이기 때문입니다.
 나는 긍정적인 태도를 유지하고 싶고 브라이언이 개발 팀 등에 참여했기 때문에 프로젝트에 대한 우리의 긍정적인 감정을 반영할 수 있기를 바랍니다.
 아, 내가 무엇을 할 수 있나요? 5분만 물러나서 그것에 대해 이야기하고 싶다면 괜찮습니다.
 우리는 할 수 있어요, 할 수 있어요.
 하지만 탑승한 모든 사람의 말을 들은 것 같아요.
 모든 사람은 우리 앞에 있는 자료를 기반으로 이 속도에 대해 몇 가지 질문과 의구심을 가지고 있습니다.
 건축가가 만든 경우
 다음 레벨 디자인 생각해 보세요. 우리에게 돌아오면 공유할 아이디어가 약 6개 있고 경쟁할 준비가 되어 있을 것입니다. 어떻게 해야 할까요? 이 지점에 도달하려면 무엇이 필요합니까? 오늘은 이사회가 완전히 받아들여지기를 원하지 않을 것 같으니 솔직하게 말씀해 주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4742.87s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 제 생각에는 앨리스가 자신에게 필요한 것이 우리에게 있다는 것을 알았는지에 대한 몇 가지 질문에 답한 것 같습니다.
 즉, 우리가 어떤 부분에서 부족한 점을 이해하고 최선을 다했다고 설명하려고 했다면, 앨리스의 경우 특정 능력을 충족하고 상을 받기 위해 서류를 제출해야 하는데 없을 수도 있다는 거죠.
 아시다시피, 예쁜 풍경 사진이 몇 주 전에 포럼에 게시된 목록입니다.
 우리는 체크리스트와 최신 계획을 제공합니다.
 그에게 심각한 문제가 있는 경우
 우리는 몇 주 전에 경고를 받았어야 했습니다.

 일부 조언자들은 전체 목록을 작성하는 것이 불편하고 계획에 포함된 모든 항목을 정리하고 위시리스트를 작성하는 부담을 우리에게 맡겨야 한다고 생각한다고 들었습니다.
 나는 당신이 다음과 같이 우리를 반대하고 있다는 느낌이 듭니다. 지난 회의에서 당신이 나에게 말한 모든 것을 했으므로 이제는 그것으로 충분합니다.</p>

 분명히, 진정한 변화를 이루기 전에 취해야 할 몇 가지 단계가 아직 남아 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4877.935s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 여기서 뛰어내릴 수 있나요?
 이 대화가 길어질수록 느낌이 더 쉬워지고, 저는 이 자리에서 우리가 현재 설명하고 있는 과정을 시에서 설명해주기를 바랍니다.
 우리 부서장은 완화 감소에 대해 우편으로 설명하지 않을 것입니다.
 우리는 위원회에서 설정한 기준에 대한 정보를 얻지 못한 채 결정을 내려야 했습니다.
 도시에서는 대화가 어떻게 진행되나요?
 평의회로서 우리는 무엇을 해야 합니까?
 우리에게는 어떤 권리가 있나요?
 나는 공개 회의에서 그렇게 편안함을 느낀 적이 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4922.138s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 또한 Christie는 부지 검토의 한 가지 장점은 의회가 부지의 디자인과 레이아웃을 통제할 수 있다는 점이라고 말했습니다.
 클라스님 말씀대로 교통, 주차, 간판, 건축디자인이죠?
 그러면 우리는
 우리는 웹사이트 관리의 미래 등에 대해 이야기합니다. 우리의 분석 중 하나는 분명합니다. 지금 우리에게 제공되는 것이 무엇인지 확인해야 한다는 것입니다. 밤새 여기에 앉아서 주제에 대해 물어볼 수도 있지만 커뮤니티를 만들고 있습니까?
 정의냐 의무냐, 나는 당신이 무엇을 숨기고 있는지에 따라 추측할 뿐이라고 확신합니다.
 “빨리 성장하길 바라” 프로젝트.
 하지만 저는 우리가 많은 시간을 들여 만든 것을 만들고 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 우리는 도시 수준에서 많은 작업을 수행하고 있으며 포괄적인 계획을 마련하고 있습니다.
 우리는 그것을 디자인할 것이라고 확신합니다.
 우리는 커뮤니티를 돌보고 모든 것이 올바르게 이루어지도록 함으로써 이를 달성하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다.
 우리는 당신도 앞으로 나아갈 수 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 정보가 충분하지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4985.775s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 우리는 달리 제안하지 않습니다.
 우리는 건축법이나 기타 사항을 무시하라고 요구하지 않습니다.
 사실 저는 이 프로젝트가 도시와 지역에 더 좋을 것이라고 생각합니다.
 오늘 밤에 이런 일이 발생하지 않으면 기술 공항과 버스 정류장은 향후 5년 동안 영향을 받지 않을 것입니다.
 임대 옵션이 있습니다. 그것이 바로 일어나는 일입니다.

 이것은 옵션입니다.</p>

 그래서 내 생각엔 이 도시가, 알리샤였다면,
 우리가 가고 있는 곳으로 돌아갈 수 있다면 블룸버그 대통령처럼 우리를 이끌어주실 수도 있겠지만, 우리가 겪어야 하고 특정 조건에 따라 선택의 여지가 없다고 말해야 하는 몇 가지 조건이 있습니까?</p>

 하지만 그것은 정확해야 하고, 미적 기준을 충족해야 하며,
 건축 자재를 평가하고 승인해야 합니다.
 이 건물에 대한 사진이 없습니다.
 그들은 재료를 정의합니다.
 따라서 프레젠테이션에서 일부 요소가 누락되었습니다.
 나의 아주 짧은 생애 동안 우리는 그런 상황에 직면한 적이 없었지만, 3~4년 동안
 우리는 후보자이며 계속해서 조언을 제공하고 결정을 내릴 것이며 항상 친구가 될 것입니다.
 피드백을 원했던 사람들이 돌아와서 훌륭한 일을 해냈고 우리는 문제를 해결했습니다.
 그래서 이것은 다른 상황이고 우리에게는 특별한 상황입니다.
 이번 호에서는 Tenyu Kuulda-La Ako Todemos Thudmose의 적절한 후보에 대한 논란이 일어나고 있습니다.
 목록이 너무 길면 어떻게 자격을 얻나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5412.2s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 알았어
 그래서 두 가지가 있습니다.
 위원회는 이전에 필수 정보를 제공하지 않았다는 이유로 요청을 거부했습니다.
 이 사건에서는 한 장소에서의 스포츠 연습을 거부해 해당 장소를 법원에 가져갔고, 신청인이 스포츠 연습에 동의한 뒤 다시 심의회에 회부됐다.
 물을 테스트하기 위해 구멍을 뚫습니다.
 비행기 안에서 보내셨는지 모르겠지만 이건 2019년 발행물이고 2020년에 보냈습니다.
 그래서 우리가 지원자에게 제시하는 미적 기준을 살펴보았는데, 그것이 바로 이 분야의 기준입니다.
 제 6.48조는 말합니다.
 제안된 프로젝트의 위치, 규모, 디자인, 건축 자재 및 운영 특성은 인접 자산이나 자연 환경의 적합성 또는 자연 지역의 개발 및 건설에 큰 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
 그는 이웃들의 화합과 화합, 그리고 외부 건축 자재의 크기와 양, 밀도에 대해 계속 이야기했습니다.
 일반 계획 및 시가 승인한 기타 계획의 목표와 목표에 대한 헌신.
 물론 그렇습니다. 어떤 이유에서든 이미 알려져 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 이것은 의회의 의견이 아닙니다.
 우리는 철보다 벽돌을 좋아합니다.
 이웃집이고 이웃의 금속 구조가 마음에 들지 않으면 그 집이 그 동네에 맞지 않는다는 것을 알게 될 가능성이 있습니다.
 그러나 디자인 다이어그램과 재료의 예를 제공합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5520.795s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 나에게는 앨리스도 없고, 건물도 없고, 그림도 없습니다. 나에게 있어 그것은 단지 아이디어일 뿐이고 현실을 반영하지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5531.644s">[Unidentified]</a>: 그게 내가 들었던 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5533.146s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 그들이 바로 이 건물을 지을 계획이라는 것을 알고 있기 때문에 정말로 그렇게 말하는 겁니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5538.43s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 당신이 알고 있다면 그렇지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5540.908s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 컨셉 이미지라고 말씀드렸으니 보시는 실제 이미지와 혼동하지 마세요.
 그런데 네, 그리고 자세히 보니 이렇게 생긴 낮은 지붕의 조립식 철골 건물이었습니다.
 아직 특정 색상을 선택하지 않았습니다.
 예산 제약으로 인해 시간이 지남에 따라 실제 건설 시간이 늘어나면서 제가 말하는 정면 유리의 양은 단지 전체 커튼월(아마도 75%)을 볼 수 있기 때문에 내부의 느낌을 줍니다.
 이 사진은 우리가 얻을 수 있는 것과 가장 가깝습니다.
 이는 우리가 계획과 도면을 제공한 Whitlock의 디자인 팀이 제공한 건축 조각을 기반으로 합니다.
 프레임이 실제 색상과 일치하는 것을 원하지 않습니다.
 사실 우리는 많이 발전할 수 있다고 생각해요.
 그래서 여기서는 정의가 부족하다고 생각하는데, 조립식 철구조물입니다.
 기본적으로 이러한 유형의 아키텍처와 유사합니다.
 천장의 색깔처럼 특정한 색깔의 스티커처럼 보이길 원하지 않습니다.
 이것부터 시작하려고 했지만, 우리가 만들고 있는 것과 같지 않다면 조언을 드려 죄송합니다.
 그러나 이것은 지표입니다.
 이것은 단지 색상 차트이므로 상황이 바뀔 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5612.705s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 얼마나 크나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5614.228s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 사이즈가 있습니다.
 내 말은, 그게 우리가 승인을 받은 이유야.
 건설 비용이 크게 달라질 것이라고 다시 말하고 싶습니다.
 이곳은 우리가 실제로 기술적 가치를 갖고 있는 유일한 곳이지만 그게 전부입니다.
 이것은 건물입니다.
 이것이 우리가 요청한 것입니다.
 우리는 그것을 설계하기 위해 건축가에게 돈을 지불합니다.
 Brian이 지적했듯이 우리는 토양 테스트를 기반으로 이 현장에서 많은 과정을 거쳤습니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 테스트 구멍을 뚫고 있습니다.
 우리는 모든 것을 해냈습니다.
 알다시피, 우리는 방금 도착했어요
 알다시피, 이것이 우리가 당신에게 제공할 수 있는 최선입니다.
 나는 의회에서 우리가 공원과 자연을 그리워한다고 말하는 것을 들었습니다.
 저는 우리가 의회와 협력하여 효과가 있는 것을 찾고 개선할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 하지만 저는 항상 조언 같은 것을 듣습니다. 하지만 아시다시피 저는 전체 과정을 존중하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5672.073s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 내 말은, 흥미로운 점은 제가 말했듯이 저는 건축 능력이 없다는 것입니다.
 나에게 건물은 건물이다.
 요즘 사이트 레이아웃과 디자인 방식에 문제가 있다는 것을 깨닫고 있는 것 같습니다.
 글쎄, 아까 말했듯이, 계획을 세운 엔지니어인 당신을 데려와서,
 귀하와 전화 대화를 연구하는 교통 엔지니어는 그들이 생각하는 것을 이해하는 데 도움이 되므로 매우 도움이 될 것입니다.
 길 중앙에 위치하지 않은 건물 입구와 주차장을 살펴보았습니다.
 우리는 Alika가 방금 언급한 또 다른 프로젝트와 운송 엔지니어가 "알겠습니다"라고 말하는 것을 얼마나 듣고 싶었는지에 대해 두 시간 동안 이야기했습니다.
 나는 좁고 밝은 연석을 만들기 위해 5피트의 연석을 만들었습니다. 아시다시피, 이 사이트의 제작자가 이 사이트가 흥미로운 이유를 듣고 싶습니다. 보행자의 움직임의 관점에서. 글쎄, 전면 주차 실속을 일으키는 많은 것들이 있습니다.
 무슨 일이에요? 구내에 3대의 차량이 주차되어 있습니다.
 그것은 재앙이 될 것입니다.
 지난번에 이웃집 울타리에 차를 주차했을 때 보안 장치가 없는 걸 알고 있다고 하셨죠? 이것이 정말 모범 사례입니까?
 모르겠습니다.
 내 말은, 우리를 불편하게 만드는 것들이 있다고 생각합니다.
 나는 그것을 믿는다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5795.949s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 그럼에도 불구하고, 나도 내가 무슨 말을 하는지 알고 있고, 당신도 나를 알고, 당신도 Alice를 알고 있습니다. 우리가 이 프로젝트를 전체적으로 본다면 이렇게 해서는 안 된다고 스스로에게 말합니다.
 모르겠습니다.
 내 말은, 이 플랫폼의 모든 사람들이 분명히 불편하다는 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5822.296s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 당신이 어떤 동물을 좋아하지 않는다고 들었는데, 진지하게, 스크린샷 공유를 중단할 수 있나요?

 이것이 우리의 임무인가요?
 우리와 우리의 일은 무엇입니까?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5857.27s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 글쎄요, 우리가 불편했다는 뜻이라면 저는 그 지역에 주차가 허용되는지 확인하지 않았습니다.
 그는 말했습니다: 맞습니다. 주차장과 이웃 사이에 점검이 필요합니다.
 당신이 말한다면
 홀이 좁아야 한다는 점에는 동의하지만, 중앙에 있는 섬을 더 크게 만들지 말고, 이웃과 멀리 옮기고 스크린을 이웃에 놓으십시오.
 당신이 할 수 있는 일은 다음과 같습니다.
 그들은 돌아와서 우리가 그 부동산을 소유하는 것이 합리적이며 그 부동산을 그에게 주어야 한다고 말했습니다.
 그들이 이것을 하고 싶어한다는 것은 이상하지만 그들은 할 수 있습니다.
 그러나 이것은 이 포럼이 일반적으로 다루는 구체적인 내용입니다.
 이 루트를 확인하고 싶었는데 자전거 라켓이 보이지 않더군요.
 그가 당신과 대화를 나누고 당신이 원하는 것이 무엇인지 말해 준다면, 제가 그러한 변화를 만들어서 몇 주 후에 당신에게 다시 연락을 드릴 것입니다. 그리고 나서 당신이 말하기 시작하면 이것이 우리가 보고 싶은 변화입니다.
 이것이 이 카드가 일반적으로 하는 일입니다.
 내 말은 Emily와 George가 초보자라는 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5928.11s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 그것을 나열할 수 있나요? 내 말은, 그게 우리가 하고 싶은 일이 아니라는 걸 알지만, 우리는 또한 프로젝트에 칼을 넣고 싶지도 않습니다. 아시다시피 저는 보행자 주차, 보도 설계에 대해 이야기하고 있는데 그것이 제가 보기에 문제이고 조경과 관련이 있습니다.
 그들이 우리와 계속 일하고 싶어하고 돌아와서 그러한 측면을 실제로 살펴보고 소방서와 협력하기를 원한다면 그것은 나에게 좋지 않습니다.
 이 프로젝트의 모범 사례를 따르지 않는 것 같습니다.</p>

 이것이 우리의 출발점이 될 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6001.06s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 아만다를 제안합니다. 아니면 아만다, 메모할 준비가 되셨나요?
 왜냐하면 이 문서를 보고 빨간색으로 추가할 수 있다는 의미이기 때문입니다.
 그러면 의회가 그것을 보게 될 것입니다.
 내가 이걸 하길 바라나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6019.222s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 의회는 이에 만족하는가?
 왜냐하면 David가 이 놀라운 프로젝트를 성공시키기 위해 몇 가지 예비 문서를 요청했기 때문입니다.
 하지만 어쩌면 이것이 게임을 더 편안하게 만들 수도 있습니다.
 이것은 후보자의 문제가 아니라 데이빗의 문제입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6040.314s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 나는 이 아이디어를 좋아한다. 이번 사건 당시 누가 당신 머리에 총을 겨눴는지는 잘 모르겠습니다. 아름다운 작은 섬을 이곳으로 옮기면 이렇게 역겨운 소리는 들어본 적이 없습니다.
 코스를 바꾸면, 아무도 말하지 않고, 말하고 있고, 깨뜨리고 있습니다. 알다시피, 앨리스가 거기에 놓으면 애초에 거기에 두었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6076.03s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 그것은 나에게 좋다.
 임대에 대해 제가 생각하는 것은 소유자가 소유할 기회가 있고 빈 땅이 필요하지 않다는 것입니다.
 그래서 그들은 우리가 진행하는 것을 원하지 않았고 우리는 동의했고 결국 부지 계획 조사는 실패했습니다.
 주민들이 이사를 가거나 양보를 요구하고 있는데, 솔직히 제 집에는 방폭 울타리가 쳐져 있습니다.
 이것이 내가 온 곳입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6102.108s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 글쎄요, 제 말이 맞다면 무단 침입으로 부인하실 수 있겠네요.
 그래서?
 우리는 귀하의 사이트 계획을 거부할 수 없으며 해당 사이트가 커뮤니티에 더 적합하다는 것을 보장할 수 있습니다.
 귀하의 사이트 계획을 거부할 수 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6115.222s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 응 알, 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아, 알은 나한테는 정말 안 좋은 것 같아, 앨 같아, 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아, 알이 나한테는 정말 안 좋아 보이는 것 같아,
 어쩌면 그것은 조건부 입학 측면에서 살펴봐야 할 것일 수도 있습니다. 평소보다 더 많은 조건이 있을 뿐이며 팬이나 골키퍼에 대한 조건, 보행자 문제, 협의회가 만족할 수 있는 현장 보행자 문제가 될 수 있습니다. 이것은 이제 예전보다 더 바람직하고 인기가 높습니다.
 그런데 우리가 조건부 입학을 요구해서 이렇게 해준다면 다른 이사들은 어떻게 생각할까요? 그것이 그들을 불편하게 만드는가?
 이에 대해 고개를 끄덕이거나 댓글을 달 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6172.999s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 네, 저는 이것이 좋은 접근 방식이라고 생각합니다.
 내 생각에는 그들이 우리에게 더 많이 참여하도록 강요하는 상황이 있다고 생각합니다.
 그리고 이러한 보안 게이트가 있으면 프로젝트가 진행됨에 따라 더 편안해질 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6194.228s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 예, 그것은 여전히 ​​예술적인 프리젠테이션이었고 저녁의 목표를 달성했습니다.
 아시다시피, 이를 통해 우리는 임무를 완수할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6206.716s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 도움이 된다면 정말 팀원들과 상의를 해요. 제한된 영역에서 일하는 우리 팀 게시판에서는 프로젝트를 받기 싫을 때 이런 질문이 자주 나오지 않거든요.
 그래서 그들은 종종 그렇습니다.
 업데이트된 계획 제안은 검토 및 승인을 위해 팀에 전송되며, 여기에는 여러 가지 기준이 설정되어 있지만 더 중요한 것은 이것이 그룹이 보지 못한 모든 제안이며 팀이 만들어야 한다는 점입니다.
 우리는 여기서 개발하는 데 동의한 사람들이므로 여전히 건축 허가가 필요합니다.
 건축 허가를 받으려면 먼저 도시 엔지니어의 승인을 받아야 합니다.
 따라서 보건소방부가 공식적인 계획을 반드시 승인할 것이고 나도 승인해야 합니다.
 그러니 돌아가서 여기서 말하지 않으면 내 서명을 받을 수 없습니다.
 그들이 돌아와서 그들의 계획을 의회에 제출하기를 원한다면
 그들이 직면한 상황은 모든 조건이 충족될 때까지 건축 허가를 받지 못할 것이기 때문에 조건을 부과할 수 있습니다.
 그는 실제로 상황을 기존 시점과 연결한다고 말합니다.
 그래서 건축허가, 건축허가, 임대허가가 있게 됩니다.
 귀하와 지역 의회가 조건을 갖춘 경우
 아만다와 나는 뒤에서 무슨 일이 일어났는지 이야기를 나눕니다.
 건축허가를 신청하기 전에 무엇을 해야 하나요? 임대 면허를 취득하려면 어떤 유형의 건축을 완료해야 합니까?
 그래서 사무실에 있는 서류와 분리했어요.
 따라서 건축 허가를 신청하기 전에 이러한 문제를 연구하는 것이 일반적이므로 옵션으로 이 위원회에 다시 참여할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6342.88s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 위기에 대한 댓글이 그 예이기 때문에 그들을 다시 불러올 수 있는 상황을 상상하고 있는 것 같아요.
 아시다시피 이것은 우리가 제공해야 할 구체적인 목록은 아니지만 누군가의 비하인드 스토리나 부두에 대한 이해에 대해 더 많이 듣고 싶기 때문에 그들이 우리에게 다시 돌아오기를 바랍니다.
 우리는 모든 요소입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6372.586s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: Lisa가 말했듯이 전화를 받는 사람은 도로 및 조경 엔지니어인 경우가 많습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6379.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 그러나 이론적으로 이것은 오늘 밤 우리가 말할 단어입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6383.021s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 내 생각엔 그럴 것 같아, 에밀리.
 그렇다면, 그렇다면 우리는 그들이 옳은지 알아내려고 노력해야 할까요?
 우리는 Claes에 합류하고 싶습니다. 우리와 함께 시작하고 싶으신가요?
 몇 가지 질문에 답해 드릴까요? 오늘 밤에 몇 가지 질문에 답해 주실 수 있을까요?
 나중에 뭔가 알고 싶을 수도 있습니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 그 팀, 아마도 우리 팀 중 하나, 그리고 특정 기능을 다룰 수 있습니다. 그리고 그것이 잠재적인 제3의 팀이라면 우리는 브라이언과 카일과 협력하여 그 일을 먼저 완료할 것입니다.
 이 직업이 당신에게 적합합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6424.193s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 스폰서에 대해 미리 물어봐도 될까요?
 틀림없이.
 내 말은, 이것이 팬들에게 효과가 있는지 물어봐야 할까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6434.515s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 아, 그렇죠.
 주요 질문
 우리가 여기서 논의하고 있는 내용에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6440.436s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 네, 물론입니다. 이 문제에 대해서는 상사와 논의해야 하지만 앞으로 나아갈 수 있다고 보장할 수는 없습니다.
 하지만 난 아이디어가 마음에 들어요, 앨리스. 당신도 알고 있고, 당신이 무슨 말을 하는지 정확히 알지만, 우리는 건축 허가와 그 모든 것을 준수해야 할 것입니다.
 모든 엔지니어와 도시의 모든 지역.
 이것이 프로세스의 다음 단계입니다.
 저는 전화통화에서 패트릭 고로스(Patrick Goros)를 보았습니다. 아시다시피 이것은 218,000명이 참여한 건축 계획이었고, 50,000개의 엔지니어링 아이디어가 있었고 우리는 그 돈을 쓸 준비가 되어 있었습니다.
 오늘 밤 의회에서 권장하는 순서대로
 주인은 우리가 지금 가지고 있는 것을 계속 갖고 싶어할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6498.75s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 브라이언, 우리 길을 다시 따라갈 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6505.435s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 우리가 계속 돌아올 수 있는 조건이 필요한 경우</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6512.548s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 이런 일이 일어날지, 이 프로젝트가 일어날지 안 일어날지는 모르겠지만, 돌아오는 사람들의 조건이 무엇인지 모르기 때문에 이것이 우리의 의심을 좀 더 자세히 밝혀줄 뿐이라고 생각합니다.
 예, 그렇게 하세요.
 부정할 수 있는 것은 없다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6532.233s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 그러다가 이런 곳들에 대해 이야기하면 어떻게 될지 들었어
 이 또한 변경될 수 있고, 주차 공간도 변경될 수 있으며, 보도도 변경될 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6547.277s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 예, 모든 것이 여기에 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6552.621s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 글쎄요, 저희 팀인 VC와 함께 무대 뒤에서 일어나는 모든 일에 대해 모두가 같은 생각을 갖고 있으며 저희는 앞으로 나아갈 준비가 되어 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6562.657s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 건축가와 사람들이 더 자세한 내용을 알면 상황이 바뀌지 않을까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6568.02s">[Unidentified]</a>: 물론 가능합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6570.141s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 그래서 우리는 그렇게 하고 싶습니다.
 지금 하도록 요청할 수도 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 단지 그 일부가 되기를 원합니다. 그리고 그들이 오면 상황은 바뀔 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6577.765s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 그런데 이것이 여러분께 큰 문제라면 사과드리고 싶은데, 왜 이런 조건들을 고려하고 이 위원회가 승인되었는지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6589.531s">[Unidentified]</a>: 솔직히.
 거기서 우리는 무엇을 하나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6596.407s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 내 말은, 브라이트, 내 생각엔 그게 받아들여질 것 같아.

 기다리고 있어요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6612.629s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 그게 내가 하는 일이기 때문에 고통을 느끼지만, 새로운 개발자로서 그러한 과정에 최대한 참여하는 것이 더 좋습니다. 왜냐하면 당신이 컷을 만들고 건축가와 엔지니어가 다시 하도록 했기 때문입니다.
 그림 그리는 데 쓰는 돈 때문에
 앞으로 나아갔다가 되돌아가서 변화하는 것에 비하면 이것은 동전에 불과합니다.
 이렇게 생각하시면 될 것 같아요. 당신도 이제 개발자입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6648.224s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 그게 바로 우리가 오늘 밤 여기에 있는 이유입니다.
 내 말은, 우리가 해냈다는 거야.
 우리는 이를 조건으로 받아들이고 싶습니다.
 나는 이것을 여러 번 해왔고 이것이 다른 커뮤니티가 그들의 제안을 관리하고 승인하는 방법입니다.
 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 탈출구야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 큰 문제야, 지원이야, 훌륭해, 훌륭해, 훌륭해, 훌륭해, 훌륭해, 훌륭해 대단해
 Brian이 말했듯이 우리는 건축가, 디자이너, 엔지니어를 영입할 수 있는 능력을 갖추고 있습니다.
 여러분이 보고 싶은 모든 것을 알려줄 수 있도록 몇 가지 조언과 명확성이 필요합니다.
 우리는 이런 일이 반복해서 일어나는 것을 원하지 않습니다.
 우리는 귀하가 커뮤니티에 관심을 갖고 최고의 제품을 보고 싶어한다는 것을 이해합니다.
 나는 당신과 내가 전적으로 동의한다고 생각합니다.
 저는 브라이언의 상황과 그가 직면하고 있는 어려움, 그리고 그에 대처하는 방법에 대해 말씀드리고 싶습니다.
 우리는 최종 계획은 물론 현장 계획 등을 보는 것을 꺼리지 않습니다.
 어쩌면 나는 당신과 가장 많이 교류하는 사람일지도 모릅니다.
 클리즈님, 소식을 들으니 반갑습니다.
 무슨 생각을 하는지, 어떤 고민을 하고 있는지 들어주는 게 정말 도움이 되는 것 같아요.
 저는 이를 엔지니어들에게 다시 가져오고 우리가 돌아왔을 때 몇 가지 맥락과 답변을 제공할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 내 생각에 브라이언의 요점은 그가 조금 진정할 필요가 있다는 것입니다.
 알다시피, 그것은 모든 사람의 시간 낭비가 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6743.47s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 나는 이것이 칭찬할 만하다고 생각한다.
 다시 말해 보세요. 다시 말해 보세요.
 나는 이 프로젝트를 좋아한다.
 나는 비어 가든에 앉아 있는 내 모습을 상상했고, 언젠가 이런 일이 곧 일어나기를 바랐다.
 내가 보고 싶은 건 팀뿐이야
 전문가 팀이 함께 협력하여 이러한 모든 회사의 모범 사례를 설명하는 웹 사이트 계획을 만들었습니다.

 예.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6805.275s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 이것은 이해할 수 있습니다.
 이는 우리가 현지 법률을 준수하고 적절하다고 믿는 것을 제공한다는 것을 의미합니다.
 물론 문제가 있고 변경하고 싶다면 논의할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 이것이 바로 우리가 엔지니어들에게 보답하는 방법입니다. 엔지니어들은 주어야 합니다.
 우리에게는 우리를 안내하는 시 조례가 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6826.285s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 나는 진보보다 더 나은 것을 찾고 있습니다.</p>

 다른 글꼴이나 다른 색상 등을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 왔다 갔다 해야 한다는 건 알지만 이렇게 하면 명판에 원래 텍스트와 다르게 쓰여진 내용을 이해하는 데 도움이 됩니다.</p>

 허가의 문제가 아닙니다.
 문제는 상인이 그렇게 하기를 원하는지 아닌지입니다.
 우리는 물어볼 수 있습니다.
 따라서 해당 열의 소유자가 누구인지에 따라 다릅니다.
 이는 전국 네트워크 게이트웨이 또는 Verizon일 수 있습니다.
 그런 다음 이 어댑터를 제자리에 배치하도록 요청해야 합니다.
 따라서 에너지는 항상 최고조에 이릅니다.
 이 샤프트를 제거하면 이 변압기를 설치하기 위해 지하, 지하 및 블록 근처의 샤프트에서 나올 것입니다. 이 변압기는 여전히 우리와 함께 어딘가에 배치해야 합니다.
 베개. 우리는 정원에 덤불과 그 주변의 모든 것을 놓아야 했지만 그래도 기둥보다는 나았습니다.

 나는 당신이 올바른 길을 가고 있다고 봅니다. 하지만 저는 당신이 좀 더 명확하게, 즉 실제로 사람들을 이끄는 것 이상의 응집력 있는 혈액 응고 계획을 알기를 바랍니다.
 내 말은, 그것이 어떻게든 보도와 통합될 수 있다면 훨씬 더 좋을 것이라는 뜻입니다.
 예를 들어, 주차장에 걸어가는 사람들이 나를 괴롭힌다.
 아시다시피 보행자와 자동차 사이에는 분명히 충돌이 있을 것입니다.
 모범 사례 중 하나는 다음을 사용하는 것입니다.
 반경이 좁은 곡선 단면의 일종입니다.
 내 말은, 우리가 정말 문제에 빠진 걸까?
 하지만 아시다시피 반경이 작을수록 자동차는 들판을 가로질러 더 느리게 움직입니다.
 제 생각에는 이것이 디자인 변경이라고 생각합니다. 아시다시피 많은 업무 윤리가 필요하지는 않지만 이 사이트의 보안과 사용자 경험도 향상됩니다.
 다른 것이 있나요?
 아, 누군가 전화해서 여기에 버스 정류장이 있다고 했는데, 여기로 운전해 보면 아마도 버스가 움직이는 사진이나 일종의 디자인을 보여주는 제스처가 있다는 것을 알 수 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7203.82s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 그들에게 더 명확한 조언을 제공하기 위해 우리는 무엇을 할 수 있습니까?
 저는 이것이 우리가 이 모든 아이디어에 대해 물어봐야 할 질문이라고 생각합니다.
 어떻게 이것을 가능하게 할 수 있습니까?
 이것을 어떻게 증명할 수 있습니까?
 따라서 우리가 그를 다시 원하기 때문에 우리의 조건 중 하나가 충족되면 우리는 그에 대해 매우 명확하기 때문에 이 사람이 정말 훌륭하다고 말할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7224.448s">[v8aFu2OAn8o_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 제 생각에는 이것이 바로 제가 생각하고 있던 질문인 것 같습니다.
 그리고 당신은 어떻게 그렇게 할 수 있었나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7232.817s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 저와 함께 일하세요. 똑같은 일이기 때문에 없애겠습니다. 하지만 도시 교통 엔지니어나 교통 관리자와 함께 일하면 여전히 혼란스럽다고 생각합니다. 하지만 조금 지저분하게 유지하고 조금 지저분하게 유지하되 약간 지저분하게 유지하되 약간 지저분하게 유지하되 현재 버스의 편안함을 유지하면서 혼돈을 일부 유지하되 현재 도시의 혼란을 유지하면서 현재 버스의 편안함을 유지하세요.
 나는 이것이 첫 번째 단계라고 생각합니다.
 그럼 알잖아
 자전거 주차에 대한 제안이 있습니다.
 어쩌면 그것은 좋은 것일 수도 있습니다.
 하지만 아마도 현재로서는 단순히 기존 버스 전용차로를 유지하는 것만으로도 충분할 것입니다.
 왜냐하면 이곳이 세균이 있는 곳이라는 것을 기억하려고 노력하기 때문입니다.
 당신은 멀리 있습니다.
 따라서 버스 정류장 16개를 건설하라고 하면 말도 안 되고 실패할 것입니다.
 그래서 어쩌면 이 전통이 먹힐 수도 있겠네요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7287.958s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 여기서 덧붙이고 싶은 말은, 누군가 동의한다면 이것이 매스닷을 거쳐야 하는 과정이라는 것은 알지만, 매스닷 방식으로 웹사이트를 개발할 때에는 대개 거쳐야 하는 과정이 있다고 생각합니다.
 많은 도시들도 때때로 이곳을 통과합니다.
 그런 식이라서 그런 것 같아요
 교통부가 운영하는 주요 고속도로에는 보행자 편의시설, 횡단보도, 더 밝은 조명 또는 기타 개선이 필요합니다.
 이런 과정이 꼭 이루어져야 한다고 생각해요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8451.753s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 조건으로 변경하거나 그대로 둘 수 있는지 궁금했습니다.
 어느 길로 가야할지 모르는 규칙에 따른 것도 포함됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8471.473s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 네, 규칙을 따르면 된다고 생각합니다만, 좀 더 듣고, 개선 방안을 생각해 실천에 옮길 수 있으면 더 좋을 것 같습니다.
 저는 귀하의 고객들이 이 제품을 좋아할 것이라고 생각하며, 적어도 마케팅 목적으로는 그럴 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8493.7s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 아, 네, 동의합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8494.761s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 이것은 귀하의 인구 통계입니다. 아시죠?
 네, 사업에 도움이 될 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8499.624s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 제가 우리 사무실의 경제 개발 기획자라고 말하지 마세요. Yvette는 종종 공공 장소에 서고 후원 행사에 참여했기 때문에 자신이 아는 것을 기꺼이 공유했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8526.55s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 뭐, 나머지 부분은 좋다고 생각해서 항상 경영진의 승인을 받아요.

 우리와 함께 여행할 수는 있지만 소방서는 무해해 보입니다.
 기술이 당신에게 문제가 되지 않습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8556.198s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 아니요, 그들은 우리 토목 엔지니어 팀과 협력하고 있습니다.
 그들은 그것을 보고 알았습니다. 그러나 비를 통제하는 데 있어서 성경은 너무 표준적이어서 그들 모두는 허가를 빼앗겼습니다.
 우리가 건설해야 하는 기존 건물을 철거할 권리가 있다면 허가를 받고 영향을 관리할 계획이 있어야 합니다.</p>

 우리가 다시 만날 때.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8590.633s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 저는 적어도 다음 계획에서는 교통부가 권고한 완화 조치를 시행할 수 있을 것이라고 믿습니다.
 알다시피, 우리는 그것을 나열하고 계획에 추가할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8608.464s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 건물의 크기를 고려할 때 태양광 발전이 필요한가요?
 태양에너지는 준비됐나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8616.895s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 나는 건물에 태양광을 설치할 계획을 갖고 있는 후보자들과 이 문제에 대해 논의한 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8622.0s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 그는 원한다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8624.622s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 나는 그것이 필요하다고 생각한다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8626.984s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 태양광 요구 사항 예.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8628.145s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 태양광 규제는 해당 지역의 레이아웃에 대한 모든 것을 염두에 두고 설계되었다는 점에 유의하는 것이 중요합니다. 작은 아파트 외에도 태양 에너지가 필요합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8642.659s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 그 보유</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8643.486s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 상황은 그들이 탐구해야 하고, 우리에게 보여주어야 하고, 태양광을 설치할 수 없다고 생각한다면 그 이유를 우리에게 보여 주어야 한다는 것입니다.
 그렇지 않으면 계속 진행하세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8656.957s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 그럼 이런 일은 어디서 일어나는 걸까요?
 건축 허가에 관해 이야기하고 있는 건가요, 아니면 이 문제가 논의 목록에 포함되어야 할까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8667.303s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 실제로 건축허가 부분부터 메드포드 절차, 메드포드 지역, 춘닝까지 어떻게 맞는지, 어떻게 맞는지, 어디에서 진행되는지 잊어버린 부분까지 알아봅니다.
 인정합니다. 어디에 있었는지 기억이 나지 않습니다. 개조 전에는 계획되지 않았으며 건축 허가 요건이었기 때문에 건축 부서에서 살펴보았습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8718.726s">[David Blumberg]</a>: Kelly, 마지막 순간에 공유하고 싶은 의견이 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8723.488s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 아니요, 정말 유용합니다.
 우리가 달성하고 싶은 목표를 간접적으로 달성하기 위해.
 오늘 저녁 시간을 내어 이러한 문제를 설명하는 데 도움을 주신 위원회에 감사드리고 싶습니다.
 오르콘</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8737.468s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 물론이죠.
 간접적으로 이 지점에 도달했다고 생각합니다. 사실입니다. 하지만 다음 단계가 무엇인지, 그리고 그것이 모든 사람에게 효과가 있는지 확인하려고 노력하고 있습니다.
 이것이 우리가 목표로 하는 바가 되기를 바랍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8755.525s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 복원할 수 있는 방법이 있나요?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8854.799s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 이 표현은 우리가 거절했다는 뜻인가요?
 내 생각엔 그것이 우리가 피하려고 하는 일이기 때문이다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8860.303s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 네, 걱정됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8862.445s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 하얀색</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8864.066s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 직원이 건축 허가 신청서에 서명하기 전에 위원회의 승인이 필요할 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8872.231s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 건축허가를 받기 전.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8877.749s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 그들이 건축 허가를 발급할 때까지, 즉 우리가 이러한 사항을 조사할 때까지는 건축 허가를 발행할 수 없다는 뜻입니다. 어쨌든 우리는 이를 조사할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8912.743s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 그래서 누군가는 아만다라고 말할 것이고, 누군가는 아마도 재평가하여 이사회에 보고할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8932.333s">[Unidentified]</a>: 하얀색</p>

 같은 운전면허를 가진 사람들에게 어디에 사는지 물어보는 것이 말이 되나요?
 이것이 무슨 뜻인가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8951.975s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 전문 진로상담사가 될 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8966.346s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 전문 디자이너와 엔지니어를 만나보실 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8968.787s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 글쎄, 내 말은, 운동 면허증이나 자격 증명에 주의하라는 뜻입니다.
 틀림없이.
 그게 다야.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8982.574s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 아마도 이것이 포함되어야 할 것입니다. 왜냐하면 저는 우리가 이 두 로마인에 대해 이야기하고 있다고 생각하지 않기 때문입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8988.817s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 이 말을 다시 해도 될까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8992.119s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 우리는 전체 교통 계획을 알고 싶기 때문에 엔지니어들이 나중에 의견을 말하고 싶어할 것 같습니다.

 첫째, 전시회를 의미합니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9080.053s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 내 생각엔 어느 시점에는 Kelly, 당신도 우리와 함께 일할 수 있을 것 같아요.
 요구 사항을 충족하는지 확실하지 않은 경우 Klaus에게 다음과 같이 알릴 수 있습니다.

 반면에 David에게 물어볼 수도 있습니다. Emily, 원하는만큼 자세하게 설명하면 충분합니까?
 우리는 약간의 유연성을 허용하기 위해 간단한 언어를 사용하기 때문에 그들이 다시 돌아와서 그것이 충분히 상세하지 않다고 말하는 것을 정말로 원하지 않습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9119.789s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 나는 이 과정을 환영한다.
 프로젝트 건설 과정은 여러 단계로 나누어져 있음이 분명합니다.
 그러니 많이 드릴게요.

 그렇다면
 만약 그들이 이것을 받아들이지 않는다면, 반대의 경우도 받아들일 수 있습니다.
 하지만 내 생각엔 그게 전체 과정이 이루어지는 방식인 것 같아.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9238.028s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 네, 약속해요.
 물론 그렇게 할 것입니다.
 때가 오면 블랙 리더가 적합하다고 생각하는 방식으로 요청을 수행하겠습니다.
 나는 이전에 그들과의 경험을 통해서만 이것을 알고 있을 뿐 그 이상은 아닙니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9276.352s">[Unidentified]</a>: 그럼, 마지막 순간에 어떤 아이디어가 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9282.434s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 조건이 충족되면 우리는 이 작업을 수행하기 위한 승인을 요청할 수 있습니다.</p>

 적어도 9.5 이전에는 나올까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9331.581s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 내 말은, 만약 그들이 10개를 하기로 결정했다면, 우리는 이상한 일을 할 필요가 없을 것입니다.
 하지만 5개를 할 수 있다면 상관없습니다.

 아니요, 우리가 만든 변경 사항을 수락하지 않으면 아무 것도 할 수 없습니다.
 사실 보도가 더 넓어져야 한다고 생각한다는 점을 이사회와 공유하고 싶을 뿐입니다.
 나는 이것을 여기서 논의했습니다.
 Todd는 이미 교통 이사로 돌아왔습니다.
 그는 나머지 도로의 깊이를 유지하고 싶고 교통부가 해당 지역의 보도 폭을 변경하기로 결정하면 도로를 열어 그렇게 할 것이라고 말했습니다.
 완전한 도로 프로젝트로 시행될 예정입니다.
 집 앞 보도의 폭을 넓히면 시간이 지나면서 이상하게 보일 것입니다.
 저는 우리와 같은 일부 사람들과 폭이 5피트에 관한 대부분의 댓글이 부에 관한 것이라는 것을 알고 있기 때문에 이것을 공유하고 싶습니다. 그러나 그것은 앞으로 일어날 일과 일치합니다.
 알다시피 이것은 이상한 상황입니다.
 우리도 걷기 쉽게 만들고 싶었지만 여전히 이웃들이 걷지 못하는 것이 현실입니다.
 그러니까 이상한 선이군요.
 사람들이 더 위험한 지역을 통과하도록 유도하는 대신 해당 지역을 보행자 전용으로 만들려고 합니까?
 이거 어렵지 않나요?

 나는 그의 노트를 보고 브라이언을 만났고 그것에 대해 이야기를 나눴습니다. 우리는 거기에 완충 장치를 두고 싶지 않았습니다. 왜냐하면 그것도 그들의 것이기 때문입니다.
 그래서 우리는 그것을 건물 측면을 향한 정면에 배치했습니다.
 그것이 그 뒤에 있는 기초입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9646.395s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 내 말은, 모든 보도와 주차장의 너비를 살펴보고 그것에 대해 생각해 보라고 진심으로 권하는 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9654.442s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 글쎄, 우리가 주차 기준을 충족할 수 있다면 그들이 나에게 깊이가 19피트라고 생각하는지 물었고 우리는 18피트라고 생각한다는 것을 압니다. 교통부는 이에 대해 경고했지만 설명에 따르면 이는 허용되고 수용 가능하다고 밝혔다.
 거기에 완충지대를 설치하면 주차공간이 줄어들 것 같아요.
 하지만 우리가 이것을 할 수 있는지 아닌지 보는 것은 흥미로울 것입니다.</p>

 또 다른 해결책은 단순히 3~4개의 영역을 제거하고 다시 토양에 넣고 녹지를 추가하는 것입니다.
