 克里斯蒂在场。
 艾米丽在场。
 我们暂时就这样吧。
 阿曼达.
 一切都好。
 今晚我们议程上的第一个也是唯一重要的项目是关于 142 Gab 先生的讨论，这是一家大型美国啤酒厂。
 与往常一样，我首先阅读该项目附带的通知。
 Metro社区发展委员会将于今天召开会议。
 现在，根据布莱恩·萨瑟 (Brian Sarthur) 提出的场地规划审查请求，库欣路 29 号米尔顿 (Milton) 土地正在扩大，以在梅德福 (Medford) 神秘大道 10142 号的地块上建造一座建筑。
 请愿人打算在该地点建造一座占地 22,025 平方英尺的新啤酒厂。
 根据我们的分区条例第 11.7 条，该开发项目被视为重大项目，因此需要接受该委员会的场地规划审查。
 那么让我先回到团队吧。
 我知道凯尔·哈尼什也在场。
 布莱恩·扎拉萨尔在场。
 凯尔，你能给大家做一个演讲吗？
 这是我听到的吗？
 是的，今晚我会在那里。
 出色的。
 欢迎。
 感谢您今晚来到这里。
 感谢您抽出时间。
 您想继续开始您的演示吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=185.598s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 当然。
 阿曼达，我什么时候可以共享我的屏幕？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=190.339s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 是的，你应该很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=191.731s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 首先，我要感谢整个董事会今晚抽出宝贵的时间。
 我要感谢大家抽出时间来，并回顾一下我们上次见面的情况。
 几周前我们对这个项目进行了初步审查，你们给了我们非常有用的意见和建议，我们听从了你们的建议并做了很多改变，我认为这些改变总体上改善了项目。
 在我们开始之前，我只想介绍一下自己。
 我叫凯尔·哈尼什。
 我是一名建筑商和开发商。
 Brian 把我带入这个团队来协助这个角色，主要是协助这个网站的建设和开发。
 我在这方面有经验，希望能够清楚地传达我们的愿景并回答可能出现的任何和所有问题。
 我想对布莱恩为使这个项目走到这一步所做的努力表示认可。
 布莱恩和他的家人显然拥有并经营这片土地，布莱恩已经在这个项目上工作了几年，并与像我这样来自不同背景的人一起尽了最大努力建立了这个团队。
 你知道，帮助这个项目成为现实并取得成功，我想这是我们都想做的。
 但布莱恩从一开始就是这个项目背后的有远见的人。
 而且，你知道，在过去的两年里，我们花费了大量的精力和努力才达到这一点。
 我想，你知道，我很高兴成为这个团队的一员
 我参与这个项目已经大约一年半了，从一切开始的地方，到今天的情况，我认为我们已经看到了巨大的进步，显然，在理事会的帮助下，以及我们从梅德福市、各个部门收到的各种信件的帮助下，他们提出的建议使该项目变得更好。
 因此，闲话少说，我想谈谈修改后的计划和演示。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=321.298s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的，大家能看到屏幕吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=323.059s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的，我们可以，谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=325.08s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 好吧，伟大的美国啤酒馆，正如你们所知，我想从我们所说的位置图开始，即该房产的大致位置，这里用红色虚线突出显示，占地两英亩。
 对于那些不知道该酒店确切位置的人来说，它位于神秘大道上汉考克街的另一侧，基本上位于 Atlas Liquors 和 Medford VFW 之间。
 这是神秘大道 142 号的卫星视图。
 我在那里用红色描述了它。
 目前，它与隔壁的土地共享，布莱恩的家族也拥有并管理这块土地。
 因此，我尽力定义了啤酒厂将占用的该特定批次的实际参数。
 从俯视图可以看出，主要是校车车身和储物的机械使用。
 这是后视图，所以是93年的。
 您可以再次看到矩形，它本质上是我们的批处理参数。
 前面的那栋建筑、车身、所有空间都将被拆除，其余部分将被释放。
 正如您在这张照片中看到的，该地块相当平坦。
 在后面你可以看到校车储藏室。
 从前面看，这是神秘大道的景色。
 再次强调，非常工业化，主要用于汽车存储。
 所以从神秘大道上看，在神秘大道上，正面立面图，这就是你每天看到的。
 看起来非常工业化。
 你的路上有一根巨大的电线杆，不是很令人兴奋，也不是很有吸引力。
 对不起，在街道上再远一点的地方还有另一种景色，回头看看项目或房产。
 只是，再次强调，非常工业化，在这个空间中没有什么非常有吸引力的地方。
 这当然不是我想在晚上聚集的地方。
 现在，这一切的整个起源是，你知道，我们如何改进神秘大道？
 我认为布莱恩从神秘大道一开始就怀有这样的愿景。
 而且，你知道，令人恐惧的是我们的团队和致力于此的一群人
 我认为这是第一张倒下的多米诺骨牌。
 所以，你知道，我们投入了很多心和很多精力来看到这个项目，你知道，美化神秘大道并成为未来发展的催化剂。
 所以，你知道，这是我们看到最大变化的地方。
 因此，显然，在左侧，他们看到的是现有站点，而在右侧，他们看到的是提议的站点。
 显然这是一个巨大的变化，更具吸引力。
 我不想太拘泥于确切的形象。
 这是一个概念图像。
 我们正在发展中。
 我们的预算在这方面是有限的。
 有一群人投入了自己的资金，他们在这方面投入了大量资金，还有我们的预算
 我们有局限性，因此所呈现的内容并不完全符合其应有的效果。
 这些将在该项目的设计、施工和许可阶段稍后被移除。
 但为了让你了解我们在这个特定情节中看到的戏剧性变化，这基本上是为了向你展示这一点。
 那么
 这是神秘大道前侧立面的近距离视图。
 显然，汽车不见了，公交车不见了，那座破旧的建筑不见了，你知道，有一个更具吸引力的社交空间，我们认为它可以成为神秘大道的中心，并希望，正如我们提到的，刺激街道的未来发展。
 对我们来说，正面必须具有吸引力。
 必须有一些绿色空间。
 我们在上次会议上清楚地听到了这一点，并已尽最大努力增加该地块的景观面积。
 我们希望这里的体验不会让人感觉自己身处工业场地和工业空间，所以我们希望感觉人们正在逃离这个开发项目、这座建筑。
 我认为这对于游客和顾客来说都应该是一种体验。
 和
 我认为缓冲景观和某种对建筑的欢迎自然将实现这一点。
 现在这是侧视图。
 我知道这个侧面的观点引起了理事会成员的一些担忧，我听到了你的声音并且理解，鉴于该项目的规模，它看起来非常大。
 我们所有的窗户都在顶部，我们的屋顶也在这里，这真的很酷。
 下半部分有很大的表面积，没有太多玻璃，
 你知道，原因是我们的很多让步和东西都在那堵墙上，所以窗户在那里没有任何好处。
 我不希望人们看到监狱后面、食品摊后面等等。
 但我们已经与建筑师分享了一些计划和想法，也许可以在这里种植某种绿色墙，种植一堵墙，某种标牌，以美化主入口和空间，使其更受欢迎，并将交通引导至我们位于酒店后面的主入口。
 在建筑物的后面，我们将安装一个自行车架。
 所以这将是一个更有吸引力的空间。
 但是，你知道，我认为我们正在做一些事情来美化这座建筑，而不是让它变得如此工业化和商业化。
 我们现在正在与我们的建筑师一起探讨这些想法，但我清楚地听到了你们的声音。
 我认为这是我们的团队。
 致力于使这个项目和这座建筑尽可能美丽，因为这反过来将使我们受益并邀请人们参与，这将是我们所有人都可以感到非常自豪的事情。
 这是侧面立面图。
 现在，我只想大致进入该网站。我记得在上次会议上，董事会中有人提到了网站的排名和一般内容。
 在平面图上看起来有点困难，但是尝试放大，几乎面向 93，你已经是第 12 年了。
 嗯，背面就是海拔 12。
 如果我们看前面，从神秘大道进来，你知道，你会从人行道上开出一个 10，然后你会看到一个 11。
 所以你说的是120米以上30到60厘米的台阶。
 所以，非常水平。
 毫无疑问，作为一名建筑商，我喜欢看到这样的事情。
 很多级别都没有太多挑战。
 抱歉，我不知道他为什么这么做。
 让我回去吧。
 对不起。
 抱歉，请尝试回到那个。
 开始了。
 因此，您会在场地平面图上看到一些在我们的景观平面图上看不到的东西。
 您会在前面看到这些虚线。
 在这里停车。
 这是一个拟议的渗透系统，本质上是一个雨水管理系统。
 这就是我们的排水系统的去向。
 所以，你知道，停车时间是 12 点，顶部是 12:30，下降到 11 点，下降到 11 点，然后下降到基本上
 它将所有的水输送到这里的渗透系统，装卸码头后面还有另一个渗透系统，将水输送到这里。
 这些是我们的雨水管理系统，我们的土木工程团队和梅德福市工程部正在对这些系统进行分析和研究。
 所以我们将对所有这些进行计算，但基本上是那里的表面积和水量。
 我们希望这能回答有关该地块是否水平的问题。
 确实如此。
 您还可以在这里看到，这些是离开神秘大道的公用设施，此处描述的是通往我们建筑物的公用设施。
 所以在公用事业、燃气、水、污水、排水和地下电力方面，我们的目的是把一切都放在地下。
 旅馆前面有一根电线杆。
 就在神秘大道上，该大道归公用事业公司所有，我们将尽一切努力拆除该杆并将变压器放置在景观缓冲区的某处。
 虽然没有任何保证，但这是我正在研究的事情，我希望让 Eversource、国家电网以及管理和维护这根电线杆的人与我们合作，将所有公用设施移至地下。
 我只是认为这有助于更好的发展，而且你不必看建筑物前面的杆子。
 嗯，这就是一般网站。
 我们现在将在这里讨论修订后的计划。
 让我摆脱这一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=846.16s">[Unidentified]</a>: 出色地。那我很抱歉。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=849.541s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我想在那里呆一会儿。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=853.949s">[Zac Bears]</a>:  Yeah, I don't know why it's letting me scroll as it once was.
 Let me try to enlarge it for you.
 Forgive me if I'm taking extra time.
 Okay, so here is the revised landscape plan and I worked on this, basically,
 to answer most of the questions that were brought about in the last preliminary hearing and also upon receiving all the letters from the Medford Fire Department, the Public Works Department, the Engineering Department and the Traffic Department.
 So we worked on this pretty diligently and forgive us, we do have budget constraints.
 This isn't some high level architectural rendering.
 So we're doing the best we can, but when it does come to actually
 permitting phase you will get much better and clearer images and renderings but I think it still communicates our message and hopefully highlight some of the areas of concern.
 Basically, everything was designed here in the city ordinance 6.3, which was provided by the planning department office.
 Alicia and Victor were kind enough to kind of send me some of that stuff and I kind of reviewed it to the best of my ability and included all those measures in here.
 So just as an overall idea of this lot size and how much we're covering, I just kind of wanted to give you an idea and we did so in this legend up here for the zoning requirements.
 This is commercial C2.
 And basically what is required of us is 35 feet of frontage.
 We actually have about 195 feet on Mystic Ave, 15 feet setback for the building.
 From the front side and rear, we have about 140 setback to the front of the building here, 15 on this side facing Atlas Liquors, and certainly more than that on that side, and then 30 feet from the rear.
 So we well within our setbacks, the height on this structure can exceed 30 so we're going right to 30 maximum lot coverage is 50% we're going to be at about 27.5.
 And the way I calculated that is over here in the lower left hand part of the legend.
 Overall lot size we have is about 89,620.
 The landscape area, and I'm calling the landscape area just the green area I have highlighted on the plan, that alone is 9,000 square feet.
 The patio area shown at the front, which is the beer garden essentially, is about 4,400 square feet.
 And the way I understand the city ordinances, the open space clause is that open area that that's your garden should be included in that tally.
 So if you calculate the landscape plus the open area, I have 13,400 square feet, which is 15% of the overall lot coverage.
 The building area is 24,682, that is this structure here, not including the beer garden, and that calculates to about 27.5% of the overall lot coverage.
 in increasing our landscape from the previous design to this design, you know, we're more than half of what our building coverage is.
 And I think that is a really nice balance for us into, you know, bring some more green to our area.
 So a couple things I want to go over that have varied from the last meeting were some of the changes that we made and
 Certainly if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
 First and foremost, one thing we heard loud and clear was the reduction of the overall width of our roadway.
 On the original site plan, it was spec'd at about 28 feet.
 And we designed that to be above what the fire department was requiring.
 The fire department got back to us and essentially asked for 24 feet for two lane traffic, excuse me.
 And so we shrunk it to 24 feet.
 which means less asphalt for us, a little more landscape buffer.
 And I think more importantly, and to the board's point, which was an excellent point from the last meeting was to increase the pedestrian access from Mystic Avenue.
 So what we've done now by shrinking this to 24 foot roadway, we're able to fit sidewalks on both sides, coming from the South and coming from the North on Mystic Ave.
 which I think will greatly improve pedestrian access to our site.
 Now, this sidewalk you can see was added in here, the trajectory this pathway would take was across the parking lot here and through this crosswalk, and then you can see we've added a pedestrian crosswalk across the front of our building and into our main entrance.
 Now, mystic have right here there's a 15 foot easement, essentially from the state of Massachusetts because it's a it's a Massachusetts roadway.
 So, the 15 feet, basically constitutes a five foot concrete sidewalk.
 plus a six inch curb, so five and a half feet.
 And that leaves us nine and a half feet of landscape buffer.
 That is gonna be on both sides of the parking lot.
 So landscape buffer of nine and a half feet here, here's your pedestrian sidewalk, there's your curbing, same condition on the opposite side, nine and a half foot landscape or five foot sidewalk and curbing in between.
 This landscape buffer was a big thing that came about in the last meeting.
 And as it's shown here now, it's just purely lawn,
 I do have a slide that I'll show you next where we do intend to do some plantings here.
 I think small shrubs, and traditionally what I've done in the past is anything greater than 30 feet you plant a small tree.
 I think that's something we can certainly look at doing here.
 My issue here is the overhead wires.
 On the southern part of Mystic Ave, there's that telephone pole that we talked about that I hope we can move, but no guarantee.
 That is a bit of a process.
 So I think there to be expected is low shrubbery and low plants, which we're open to doing and certainly, you know, shielding a bit of our parking lots from Mystic Ave.
 But I just wanted to point out that we do have a challenge there in the telephone pole.
 So parking, parking I've highlighted on the whole development.
 The main parking lot here has 86 spots, 75 of which are regular, four are handicap and we've included now what we're calling seven EV or electric vehicle spots.
 Those seven spots are right here, one, two, three, four.
 567.
 Now we're committed, and we talked to Alicia about this, we're committed to running conduit to these areas.
 We don't have a specific charging station spec yet or anything like that.
 Again, budget constraints, but we are open to certainly running conduit to these areas and working with the City of Medford
 when it comes about, if there's opportunities for us to take advantage of some incentives or some, you know, cost breaks, we would be open to putting charging stations there.
 But for now, I think the best we can do is provide conduit to those areas.
 On the front side here, you'll see we have an additional 16 spots.
 So 14 regular, 2 handicap.
 So if you calculate the 16 spots plus these 86, you get a total of 102.
 And the traffic department confirmed this in their review is 102 spots.
 So I worked with Alicia and Victor and Amanda in the calculation of what was required for parking on this site.
 And based on the calculation of the building, whether or not you include the beer garden, it remains up in the air.
 But for the sake of this measure, we included the beer garden.
 So if you include the 24,682 plus the 4,400 of the patio area,
 you get above 29,000 square feet and if you divide that by one spot per 350 square feet is the calculation we were given by Alicia's office and you come up with
 83 spots so that would be the minimum for a development as such 83 spots and the maximum is double that number so 166 so we're offering 102 which we think is a generous little sweet spot and the reason we exceeded the 83
 was mainly because we had a community outreach reading a few months back and one thing we heard loud and clear from local neighbors, mainly on the side streets, was they were concerned that the traffic to this building would lead to people parking on the side streets and impacting their properties negatively.
 That is certainly not something we want to do and we assured the neighbors of this property that we would do
 the best we can to mitigate that and put as much parking as we saw fit on our property.
 So that's kind of how we landed at 102.
 We felt like it was a sweet spot, a little bit above what is required, but not so excessive.
 And that is mainly in response to our community outreach meeting.
 So that is the parking.
 Now around the parking you'll see we have a seven foot landscape buffer all along here, all along the parking in the edges.
 The tree plantings we've done here I did an accordance with the
 with the zoning ordinance provided by Victor's office, the landscape plan 6.3, if you look at it, any parking lot that exceeds 20 parking spaces is required to have a tree per 10 spots.
 So if you see we have 86 spots all at 90, you should have nine trees, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
 So there's 12 in that area we exceed our minimum there.
 And this doesn't really fall in it because it doesn't exceed 20 spots so therefore there's not a minimum but we still have two trees there regardless.
 So I think the tree planting that we're proposing is sufficient.
 So that's the reason behind the trees.
 The lighting again I met with Alicia and Victor and Amanda on this and
 I did the best I could.
 I put lighting in here, parking lot lighting, and it's in accordance with the city spec performance standards and zoning order in section 6.44.
 There is no very specific spec for the lighting just yet, and I'm open to working with the city and finding one and proposing some lights.
 We understand there'll be LED,
 you know, anything that's efficient is in our best interest as well.
 So I think we were going to work with the design build team and our architect to provide some sort of lighting options and then go before Alicia and show her what our thoughts are on the parking lot lighting.
 Around the beer garden here, you can see we have some string lights.
 One thing we put on here, which we heard from the board last time, permeable pavers will be used on this beer garden.
 So 4,400 square feet of permeable pavers here.
 We do intend to put some form of barrier around our patio, whether that's a reclaimed wooden fence out of pallets
 maybe perhaps old wine barrels, whiskey barrels with white rope, there's going to be some delineation there between the area in which you can drink alcohol and then obviously the parking lots and the pedestrian sidewalk.
 So we don't have a full commitment on what that barrier will be.
 It'll be low, it'll probably be four feet or so, and there'll be some plantings and shrubs in between, perhaps some planter boxes so people can still see in, but we do not want people gaining access from the parking lot that way.
 On the other side of the beer garden there, there's a 15-foot landscape buffer that kind of traverses the whole back here.
 We basically split half the building and increased that green area all the way up above 180, 200 feet of our structure.
 And the reason for that was, again, in hearing the board of increased green space, increased lawn space, you know, we see potential here of perhaps dog area or something of that nature.
 We've also added hedges alongside the Atlas Liquor property, which is along here, it's about 80 feet of hedges, I think that'll shield that parking lot from Atlas Liquors.
 A bike rack was mentioned at the last meeting.
 We have a 15 foot metal bike rack included at the front side of the building over here.
 We put it further back on the property just to hopefully deter any theft or anything like that.
 We also have two loading bays at the back of the property that was brought about by one of the departments.
 And then we've clearly identified our entrances.
 We've opened up our landscape buffer area to show the flow of traffic going to the parking lots.
 and how those concrete sidewalks are going to work.
 So I think overall, that is essentially the changes that were made on our behalf, and hopefully answering a lot of the questions and concerns from the board in the last meeting, and certainly all the letters we received from the various departments.
 One thing I wanna bring about in attention to from one of the departments was the traffic department.
 We understand that the traffic study that was provided is lacking in some areas, and the traffic department director suggested some mitigation efforts to help us get where we need to be.
 And I think our team is committed to doing our best effort in working with the town, I mean, the city to achieve those mitigation efforts.
 He provided essentially two pathways, not sure if everybody read the report,
 the first of which mitigation efforts are mainly using MassDOT because that road, Mystic Ave is a MassDOT road.
 So we would have to engage with them and offer some ideas in mitigating the traffic flow to our site.
 And I just know from experience there, it's a bit of a process working with MassDOT.
 So I don't wanna guarantee anything there, but I do certainly,
 I will make a concerted effort and I think the team is supportive of this to engage with MassDOT and share with them our thoughts and how to improve the flow for Mystic Ave.
 And I think the traffic department suggestions are certainly ways to improve the area.
 My concern is just MassDOT being responsive in a timely manner.
 and working with us, but it certainly will be an effort that we will put forth.
 Secondarily, the traffic director was kind enough to offer other mitigating efforts, which I see as totally doable on our behalf, mainly some barriers, some painting.
 I think he had planned for some crosswalk signage, which we are open to, we are certainly willing to do.
 our best interest to draw good traffic and good flow to this area.
 We don't want to cause any problems or issues on Mystic Ave, and we are committed to doing whatever it takes.
 I just tread with caution when it comes to the MassDOT.
 I do not want to over-promise and under-deliver in that regard.
 So I certainly appreciate the traffic director's suggestion for some other mitigating efforts, which we are committed to doing.
 Other than that, I don't see anything that came about from the various boards that, excuse me, from the various departments that we are not able to answer or flush out either in this meeting or some of the stormwater questions that came about from the engineering office.
 Those are all being worked on by our civil engineering team.
 And obviously when we go for permitting, stormwater permits are required.
 So we won't be able to do anything without those permits in place, irregardless.
 So I think we've sufficiently answered most of those questions.
 And to bring me just back to my slides here to give some detail on the landscape buffer, this is just something I brought from another development.
 So to give you an idea of what that Mystic Ave entrance, I know the board was curious on what our efforts are gonna be on that landscape buffer.
 And this is kind of just a general,
 idea, I guess, of what it might look like.
 I've highlighted here, a four foot max shrub height.
 And then on the bottom slide there it's, it shows you the nine and a half foot minimum buffer, and then various plantings and shrubs located and then you know for every
 10, 12, 30 feet, so we can try to plant a mature tree.
 However, I think with the current telephone pole that exists on one side, that's going to be very difficult to do.
 So I just wanted to give the board some idea of what our vision is for that landscape buffer on Mystic Ave.
 Go to the next slide here.
 Okay, so again, this is your front view.
 Something that came about, what I want to talk about next is the overall design and aesthetic of this building.
 And, you know, I think, I hope the board understands this, like I've mentioned several times before, there are budget constraints in this project.
 We've already done a lot and paid a lot of money to get to this point.
 And, you know, without knowing that we're actually going to build this thing it's hard to commit more capital to have the full architectural plan done.
 So, at this point, this is, you know, the best that I think that we can provide to the board to give you an idea of what we're trying to build and I have some slides to show you guys some what I think are successful metal prefab buildings and how they've been.
 built in some of the other areas of the country that I think are good examples of what we're trying to do.
 Something to understand, a key factor to our building is the prefab metal.
 The reason for that is twofold.
 One, cost, keep our costs down.
 Two, speed.
 We want to open this thing as soon as possible and we are committed to doing so.
 Um, and the big reason, uh, for us to doing that is obviously construction costs are constantly fluctuating.
 Uh, since the pandemic I I'm in this field and in this industry has been very difficult to gauge pricing and, uh, almost everything you put out to bid comes back over budget.
 So you're constantly, um,
 constantly trying to value engineer and also source materials from different areas.
 So, you know, something that might be visual to you today on this board might not be available to us.
 So we're just trying to give you a concept image of what we're trying to achieve.
 And I think the other other buildings that I show you will be helpful in
 and gaining some perspective of where we're coming from.
 But metal prefab building, it'll be a low pitched gable roof just like this.
 You'll have a second floor roof deck.
 You'll have as much glazing as we can get on the first floor to see into the property.
 You will have an outdoor patio.
 This is shown as concrete.
 Again, forgive us on that it is permeable pavers, but this is just purely a concept.
 We will try to carry the front facade with as much glazing as possible to again invite people in.
 So to give you an idea of the building itself, metal prefab building, likely metal cladding on the outside.
 We haven't decided on a color or anything yet, but I wanted to give you guys some real world examples of metal prefab buildings that I think are pretty successful.
 So here's one, Pacific Northwest.
 This is a wine market and hall.
 Again, if you just follow the architecture of this thing, it's a low pitched roof, gable roof.
 metal prefab building, a lot of glazing on the front.
 It's obviously on a main road.
 I'll show you another view of this same building.
 Why does it keep going back to that?
 Sorry.
 So this is the building again.
 low pitched roof.
 You can see they have solar on top, which we intend to do.
 HVAC mechanicals are on top.
 They obviously have some outside dining.
 They're on a main road.
 I know if you look at more recent images of this property, they have this landscape buffer here.
 It's very narrow.
 Ours is bigger, but these have grown into some vines.
 And so they've shielded some of that metal, corrugated metal paneling with some landscape screens, which I think is a real nice detail.
 They have some plantings in the front.
 And again, this is just kind of shows you a real world example.
 I'll give you one more.
 This is Surly Brewing.
 So this is a metal prefab building.
 Again, look at the roof pitch, very similar to ours.
 This has some second floor mezzanine, obviously some indoor outdoor feel and a fire pit in the front.
 So this is essentially trying to give, to give you some idea of, you know, our job
 is to create an experience for our customers.
 So I think that indoor outdoor feel is something that I think is going to be instrumental in our success.
 So any areas we can do that we're going to.
 So you know mainly our strong point I think is on the Mystic Ave elevation and that front beer garden.
 So we're going to do the best we can to keep it open, keep it airy.
 Obviously being in New England we have challenges with weather so
 know, a good part of the year, we won't be open out there.
 But it is in our best interest to introduce as much glass as possible and create that flow indoor and outdoor.
 So those are three real world examples of metal prefab buildings.
 You know, this one in particular, I don't particularly like the color of it.
 I think it's a little too dark, but the lighting of this space, I really do like.
 So I think, you know, that should help give some ideas to the board of what we're trying to achieve design-wise and aesthetically.
 I know the board has seen this before, but for anybody who hasn't, this is just to kind of give you an indication of what the inside is gonna be, large gathering spaces down the center of the beer hall, concessions on the outside,
 beer garden at the front, and then additional taps on the other side of the building and then bathrooms at the rear, and then we're gonna have some form of second floor mezzanine, again great for private events and maybe some home, some offices, ADA accessible bathrooms, we have an elevator, and then a roof deck off the front.
 Just to give you some idea, again, concept images, please forgive us, limited budget, but this tries to give you some idea of what the inside might look like.
 You know, don't get married to the flooring or the color scheme or anything like that.
 It's just to show you that people are congregated in a social setting in the middle of this building with a lot of glass, trying to feel escaped, I think, from the city and the hustle and bustle of Mystic Ave.
 The idea is to create an environment inviting inside as well as outside.
 I'll show you another view.
 This just shows you some of the beer vending stations down below.
 This is up looking from the mezzanine level, some form of television for sporting events, things of that nature.
 Um, and then one last view just shows you some seating.
 This is not the set of chairs we particularly have or the tables.
 It's just to kind of give you this communal aspect of, you know, um, bringing people together.
 And that's kind of what our motto is best brought together.
 And, um, we feel that this beer hall can certainly achieve that and, and, um, we're doing the best we can to, to make an inviting space.
 that people want to gather both inside and out.
 So to wrap this up, I kind of wanted to give you a gap timeline on where we're at and kind of how this project has come to date.
 We've applied for our liquor license, so we're still awaiting that.
 Site planning and permitting, we hope to get through as soon as possible.
 There are time constraints
 not only on our capital, we are being funded by Capital One through an SBA loan.
 And we have capital requirements and commitments that have certain deadlines to them.
 So, you know, we are running low on that timeline.
 And I think Brian has clearly communicated it from the beginning.
 His family who owns and manages the property, they have tenants and need to give them forewarning.
 And there's leases and things of that nature that are coming up
 to expire.
 So it is certainly critical path for us.
 We are at that juncture right now and need to move things along as best as possible.
 Our team is committed to doing it.
 We just hope the board sees it the same way in assisting us to get, we understand there's multiple steps still to be had, but this is one critical and important step that can get us on the right path.
 Again, I mentioned time, speed, the metal prefab buildings, we can move fast and it is in our intention completely to move fast.
 So if we can get swift approvals and permitting going as soon as possible, we will intend to build in the spring in May of 2023, and hopefully have one year of building and be open by spring 2024.
 Um, so that's what our team is committed to.
 And, um, you know, I hope with, um, the, the help of this board that, um, you know, you guys will see it the same way as we do and, and doing everything we can to improve Mystic Ave and make it, um, you know, a place for people to want to be and hopefully, uh, spur future development on the street.
 So I'm open to any questions from anybody.
 Uh, I hope I didn't take too much of your time.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2414.982s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 不，谢谢你的介绍。马内斯先生非常感谢你。
 感谢您提供的详细信息和附加材料。
 让我按照我们通常的议程，邀请任何可能在这里并愿意在我们继续之前讨论或解决该项目的市政府工作人员。
 朋友们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2440.203s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 我不认识任何人，除非维克托·艾丽西亚现在想补充一些东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2445.286s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 他们不仅要感谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2450.789s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我认为听到建议会很好。
 我们一直在与候选人合作，努力确保他们能够回答所有问题。
 这座城市在这样的演示中寻找什么。
 我们很高兴与一家较小的公司和当地居民合作，而不是一家大型国际公司来梅德福设立这个项目，而是与
 来自社区的人正在尝试为社区开发一些东西，我只是想认识到这一点，因为我知道他们一直用非常严格的方式说这句话，你知道，这很严格，但这是他们的工作，我们正在与社区成员合作，为社区开发一些东西。
 还可以与我们举行额外的会议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2509.369s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的，非常好。
 在我们向公众开放之前，我们通常会提出一些问题，或者至少向董事会开放一些初步问题，也许不是为了卷起袖子，而是为了一些初步问题。
 如果你不介意的话，我想带头做这件事，这就是发布
 凯尔或布莱恩在这里。
 我认为。
 我犹豫是否要这么做，因为我不想抢大家的风头，或者可能抢大家的风头。
 我也不想给人留下我们不会就这个话题进行全面讨论的印象，但我想我对你的问题是，我们习惯于看到提交给我们的计划，经过你提到的过程的场地计划，很快就会推出，所以你要和你的建筑师谈谈，并提出一些更详细的计划，等等。
 如果董事会积极倾向于该项目，但尚未看到最终批准所需的一切。
 哪里，你在哪里？
 你能回应我的这个想法吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2586.853s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 自新冠疫情爆发以来，建筑成本大幅上涨。
 当我开始这项工作时，我在 2019 年制定了预算，我不敢相信我们看到的数字。
 因此，我们从第一资本获得 SBA 贷款的资格开始，就取得了现在的成就。
 所以我们没有资金继续前进。
 考虑到我们现在在时间表上的位置，这实际上是我们可以采取的最佳步骤。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2629.852s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 当然，布莱恩。
 但这什么时候会发生呢？
 假设我们通过</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2653.798s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，我们已经承诺提供资金来开始这一进程。
 我们已经聘请了海恩斯集团，它是我们的建设者。
 这是一种设计建设能力。
 他们将收到这些会议的所有记录以及市政府向他们提供的所有信件。
 这就是为什么我们知道并将准确设计所需的内容。
 传统上，在之前的开发中，我一直致力于回答您的问题，如果您没有按要求提供完整的场地规划，通常会传达条件顺序。
 对于您，您知道，然后我们确保当您看到最终计划时，我们确保它回答您的所有问题并拥有您需要的一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2689.598s">[Unidentified]</a>: 好的，再来一张
 大卫，我有一个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2697.802s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 杰基，请。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2699.523s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 所以我的第一个问题肯定是这个站点计划，这样我就可以继续前进。
 我不知道这对市政府雇员本身有何影响。
 但我们实际上不得不要求以前的支持者提交完整的场地规划，这样我们就可以
 确保我们正在考虑我们必须扩展的一切。
 我遇到的问题之一是我无法按比例看到它。
 我不能说我不能对此发表评论，但我不确定如果没有以前的支持者并且没有我们要求他们回去获取站点计划，情况会是什么样子。
 所以这是这个城市的另一个问题。
 我们可以在不确定场地规划大小的情况下继续前进吗？
 您认为这会是以前支持者反应的问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2753.401s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好吧，我可以尝试回答这个问题，杰基，我认为如果董事会想要发挥创造力，我们可以尝试发挥创造力，我想也许你和我的想法是一样的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2767.848s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我可能会补充一点，有时你会对提案者说，好吧，那是怎么回事？
 那又怎样呢？
 他们会立即说，哦，哦，我们会做出一些改变并回复您。
 好的。
 支持者很少会说，好吧，如果你把这个放在条件里，我们就需要这个。
 我想我们已经有一些了，对吧？
 所以这并没有显示出，我不知道，你在寻找什么，对吧？
 这并没有显示出狭窄、干燥的瓶子。
 好吧，如果条件规定干燥瓶必须为 28 英尺且不能更宽，那么它就是这样构造的。
 因为这就是条件所说的，无论你是否在计划中看到它，对吧？
 我认为部分困难在于，如果他们没有给你需要的东西，如果我们没有做出决定所需的一切，你可以拒绝场地规划审查，但你不能随意拒绝，对吧？
 是的，我们通常会有一位候选人直接让我进行编辑并回复您。
 我认为候选人说“好吧，是的，我们可以做到这一点”是有一定风险的。
 是的，我们可以做到。
 一些候选人说，在我们投入某些东西之前，让工程师检查每一个细节。
 我认为这也是不同的，因为它涉及设计和施工。
 在设计和施工中，您的建筑商实际上进行设计并可以立即进行更改。
 相反，它们是 100% 完整的建筑图纸，你对他们投标，然后他们必须对图纸中的内容进行投标。
 这也是一个不同的过程。
 我也不知道，希望对你有一点帮助。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2878.044s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我想补充一点关于项目建设过程的信息。
 我认为这就是为什么理事会提出的有关今晚条件的所有建议对于这一进程都非常重要，因为你必须遵守。
 对您的设计和施工团队的期望。
 不管怎样，如果我打扰了任何人，我很抱歉。
 你介意我继续吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2904.085s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 这太完美了，克里斯蒂，因为我只是不明白我们将如何前进。
 你正在解释它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2912.793s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我知道并且感觉我和你和大卫意见一致。
 好吧，首先，我想退一步说，作为一名居民，我很高兴这个项目来到镇上。
 我很想在这里看到这一点。
 我更高兴能成为社区的一员。
 这样就多了一点。
 你知道，有兴趣为城市做点好事。
 然而，我对演示文稿尚未做出决定，我感到非常不舒服，我正在寻求指导以及该董事会如何能够在今晚获得批准，因为我很遗憾这是很多钱，因此我们没有花时间至少给予它
 我们习惯看到的效果图或平面图。
 我知道我从事房地产开发和建筑业务，但有一种方法可以做到这一点。
 我认为我们需要非常清楚期望和条件是什么，而不是树立先例。
 这将在未来对这个建议产生适得其反的效果，偏离我们之前设定的期望。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=2996.344s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我不妨跳到克里斯蒂说的话。
 而且我想我也感觉不舒服。
 我认为原因之一是缺乏
 我们在演示文稿中看到的信息，我完全理解为什么，这些信息的负担由我们而不是支持者承担。
 我认为这很危险。
 你明白我在说什么吗？
 突然我们必须列出一些事情
 不，我个人什至不知道从哪里开始，你知道，看起来一切都很好。
 我认为在场地规划方面还有很多工作要做。
 我一点也不担心这座大楼。
 这会好起来的。
 嗯，还有，还有，但是场地规划需要，需要大量的工作。
 我，我觉得你真正需要的是，呃，
 一名景观设计师和一名交通工程师，你确实需要努力并将该计划放在一起，因为它还没有准备好。
 我不知道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3084.433s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我不知道我们如何才能批准我的这一声明。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3091.156s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我们怎么能说是的，我们喜欢它，但你还有很多工作要做呢？
 这是怎样的批准条件？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3100.031s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 谢谢。
 我看到艾米丽举起了手，所以我想把麦克风递给艾米丽。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3106.893s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的。
 我不知道我们将如何做到这一点，但哈尼什先生演讲中的每一个元素都提到了类似的内容，哦，这就是我们向您展示的内容，但仅此而已。
 我们必须对它们中的每一个进行调节。
 这是很多。
 我尊重你对预算的评论。
 我知道这不是一家这样做的大公司。
 你知道，这些是社区成员，但我不仅可以控制细节的缺乏，而且我也不理解在时间表方面给理事会带来的压力，你知道，
 我是一名项目经理，范围、进度和预算是您可以在最佳控制范围内控制的三件事。
 如果我们真的要结束了，那么我不会说我们的角色不是唯一保证项目财务可行性的事情。
 嗯，但是所涉及的压力是。
 嗯，这很奇怪，而且考虑到我们现在面临的情况，你知道，有点不合适。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3196.25s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 供记录。
 我只是想提一下，乔治·费舍尔在演讲一开始就加入了我们。
 所以乔治也在这里。
 乔治或迪安娜。
 在我们看看公众是否愿意对该项目发表评论之前，您有什么意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3213.098s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 我同意大家所说的。
 我只是想了解我们如何根据现有的情况继续前进。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3223.964s">[v8aFu2OAn8o_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 我也同意所说的。
 我想我也在尝试思考如何在没有看到完整的场地规划的情况下，在如此多的条件下推进批准这个项目。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3239.807s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的，谢谢，我们有消息了。我认为论坛上的每个人都感谢您的评论。
 让我们阐述一下我们目前的想法并开放这个问题，阿曼达，如果你能帮助我们组织它，就观众而言，公众更愿意谈论该项目，而不是提出问题，提出意见与董事会分享。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3264.975s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 是的，如果观众中有人有兴趣发表公开评论，如果您可以使用位于 Zoom 屏幕底部的手部功能举手，或者如果您想在聊天中发表评论，我会打电话给您，您只需提供全名和地址即可注册。
 我仍然没有看到任何手。
 我知道在谈话开始时布伦达·布里德询问了公众意见。
 布伦达，你还在我们身边吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3307.537s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，对不起。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3307.877s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 我只是想找到举手的东西。
 哦，别担心。
 我们现在有你了。
 如果您可以提供您的姓名和地址进行注册。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3316.644s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 当然。
 你好，你好。
 是的，我的名字是布伦达·布里德。
 嗯，我的丈夫 Glen McKay 和我在一起，我们住在新月街 19 号，离
 建议的位置。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3338.872s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 欢迎你们两位。
 感谢您来到这里。
 感谢您前来与我们分享一些评论。
 我们很感激。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3346.518s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 当然，当然。
 我认为我们最关心的两个问题是其中之一是可靠的，我不知道这是否可以结合在一起。
 尝试与否，但我注意到在一些信息中它说您计划进行现场音乐表演。
 我不知道外面是否会有现场音乐，是否会被放大。
 我还想知道如何开放、开放时间以及开放时间。
 然后我们的另一个问题是：其他问题是关于交通的。
 部分原因是它是均匀的，
 我们的想法是，它不仅会在这个特定位置，而且在街上还会有一个大麻药房。
 据我了解，我实际上在两侧都创建了一个。
 所以所有这些都将同时在线。
 所以我想知道为什么会有多种因素同时影响交通。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3407.592s">[Adam Hurtubise]</a>: 看来项目已经结束了
 我们所在地区的交通量将会大幅增加。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3416.946s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 这些都是复杂的交叉点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3422.069s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 对于交通来说，我认为我们项目的好处是，Mystic Ave 上最安静的时间现在是最繁忙的时间。
 我们希望拥有最多
 我想干杯。
 至于现场音乐，我们会在室内进行，在室外不扩音，白天在室外，我们可能会有一支单人乐队或类似的东西。
 但他没有注意到噪音。
 而且，你知道，室外区域在晚上结束得早得多，然后是室内区域。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3463.473s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 布莱恩，我可以试着帮助澄清你的项目吗？您的业​​务运营将受到城市噪音条例的约束。
 是的，绝对是。
 是不是也可以向公众、向董事会汇报？
 是许可委员会吗？
 我想你们对营业时间有限制之类的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3487.978s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 您能给我们只提供一门课程吗？
 是的。
 因此，酒类许可证相当规范。
 但现在周末我们的时间是中午 12 点到凌晨 1 点。最后一次通话时间为中午 12 点。
 目前，仅限周一至周三，我们仅限私人聚会。
 但是，让我们考虑一下周一开放举办体育赛事和类似活动。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3526.158s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 您还对交通有疑问，对吧？
 你愿意吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3529.679s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我认为我没有，嗯，我没有任何具体问题。
 我只是想确保另一个
 也将在该领域上线的公司，这将吸引大量流量。
 如果是的话，不知道是否可以做一些规划，对吧？考虑到所有这些。
 我不知道这是如何运作的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3554.087s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3555.068s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我真的无法谈论这个城市的另一个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3558.711s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 我不知道，但是因为这不公平，你知道我在说什么吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3561.733s">[Unidentified]</a>: 不仅如此，还有几件事同时发生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3569.926s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 仅代表理事会，我想我应该说，我们看到一位大麻经营者与我们一起审查了场地规划，并进行了讨论。
 我知道交通部门已经在这里提出了意见和缓解建议。
 我确信布莱克先生知道神秘主义者的其他发展，但是。
 冒着超越我的极限并为他负责的风险。
 我只是想让你们知道，在某种程度上，这座城市肯定意识到了正在发生的发展。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3606.141s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的。
 因为一个空间里有很多东西，你知道，我知道城市需要这些，你知道，我们需要这些企业的税收收入。
 所以，你知道，我知道这对这座城市来说是件好事。
 我只是不想过度影响我们的社区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3627.096s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 比现在的使用，比拖车场和公交车场好多了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3630.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 就像......是的，这在视觉上确实有很多，一个很大的改进，是的。
 我想我只是有几个具体问题。
 我知道左边有照片，你知道，电线杆在哪里，那里实际上有一个公共汽车站。
 事实上，我认为那个柱子上有一个公交车站标志和一个人行横道。
 所以我想知道，
 如果您的计划中包括公交车站，您会改变人行横道还是会有多个人行横道？
 从你的计划中我实在无法判断人行横道在哪里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3668.897s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我们询问城市他们想要什么，但我们愿意增加人行横道，甚至在那里放一盏灯、一个闪光器，然后再增加一个。
 是的，我们可以在我们自己的网站上管理人行横道，但神秘大道上的一切都是由 MassDOT 管理的，所以这是 MassDOT 的批准，你知道，我在我们的演示中提到，我们愿意与他们合作并尽我们最大的努力，我当然认为，您可以提出的任何意见，请与您的交通总监跟进并提出，并让您的部门知道您已经
 的担忧。
 也许您的努力可以帮助 MassDOT。
 你知道，他们在全州有一长串的资本改善项目。
 而且，你知道，这只是关注这个具体问题的问题。
 我认为这在很大程度上来自于对城市的监控，你知道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3723.043s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 好吧，是的，因为这已经是一个非常危险的地方了，好吧，穿过整个神秘大道都是危险的，但它确实是一个危险的地方，因为有人转向汉考克街或从阿特拉斯酒业出来，如果我不知道能更好地处理这件事，那就太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3743.756s">[Victor Schrader]</a>: 是的，我可以解决这一点。
 这是维克多·施拉德。
 该区域有一个人行横道，但位于街区的中间。
 它位于一个奇怪的位置。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3753.961s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，人们总是把车停在前面。
 因此，当您在人行横道处时，来自波士顿的汽车看不到您，因为总是有一辆小型货车或卡车或其他东西停在您面前。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3767.86s">[Victor Schrader]</a>: 是的，所以我们的想法是将其重新安置在靠近汉考克十字路口的地方，这对社区来说是有意义的。
 是的，这对于交通模式来说非常有利，而且对于该项目来说，可以从人们可以到达的街道更直接地进入该项目。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3788.954s">[Unidentified]</a>: 嗯，我认为对他们来说这就是问题所在。
 是的，这些是我们主要关心的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3795.639s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好吧，我们感谢您今晚提出这个问题。
 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3802.544s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 大卫，这是克里斯蒂。
 请问部门领导怎么来了？
 他们通常会参加其中一场会议，例如，托德·布莱克在哪里？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3813.893s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我发言只是为了帮助回答你的问题。
 我早些时候问过阿曼达这个问题，她说托德今晚还有另一项与市政府的承诺，不太可能参加。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3827.868s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 当他在这里时，他非常有帮助，因为他同意所做的某些陈述或试图帮助解释事情，特别是他的信。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3842.778s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 绝对地。
 阿曼达，今晚还有其他观众想参加吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3851.399s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 我看不到更多的手了。
 所以我会做另一件事。我注意到我们说话时有一两个人进来了。
 因此，如果我们在公众意见征询期间，我会看到有人举手。
 Caleb Bachman，您愿意发言吗？您可以提供您的姓名和地址以供记录吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3870.78s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 我是凯拉·多克曼，我在富尔顿街 604 号。
 我只想说...嗨，欢迎。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3877.486s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 欢迎您的光临，感谢您的评论，感谢您的参与。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3880.568s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 我首先想说的是，我认为，正如其他一些人所说的那样，我支持这个项目，我认为这是一个好主意，对梅德福的发展来说确实是好事。
 我不知道这是某种本地项目，所以听到这个消息真的很令人兴奋。
 嗯，我很高兴看到这一点，因为我审查了计划。
 顺便说一句，我是一名景观设计师。
 我在会前回顾了计划，提出了很多问题，其中很多得到了解答。
 所以像人行道这样的东西，我的意思是，街道，自行车架，尽管我认为人行道中间的位置可能行不通。
 嗯，但他们就在那里。
 所以你正在考虑它们。
 嗯，我同意，有，有，比我通常看到的要少得多。
 并在场地规划审查中专业地展示自己。
 我们通常会为此类项目提供更多信息。
 因此，我再次看到，董事会的观点对于在提出要求时必须列出他们需要查看的内容感到不太舒服。
 所以你没有添加太多，
 事实上，我的一个评论是，好吧，我们稍后再进行设计。
 以后我们有钱做设计。
 好吧，我的问题是：为什么他们不能在获得许可证之前在这些会议或听证会之前这样做？
 这不应该是对立的。
 我只是不知道这是否与您的贷款融资有关。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3979.408s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我们不想撤回贷款，除非这是一次全面的尝试。
 是的，好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3985.37s">[SPEAKER_17]</a>: 好吧，这是可以理解的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3987.36s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我要说的就是这些。
 好吧，这很有帮助。
 谢谢。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=3995.087s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 好吧，如果任何其他公众有任何意见想要分享，您是否可以举手或在聊天中留言。
 我会给人们一分钟左右的时间。
 当我这样做时，我会检查我们的电子邮件。
 好吧，我没有看到更多的评论请求。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4020.742s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的，非常好。
 会议的公众评论部分就此结束。
 然后我可以返回会议进行讨论并回答项目团队提出的其他问题。
 我可以只是为了提供帮助并简化事情而进行推销吗？我可以向其他辅导员提出建议吗？
 或者如果你不在乎的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4051.257s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 戴尔.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4052.258s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 出色地。
 如果理事会（我认为在我们的圆桌会议上单独听取了大家的意见）可以为该项目提供一定程度的支持，但继续会议，也许我们可以做点什么。
 我们已经安排了 11 月 10 日的会议，据我记得，我们将继续会议，直到该会议或下一阶段项目完成后的稍后会议讨论细节，但这是我们可以安排的事情。
 这样布莱恩和他的团队就可以放心地前进。
 认可，一封您可以代表董事会签署的信函，为您使用该网站提供原则性支持。
 沿着这些思路，人们会有何感受？我想在我离开之前我应该​​先问问我的董事会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4113.307s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我怎样才能问另一个问题，或者问艾丽西亚一个问题，比如</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4124.153s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 如果没有经过认证的场地规划，我们可以批准场地规划吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4133.658s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我必须告诉你，我实际上在寻找相反的东西。
 在什么条件下你可以拒绝这样的项目？
 你必须拥有某些东西，但如果有一个水平你可以说，你知道，
 如果您知道，只要您向我们展示反映我们讨论的这些内容的计划，我们就会批准它并颁发特别许可证，因为您只能在某些条件下拒绝场地计划审查。我真的拿起我的书，开始翻阅书页
 看到这个。
 所以我可以简单地说，董事会有能力放弃他们想要的任何东西。
 然后我们对候选人说：你需要豁免我们的绩效要求吗？
 他们看了我们的分区后说，不，我们可以遵守一切。
 我们不要求任何豁免，因为您有能力放弃任何东西。
 我们在树林里，
 你遇到了挫折，你的评估完全基于绩效标准，我们从来没有回过头来说，这不是一个场地规划吗？
 你是对的，它不是由注册建筑师、景观设计师或专业工程师准备的。
 事实上，这就是他们要求豁免的作品，而这并不是他们中任何人准备的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4220.031s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 他们正式问过这个问题吗？
 因为他们做到了。
 我做到了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4228.567s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 但接下来我会回到我之前的声明，即您现在将这一决定的责任归于我们，而不是您。
 我对此感到非常不舒服。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4239.695s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我不明白文字。
 对不起。
 是否以书面形式向理事会提出豁免请求？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4246.98s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，不是我。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4248.501s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 这是哪里？
 因为不是，所以我在任何材料中都没有看到它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4251.643s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我有一张场地图作为场地规划、支持信、</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4258.362s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。
 仅此而已。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4265.708s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 因此，当我们与他们讨论此事并询问他们是否需要任何豁免时，我会说在讨论中他们说不需要。
 因为我们会关注每一个细节，但不会关注注册建筑师等的作品。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4285.865s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我会说我们提供了一个场地规划。
 我们没有完整的景观规划。
 场地平面图由注册工程师提供。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4291.848s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 我们的文件中是否提供了这一点？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4295.069s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，这是其中之一……是的，就是这个。
 排水、雨水管理，所有这些都是注册工程。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4301.472s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 申请材料原件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4308.396s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 我会再次检查，但它应该在该应用程序包中，但现在让我看一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4314.468s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这是演示文稿中的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4318.651s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 无论哪种方式，我认为您向我们提供的图像与站点计划不符。
 所以看起来事情需要解决。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4328.817s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 嗯，这就是我有点迷失的地方，因为这个场地平面图是用于其他景观平面图的直接 CAD 绘图。
 他们有效地协调一致。
 我只是将风景放大成更大的图像，以便您可以在演示中看到它，你知道，并描述了尽可能多的东西。
 你知道，我知道景观设计师没有被雇用，也没有被雇用，你没有关于草地或我们正在使用的特定灌木或树篱的尺寸的完整规格，但我们的设计是为了满足我们认为合适的性能标准，并且我们提供了我认为最重要的部分是土木工程场地平面图。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4370.874s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的。
 因此，Eagle 书中展示的场地规划文件是由一家工程和测量公司准备的。
 候选人所做的就是利用它并添加颜色来展示风景。
 所以它是 100% 按比例缩放的，是同一个文档。
 因此，事实上，由经过认证的建筑师、专业工程师制作的场地规划的一部分是包含标高和其他所有内容、地役权、通行权、现有轮廓的文件。
 这是该文档的版本 11.7.7。
 我明白了，谢谢。
 射线。
 所以他们确实补充了它。
 这里的一些元素，景观和投影，都在他们准备的附加文件中，有颜色的，有颜色的。
 抱歉，我认为他们在包裹中提供了一份书面清单。
 有，我回来还给你。
 站点计划更新列表。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4458.325s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，根据之前的会议，我描述了 15 个不同的项目，并将它们放入 EMS 中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4465.948s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的，所以董事会不负责制定这份清单。
 该清单已以书面形式提供给您。
 因此，很容易说将站点规划更新列表纳入 2022 年 10 月 21 日的信函中，因为每个更新都是一个条件。
 在颁发建筑许可证之前，必须向建筑部门提供一份反映该清单中 15 项的计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4501.001s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我认为问题是，艾丽西亚，我认为这不是那么好，因为我们举行了一次初步会议，但我们只进行了到目前为止。我认为我们还没有列出我们想要评论的所有内容的绝对详尽的清单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4513.279s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 不，我想说的是，这个清单是他在演示期间说我们要做的事情的清单。
 艾米丽说他们没有反映在计划中。
 不，它们没有反映在计划中，但反映在书面清单中。
 如果还有其他未包含在其中的内容，我通常会在该板上进行调整。
 这里有一些你没有提到的事情。
 以下是我们尚未看到但希望看到的事情。
 如果我可以这么说的话，这将是您进行头脑风暴的条件清单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4547.452s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4549.453s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 是否会进行交通研究？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4553.455s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我们提供了一个。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4554.916s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 是的，有一项交通研究。
 但正如托德在信中指出的那样，他认为该项目的范围不够大。
 那么这也...</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4569.571s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>: 交通研究的范围？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4571.512s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 好的。
 我认为它只覆盖了一个路口。
 托德提到，通常候选人会来找他，他们会一起决定如何或什么、什么区域应包括在交通研究中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4587.216s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 所以，嗯，我的意思是，我所说的只是为了完全清楚，你知道，我的保留意见是现场的流线设计、现场的行人流线设计、现场的车辆流线设计以及由此产生的景观空间。
 当然，我喜欢这个项目，我真的很想看到它完成，但我认为有一些事情，我不是景观设计师，我也不是……交通工程师，但有些事情对我来说很突出，因为它们看起来不像最佳实践。
 我只是，这些都是让我不舒服的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4641.953s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 如果我想在这里跳一下，就像我所做的那样，我已经在这方面工作了三年，我们有工程师进行土壤测试和钻孔等所有工作。
 然后，建筑师和工程师实际上是基于建筑物的最佳放置位置。
 然后我们就从这里开始工作，因为土壤条件以及所有这些，你知道，这里的基地相当广泛。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4672.396s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好吧，我提几件事。
 在我们去那里之前，让我来，因为我想做的是尝试看看我们是否能想出一些不会让我们整夜都呆在这里的东西，回顾所有我们看到的、我们有疑问的事情或我们甚至没有看到的事情。
 我想保持积极的态度，我希望我们能够反映我们对该项目的积极感受，因为布莱恩是开发团队等，但是。
 嗯，我能做什么，布莱恩？如果你想断开五分钟的时间来谈谈这件事，也可以。
 我们可以，我们可以这样做。
 但我想你已经听到了董事会中每个人的意见。
 鉴于我们面前的材料，每个人都对这一速度有一些疑问和保留。
 如果你的架构师把
 下一个层次的设计思维，当你回到我们这里时，可能有六条评论要与你分享，你就可以参加比赛了，那么我们该怎么办呢？你需要什么才能达到这一点？因为我认为今晚董事会不愿意完全接受这一点，老实说。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4742.87s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我认为艾丽西亚已经回答了其中一些问题，无论她是否知道我们已经满足了所需的条件。
 我的意思是，如果你明白我们在某些方面有不足，我们当然明白我已经尽力解释了这一点，但就艾丽西亚而言，你知道我们需要满足一定程度的条件并提供授予的材料，他们可能不会
 你知道，令人惊叹的风景照片，但这是几周前该论坛要求的内容列表。
 我们向他们提供一份清单和更新的计划。
 如果他有严重的问题，
 我们应该在几周前就收到警报。
 现在，在我看来，我们浪费了时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4784.713s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 哈尼什先生，很抱歉，我要打断您了，因为我们与您进行了一次非正式会议，您很合作，并向我们做了自我介绍，努力提供尽可能多的信息并提供尽可能多的帮助，以便这次会议有最大的成功机会。
 您听说过一些董事会成员对向他们提供完整的事项清单感到不舒服，并认为我们必须提出他们与该计划相关的所有事项，并将提出愿望清单的负担强加给我们。
 我觉得你在反对我们，说，好吧，我做了你在上次会议上告诉我的一切，现在应该足够了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4821.112s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 因此，恕我直言，如果有人可以传达这是什么。
 只是景观设计师绘制了一张展示草地及其各种灌木的平面图。
 因为你知道，我们举行了几次、几次会议，不仅尊重董事会和他们的身份，你知道，以及他们必须做什么，而且我们会见了规划总监，我们在几次会议上会面，我们尽了最大努力。
 这就是我们所要求的，我们有一个公平的评估，为您提供我们所能提供的最好的服务。
 如果你告诉我们，你知道，就这样，如果你能给我们任何关于它丢失原因的指示，除了，
 景观设计师盖章并计数，你知道，指定植物和树木。
 我们为您提供场地规划。
 然后你检查了一下。
 在这里我们有一定程度的必要条件。
 显然，要真正在这件事上铲起土来，还有几个步骤要做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4877.935s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我可以跳到这里吗？
 谈话时间越长，我就越感到不舒服我要来这里只是说：我希望市政府解释一下我们现在正在做的这个过程。
 我们的部门负责人不会在信中解释他们在缓解方面的要求。
 我们被迫在没有我们为该委员会设定的标准信息的情况下做出决定。
 那么，镇上发生了哪些谈话呢？
 作为董事会我们应该做什么？
 我们有什么权利？
 我从来没有在公开会议上感到如此不舒服。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4922.138s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 除了克里斯蒂所说的之外，场地规划审查的其中一件事是议会拥有，我们可以控制场地的设计和布局。
 正如克拉斯已经提到的，交通、停车、标牌、建筑设计，对吗？
 然后我们，
 我们讨论网站的未来管理等，我们所做的分析之一显然是：我们需要看看现在如何向我们呈现。我可以整夜坐在这里给你条件，但我是在建立一个社区吗？
 正义还是服务，无论我只是根据你现在阻止的事情来猜测，我都确信这一点。
 项目，我希望看到您尽快取得进展。
 但我只是想确保我们在已经花费大量时间的基础上继续努力。
 我们在城市层面做了很多事情，并确保我们有一个全面的计划。
 我们确保我们设计它。
 我们正在努力为社区进行尽职调查，并确保发生的一切都是正确构建的。
 我们希望确保您也能继续前进。
 我们根本没有足够的信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=4985.775s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我们不要求差异。
 我们并不是要求您绕过任何建筑规范或类似的规定。
 事实上，我相信这个项目对城市和地区来说要好得多。
 如果今晚没有通过，那么接下来的五年里，起重机场和公交车场将保持原样。
 有租赁选择，这就是将会发生的事情。
 我认为这会对梅德福市造成损害。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5016.398s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 布莱恩，你让我们陷入了困境。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5017.619s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我的意思是，我们……我知道，但有时我认为应该使用常识。
 我不相信如果你必须在拖车场和大美国啤酒馆之间做出选择，你会选择拖车场。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5029.445s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 这是不公平的，这不是我们想要做的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5032.246s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这就是现实情况。
 这是一个选择。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5035.888s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我们正在努力代表社区和梅德福市坚持我们被要求做的事情。
 所以我想如果这个城市，如果艾丽西亚，
 您能否指导我们，也许布隆伯格总统，如果您可以带我们回到一个有方向的地方，但我们应该设定什么条件，或者您为什么告诉我们我们必须通过，并且基于某些要求我们别无选择？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5069.468s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 有一些选项，它们将于 10 月 31 日到期。
 这也是我们通过第一资本获得7A贷款的条件。
 这些都是本项目开展的条件。
 如果没有今晚，我们就无法前进。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5088.997s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 因此，如果可以的话，我认为我从董事会那里听到的内容，首先，我想明确表示，有些条件是董事会可以批准的，有些条件是董事会可以拒绝的。
 我们向申请人提供，除了我们的会议之外，
 在申请人与该委员会的上次会议中，我们向他提供了该委员会的绩效标准，即分区的第 6.4 条。
 在您的数据包中，这是提供给您的分区的第 40 页，以及第 11.7 节，即场地规划审查，即第 125 页。
 我们要求他回顾一下并确保他完成了其中的所有事情。
 他以书面形式规定他遵守这些规定，如果他不能遵守其中任何规定，他应该请求豁免。所以我们听到他说的是，他觉得自己已经达到了这些标准，在我看来，董事会的说法是不，我们没有看到他已经达到了标准，但他相信自己已经达到了。
 所以这是一个死胡同。
 我真的需要你说出哪些项目没有得到解决，因为你逐项浏览了它们，并意识到你感觉自己找到了它们。
 当我们看到这个时，有 11-7-10 种模式可供批准。
 当该董事会作为决策者时，正确的做法是审查第一点到第七点以及这些事情是否可以完成，因为它们对于作为发行人的拟议开发的书面结论是必要的。
 这是第 125 页。
 我们唯一能提供的是
 可以做的一件事是向申请人发送一封信，表明在提供更多详细信息后打算批准他们。
 这不是一个假设，这是因为从法律上讲，如果您提供了所要求的一切，该委员会就不能拒绝您。
 根据裁决第 11.7.11 条，董事会在作为场地规划审批机构时可以有条件地批准或拒绝场地规划审批请求。
 但是，拒绝申请应仅基于申请人未提供所需信息。
 因此，如果您提供该信息，董事会必须批准。
 这是我们需要理解的东西，理解是必要的。
 信息，你可能会说它符合第 11 710 节的批准标准，我们可以一一审查这些标准，我会告诉你，分区委员会，当它是特别许可机构时，也就是今晚的这个机构，将审查每项标准并讨论它是否已达到，然后将反映在决定中。
 由于这是该级别的许可证，因此没有分区标志。
 事实上，我们需要为这七个要素中的每一个要素写出一个答案。
 事实上，这是我们今天下午应该做的练习，以便为我们提供正确撰写决定的材料。
 因此，我认为可以选择继续举行听证会，然后提供更多信息。
 我不认为这位候选人是读心术者。
 我不会读心术。
 我理解你的意思：我听到了，但我没有看到，我需要看到。
 但我不明白的是，还有哪些是你没有听说过、想看到的？
 因为他检查了清单。
 所有这些东西都在书面文件中或上面。
 因此，如果我们说：这是您需要向我们提供的内容，则需要您向我们解释。
 我不准备说这幅画只看到图像而不是文字。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5340.343s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 嗯，艾丽西亚，谢谢你的澄清。
 但公平地说，也就是为了符合审美标准，
 我们必须评估和批准建筑材料。
 我们甚至没有该建筑的照片。
 并且材料将被确定。
 因此，演示文稿中遗漏了一些元素。
 现在，我们在我的任期内从未有过这种情况，虽然任期不长，但在我的三四年里，
 我们是候选人，我们将继续进行指导和决策，我们永远是朋友。
 那些想要反馈的人回来了，回来了，做了额外的工作，我们一起解决了这个问题。
 所以这是一个不同的情况，对我们来说是一个独特的情况。
 Se o 候选人的辩论，精确的决定，e tenho que tomá-la, acho que esse é o nosso trabalho, e podemos analisar tudo isso, e podemos fazer uma lista tão exaustiva quanto possível, mas não sei se isso seria uma aprovação,
 如果名单这么长，如何才能获得批准呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5412.2s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的。
 所以，有两件事。
 该委员会曾因未提供所需信息而拒绝了一名申请人。
 在那起案件中，他们拒绝在一个地点进行钻探，该地点向法院提起诉讼，并在申请人同意钻探后被退回议会。
 钻孔进行水测试。
 我不知道你在理事会时是否转发过，但这是2019年的一个案例，2020年转发的。
 所以我审查了我们给申请人的审美标准，这就是分区中的标准。
 它说第 6.48 节
 拟议开发项目的位置、规模和设计、建筑材料和运营特征将与该地区及周边社区的自然和建筑环境相邻的房产的宜居性或充分开发相兼容，并且不会对其产生不利影响。
 他接着谈到了邻里的兼容性、外部建筑材料的和谐和规模、质量和密度。
 与总体规划和城市通过的其他规划的目的和目标保持一致。
 嗯，所以我知道你在哪里说起来有困难，比如，
 这不是理事会的意见。
 我们喜欢砖而不是金属。
 可能是，如果这是一个由房屋组成的社区，而您不喜欢该社区的金属结构，您会意识到它与周围的社区不兼容。
 但他实际上给了你一张结构图和材料示例。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5520.795s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我没有艾丽西亚，没有建筑物，我有一个图像，它对我来说只是概念性的，并不反映真实情况。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5531.644s">[Unidentified]</a>: 这就是我听到的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5533.146s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 你真的这么说是因为我知道这是他们计划建造的建筑吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5538.43s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 不不不，他不是这么说的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5540.908s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我说过这是一个概念图像，所以不要将它与您所看到的确切图像结合起来。
 然而，它是，我已经详细回顾过，它是一个低坡屋顶，一个预制金属建筑看起来像这样。
 我们还没有选择特定的颜色。
 考虑到预算限制，当实际施工时间周期性增加时，我所说的正面立面上由内而外的感觉的玻璃数量，仅仅因为你看到完整的幕墙，可能是其中的 75%。
 这张图片是我们能提供的最接近的图片。
 这是基于 Whitlock Design Group 提供的建筑图纸，我们向其提供平面图和示意图。
 我只是不想让框架与确切的颜色相匹配。
 事实上，我认为我们可以极大地改进它。
 所以我认为缺乏定义，但它是一种预制金属结构。
 基本上，它在架构上看起来像这样。
 我只是不想让面板匹配特定的颜色，也许是屋顶的颜色。
 我试图从这个开始，但如果这看起来不是我们正在构建的，我向董事会道歉。
 但这很有指示意义。
 这只是调色板，事情可能会发生变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5612.705s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 尺寸呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5614.228s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 尺寸就在那里。
 我的意思是，这就是我们基本上获得批准的原因。
 我的意思是，建筑成本再次大幅波动。
 这是我们在价值工程中唯一真正拥有它的地方，但仅此而已。
 这就是大楼。
 这就是我们所要求的。
 我们付钱给建筑师来设计它。
 正如布莱恩指出的，我们根据土壤测试对这座建筑的选址进行了多次迭代。
 你知道，我们挖了测试坑。
 我们做了所有这些事情。
 你知道，我们刚刚到达
 你知道，重点是，这是我们为你提供的最好的。
 我当然听到董事会说我们缺乏景观和这种性质的东西。
 我认为我们可以与议会合作，找到可以美化空间的东西，并希望让它变得更好。
 但是，你知道，我通常会得到某种指导或其他东西，但是，你知道，我想尊重整个过程。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5672.073s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我的意思是，我认为，有趣的是，就像我之前说过的那样，我对这座建筑没有任何保留。
 我，建筑物就是建筑物。
 我想我明白我对场地规划和今天的设计方式有疑问。
 嗯，就像我一样，我之前想说的是，我想也许对我有帮助的是带你，提出这个计划的工程师，并得到，
 在与我们通话期间进行研究的交通工程师将提供很大帮助，因为这将帮助我们了解他们的想法。
 我正在看大楼的入口处和停车场，它偏离了对面街道的中心。
 我们在艾丽西亚刚刚提到的另一个项目上讨论了几个小时，关于如何……我想听交通工程师说，好吧。
 嗯，所以你设计了一条从街道人行道到前门的五英尺长的人行道，非常狭窄，不受欢迎。你知道，我想听听创建该网站的人告诉我们为什么它很酷。从人行流线来看。嗯，有很多事情让前面的停车变成了死胡同。
 会发生什么？那个空间里停着三辆车。
 这将是一场灾难。
 你知道，我上次说过，当你把车停在栅栏上时，邻居的栅栏上，你知道，没有任何保护，你知道吗？这真的是最佳实践吗？
 我，我，我不知道。
 我的意思是，我认为有些事情让我们感到不舒服。
 我相信。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5784.706s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 好的。
 你是在说那个神秘的隔壁邻居吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5788.429s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 这太可爱了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5790.907s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 财产也。
 所以没关系。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5795.949s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 但无论如何，你把车停在地界线旁边，你知道，我的意思是，我，这些是我，你知道，我们，我和，你知道，艾丽西亚，我告诉自己如果我错了，但我们从整体上看待这些项目，现在，它看起来并不像它应该的那样。
 我不知道。
 我的意思是，显然这个论坛上的每个人都感到不舒服。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5822.296s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 所以我听到的是你不喜欢某些设计，但是说真的，你能停止屏幕共享吗？
 因为这对我们来说似乎很奇怪。
 这令人不安。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5833.063s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 它就在你的屏幕上。
 那真令人恶心。
 啊，它说屏幕共享已暂停。
 对不起。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5839.527s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 我们真的有吗？我们可以给他们如何
 这是我们的工作吗？
 我们是什么，我们的工作是什么？
 例如，我们通常会发表这些评论，然后来来回回，这就是它的工作原理，但我们必须做什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5857.27s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好吧，好吧，如果你想说我们不舒服，老实说，我还没有检查过分区是否允许停车。
 它说是的，需要在您的停车场和邻居之间进行检查。
 如果你说，
 我们同意入口走廊应该更窄，但不要让中间的岛变大，将其移离邻居并在邻居上放置屏风。
 这是你可以做的事情。
 他们回来说我们实际上拥有那处房产并且宁愿把它放在它前面也是合理的。
 他们想要这样做有点奇怪，但他们可以。
 但这些具体的事情是这个论坛通常说的事情。
 我想看看这条步行道，但没有看到自行车架。
 如果他对你说，告诉我你想要什么改变，我将做出改变，我会在两周内回复你，那么你就会开始说，这是我们希望看到的改变。
 这就是这张卡通常的作用。
 我实际上是说艾米丽和乔治中的一些人相对较新。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5928.11s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 可以简单的列出来吗？我的意思是，我知道这不是我们想做的，但我们也不想在这个项目中插刀。你知道，我指的是停车场、行人流通、人行道的设计，这就是我所看到的问题以及与景观美化相结合的问题。
 如果他们愿意继续与我们合作并回来真正考虑这些方面并与消防部门合作，我的意思是，这些都是我感到不舒服的事情。
 您似乎没有对这些项目使用最佳实践。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=5976.922s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们可以查看站点计划更新列表并将其作为起点吗？
 了解条件并发现哪些是我们想要深入研究的，哪些是我们可能需要量化或限定的才能感到舒服。
 然后可能会合并一些未反映在该列表中的内容。
 这可能是我们的起点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6001.06s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我建议阿曼达或者阿曼达，你准备好做这些笔记了吗？
 因为我想说你可以屏幕共享该文档并将其添加为红色。
 然后理事会就可以看到这一点。
 你想让我这样做还是？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6019.222s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 董事会对此也感到满意吗？
 因为大卫早些时候提出了某种临时文件的建议，以允许这个令人难以置信的项目向前推进。
 但也许在某种程度上让董事会更舒服。
 这是大卫的问题，而不是任何候选人的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6040.314s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的。
 我喜欢这个主意。在这个时间线事件中，我不确定是谁用枪指着你的头，布莱恩。我没有从建议中听到任何无法克服的建议，你知道，如果你必须将一座风景优美的岛屿移到这里一点点。
 你改变行程，你知道，没有人说话，你改变建筑物，没有人说话，你把它推倒，你把它切成两半，你知道，是的，那是艾丽西亚之前离开的地方，如果你把它放在那里</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6076.03s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这对我有好处。
 我想到的是租金受到威胁，业主有房东选择权，他们不希望土地空置。
 所以他们不希望我们继续前进，我们说我们很好，最后场地规划审查告诉我们不行。
 租户正在搬出或要求让步，老实说，它在我的地方变成了火球围栏。
 这就是我来自的地方。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6102.108s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 好吧，如果我是对的，你只能以违反分区规定为由拒绝。
 是这样吗？
 我们不能否认您的场地规划，我们只能确保我们最好地适应社区。
 我们不能否认您的网站计划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6115.222s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的，本质上是艾丽西亚向我们展示了它，这就像一种否认，因为缺少基本元素或您所了解的有关该应用程序的信息。
 也许这是我们应该在有条件接受方面考虑的问题，我们只是比平时有更多的条件，这可能是支持者或申请人返回议会并解决现场行人和车辆流动问题以使议会满意的一个条件。现在，这比我们通常所做的更令人向往、更普遍。
 但如果我们寻求有条件接受并以这种方式表达，其他董事会成员会有何感受？这会让他们感到舒服吗？
 您是否可以看到对此点赞或点头或评论？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6172.999s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 是的，我认为这是一个好方法。
 我认为有条件迫使他们回到我们身边更多地参与并拥有这些
 看看那种安全港条款，你知道，项目的进展会让我感觉更舒服。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6194.228s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，这仍然是一次技术传球，并且满足了他今晚的目标。
 所以，你知道，它使我们能够完成我们的任务。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6206.716s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 如果有帮助的话，我们实际上咨询了我们团队的一位成员，因为这种类型的问题在梅德福并不经常出现，但我们团队的一位成员已经在萨默维尔的分区委员会任职多年，她说，当申请人资源有限时，就会出现这种情况，如果他们不知道该项目会获得批准，他们就不愿意在景观设计师身上花很多钱。
 所以他们经常这样做，
 景观美化计划更新条件已提交给团队进行审查和批准，并满足他们设定的许多标准，但基本上他们会说这里是团队必须批准任何事情的所有条件，我将指出你们都看不到的幕后部分。
 是我们签发了批准，说我们在这里种植，所以他们仍然需要建筑许可证。
 在他们获得建筑许可证之前，必须经过我们的城市工程师的批准。
 因此，健康和消防部门将真正批准正式计划，而我也必须批准这些计划。
 所以，除非你回来在这里说出来，否则你无法得到我的签名。
 如果我们希望他们回来并向议会展示计划，
 我们可以设置条件，因为他们满足的条件是，在满足所有条件之前，他们不会获得建筑许可证。
 事实上，她是说他们将条件与时间点联系起来。
 因此，会有基础许可证、建筑许可证和占用许可证。
 当你们和分区委员会提出条件时，
 阿曼达和我讨论幕后的事情，对吧？
 在获得建筑许可证之前他们必须做什么？在获得入住许可证之前他们必须做哪些建设，对吗？
 所以我们已经在办公室用电子表格将这些东西分开了。
 因此，回到本委员会作为一种选择，在获得建筑许可证之前考虑这些事情是标准做法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6342.88s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我认为我所想象的是一种能让他们回来的条件，因为你知道，危机评论就是一个例子。
 你知道，这不是一个我们可以提供的具体要做的事情的简短清单，但我们希望听到更多关于某人的想法背后的流通或路边放置和此类事情的理解，所以我认为我们希望他们回到我们身边来解决这个问题。
 我们是任意数量的元素。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6372.586s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 正如丽莎所说，通常就像接听电话的交通工程师和景观设计师一样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6379.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 但从理论上讲，这些将是我们今晚接受的条件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6383.021s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我想这就是我的想法，艾米丽。
 所以如果是这样的话，我们也许应该尝试，我们应该尝试弄清楚它们是什么，对吧？
 我们想加入，Klyce，你想和我们一起开始吗？
 我们能否就问题而言，也许今晚你可以回答一些问题。
 也许稍后您想了解一些事情。
 我们可以包括，你知道，这可能是我们的一个小组，然后可能是一些具体的任务，如果这是一个潜在的第三组，我们将与布莱恩和凯尔一起推进这一工作。
 这对你有用吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6424.193s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我们可以先询问支持者吗？
 当然。
 我想说，我们是否应该首先询问支持者这是否适合他们？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6434.515s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 哦是的。
 关键问题。
 您对我们在这里讨论的内容有何看法？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6440.436s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 好吧，显然我必须将这一点传达给我的老板，但我不能保证我们能够继续前进。
 但我喜欢艾丽西亚的想法，你知道，我完全理解你在说什么，但我们将受到建筑许可证和所有
 每一位工程师和每一个城市部门。
 这就是我们在此过程中的下一步。
 我在电话中看到帕特里克·安德鲁斯 (Patrick Andrews)，我们的下一步实际上就是，你知道，这是 218,000 个架构计划，然后是另一个，你知道，50,000 名工程师，我们已经完全准备好花费这些资金来完成这项任务。
 今晚理事会建议的方式，
 业主会想保留我们现在拥有的东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6498.75s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Brian，你能重申一下我们前进的道路吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6505.435s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 如果你希望有某种条件迫使我们返回，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6512.548s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我不知道这是否会发生，这个项目是否会发生，因为我不知道你回来的条件，我想这只是更详细地解释我们的一些疑问。
 好吧，做吧。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6532.233s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 然后当我听说如果这些地方都说了会发生什么
 补充说，这可能会改变，停车位可能会改变，人行道可能会改变以及其他一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6547.277s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 是的，然后一切。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6552.621s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，你知道，自从我的团队（第一资本的所有者）以来，这一切都在幕后进行，每个人都对此达成了共识，我们已经准备好继续前进。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6562.657s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 如果建筑师和所有人，你知道，一旦他们了解更多细节，难道不会改变吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6570.141s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 所以我们只想这么做。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6577.765s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我只想说，很抱歉，如果这对您来说是一个大问题，那么我不知道为什么该委员会要花接下来的一个小时来研究这些条件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6589.531s">[Unidentified]</a>: 说实话。
 我们在这里做什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6596.407s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我的意思是，布莱恩，我认为这就是接受。
 会有条件，但你知道，事实并非如此。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6605.017s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我们可以做到这一点。
 我只是等待。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6612.629s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sinto sua dor porque este é o trabalho que faço, mas é melhor para você, como novo desenvolvedor, se envolver em um processo como este o mais rápido possível, para que você realmente minimize o risco agora e se comprometa com nossos termos e faça com que seus arquitetos e engenheiros façam isso uma vez.
 Porque a quantidade de dinheiro que você gasta em desenhos
 São centavos comparados a ir mais longe e ter que voltar e se trocar.
 E acho que você deveria pensar assim agora que é um desenvolvedor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6648.224s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 嗯，这就是我们今晚来这里的原因。
 我的意思是，我们基本上已经确定了这一点。

 E a gente tem que cumprir essas condições perante a diretoria, sabe, e você, sim, eu entendo que poderia ser uma lista longa nesse Sentido, e estamos pedindo um pouco de Assistência and ajuda porque estamos com pouco tempo, sabe, mas,
 正如布莱恩所说，我们有能力让建筑师、设计师和工程师参与其中。
 我们只是想要一些清晰的信息和指导，以帮助我们向您传达您想看到的一切。
 我们不想对此进行多次迭代和重申。
 我们了解您考虑的是社区并希望看到最好的产品。
 我认为我们完全同意你的观点。
 我想告诉你，布莱恩的处境和困难，以及如何解决这些问题。
 我们不反对他们看到最终的规划，当然还有景观规划等等。
 我可能是与您互动最多的人。
 我很高兴收到你的来信，克莱斯。
 我认为听听您的想法和担心的事情确实很有帮助。
 我可以将这一点传达给我们的工程师，并在我们回来时向他们提供一些背景信息和一些答案。
 但我认为从布莱恩的角度来看，是的，他需要一些保证
 你知道，这并不是浪费大家的时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6743.47s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我认为这是值得赞赏的。
 再说一遍，我再说一遍。
 我喜欢这个项目。
 我想象自己坐在啤酒厂里喝啤酒，希望很快有一天。
 话虽如此，对我来说，我希望看到的是一个团队，一个
 由专业人士组成的联合团队共同提供场地规划，展示所有这些企业的所有最佳实践。
 场地流线、景观美化、车辆流线。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6800.225s">[Unidentified]</a>: 就这样。
 嗯嗯。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6805.275s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这是可以理解的。
 也就是说，我们以国内法为指导，并提供我们认为足够的内容。
 然后，显然，如果您对此有意见并且想要改变它，我们可以讨论该问题。
 但这是我们为工程师提供的道路：他们必须交付。
 我们有市政法令为我们提供指导。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6826.285s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我，我，我，我正在寻找比成就感更好的东西。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6928.595s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 如果我可以问一下支持者的话，有人提到了神秘大道南侧的一些事情。
 提案者想埋葬某个帖子或其他东西。
 我不明白替代方案是什么，也不明白那根柱子的目的是什么。
 我什至无法想象那是什么样子。
 如果你买不起或埋掉那根杆子，还有什么选择呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=6954.883s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这是一个很好的问题。
 这不是允许的问题。
 这就是经销商愿不愿意做的问题。
 我们可以下订单。
 所以这取决于谁拥有这根杆子。
 它可能是 Eversource、国家电网或 Verizon。
 然后你必须要求他们在其位置放置一个变压器。
 所以能量仍然到达极点。
 您移除该杆，它将来自最近的杆，进入地下并进入块安装变压器，该变压器仍必须位于我们的某个地方
 景观的缓冲区，我们必须在它周围放置一些灌木丛和所有东西，但它仍然比那里的杆子更好。
 我的意思是，这只是我们的一个目标，我们致力于努力完成这件事，我想克莱提到过这一点，入口、车库通道、路缘切口是在其位置提出的，这就是它不能进一步向下滑动的主要原因，它偏离了中心，因为我们那里有一条公用设施管线，并且不能保证我们可以移动它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7009.258s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 不，我只是想知道移动杆子的确切目的是什么，因为我从在该州工作以及与公用事业公司合作中了解到的一件事是，你可以通过尝试来破坏你的整个预算和范围
 在适当的时间带上所有公共服务人员。
 它还可以极大地增加您的地铁预算。
 我只是不知道你到底想用它来完成什么。
 就这样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7040.487s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 它在街上看起来更好而且......非常美观。
 是的，审美，是的。
 我的意思是，无论如何，我们将提供一直到街道的地下服务。
 因此，您需要挖掘一条额外的电线以供电线到达该位置。
 Eversource 或任何公用事业提供商从上到下都拥有它。
 我们将拥有从建筑物到人行道的挖掘工作。
 我希望这能回答你的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7065.47s">[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>: 是的，谢谢。</p>

 谢谢您，先生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7089.36s">[v8aFu2OAn8o_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 我，嗯，我很高兴能回来，我知道我在周中与阿曼达分享了一些关于该项目的行人通道的评论。
 我看到你们包括了一条人行道，但我想看到，你知道，更好，只是一个更有凝聚力的行人流通计划，这实际上不仅仅是引导人们通过
 我想，我的意思是，如果它能以某种方式与人行横道整合，你知道，更好。
 例如，我担心人们穿过停车场。
 而且，你知道，行人和车辆之间难免会发生冲突。
 我知道最佳实践之一，最佳实践之一是使用
 半径较窄的弯曲零件类型。
 我的意思是，伙计，我们真的陷入了困境，不是吗？
 但是，您知道，半径较小会迫使汽车在场地周围移动得更慢。
 所以这就是我真正认为的设计姿态，你知道，我认为这不是一项艰巨的任务，但它也确实提高了网站的安全性和体验。
 别的东西
 呃，有人打来电话，你提到这里有一个公共汽车站，你知道如果人们想要使用公共交通到达该项目会是什么样子，你知道这是一个非常好的主意，所以你不会有人酒后驾车，人们如何从公共汽车到达这里，公共汽车站在哪里，如果我们可以在计划中显示它，你知道，也许这表明或表明人们如何上下公共汽车，或者是否有某种设计姿态。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7203.82s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们如何才能做到这一点才能为他们提供最清晰的指导？
 我认为这应该是我们对所有这些评论提出的问题。
 我们如何才能使其可行？
 我们怎样才能把这一点说清楚呢？
 因此，当我们的条件之一最终是我们希望他回来时，我们可以说，伙计们，这是惊人的，因为我们已经非常清楚了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7224.448s">[v8aFu2OAn8o_SPEAKER_18]</a>: 我想这其实也是我一直在思考的一个问题。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7232.817s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 与我一起工作，我会把它扔在那里，因为它就像，但是，你知道，与市政交通工程师或交通总监一起工作，我认为这仍然有点令人困惑，但要维持现有的公交车通道。
 我认为这是第一步。
 然后，你知道，
 有一个关于自行车停放的评论。
 所以也许这样做会很好。
 但也许现在只需维持现有的公交车通道即可。
 因为我也在努力记住这是一个 DOT 拥有的地方。
 你离得很远。
 因此，如果我们要求他们建立 16 个公交车站，那是不现实的，我们会让他们失败。
 所以也许这个传统会起作用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7287.958s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 在这一点上，我想补充一点，如果其他人同意的话，我知道这是一个要经过 MassDOT 的过程，但是当你以 MassDOT 的方式开发一个网站时，我觉得这通常伴随着一个你必须经历的过程。
 许多城镇也时常经过它。
 所以我想既然这是一条路
 一条交通部拥有的大型高速公路，需要在行人活动、人行横道以及可能闪烁的灯光或其他方面进行改进。
 我认为这个过程必须要做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7329.686s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们之前批准的项目是否有类似的条件，我认为该项目位于神秘岛更北的地方？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7342.339s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 具体是通过什么方式呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7344.561s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 将人行横道视为行人安全。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7350.745s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的，也许这是正确的做法，因为托德·布莱克（Todd Blake）看到了它。</p>

 如果交通部批准，我们将尝试这样做，并且现在已将其纳入计划中。
 这样的事情可以澄清一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7386.608s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，他提供了两条路，其中之一就是 DOT。
 另一个是我们说过我们将致力于的另一项缓解措施，我们同意这一点，并且我们可以实施它。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7509.162s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，由注册景观设计师按照 6.4 的规定制定景观规划。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7515.184s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7649.999s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 上次会议上我提到了一种壁画。
 在其中，我认为它是建筑物的北侧，与其纪念性入口在同一侧。
 我在文档中没有看到这个，我们看的文档是什么？
 站点计划更新列表。
 我知道不是每个人都喜欢壁画，但我会对某种条件或条件感兴趣
 你知道，如果你不能添加额外的窗户、开口或栅栏，无论你想怎么称呼它，在建筑物的一侧，你知道，有某种艺术成分，或者我想，是的，我试图不陷入砖块与金属的争论。
 是的，我不知道。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7715.211s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我们可以跳到阿曼达的名单吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7745.43s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7746.19s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 让我们有机会看看愿景是什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7749.493s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 你可以想出更好的办法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7750.733s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 确切地。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7752.435s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 这是否是我们要求他们回来更新我们的情况的一部分，而不是额外的批准步骤？
 它会简单地
 你知道，嘿，告诉我们你在做什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7768.61s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我想我们正在弥补。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7771.452s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 这就是我们正在努力的方向，对吧？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7773.594s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我想了一下，无论是在一次会议还是几次会议上，或者我认为我们必须听取提议者的意见，当他准备好解决足够多的问题以使其值得讨论时。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7785.062s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我认为我们应该合理，就像开会一样，如果我们能包含所有内容，那就合理了。
 就像，是的，我们不想。
 你知道，我不想成为负担。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7797.537s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 对每个人来说都是公平的。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7798.917s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7802.498s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我本来想添加这个。
 我的意思是，我一直认为，嗯，利用壁画的想法，嗯，潜在地接触艺术组织，与他们合作处理这类事情是个好主意。
 我知道药房有类似的，嗯，
 我们与他们进行了类似的讨论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7827.225s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 不过，我想指出一些事情。
 寻找壁画非常昂贵。
 艺术团体在药房里也有自己的空间。
 他们想要把壁画放在前面。
 但他们仍然要求大麻公司向艺术家支付设计和制造费用。
 我会自然而然地说，做这样的事情是一笔很大的钱，很容易超过 10,000 美元。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7858.988s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 艾丽西亚，我要补充一点，这是一个建议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7863.69s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7865.191s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 这不是一个条件。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7870.313s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 无论如何，仅强烈建议符合美学标准 6.4.8。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7879.578s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 绝对地。
 我认为，如果我们看到更多真实的东西，少一点概念性，多一点真实，我们可能会对布莱恩和凯尔有更好的了解，了解他们的愿景是什么。
 但如果没有的话，我们就会问这些类型的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7895.543s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 所以我只想跟大家分享一下，对于建筑许可，有时需要您提供标高和材料类型，但不需要您提供任何类型的表示。
 所以这将是他们专门为我们创造的东西，而不是为了任何其他目的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=7914.228s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我认为立面是一种表征。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8025.723s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我的意思是，我对景观美化有一些了解，但我认为答案是，你知道，优先考虑本地物种，任何需水量较低的植物。

 所以不要强迫它，但是
 这是一种双向流量模式，而不是单向。
 是这样吗？
 正确的。

 朝着一个方向前进会给你更多的空间去做表面上的其他事情，对吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8125.758s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 也许是的。
 最重要的事情，我们必须满足的最重要的参数是消防部门的通道以及能够转动消防车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8137.405s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 是的，然后我想知道循环是否是一个更好的主意。
 也许甚至可以倾斜停车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8147.129s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 这是我们可以为您列入清单的内容。
 考虑到流通模式，请记住这一点，将这些部分作为可能性牢记在心。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8162.811s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 当然，我们可以对此进行探索，并与我们的工程师交谈。
 如果它改善了我们的网站，它就会改善，你知道，并降低我们的成本和其他一切，绝对是有好处的。
 正如布莱恩所说，我们已经为此努力了一段时间。
 所以，你知道，工程师们多次提出这样的建议。
 我们是这样看的，但值得注意的是，我认为我们可以研究一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8186.084s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 我谢谢。
 当前所在的前角建筑将是正确的。
 出色地。
 你说你会让所有的照明都遵守法律，所以我想我们不需要听到这个，只要这是真的。
 您在演讲中提到凯尔在建筑物南端、建筑物和阿特拉斯之间进行了绿地延伸类型的景观美化。
 它就在那里。
 我的意思是，您是否会考虑扩大这一点，就像增加绿色空间的成本很高一样？你能告诉我那里发生了什么吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8244.923s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，我们右侧加宽了大约60米，宽4.5米。
 具体原因是我试图达到城市景观条例 6.3 中列出的绩效标准。
 也就是说，你应该拥有 10% 的地面、景观和开放区域。
 所以我至少打了草地，然后打了空地。
 如果没有完成的话，庭院。
 但要回答你的问题，你为什么不完全退缩呢？
 另外，它可能不会得到任何阳光。
 我认为后面的沥青应该在那里，我们从消防部门学到的最重要的一点是他们需要 360 度的通道，所以他们需要能够停放卡车并将所有设备和所有东西放到后面。
 我不一定想给每个人草去做这件事。
 所以我们把它延伸到我们认为眼睛能看到的地方，然后我们把它变成了建筑物背面的沥青。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8300.304s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的，这是沥青状态吗？</p>

 这是垃圾桶吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8329.093s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 嗯，是的，那是一辆车停在那里。
 那里有一个垃圾箱，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8335.158s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 那里有车辆充电站管道吗？它们是电动的还是电动的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8345.595s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 将提供电力服务。
 我的意思是，你知道，他们并没有真正让你让他高兴起来。
 他们只是让你通过坡道。
 你知道，我们会把管道放在机舱的某个地方。
 而且，你知道，如果我们进入充电器安装阶段，一切都将准备就绪。
 无需挖掘沥青。
 只需拉动电缆并连接充电器即可。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8365.942s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 出色地。
 我们的法令的编写方式对此有点令人困惑。

 一年之内，我们将拥有 X 个电动汽车停车位。
 两年内我们将拥有这个价值。
 我认为，如果我们第一天没有这样的事情，我们会很受欢迎。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8402.828s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，我想我们和艾丽西亚谈过几次，因为我需要澄清这一点。
 我没有看到任何具体的法令。
 我认为最好的解决方案就是她建议的解决方案，我认为这很棒，至少运行管道直到我们弄清楚它应该是什么。
 绝对地。
 这就是我现在的解决方案。</p>

 好吧，也许当我们回来时你会有更多的想法与我们分享。

 并不是真正的条件，而是我想听到的。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8451.753s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们已经考虑到我们是将其转换为条件还是保持原样。
 包括我不知道的规定，我可能会采取任何一种方式。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8471.473s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 是的，我觉得他们可能遵守了该条例，但如果我们能够更多地倾听，如果他们能够制定改进计划并将其带到现实空间，那就太好了。
 我认为你的客户会想要这样，我认为他们会想要这样，至少出于营销目的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8493.7s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 哦，是的，我们同意。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8494.761s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 这就是你的人口统计，你知道吗？
 是的，这对生意会有好处。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8499.624s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我先不说我是我们办公室的经济发展规划师。伊薇特在我们的公共场所停放了很多停车位，并参与了资助计划，因此她很乐意分享她所知道的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8526.55s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 嗯，我想其他部分是常见的，所以我们几乎总是以遵守部门的信件为条件接受。
 健康委员会，我想这是相当无害的事情。
 尽管你可以和我们一起登机，但消防部门似乎无害。
 工程对你来说不是有问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8556.198s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 不，他们实际上一直在与我们的土木工程团队 Eagle Brook 合作开展雨水管理项目。
 他们已经看到了这一点，也意识到了这一点，但不，他们的标准是相当标准的雨水管理，而所有这些都被许可证取消了。
 如果我们被允许拆除我们必须建造的现有建筑物，我们必须获得雨水管理计划和许可证。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8578.787s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 有趣的。
 出色地。
 出色地。
 然后是交通。很抱歉，我们已经要求您单独回答这个问题。
 当我们再次见面时。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8590.633s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我认为至少在下一个计划中，我们将能够提供交通部门建议的缓解措施。
 你知道，我们可以列出它们并将它们放入计划中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8608.464s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 考虑到建筑物的规模，是否需要使用太阳能？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8616.895s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我相信我已经与候选人讨论过这个问题，他们正计划在建筑物上安装太阳能。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8622.0s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 这是正确的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8624.622s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我认为这是必要的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8626.984s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 太阳能需求，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8628.145s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 基本上，太阳能条例的设计是为了满足通过场地规划审查所需的一切。除了较小的公寓外，我们还需要太阳能。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8642.659s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8643.486s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 要求是他们必须进行研究，他们必须向我们展示，如果他们认为他们不能投入太阳能，他们必须向我们展示为什么不。
 否则，就继续吧。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8656.957s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 那么，这种情况出现在哪里呢？
 我们是在谈论建筑许可证还是应该将其列入我们的讨论清单？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8667.303s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我们实际上弄清楚了它是如何适应的，我忘了在哪里，并且在重新编码期间它从梅德福法律的建筑许可部分移至分区。
 我必须承认，我不记得他们在哪里停下来了，它不在重新编码之前的分区中，而是建筑许可要求，所以建筑部门对此进行了调查。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8690.454s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 好的。
 嗯，阿曼达知道，我想现在就足够了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8791.737s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我建议也许我们可以讨论第 16 点，阿曼达，这是全面的，并规定了候选人或提议者返回的条件，这样可以吗？
 与董事会讨论并分享以下信息以供董事会批准。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=8854.799s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 这种语言是否意味着我们有否认？

 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9080.053s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我认为在某个时候，凯尔，你将能够与我们一起处理事情。
 如果我们不确定这是否满足要求，您可以告诉 Klaus：
 这对你来说已经足够详细了，对吧？
 另一方面，我可以问 David 这是否足够，或者 Emily，这是否达到了您想要的详细程度？
 因为我们使用更宽松的语言来允许一定的灵活性，但我真的不想让他们回来说，好吧，这还不够详细。
 我们可以代理一些验证工作，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9119.789s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 我欢迎这个过程。
 显然，项目建设过程分为几个步骤。
 所以我会给你很多这样的迭代。
 我越能持续关注并让他们参与进来，他们就越能帮助我更详细地准确了解他们的需求。
 我可以让建筑师和景观工程师来安排，这样我们就不会在这些会议上浪费时间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9146.995s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 阿曼达，我还有一份给你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9190.864s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我只是希望项目团队和托德讨论这个问题并提出一个计划，他们可以告诉我们，嘿，这就是我们决定要做的。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9203.497s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，他在信中给出了这一点，或者至少给出了一些指导。
 显然，这是非常详细的。
 所以，是的，他提供了两条解决方案。
 我认为我们的工程师可以最后一次联系他并询问他，你对此有何看法？
 要知道吗？我们尝试根据您提供的信息进行工作。
 如果你给予他祝福，也许他可以给你写一封支持信。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9225.308s">[Deanna Peabody]</a>: 然而，我读你的信的方式并不是两种方式。

 我当然会的。
 时机就到了，我会以布莱克主任认为适当的方式满足我的要求。

 是啊，好吧，那太好了。
 是的，完美。
 这公平吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9331.581s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我的意思是，如果他们决定做 10 个，那么我们就不必做任何奇怪的事情。

 但如果你做得更多。</p>

 我认为最少是四个半。
 所以人行道是五厘米，这样我们九点半就有六英寸的路缘石。
 当然，当然。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9367.814s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我只是想确保这种语言不会让我们不得不这样做

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9382.581s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的，艾米丽正在努力提供尽可能多的灵活性。
 当你说给出一个数字时，你就必须给出这个数字，至少说出这个数字，然后你就可以灵活地给出这个数字。
 这就是我们在几个不同的警察地点看到的情况，所以
 你没有被困住。
 不，如果不找我们的零钱，您就不能做更多的事情。
 实际上我只是想与董事会分享我认为前面的人行道应该更大。
 我已经在这里讨论过这个问题。
 事实上，托德回来担任我们的交通总监。
 他说，实际上他更倾向于将其与道路的其他部分保持一致，并且如果交通部实际上决定改变该地区人行道的宽度，他们将通过铺设沥青来实现。
 他们会将其作为一个完整的街道项目来完成。
 如果我们只是简单地增加房屋前面人行道的宽度，那么在很长一段时间内都会显得很奇怪。
 我只是想分享这个，因为我知道有一些像我们一样的人，大多数关于五英尺宽的评论都是针对该房产的，但它与街上的情况相符。
 所以，你知道，这是一个奇怪的情况。
 我们也希望它更加适合步行，但现实是该社区仍然不适合步行。
 所以这是一条奇怪的路线。
 您是否试图通过邀请人们步行穿过非常危险的区域来使房产变得更适合步行？
 这很难，对吧？
 因为好吧，如果没有，你从哪里开始呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9487.188s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 当然。
 但我认为，爱丽丝，
 人们会从街对面的社区过来，走人行横道，或者穿过一个街区，然后沿着神秘街区走一个街区，或者其他什么，你知道，这会很高兴地发生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9508.252s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 是的，确实如此。
 我们同意这一点。
 一切都好。
 所以，事实上，邻居说她似乎当时就过马路，也许是为了赶那辆公共汽车。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9520.362s">[Unidentified]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9521.378s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 因此，我们希望让您在该区域尽可能感到舒适。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9525.762s">[Unidentified]</a>: 确实。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9533.187s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们可以用前脚掌敲击M1M并直接说出适当的障碍吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9606.481s">[Unidentified]</a>: 也许值得问凯尔，因为这实际上是他在文章中包含的内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9611.365s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 他们这是什么意思？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9614.585s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，这个列表，基本上从 A 到 O，是我根据我们上次的初步听证会生成的。
 我刚刚整理了他的笔记并会见了布莱恩，我们讨论了这个问题，他们更喜欢不在那边有景观缓冲区，因为他们也拥有那部分财产。
 所以我们只把它放在前面，面向建筑物的一侧。
 这就是它背后的背景。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9646.395s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 我的意思是，我绝对鼓励您观察人行道和停车场的整个宽度并进行思考。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9654.442s">[Zac Bears]</a>: 是的，只要我们能够满足停车标准，我知道，所以他们要求，我想，那是什么，19英尺深，我想我们有18英尺。因此，交通部门已经对此发出警告，但表示根据他们的解释，这是允许和可以接受的。
 如果我们在那里建立一个景观缓冲区，我认为我们会减少这些停车位。
 但值得关注的是我们能否做到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9679.691s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 如果你在单向道路上拍摄角度，你可能会距离该路段另外五英尺远。
 我的意思是，老实说，我认为栅栏上没有必要有七个，但你知道。
 另一种解决方法是简单地移除三四个空间，将其转换为土地，并添加一些树木。
 我认为这是创造的另一种方式......只是一些想法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9720.786s">[Amanda Centrella]</a>: 那么，克劳斯，您刚才提到的内容，我们仍然认为将其放在那里有意义吗，因为它并不真正完整？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9739.135s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 好吧，也许我们可以说包括一个水平缓冲区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9750.084s">[Unidentified]</a>: 我的意思是，是的，那很好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9751.485s">[David Blumberg]</a>: 我觉得这个非常好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/eytfxLwMk5s&t=9756.509s">[Claes Andreasen]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，这取决于你的解释。

 嗯，经过一番麻烦之后，他们投了一点赞成票。
 嗯，他们投票了，他们在一读时批准了起诉书。
 将会公布，15日他们将再次投票。
 我们非常兴奋。
 我们获得了七票中的五票赞成，比我们预期的多了一张。
 嗯，看起来这一切正在向前发展。
 我们有一份住房规划师职位草案，已发送给人力资源部进行审查。
 嗯，我们很快就会发布。
 嗯，15号之后，当我们认为市议会将完成投票时，他们将不得不对分配文件和小牛交换进行投票。
 我们将扮演高级策划者的角色，然后我们也会发布。
 所以我们也有一个，所以我们将有三个。
 全职住房注册会计师和高级规划师职位，我们目前有兼职住房注册会计师和开放规划师职位。
