[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll leave it at that for now.

16
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Amanda.

17
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:39,972
Okay.

18
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:42,692
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

19
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:55,199
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and really only primary item we have on our agenda tonight is a discussion of 142 Mr gab this is a great American beer hall.

20
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,941
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, let me start by reading the public notice that accompanied the project.

21
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:05,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Metro Community Development Board will conduct a meeting today.

22
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:21,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on zoom relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Brian Sarthur, 29 Cushing Road Milton mass to erect a structure on lot are 10142 mystic Avenue in Medford.

23
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:26,364
[SPEAKER_00]: The petitioner seeks to construct a new 22,025 square foot beer hall at the location.

24
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:41,013
[SPEAKER_00]: under section 11.7 of our zoning ordinance, the development is considered quote a major project, and is therefore subject to site plan review by this board.

25
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:49,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me first turn to the team.

26
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:52,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand Kyle Harnish is present.

27
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Zarathar is present.

28
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle, will you be presenting for the group?

29
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:56,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what I hear?

30
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will be this evening.

31
00:02:58,936 --> 00:02:59,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

32
00:02:59,376 --> 00:02:59,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.

33
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:00,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here tonight.

34
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time.

35
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to go ahead and start your presentation?

36
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:05,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

37
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Amanda, can I share my screen when?

38
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you should be good.

39
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:16,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so first and foremost, I'd like to thank the whole board for their time this evening.

40
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:25,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to acknowledge everybody's time and want to follow up from last time we've met.

41
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:39,165
[SPEAKER_11]: We did an initial review on this project a couple of weeks ago, and you guys gave us some very helpful comments and suggestions that we've heeded your advice and made a bunch of changes that I think have improved the project overall.

42
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:44,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I get into that, I just wanted to introduce myself.

43
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:45,224
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Kyle Harnish.

44
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a builder and a developer.

45
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:55,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I was brought on this team by Brian to assist in this capacity, essentially to help in the building and development of this site.

46
00:03:56,228 --> 00:04:03,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have experience in this field, and I hope that I can clearly communicate our vision and answer any and all questions that may come about.

47
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:08,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to acknowledge Brian's effort to getting this project to this point.

48
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:24,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Brian and his family obviously own and operate this parcel of land and Brian's been working on this project for a couple years and has done his best job and putting this team together with individuals such as myself who all come from different backgrounds to

49
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:33,304
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, help assist in seeing this project as come to fruition and achieve success, which I think we all want to do.

50
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:37,586
[SPEAKER_11]: But Brian has certainly been the visionary behind this project from day one.

51
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:42,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it takes a lot of energy and effort over the past couple years to get it to this point.

52
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:46,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that, you know, I'm happy to be a part of this team and

53
00:04:47,770 --> 00:05:07,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been engaged with this now for about a year and a half and where it started from where it is today, I think we've seen dramatic improvements and obviously with the help of the board and various letters we received from the city of Medford, various departments, suggestions that they made all just improved the project even more so.

54
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:13,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So without kind of further ado, I'd like to jump into the revised plan and presentation.

55
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:22,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, can you all see the screen?

56
00:05:23,059 --> 00:05:24,099
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, yes, thank you.

57
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:36,543
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so Great American Beer Hall, as you all know, I want to start off with the, what we call a locus map, the general location of this property, highlighted here in the dotted red lines, two acre parcel.

58
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:46,947
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right across from Hancock Street, right on Mystic Avenue, basically in between Atlas Liquors and Medford VFW, for anybody who might not know the exact location of this property.

59
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a satellite view of 142 Mystic Ave.

60
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,079
[SPEAKER_11]: I've outlined it in the red there.

61
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,880
[SPEAKER_11]: It's currently sharing with the parcel next door, which Brian's family also owns and operates.

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did the best we could at defining the actual parameters of this specific lot for which the beer hall will occupy.

63
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:12,905
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see from the overhead view, it's mainly auto body mechanic use and storage of school bus.

64
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,888
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the view from the rear, so this is coming from 93.

65
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:21,770
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see, again, the rectangle that is essentially our parameters of the lot.

66
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:29,254
[SPEAKER_11]: That building in the front, auto body, that whole space will be torn down and the rest of the lot will be clear.

67
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:33,936
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can kind of see from this image, the lot is fairly level.

68
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,338
[SPEAKER_11]: In the back there, you can see the school bus storage.

69
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:39,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So from the front, this is from Mystic Ave view.

70
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, very industrial, mainly car storage.

71
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:55,015
[SPEAKER_11]: So from Mystic Avenue itself, standing on Mystic Avenue, front side elevation, this is what you're staring at on a day-to-day basis.

72
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,535
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very much industrial.

73
00:06:56,555 --> 00:07:01,677
[SPEAKER_11]: You have that giant telephone pole in your way, not very exciting, not very inviting.

74
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:07,460
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another view just further up the street, looking back at the project or the property, excuse me.

75
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:13,804
[SPEAKER_11]: just, again, very industrial, nothing very inviting about this space at all.

76
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly not a place I'd like to gather at night.

77
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:23,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the whole genesis of this thing is, you know, how can we improve Mystic Avenue?

78
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, Brian's had this vision from the beginning of, you know, what Mystic Avenue could potentially be.

79
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:34,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's a scary thought for our team and our group of individuals who are invested in this to be

80
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,731
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of the first domino, I think, to fall.

81
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:47,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we poured a lot of heart and a lot of energy into seeing this project, you know, beautify Mystic Avenue and kind of be the catalyst for future development.

82
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:51,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, this is kind of where we see the biggest change.

83
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:57,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So, on the left side, obviously, you see the existing site, and on the right side, you see the proposed.

84
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:01,278
[SPEAKER_11]: obviously a dramatic change, very more inviting.

85
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,940
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to get married too much to the exact image.

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a concept image.

87
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,781
[SPEAKER_11]: We are in development.

88
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:12,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Our budgets are limited in this capacity.

89
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a group of individuals who've committed their own capital, who are very invested in this, and our budgets do have

90
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:22,589
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have limitations, so the renderings are not exactly what they might be.

91
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:28,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Those will get flushed out later in the design, build, and permitting phase of this project.

92
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:36,742
[SPEAKER_11]: But to give you an idea of the dramatic change that we see happening on this specific parcel, this is to basically show you that.

93
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:37,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So

94
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a more enlarged view of that front side elevation coming off Mystic Ave.

95
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:56,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously the cars are gone, the bus is gone, that old dilapidated building is gone, you know, and a much more inviting social space that we think can be the hub for Mystic Ave and hopefully, as we mentioned, spur future development on the street.

96
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,266
[SPEAKER_11]: The front side elevation for us has to be inviting.

97
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,087
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to have some green space.

98
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:07,369
[SPEAKER_11]: We heard you loud and clear in the last meeting, and we've done our best job to increase the landscape area of this lot.

99
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:19,414
[SPEAKER_11]: We do want the experience here to not feel as though you're on an industrial lot and in an industrial space, so we want to feel like people are escaping to this development, into this building.

100
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:24,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like it needs to be an experience for visitors and customers alike.

101
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:24,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And

102
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:31,354
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a buffer of landscape and some sort of inviting nature towards the building will accomplish that.

103
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:34,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this is the side view.

104
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:45,494
[SPEAKER_11]: This side view I know has drawn some concerns from members of the board and I totally hear you and I understand that because of the massing of the project, it looks so large.

105
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:51,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We have these windows all at the top part here, we have our roof deck here, which is all well and nice.

106
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:56,442
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a lot of surface area on the lower half where there's not a lot of glazing and

107
00:09:57,402 --> 00:10:03,263
[SPEAKER_11]: you know the reason for that is a lot of our concessions and stuff are on that wall so there's really no use for the windows being there.

108
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't want people peeking in behind the bars behind the concession stands and whatnot.

109
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:26,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have plans and ideas that we've shared with our architect already to perhaps grow some sort of green wall here planting wall some sort of signage to beautify that front entrance and space and make it more welcoming and also to direct traffic to our main entrance on the further back on the property on the

110
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:30,450
[SPEAKER_11]: backside of the building here, we will have installed a bike rack.

111
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,671
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'll be a more inviting space there.

112
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:40,654
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I do think that we have things in play that will beautify this building and not make it look so industrial and commercial.

113
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:47,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're playing around with those ideas right now with our architects, but I hear you loud and clear.

114
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it is our team

115
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:59,730
[SPEAKER_11]: commitment to make this project and this building as beautiful as possible because it will in turn benefit us and invite people in and be something that we can all be very proud of.

116
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is the side elevation.

117
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:10,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I wanted to just get into the site as general I remember the last meeting, somebody on the board mentioned grading and the overall pitch of the site.

118
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:20,657
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of difficult to see on the site plan but try to zoom in for you at the rear, almost facing 93, you have grade 12.

119
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:23,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that's elevation 12 at the rear.

120
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:31,064
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we look at the front, which is on Mystic Ave coming in, you know, you have a 10 coming off the curb and then you're up to an 11.

121
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're talking a one to two foot pitch over 400 feet.

122
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So a very level lot.

123
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly something that as a builder, I love to see.

124
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a tremendous amount of challenges in a level lot.

125
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I don't know why it did that.

126
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go back.

127
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:52,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Forgive me.

128
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, try to go back to that.

129
00:11:55,507 --> 00:12:00,149
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

130
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:04,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So, a couple things with the site plan that you'll see on here that you won't see on our landscape plan.

131
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:08,593
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see these dotted lines at the front.

132
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,834
[SPEAKER_11]: of the parking lot here.

133
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:14,355
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a proposed infiltration system, essentially stormwater management system.

134
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,536
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where our drainage will go.

135
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:25,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So the lot, the parking lot, you'll see is at 12, 12 and a half at the top, goes down to 11, goes down to 11, and then pitches all the way down to essentially

136
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:35,646
[SPEAKER_11]: that is to send all the water down to this infiltration system here, and then there's another infiltration system in the back by the loading dock, and that is to send the water down this way.

137
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:46,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are our stormwater management systems that have been looked at and are being worked out with our civil engineering team and the city of Medford Engineering Department.

138
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:53,317
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will get calcs on all that, but it's basically the surface area that is out there and how much water

139
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:00,302
[SPEAKER_11]: That hopefully answers questions on whether or not the lot is level.

140
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:01,002
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly is.

141
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:08,428
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also see here, these are the utilities coming off Mystic Ave outlined here that go into our buildings.

142
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:19,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of utilities, gas, water, sewer, drain, and underground electric, it is in our intention to get everything underground.

143
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,599
[SPEAKER_11]: There is an electric pole at the front of this property.

144
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:34,965
[SPEAKER_11]: right on Mystic Ave that is owned by the utility company and we will do everything in our power to hopefully get that pole removed and get a transformer somewhere put on the landscape buffer area.

145
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:47,271
[SPEAKER_11]: No guarantees there but it is something that I am looking into and hopefully can get either Eversource, National Grid, whoever manages and maintains that pole to work with us in that so that all the utilities are underground.

146
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:52,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it makes for a better development and you don't have to stare at the pole right in front of the building.

147
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that's the site overall.

148
00:13:55,415 --> 00:14:00,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we'll get into the, um, revised plan here.

149
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Get me back to me out of this.

150
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

151
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, sorry.

152
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:13,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stand there for a second.

153
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know why it's letting me scroll as it once was.

154
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:21,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me try to enlarge it for you.

155
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Forgive me if I'm taking extra time.

156
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:31,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so here is the revised landscape plan and I worked on this, basically,

157
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:47,646
[SPEAKER_11]: to answer most of the questions that were brought about in the last preliminary hearing and also upon receiving all the letters from the Medford Fire Department, the Public Works Department, the Engineering Department and the Traffic Department.

158
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:53,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So we worked on this pretty diligently and forgive us, we do have budget constraints.

159
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,453
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't some high level architectural rendering.

160
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:00,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're doing the best we can, but when it does come to actually

161
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:10,916
[SPEAKER_11]: permitting phase you will get much better and clearer images and renderings but I think it still communicates our message and hopefully highlight some of the areas of concern.

162
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:19,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, everything was designed here in the city ordinance 6.3, which was provided by the planning department office.

163
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia and Victor were kind enough to kind of send me some of that stuff and I kind of reviewed it to the best of my ability and included all those measures in here.

164
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:38,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So just as an overall idea of this lot size and how much we're covering, I just kind of wanted to give you an idea and we did so in this legend up here for the zoning requirements.

165
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,900
[SPEAKER_11]: This is commercial C2.

166
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:45,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically what is required of us is 35 feet of frontage.

167
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:52,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually have about 195 feet on Mystic Ave, 15 feet setback for the building.

168
00:15:53,431 --> 00:16:04,861
[SPEAKER_11]: From the front side and rear, we have about 140 setback to the front of the building here, 15 on this side facing Atlas Liquors, and certainly more than that on that side, and then 30 feet from the rear.

169
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:18,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So we well within our setbacks, the height on this structure can exceed 30 so we're going right to 30 maximum lot coverage is 50% we're going to be at about 27.5.

170
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:23,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way I calculated that is over here in the lower left hand part of the legend.

171
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:27,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Overall lot size we have is about 89,620.

172
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:36,518
[SPEAKER_11]: The landscape area, and I'm calling the landscape area just the green area I have highlighted on the plan, that alone is 9,000 square feet.

173
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:41,945
[SPEAKER_11]: The patio area shown at the front, which is the beer garden essentially, is about 4,400 square feet.

174
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:54,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way I understand the city ordinances, the open space clause is that open area that that's your garden should be included in that tally.

175
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:59,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you calculate the landscape plus the open area, I have 13,400 square feet, which is 15% of the overall lot coverage.

176
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:14,131
[SPEAKER_11]: The building area is 24,682, that is this structure here, not including the beer garden, and that calculates to about 27.5% of the overall lot coverage.

177
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:24,898
[SPEAKER_11]: in increasing our landscape from the previous design to this design, you know, we're more than half of what our building coverage is.

178
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:31,544
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that is a really nice balance for us into, you know, bring some more green to our area.

179
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:38,650
[SPEAKER_11]: So a couple things I want to go over that have varied from the last meeting were some of the changes that we made and

180
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

181
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:48,878
[SPEAKER_11]: First and foremost, one thing we heard loud and clear was the reduction of the overall width of our roadway.

182
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:52,381
[SPEAKER_11]: On the original site plan, it was spec'd at about 28 feet.

183
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:57,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And we designed that to be above what the fire department was requiring.

184
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:03,690
[SPEAKER_11]: The fire department got back to us and essentially asked for 24 feet for two lane traffic, excuse me.

185
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we shrunk it to 24 feet.

186
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,779
[SPEAKER_11]: which means less asphalt for us, a little more landscape buffer.

187
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:20,025
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think more importantly, and to the board's point, which was an excellent point from the last meeting was to increase the pedestrian access from Mystic Avenue.

188
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:30,511
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we've done now by shrinking this to 24 foot roadway, we're able to fit sidewalks on both sides, coming from the South and coming from the North on Mystic Ave.

189
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:35,175
[SPEAKER_11]: which I think will greatly improve pedestrian access to our site.

190
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:50,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this sidewalk you can see was added in here, the trajectory this pathway would take was across the parking lot here and through this crosswalk, and then you can see we've added a pedestrian crosswalk across the front of our building and into our main entrance.

191
00:18:50,911 --> 00:19:00,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, mystic have right here there's a 15 foot easement, essentially from the state of Massachusetts because it's a it's a Massachusetts roadway.

192
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So, the 15 feet, basically constitutes a five foot concrete sidewalk.

193
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:09,844
[SPEAKER_11]: plus a six inch curb, so five and a half feet.

194
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:13,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And that leaves us nine and a half feet of landscape buffer.

195
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,507
[SPEAKER_11]: That is gonna be on both sides of the parking lot.

196
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:28,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So landscape buffer of nine and a half feet here, here's your pedestrian sidewalk, there's your curbing, same condition on the opposite side, nine and a half foot landscape or five foot sidewalk and curbing in between.

197
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:33,173
[SPEAKER_11]: This landscape buffer was a big thing that came about in the last meeting.

198
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And as it's shown here now, it's just purely lawn,

199
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:41,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a slide that I'll show you next where we do intend to do some plantings here.

200
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:48,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I think small shrubs, and traditionally what I've done in the past is anything greater than 30 feet you plant a small tree.

201
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's something we can certainly look at doing here.

202
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:55,959
[SPEAKER_11]: My issue here is the overhead wires.

203
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:04,281
[SPEAKER_11]: On the southern part of Mystic Ave, there's that telephone pole that we talked about that I hope we can move, but no guarantee.

204
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,501
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a bit of a process.

205
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:18,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there to be expected is low shrubbery and low plants, which we're open to doing and certainly, you know, shielding a bit of our parking lots from Mystic Ave.

206
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:23,045
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to point out that we do have a challenge there in the telephone pole.

207
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,148
[SPEAKER_11]: So parking, parking I've highlighted on the whole development.

208
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:40,257
[SPEAKER_11]: The main parking lot here has 86 spots, 75 of which are regular, four are handicap and we've included now what we're calling seven EV or electric vehicle spots.

209
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Those seven spots are right here, one, two, three, four.

210
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:52,247
[SPEAKER_11]: 567.

211
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:52,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're committed, and we talked to Alicia about this, we're committed to running conduit to these areas.

212
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,450
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a specific charging station spec yet or anything like that.

213
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, budget constraints, but we are open to certainly running conduit to these areas and working with the City of Medford

214
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:14,221
[SPEAKER_11]: when it comes about, if there's opportunities for us to take advantage of some incentives or some, you know, cost breaks, we would be open to putting charging stations there.

215
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:18,103
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, I think the best we can do is provide conduit to those areas.

216
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,984
[SPEAKER_11]: On the front side here, you'll see we have an additional 16 spots.

217
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,826
[SPEAKER_11]: So 14 regular, 2 handicap.

218
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:31,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you calculate the 16 spots plus these 86, you get a total of 102.

219
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:36,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And the traffic department confirmed this in their review is 102 spots.

220
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So I worked with Alicia and Victor and Amanda in the calculation of what was required for parking on this site.

221
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:51,287
[SPEAKER_11]: And based on the calculation of the building, whether or not you include the beer garden, it remains up in the air.

222
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:54,789
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the sake of this measure, we included the beer garden.

223
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you include the 24,682 plus the 4,400 of the patio area,

224
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:17,622
[SPEAKER_11]: you get above 29,000 square feet and if you divide that by one spot per 350 square feet is the calculation we were given by Alicia's office and you come up with

225
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:35,941
[SPEAKER_11]: 83 spots so that would be the minimum for a development as such 83 spots and the maximum is double that number so 166 so we're offering 102 which we think is a generous little sweet spot and the reason we exceeded the 83

226
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:53,197
[SPEAKER_11]: was mainly because we had a community outreach reading a few months back and one thing we heard loud and clear from local neighbors, mainly on the side streets, was they were concerned that the traffic to this building would lead to people parking on the side streets and impacting their properties negatively.

227
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:59,143
[SPEAKER_11]: That is certainly not something we want to do and we assured the neighbors of this property that we would do

228
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:05,091
[SPEAKER_11]: the best we can to mitigate that and put as much parking as we saw fit on our property.

229
00:23:05,171 --> 00:23:07,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of how we landed at 102.

230
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:12,581
[SPEAKER_11]: We felt like it was a sweet spot, a little bit above what is required, but not so excessive.

231
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:17,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is mainly in response to our community outreach meeting.

232
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:18,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is the parking.

233
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:28,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Now around the parking you'll see we have a seven foot landscape buffer all along here, all along the parking in the edges.

234
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:32,737
[SPEAKER_11]: The tree plantings we've done here I did an accordance with the

235
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: with the zoning ordinance provided by Victor's office, the landscape plan 6.3, if you look at it, any parking lot that exceeds 20 parking spaces is required to have a tree per 10 spots.

236
00:23:50,466 --> 00:24:00,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you see we have 86 spots all at 90, you should have nine trees, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

237
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's 12 in that area we exceed our minimum there.

238
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:13,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And this doesn't really fall in it because it doesn't exceed 20 spots so therefore there's not a minimum but we still have two trees there regardless.

239
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:16,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the tree planting that we're proposing is sufficient.

240
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:19,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the reason behind the trees.

241
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,276
[SPEAKER_11]: The lighting again I met with Alicia and Victor and Amanda on this and

242
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:27,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I did the best I could.

243
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:36,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I put lighting in here, parking lot lighting, and it's in accordance with the city spec performance standards and zoning order in section 6.44.

244
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:46,246
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no very specific spec for the lighting just yet, and I'm open to working with the city and finding one and proposing some lights.

245
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:48,267
[SPEAKER_11]: We understand there'll be LED,

246
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:53,913
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, anything that's efficient is in our best interest as well.

247
00:24:54,013 --> 00:25:06,488
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we were going to work with the design build team and our architect to provide some sort of lighting options and then go before Alicia and show her what our thoughts are on the parking lot lighting.

248
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Around the beer garden here, you can see we have some string lights.

249
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:19,183
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing we put on here, which we heard from the board last time, permeable pavers will be used on this beer garden.

250
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So 4,400 square feet of permeable pavers here.

251
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:33,047
[SPEAKER_11]: We do intend to put some form of barrier around our patio, whether that's a reclaimed wooden fence out of pallets

252
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:45,672
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe perhaps old wine barrels, whiskey barrels with white rope, there's going to be some delineation there between the area in which you can drink alcohol and then obviously the parking lots and the pedestrian sidewalk.

253
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't have a full commitment on what that barrier will be.

254
00:25:49,754 --> 00:26:02,040
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be low, it'll probably be four feet or so, and there'll be some plantings and shrubs in between, perhaps some planter boxes so people can still see in, but we do not want people gaining access from the parking lot that way.

255
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,907
[SPEAKER_11]: On the other side of the beer garden there, there's a 15-foot landscape buffer that kind of traverses the whole back here.

256
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:19,274
[SPEAKER_11]: We basically split half the building and increased that green area all the way up above 180, 200 feet of our structure.

257
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:30,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason for that was, again, in hearing the board of increased green space, increased lawn space, you know, we see potential here of perhaps dog area or something of that nature.

258
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:44,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also added hedges alongside the Atlas Liquor property, which is along here, it's about 80 feet of hedges, I think that'll shield that parking lot from Atlas Liquors.

259
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:48,735
[SPEAKER_11]: A bike rack was mentioned at the last meeting.

260
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:54,339
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a 15 foot metal bike rack included at the front side of the building over here.

261
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:59,142
[SPEAKER_11]: We put it further back on the property just to hopefully deter any theft or anything like that.

262
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:05,807
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have two loading bays at the back of the property that was brought about by one of the departments.

263
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,690
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we've clearly identified our entrances.

264
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,594
[SPEAKER_11]: We've opened up our landscape buffer area to show the flow of traffic going to the parking lots.

265
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:19,100
[SPEAKER_11]: and how those concrete sidewalks are going to work.

266
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:36,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think overall, that is essentially the changes that were made on our behalf, and hopefully answering a lot of the questions and concerns from the board in the last meeting, and certainly all the letters we received from the various departments.

267
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:42,833
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I wanna bring about in attention to from one of the departments was the traffic department.

268
00:27:43,335 --> 00:27:55,217
[SPEAKER_11]: We understand that the traffic study that was provided is lacking in some areas, and the traffic department director suggested some mitigation efforts to help us get where we need to be.

269
00:27:55,417 --> 00:28:04,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think our team is committed to doing our best effort in working with the town, I mean, the city to achieve those mitigation efforts.

270
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:09,560
[SPEAKER_11]: He provided essentially two pathways, not sure if everybody read the report,

271
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:18,747
[SPEAKER_11]: the first of which mitigation efforts are mainly using MassDOT because that road, Mystic Ave is a MassDOT road.

272
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:26,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would have to engage with them and offer some ideas in mitigating the traffic flow to our site.

273
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:33,079
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just know from experience there, it's a bit of a process working with MassDOT.

274
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,982
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't wanna guarantee anything there, but I do certainly,

275
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:47,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I will make a concerted effort and I think the team is supportive of this to engage with MassDOT and share with them our thoughts and how to improve the flow for Mystic Ave.

276
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:54,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the traffic department suggestions are certainly ways to improve the area.

277
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:58,717
[SPEAKER_11]: My concern is just MassDOT being responsive in a timely manner.

278
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,224
[SPEAKER_11]: and working with us, but it certainly will be an effort that we will put forth.

279
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:18,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondarily, the traffic director was kind enough to offer other mitigating efforts, which I see as totally doable on our behalf, mainly some barriers, some painting.

280
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:26,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he had planned for some crosswalk signage, which we are open to, we are certainly willing to do.

281
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:33,423
[SPEAKER_11]: our best interest to draw good traffic and good flow to this area.

282
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:40,264
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to cause any problems or issues on Mystic Ave, and we are committed to doing whatever it takes.

283
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:45,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I just tread with caution when it comes to the MassDOT.

284
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:48,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not want to over-promise and under-deliver in that regard.

285
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:56,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly appreciate the traffic director's suggestion for some other mitigating efforts, which we are committed to doing.

286
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:15,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, I don't see anything that came about from the various boards that, excuse me, from the various departments that we are not able to answer or flush out either in this meeting or some of the stormwater questions that came about from the engineering office.

287
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are all being worked on by our civil engineering team.

288
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:23,805
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously when we go for permitting, stormwater permits are required.

289
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:28,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So we won't be able to do anything without those permits in place, irregardless.

290
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:32,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we've sufficiently answered most of those questions.

291
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:40,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And to bring me just back to my slides here to give some detail on the landscape buffer, this is just something I brought from another development.

292
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:48,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So to give you an idea of what that Mystic Ave entrance, I know the board was curious on what our efforts are gonna be on that landscape buffer.

293
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:50,197
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is kind of just a general,

294
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,040
[SPEAKER_11]: idea, I guess, of what it might look like.

295
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:57,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I've highlighted here, a four foot max shrub height.

296
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:08,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the bottom slide there it's, it shows you the nine and a half foot minimum buffer, and then various plantings and shrubs located and then you know for every

297
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:12,521
[SPEAKER_11]: 10, 12, 30 feet, so we can try to plant a mature tree.

298
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:20,529
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I think with the current telephone pole that exists on one side, that's going to be very difficult to do.

299
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:27,516
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to give the board some idea of what our vision is for that landscape buffer on Mystic Ave.

300
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to the next slide here.

301
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so again, this is your front view.

302
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:41,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that came about, what I want to talk about next is the overall design and aesthetic of this building.

303
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I think, I hope the board understands this, like I've mentioned several times before, there are budget constraints in this project.

304
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:55,113
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already done a lot and paid a lot of money to get to this point.

305
00:31:55,673 --> 00:32:03,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, without knowing that we're actually going to build this thing it's hard to commit more capital to have the full architectural plan done.

306
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:18,042
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at this point, this is, you know, the best that I think that we can provide to the board to give you an idea of what we're trying to build and I have some slides to show you guys some what I think are successful metal prefab buildings and how they've been.

307
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:25,225
[SPEAKER_11]: built in some of the other areas of the country that I think are good examples of what we're trying to do.

308
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:29,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Something to understand, a key factor to our building is the prefab metal.

309
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:31,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason for that is twofold.

310
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,489
[SPEAKER_11]: One, cost, keep our costs down.

311
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, speed.

312
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,192
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to open this thing as soon as possible and we are committed to doing so.

313
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:45,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and the big reason, uh, for us to doing that is obviously construction costs are constantly fluctuating.

314
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:54,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, since the pandemic I I'm in this field and in this industry has been very difficult to gauge pricing and, uh, almost everything you put out to bid comes back over budget.

315
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:55,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're constantly, um,

316
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,494
[SPEAKER_11]: constantly trying to value engineer and also source materials from different areas.

317
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:06,380
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, something that might be visual to you today on this board might not be available to us.

318
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just trying to give you a concept image of what we're trying to achieve.

319
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:13,788
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the other other buildings that I show you will be helpful in

320
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,309
[SPEAKER_11]: and gaining some perspective of where we're coming from.

321
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:21,290
[SPEAKER_11]: But metal prefab building, it'll be a low pitched gable roof just like this.

322
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,571
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have a second floor roof deck.

323
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:29,493
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have as much glazing as we can get on the first floor to see into the property.

324
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:31,214
[SPEAKER_11]: You will have an outdoor patio.

325
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:32,354
[SPEAKER_11]: This is shown as concrete.

326
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:37,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, forgive us on that it is permeable pavers, but this is just purely a concept.

327
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:44,030
[SPEAKER_11]: We will try to carry the front facade with as much glazing as possible to again invite people in.

328
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:59,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So to give you an idea of the building itself, metal prefab building, likely metal cladding on the outside.

329
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:06,603
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't decided on a color or anything yet, but I wanted to give you guys some real world examples of metal prefab buildings that I think are pretty successful.

330
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:09,163
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's one, Pacific Northwest.

331
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:11,084
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a wine market and hall.

332
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:15,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, if you just follow the architecture of this thing, it's a low pitched roof, gable roof.

333
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:18,668
[SPEAKER_11]: metal prefab building, a lot of glazing on the front.

334
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,230
[SPEAKER_11]: It's obviously on a main road.

335
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:23,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll show you another view of this same building.

336
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does it keep going back to that?

337
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:26,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

338
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,484
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the building again.

339
00:34:32,412 --> 00:34:33,393
[SPEAKER_11]: low pitched roof.

340
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,794
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see they have solar on top, which we intend to do.

341
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:37,455
[SPEAKER_11]: HVAC mechanicals are on top.

342
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,877
[SPEAKER_11]: They obviously have some outside dining.

343
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:41,837
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on a main road.

344
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:46,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I know if you look at more recent images of this property, they have this landscape buffer here.

345
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,100
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very narrow.

346
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Ours is bigger, but these have grown into some vines.

347
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:58,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they've shielded some of that metal, corrugated metal paneling with some landscape screens, which I think is a real nice detail.

348
00:34:58,427 --> 00:34:59,627
[SPEAKER_11]: They have some plantings in the front.

349
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:04,139
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this is just kind of shows you a real world example.

350
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you one more.

351
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,279
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Surly Brewing.

352
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a metal prefab building.

353
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, look at the roof pitch, very similar to ours.

354
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: This has some second floor mezzanine, obviously some indoor outdoor feel and a fire pit in the front.

355
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:26,783
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is essentially trying to give, to give you some idea of, you know, our job

356
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:30,284
[SPEAKER_11]: is to create an experience for our customers.

357
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:35,307
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that indoor outdoor feel is something that I think is going to be instrumental in our success.

358
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So any areas we can do that we're going to.

359
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:43,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know mainly our strong point I think is on the Mystic Ave elevation and that front beer garden.

360
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:46,273
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to do the best we can to keep it open, keep it airy.

361
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:48,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously being in New England we have challenges with weather so

362
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:51,839
[SPEAKER_11]: know, a good part of the year, we won't be open out there.

363
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,969
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is in our best interest to introduce as much glass as possible and create that flow indoor and outdoor.

364
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are three real world examples of metal prefab buildings.

365
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:08,139
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this one in particular, I don't particularly like the color of it.

366
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a little too dark, but the lighting of this space, I really do like.

367
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:21,246
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think, you know, that should help give some ideas to the board of what we're trying to achieve design-wise and aesthetically.

368
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:33,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the board has seen this before, but for anybody who hasn't, this is just to kind of give you an indication of what the inside is gonna be, large gathering spaces down the center of the beer hall, concessions on the outside,

369
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:55,083
[SPEAKER_11]: beer garden at the front, and then additional taps on the other side of the building and then bathrooms at the rear, and then we're gonna have some form of second floor mezzanine, again great for private events and maybe some home, some offices, ADA accessible bathrooms, we have an elevator, and then a roof deck off the front.

370
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:07,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to give you some idea, again, concept images, please forgive us, limited budget, but this tries to give you some idea of what the inside might look like.

371
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:12,340
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, don't get married to the flooring or the color scheme or anything like that.

372
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:23,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just to show you that people are congregated in a social setting in the middle of this building with a lot of glass, trying to feel escaped, I think, from the city and the hustle and bustle of Mystic Ave.

373
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:28,132
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is to create an environment inviting inside as well as outside.

374
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll show you another view.

375
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:35,129
[SPEAKER_11]: This just shows you some of the beer vending stations down below.

376
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:40,719
[SPEAKER_11]: This is up looking from the mezzanine level, some form of television for sporting events, things of that nature.

377
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:44,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then one last view just shows you some seating.

378
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,502
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not the set of chairs we particularly have or the tables.

379
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:52,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just to kind of give you this communal aspect of, you know, um, bringing people together.

380
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of what our motto is best brought together.

381
00:37:55,689 --> 00:38:03,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, we feel that this beer hall can certainly achieve that and, and, um, we're doing the best we can to, to make an inviting space.

382
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,871
[SPEAKER_11]: that people want to gather both inside and out.

383
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:15,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So to wrap this up, I kind of wanted to give you a gap timeline on where we're at and kind of how this project has come to date.

384
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,336
[SPEAKER_11]: We've applied for our liquor license, so we're still awaiting that.

385
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:25,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Site planning and permitting, we hope to get through as soon as possible.

386
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:26,658
[SPEAKER_11]: There are time constraints

387
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:33,902
[SPEAKER_11]: not only on our capital, we are being funded by Capital One through an SBA loan.

388
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:39,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have capital requirements and commitments that have certain deadlines to them.

389
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:42,947
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we are running low on that timeline.

390
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:46,289
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Brian has clearly communicated it from the beginning.

391
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,032
[SPEAKER_11]: His family who owns and manages the property, they have tenants and need to give them forewarning.

392
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's leases and things of that nature that are coming up

393
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:55,615
[SPEAKER_11]: to expire.

394
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:59,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is certainly critical path for us.

395
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:04,819
[SPEAKER_11]: We are at that juncture right now and need to move things along as best as possible.

396
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Our team is committed to doing it.

397
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:19,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We just hope the board sees it the same way in assisting us to get, we understand there's multiple steps still to be had, but this is one critical and important step that can get us on the right path.

398
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:28,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I mentioned time, speed, the metal prefab buildings, we can move fast and it is in our intention completely to move fast.

399
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:43,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can get swift approvals and permitting going as soon as possible, we will intend to build in the spring in May of 2023, and hopefully have one year of building and be open by spring 2024.

400
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:47,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that's what our team is committed to.

401
00:39:48,052 --> 00:40:07,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, I hope with, um, the, the help of this board that, um, you know, you guys will see it the same way as we do and, and doing everything we can to improve Mystic Ave and make it, um, you know, a place for people to want to be and hopefully, uh, spur future development on the street.

402
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm open to any questions from anybody.

403
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I hope I didn't take too much of your time.

404
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:18,023
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we appreciate the presentation Mr harness appreciate that very much.

405
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the additional details and materials you provided to us.

406
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:33,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go just following kind of our regular agenda, invite any city staff who might be here who would like to speak or address the project before we go further.

407
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:39,882
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.

408
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:45,266
[SPEAKER_12]: No one from that I know of unless Victor Alicia have something they want to add at this time.

409
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:50,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have to just thank you.

410
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:54,012
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's um, it would be good to hear from the board.

411
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:58,915
[SPEAKER_13]: We have been working with the applicant to try and make sure that they could respond to everything.

412
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:03,163
[SPEAKER_13]: that the city is looking for in a presentation like this.

413
00:41:03,683 --> 00:41:15,427
[SPEAKER_13]: We're excited to be working with a smaller company and local residents and not in a large international firm that's coming in and putting this in Medford, but rather

414
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:44,387
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody who's from the community trying to develop something for the community and I just want to sort of acknowledge that because I know they keep saying like on a shoestring you know tight but that is their work we're working with community members here to develop something for the community um which does in fact have a lower level of initial investment than when some of the larger projects that have come before you recently um so and we thank you for them um to them for

415
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,128
[SPEAKER_13]: having extra meetings with us as well.

416
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, excellent.

417
00:41:50,649 --> 00:42:04,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go to open this up to the public, we usually pose a few questions or open it to the board for at least initial questions, maybe not to roll up our sleeves entirely, but for some initial questions.

418
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to take the lead in that, if you don't mind, and that is to throw to

419
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:14,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle or Brian's here.

420
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:15,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

421
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:24,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hesitant to do this because I don't want to just steal everyone's thunder, or potentially everyone's thunder.

422
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:45,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't want to make it appear that we're not going to have a full discussion on this matter but I guess my question for you is, we're accustomed to seeing plans site plans presented to us that have been through that process that you mentioned will be forthcoming so you will sit down with your architect you will come up with some more detailed plans, etc.

423
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:55,646
[SPEAKER_00]: If the board is positively inclined toward the project, but hasn't seen everything it needs to see for a final approval.

424
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:59,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where are you on that.

425
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you respond to that thought that I have.

426
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:14,038
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost of construction has really gone up since COVID and all that.

427
00:43:14,078 --> 00:43:22,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I had a budget back in 2019 when I started this and it is, I can't believe the numbers that we're looking at.

428
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:30,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And so working it back from what we qualify for for the SBA loan through Capital One is how we got to where we are at now.

429
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we just don't have the funds to keep going

430
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:48,671
[SPEAKER_10]: given where we're at now in our timeline, this is literally the best foot forward that we could possibly do.

431
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Brian.

432
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:53,754
[SPEAKER_00]: But when will that occur?

433
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:54,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming we pass

434
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:16,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so we've pledged capital already to start that process.

435
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:19,399
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already engaged the Haines group, which is our builder.

436
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:20,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a design build capacity.

437
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,180
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll get every note from these meetings, all the letters that have been provided by the city.

438
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So we know and we'll design exactly to what is required.

439
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:39,863
[SPEAKER_11]: So traditionally in previous developments that I've worked on to answer your question, if it doesn't have a full site plan, like you're asking for, there's usually an order of conditions handed down.

440
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:49,578
[SPEAKER_11]: by you guys, you know, and then we make sure that when you will see the final plan and make sure it, you know, answers all your questions and has everything that you need on it.

441
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, other

442
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,482
[SPEAKER_05]: David, I have a question.

443
00:44:57,802 --> 00:44:58,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackie, please.

444
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:05,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of my first questions was definitely this site plan in order to move forward.

445
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how this sits with the with the city staff itself.

446
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:16,907
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have actually had to have previous proponents come back with a full site plan just so that we can

447
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:21,232
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that we're seeing everything that we have to scale.

448
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:26,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the issues that I'm having is that I'm not able to see this to scale.

449
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:36,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that I'm not able to give comments on it, but I'm not sure how that would look without previous proponents and us having them go back and get site plans.

450
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:40,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more of a question for the city.

451
00:45:40,156 --> 00:45:43,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we able to move forward without that site plan being to scale?

452
00:45:45,698 --> 00:45:50,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that would be an issue the way we have had previous proponents go back?

453
00:45:53,401 --> 00:46:05,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can try to respond to that Jackie and that I think we can try to be creative here if the board wants to be creative and that's I think maybe you and I are thinking along the same lines.

454
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:12,469
[SPEAKER_13]: And I might I might add it this way that sometimes you'll say to proponents, well, what about this?

455
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:13,089
[SPEAKER_13]: And what about that?

456
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,951
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll immediately say, oh, oh, we'll make some edits and come back to you.

457
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:18,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

458
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:25,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very rare that you actually have had a proponent say, well, if you put that in the conditions, we'll need it.

459
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,174
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we actually have had some of those, right?

460
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:33,697
[SPEAKER_13]: So this doesn't show, I don't know, what it is that you're looking for, right?

461
00:46:34,037 --> 00:46:36,298
[SPEAKER_13]: This doesn't show a narrow dry vial.

462
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:46,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if the conditions say that the dry vial has to be 28 feet and no wider, then that's how it gets constructed.

463
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:51,467
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's what the condition says, whether or not you saw that on the plan, right?

464
00:46:51,487 --> 00:47:05,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess sort of part of the difficulty is that site plan review can be denied if they don't give you what you, if we don't have everything we need to make a decision, but it can't be denied sort of arbitrarily, right?

465
00:47:06,477 --> 00:47:13,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it's, and usually we have an applicant who jumps at the, let me make edits and come back to you.

466
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:20,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's some risk to the applicant to say like, well, yes, we can do that.

467
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:21,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we can do that.

468
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:31,132
[SPEAKER_13]: And some applicants are like, let's have every detail drawn out by an engineer before it's in something.

469
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:35,495
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's also different because this is design build.

470
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:41,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And in design build, your builder actually designs it and can make changes as you go.

471
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:50,121
[SPEAKER_13]: as opposed to this is full architectural drawings 100% and you put it out to bid and then they have to bid what's on the drawings.

472
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:53,542
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a different process as well.

473
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,203
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know, I hope that's a little helpful.

474
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to add to that on the design build process.

475
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why whatever the board comes up with conditions for tonight is very important to that process because you have to give performance

476
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:15,577
[SPEAKER_06]: expectations to your design build team.

477
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:19,921
[SPEAKER_06]: And so anyway, I'm sorry if I cut someone off.

478
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I just do you mind if I continue?

479
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:29,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect, Christy, because I just didn't understand how we were going to move forward with

480
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:32,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're explaining it.

481
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:35,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I know and I feel I'm on the same page with you and David.

482
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:45,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, first of all, I'd like to take a step back and say like, as as a resident, I'm very excited that this project is coming before the city.

483
00:48:46,896 --> 00:48:48,556
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would love to see it here.

484
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:53,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm even more excited that it's by a community member.

485
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So that gives a little more

486
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:59,276
[SPEAKER_06]: know, interest in doing good to the city.

487
00:48:59,296 --> 00:49:18,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I am torn though about the presentation and I'm feeling really uncomfortable and looking for guidance and how this board can actually move towards an approval tonight because everything is sorry, it's too much money and therefore we haven't spent the time to at least give you

488
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: the renderings or the plans that we're used to seeing.

489
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:29,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that I'm in real estate development and construction, but there is a way to go about that.

490
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:45,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think we just need to be very clear about what the expectations are and the conditions are and not set a precedent

491
00:49:46,878 --> 00:49:56,324
[SPEAKER_06]: that is going to backfire on this board in the future for deviating from expectations that we set in prior.

492
00:49:56,344 --> 00:50:00,887
[SPEAKER_16]: I can just jump onto what Christie's saying also.

493
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:04,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that I'm feeling uncomfortable as well.

494
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:09,353
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think one of the reasons for that is that the lack of

495
00:50:11,536 --> 00:50:28,021
[SPEAKER_16]: information that we see in the presentation, and I totally understand why, is sort of putting the burden of this information on us rather than the proponent.

496
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:30,782
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's dangerous.

497
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:33,403
[SPEAKER_16]: You see what I'm saying?

498
00:50:35,504 --> 00:50:39,345
[SPEAKER_16]: All of a sudden now, we're going to have to come up with a list of things

499
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:49,929
[SPEAKER_16]: that I don't, I personally don't even know where to start, you know, like everything seems okay.

500
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:55,132
[SPEAKER_16]: There's, I think you have a lot of work to do specifically on the site plan.

501
00:50:55,172 --> 00:50:56,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm less than concerned about the building.

502
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:57,814
[SPEAKER_16]: That's going to be fine.

503
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:05,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and, and, and, but the site plan needs, needs a lot of work.

504
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, and I just feel like what you really need is a, uh,

505
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:19,371
[SPEAKER_16]: a landscape architect and a traffic engineer, and you really need to get down and hammer that plan because it's not there yet.

506
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:23,613
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

507
00:51:24,433 --> 00:51:30,016
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how we could approve, for me, that statement.

508
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:35,158
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we say, yeah, we sort of like it, but you have a lot of work to do?

509
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,839
[SPEAKER_16]: How is that a condition of approval?

510
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

511
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:46,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Emily's hand up, so I wanted to turn the mic over to Emily.

512
00:51:46,893 --> 00:51:48,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

513
00:51:49,473 --> 00:52:02,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how we would do this, but every element of Mr. Harnish's presentation where he mentioned something like, oh, this is what we're showing you, but then it would be this.

514
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:04,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have to condition every single one of those.

515
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:07,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot.

516
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,281
[SPEAKER_07]: and I respect your comment about budget.

517
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:15,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that this is not a giant corporation doing this.

518
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:32,728
[SPEAKER_07]: These are, you know, community members, but I am, not only am I in control with the lack of detail, but I also really don't appreciate the pressure being applied to the board in regards to schedule, you know,

519
00:52:33,553 --> 00:52:39,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a project manager, scope, schedule, budget are the three things that you can control within your best control.

520
00:52:40,277 --> 00:53:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're really coming down to the wire, then I'm not gonna say it's not our role to be the single thing that ensures the financial viability of your project.

521
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:04,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but the pressure that's being implied is.

522
00:53:06,342 --> 00:53:12,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Is, um, it's it's uncomfortable, and it's it's a little, you know, inappropriate, given what we're being presented right now.

523
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:16,850
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record.

524
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:21,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just wanted to mention that George Fisher joined us very early in the presentation.

525
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:22,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So George is here as well.

526
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:25,717
[SPEAKER_00]: George or Deanna.

527
00:53:25,737 --> 00:53:31,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any comments before we go to see if their members of public would like to comment on the project?

528
00:53:33,098 --> 00:53:35,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with what everybody said.

529
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:43,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to understand how we move forward based on what we have.

530
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:46,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I similarly agree with what was said.

531
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:58,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think I'm also trying to think of ways that we could move forward approving this project with so many conditions and without seeing a full site plan.

532
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:03,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you we've heard from I think everyone on the board I appreciate the input there.

533
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:23,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's, let's table our thoughts for the moment, and let's open this up and Amanda if you can help orchestrate that for us in terms of folks in public members of the public would like to speak on the project for against to have questions comments to share with the board.

534
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:46,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so if anyone from the public is interested in providing public comment, if you could raise your hand using the hand feature, kind of at the bottom of the Zoom screen, or if you want to put a note in the chat, I'll call on you, and you would just need to provide your full name and address for the record.

535
00:54:57,889 --> 00:54:59,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not seeing any hands as of yet.

536
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:06,576
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know earlier in the conversation, Brenda Breed had asked about public comment.

537
00:55:06,716 --> 00:55:07,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Brenda, are you still with us?

538
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

539
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:10,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to find the raised hand thing.

540
00:55:10,899 --> 00:55:11,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no worries.

541
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,041
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got you now.

542
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:15,884
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could just state your name and address for the record.

543
00:55:16,644 --> 00:55:16,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

544
00:55:20,324 --> 00:55:21,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, hi.

545
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my name is Brenda Breed.

546
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:33,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and my husband Glen McKay is with me, and we live at 19 Crescent Street, which is very close to the

547
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,831
[SPEAKER_04]: the proposed site.

548
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:39,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to both of you.

549
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:41,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.

550
00:55:41,073 --> 00:55:45,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for stepping forward to share some comments with us.

551
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:46,497
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.

552
00:55:46,518 --> 00:55:48,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.

553
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:55,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess our two biggest concerns are one of them is sound, which I don't know if that's something that this board

554
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:02,403
[SPEAKER_04]: deals with or not, but I noticed in some of the information that says that you're planning to have live music.

555
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know if that live music was going to be outside and if it's going to be amplified.

556
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:11,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And also was wondering how, what your hours are going to be, how late you're going to be open.

557
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:18,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our other question would, other concerns were about traffic.

558
00:56:20,732 --> 00:56:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Partly because even it's,

559
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:33,503
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're thinking about is it's not just this particular site, but there's also going to be a marijuana dispensary just down the road.

560
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:37,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe actually one on both sides from what I understand.

561
00:56:38,086 --> 00:56:41,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that are all going to be coming online at the same time.

562
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:47,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering how there'll be multiple things impacting the traffic at the same time.

563
00:56:47,592 --> 00:56:51,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like over between the project,

564
00:56:52,263 --> 00:56:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: that there'll be a substantial increase in traffic right where we are.

565
00:56:56,946 --> 00:57:01,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are tricky intersections.

566
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:09,974
[SPEAKER_10]: For the traffic, I think the good part about our project is that the quietest times in Mystic Ave right now is our busiest times.

567
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:13,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And we wanted to have the most

568
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:22,565
[SPEAKER_10]: want to provide.

569
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:32,568
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as live music, we're gonna have that indoors, not amplified outdoors, outdoors during the day, we might have like a one man, one man band there or something like that.

570
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:34,389
[SPEAKER_10]: But no cognizant of the noise.

571
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:41,851
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, the outdoor area finishes up a lot earlier into into the night and then the indoor area.

572
00:57:43,473 --> 00:57:54,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian can I just just to try to help clarify your projects, your company operations would be subject to the noise ordinances of the city.

573
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:56,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.

574
00:57:56,672 --> 00:58:00,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it also just maybe you can again to inform the public and inform the board.

575
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the licensing commission?

576
00:58:02,953 --> 00:58:07,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that you have restrictions in terms of the hours that you can be open, that sort of thing.

577
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:09,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you give us just a course?

578
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:09,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

579
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,064
[SPEAKER_10]: So like, the liquor license are pretty, pretty standard.

580
00:58:13,104 --> 00:58:21,512
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now on the weekends, we're, you know, 12 to 1am with last call being at, you know, 12 o'clock.

581
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:34,273
[SPEAKER_10]: right now, just Monday through Wednesday, we're private party only.

582
00:58:35,374 --> 00:58:41,636
[SPEAKER_10]: But we are going to be, we're going to be thinking about being open Mondays, you know, for sporting events and such and such like that.

583
00:58:46,158 --> 00:58:48,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also had questions about the traffic, right?

584
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like?

585
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:54,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't have, well, I don't have specific questions.

586
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be sure that the other

587
00:58:58,674 --> 00:59:03,378
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses that are also going to be coming online in that area, which are going to be attracting a lot of traffic.

588
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:09,683
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's, I don't know if there's some planning that can be done, you know, taking all of those into account.

589
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:12,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that works.

590
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:14,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

591
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:18,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I really can't talk about the other question for the city.

592
00:59:18,711 --> 00:59:21,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but cause it's not just, you know what I'm saying?

593
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:25,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just this it's the, you know, it's the several things happening at once.

594
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:40,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on behalf of the board I suppose I should tell you that we have seen one of the cannabis operators go through a site plan review with us and there was a discussion there.

595
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:48,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the traffic department in terms of laying out its comments here and its recommendations for mitigation.

596
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:54,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite confident that Mr. Blake is cognizant of the other development of mystic but.

597
00:59:55,936 --> 00:59:58,577
[SPEAKER_00]: at the risk of overstepping my bounds and answering for him.

598
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:04,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know that the city at some level is certainly cognizant of the development happening.

599
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:06,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

600
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's a lot in one space, which, you know, I know the city needs and we need the, you know, the tax revenue from these businesses.

601
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:17,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, I know it's a good thing for the city that this is happening.

602
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to unduly, you know, impact our neighborhood.

603
01:00:27,096 --> 01:00:30,777
[SPEAKER_10]: is so much better than the current use, than the tow yard and the bus yard.

604
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:36,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And like- Yeah, it's certainly visually a lot, a big improvement, yeah.

605
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I just had a couple of particular questions.

606
01:00:40,861 --> 01:00:47,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's the picture on the left, you know, that where that telephone pole is, there's actually a bus stop right there.

607
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:53,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think there's a bus stop sign on that pole and there's a crosswalk.

608
01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering,

609
01:00:55,232 --> 01:01:03,215
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're figuring a bus stop into your plans and also, are you gonna be moving the crosswalk or there's gonna be multiple crosswalks?

610
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:08,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't really tell on your plan where the crosswalk's gonna be.

611
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:18,261
[SPEAKER_10]: We're asking the city what they want, but we're up for adding in the crosswalk or even putting in a light, a blinking light there and adding another one in.

612
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:41,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah we can manage our crosswalks on our own site but anything on Mystic Ave is managed by MassDOT so that's both MassDOT approvals which uh you know we I mentioned in our presentation that we're willing to engage them and do the best efforts we can and I certainly think um any comments that you can you know follow up and make with your traffic director and make his department aware that you have

613
01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:42,406
[SPEAKER_11]: concerns.

614
01:01:42,806 --> 01:01:44,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps his push can help MassDOT.

615
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:49,214
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they got a laundry list of capital improvement projects across the state.

616
01:01:49,374 --> 01:01:54,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's just a matter of us getting our attention to this specific matter.

617
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:59,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that comes a lot with some follow up from the city, you know.

618
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:21,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, because already now that's a really treacherous place to, well, all of Mystic Ave is treacherous to cross, but it's a really treacherous place because there are people turning onto Hancock Street or coming out of Atlas Liquors, and it would just be nice if that could be, I don't know, managed better.

619
01:02:23,756 --> 01:02:25,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can jump in on that point.

620
01:02:25,277 --> 01:02:27,238
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Victor Schrader.

621
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:32,560
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crosswalk in this area, but it's mid block.

622
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in an odd location.

623
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:36,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and people always park right in front of it.

624
01:02:36,863 --> 01:02:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're standing at the crosswalk, the cars that are coming from Boston can't see you because there's always a minivan or a truck or something parked right in front of you.

625
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:54,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the idea would be to relocate that closer to the intersection of Hancock, which would make sense for the neighborhood.

626
01:02:54,665 --> 01:03:03,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be great for traffic patterns, but also for the project to more direct access to the to the project from a street that people may be coming from.

627
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:11,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think for those, that was the problem.

628
01:03:11,656 --> 01:03:13,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were Yeah, those were our main concerns.

629
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:18,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, we appreciate you raising this tonight.

630
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:19,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

631
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:23,505
[SPEAKER_06]: David, this is Christy.

632
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask why the department heads are here?

633
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:33,253
[SPEAKER_06]: They typically attend one of these meetings, like where is Todd Blake?

634
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:37,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I did speak in just to help answer your question.

635
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:44,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked the question of Amanda earlier, and she said that Todd has another city commitment tonight and would be unlikely to attend.

636
01:03:47,868 --> 01:04:00,937
[SPEAKER_06]: just very helpful when he's here because he concurs, you know, with certain statements that are made or will try to help explain things or especially his his letter.

637
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:03,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

638
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Amanda, do we have other members of the public who'd like to participate tonight?

639
01:04:11,399 --> 01:04:13,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not seeing any more hands.

640
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:18,643
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just going to make another I did notice another person or two coming in while we were talking.

641
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:23,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we're during our comment, a public comment period, oh, I see a hand raised.

642
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:29,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Caleb Bachman, would you like to speak if you could just give your name and address for the record?

643
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,522
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Kayla Dockman, I'm at 604 Fulton Street.

644
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:37,466
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna say that- Hi, welcome.

645
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:40,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, we welcome your comments, thank you for participating.

646
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:48,835
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna start by saying I do, I think like a couple other people said, I do support the project, I think it's a great idea, very good things for development in Medford.

647
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:56,322
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know that it was kind of a local project coming into this, so that's very exciting to hear.

648
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:00,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I am happy to see because I reviewed the plans.

649
01:05:00,756 --> 01:05:01,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a landscape architect, by the way.

650
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:07,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I reviewed the plans prior to the meeting and I had a lot of questions, um, and a lot of them were actually addressed.

651
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:14,347
[SPEAKER_17]: So the things like the sidewalk, I mean, the street, the bike racks, although I think the location in the middle of the sidewalk probably isn't going to work.

652
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:17,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but they're there.

653
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:18,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're kind of accounting for them.

654
01:05:19,491 --> 01:05:26,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I do agree that it's, there's, there's, it's a lot less than I normally see.

655
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:29,510
[SPEAKER_17]: and present professionally in a site plan review.

656
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:35,453
[SPEAKER_17]: We're usually providing a lot more information for a project like this.

657
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:52,784
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can see, again, the perspective of the board here not really being comfortable, having to come up with a list of things that they need to see when they're sort of asking for them.

658
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:55,566
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's not adding too much,

659
01:05:58,061 --> 01:06:02,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And actually a comment I have was, well, we'll do the design later.

660
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:04,903
[SPEAKER_17]: We have the money to do the design later.

661
01:06:04,943 --> 01:06:13,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, my question then is, you know, is why can't you do it before these meetings or hearings before the permitting?

662
01:06:13,866 --> 01:06:15,327
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not to be antagonistic.

663
01:06:15,407 --> 01:06:19,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just, I don't know if that's tied to your loan funding.

664
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,649
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't want to draw on our loan unless this was a full go.

665
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fine.

666
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:26,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's understandable.

667
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,742
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.

668
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:30,703
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that's helpful.

669
01:06:30,743 --> 01:06:31,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

670
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:31,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

671
01:06:35,087 --> 01:06:41,713
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, if any other members of the public have comment that they'd like to share, if you could raise your hand or you could put a little note in the chat.

672
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:44,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to give folks another minute or so.

673
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:47,438
[SPEAKER_12]: And while I do that, I'll check our email.

674
01:06:54,618 --> 01:06:58,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, not seeing any further requests for comment.

675
01:07:00,742 --> 01:07:02,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, excellent.

676
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:07,126
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will then close the public comment portion of the meeting.

677
01:07:07,146 --> 01:07:16,933
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can go back to the board for our deliberation and additional questions from the project team.

678
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:27,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I throw, just to try to be helpful and kind of streamline things, can I throw out a suggestion to the other board members?

679
01:07:29,937 --> 01:07:30,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you don't mind.

680
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:31,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring it on.

681
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:32,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

682
01:07:33,439 --> 01:07:48,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something that we could do if the board, and I think, and having heard from all of you individually in our round table, could we offer some level of support to the project, but continue the meeting

683
01:07:49,457 --> 01:08:05,168
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have one scheduled for November 10, as I recall, continue the meeting to either that one or a subsequent one to actually get into the details after the next phase of the design has been completed, but something that we could provide.

684
01:08:06,108 --> 01:08:09,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Brian and his team feel comfortable moving forward.

685
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:23,401
[SPEAKER_00]: an endorsement a letter that I could sign on behalf of the board, giving principled support to the, to the to the use of the location.

686
01:08:26,243 --> 01:08:32,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything along along these lines, how would people feel about that I guess first I should ask my board, before I go.

687
01:08:33,307 --> 01:08:37,189
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we can I ask another question or maybe a question for Alicia, like

688
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:49,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we even allowed to approve the site plan without a certified site plan?

689
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:55,919
[SPEAKER_13]: I gotta tell you, I was actually looking up the opposite.

690
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:00,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Under what conditions are you even allowed to deny a project like this?

691
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:07,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you have to have certain things, but if they, like, is there a level where you can say, you know,

692
01:09:08,873 --> 01:09:30,201
[SPEAKER_13]: if you know as long as you show us the plan that that reflects these things that we've discussed then we will approve this and issue the special permit because you can only deny a site plan review under certain I literally just picked up my book and started flipping through the pages to

693
01:09:30,941 --> 01:09:31,602
[SPEAKER_13]: to see it.

694
01:09:31,622 --> 01:09:38,107
[SPEAKER_13]: So can I just say that the board has the ability to waive anything that they want.

695
01:09:38,447 --> 01:09:44,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we actually said to the applicant, are there any waivers you need from our performance requirements?

696
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:49,136
[SPEAKER_13]: And they went through our zoning and said, no, we can meet everything.

697
01:09:49,176 --> 01:09:55,021
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not asking for any waivers because you do have the ability to waive anything.

698
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,743
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were in the weeds like,

699
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:08,005
[SPEAKER_13]: do you have this setback and do you have this screening that is all in the performance standards that we never stepped back and said, is this not a site plan?

700
01:10:08,025 --> 01:10:14,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're right, it's not prepared by a registered architect, landscape architect or professional engineer.

701
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:19,851
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually the piece that they're asking the waiver from, that it's not prepared by one of those.

702
01:10:20,031 --> 01:10:22,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they ever actually formally ask that?

703
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:24,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they did.

704
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:25,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

705
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:36,192
[SPEAKER_16]: But then I'm going to go back to my previous statements, which is that now you are putting the liability of this decision on us instead of you.

706
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:38,234
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very uncomfortable with that.

707
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand the wording.

708
01:10:41,876 --> 01:10:42,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

709
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:46,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that requested waiver in writing to the board or to this?

710
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't.

711
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:49,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is that?

712
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:51,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's not, I didn't see it in any of the materials.

713
01:10:51,643 --> 01:10:57,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a drawing of the site as the site plan, letters of support,

714
01:10:58,362 --> 01:10:58,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

715
01:10:59,183 --> 01:10:59,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

716
01:11:05,068 --> 01:11:05,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

717
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:13,214
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we discussed it with them and we asked if they needed any waivers, I will say that the discussion they said no.

718
01:11:14,415 --> 01:11:22,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we looked at every detail but we didn't look at the part about the it being from a registered architect, etc.

719
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say we provided a site plan.

720
01:11:27,606 --> 01:11:29,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a full landscape plan.

721
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,228
[SPEAKER_11]: The site plan is provided by a registered engineer.

722
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:32,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

723
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that provided to us in our documents?

724
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:36,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's one of the... Yeah, it's this.

725
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:40,972
[SPEAKER_11]: The drainage, the stormwater management, that's all registered engineering.

726
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: The original application materials.

727
01:11:48,396 --> 01:11:52,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll double check that, but it should have been in that application packet, but let me take a look now.

728
01:11:54,468 --> 01:11:56,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It's this one here that was in the presentation.

729
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:05,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I think regardless, you're in a position where you've presented to us images that don't match the site plan.

730
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just seems like things need to get lined up.

731
01:12:08,817 --> 01:12:15,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's where I'm a little lost because this site plan is the direct CAD drawing that was used for the other landscape plan.

732
01:12:16,857 --> 01:12:18,820
[SPEAKER_11]: They do effectively line up.

733
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:28,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I just blew up the landscape plan in a larger image so that you could see it in a presentation, you know, and outlined as many things as I possibly could.

734
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:49,194
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I understand that the landscape architect hasn't been engaged and hasn't been, you don't have a full spec on the lawn or the size of shrub or the specific hedge that we're using, but we designed it to meet the performance standards as we saw fit and provided what I think is the most important piece is the civil engineering site plan.

735
01:12:50,874 --> 01:12:51,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

736
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:58,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So the site plan document exhibit a Eagle book site plan has been prepared by an engineering and survey firm.

737
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:08,744
[SPEAKER_13]: What the applicant did was took this and added color to it to show landscaping on that.

738
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:12,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is 100% to scale, it's the same document.

739
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:33,844
[SPEAKER_13]: So actually the part about a site plan prepared by a registered architect, a professional engineer is that document with the elevations and everything, the easements, the right of ways, existing contours.

740
01:13:33,864 --> 01:13:34,685
[SPEAKER_13]: That's 11.7.7 of the document.

741
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:36,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I see that, thank you.

742
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:36,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Lighting.

743
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:46,623
[SPEAKER_13]: They then actually supplemented that.

744
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:57,571
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of those items that are on here, landscape and screening, is on the additional document that they prepared, the one that's colored in, the one that's in color.

745
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:06,697
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe they provided a written list, sorry, in the packet.

746
01:14:07,478 --> 01:14:13,162
[SPEAKER_13]: There is, I'm going back and handing it.

747
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,241
[SPEAKER_13]: List of site plan updates.

748
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:25,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, based on the previous meeting, I outlined 15 different items that were brought about and put it on the EMS.

749
01:14:25,948 --> 01:14:29,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so this is not on the board to develop that list.

750
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:31,970
[SPEAKER_13]: That list was provided to you in writing.

751
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:45,695
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it is extremely simple to say that the list of site plan updates in the letter dated October 21st, 2022 would be incorporated as each of these is a condition

752
01:14:46,675 --> 01:15:00,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And before building permits shall be issued there should be a plan provided to the building department, reflecting each of the 15 items on this list.

753
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:12,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the problem Alicia I don't think it tees up that nicely because we had a preliminary meeting and we only went so far I don't think we was an absolutely exhaustive list of everything that we would like to weigh in on.

754
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:21,444
[SPEAKER_13]: No, what I'm saying is that that list is the list of things that during his presentation, he said we're going to do.

755
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:23,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And Emily said they're not reflected on the plan.

756
01:15:23,945 --> 01:15:27,567
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they're not reflected on the plan, but they're captured in a written list.

757
01:15:28,087 --> 01:15:34,691
[SPEAKER_13]: If there are additional things that are not on that, that is what this board would typically condition.

758
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:36,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Here are things you didn't bring up.

759
01:15:36,572 --> 01:15:39,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Here are things we haven't seen yet that we would like to see.

760
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:44,790
[SPEAKER_13]: So those would be your brainstormed, if I might say, list of conditions.

761
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:49,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

762
01:15:49,453 --> 01:15:51,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there going to be a traffic study done?

763
01:15:53,455 --> 01:15:54,896
[SPEAKER_10]: There is one that we provided.

764
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there is a traffic study.

765
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:05,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But as Todd pointed out in his letter, he didn't think that the scope was large enough for the project.

766
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So that also is...

767
01:16:09,571 --> 01:16:10,951
[SPEAKER_14]: the scope of the traffic study?

768
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:11,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

769
01:16:12,052 --> 01:16:15,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It only encompassed like one intersection, I think.

770
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:26,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And Todd had mentioned that, you know, usually the applicant would come to him and they would together, you know, decide on how or what should, what area should be included in the traffic study.

771
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:38,340
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, I mean, so the things that I'm saying, just to be completely clear about, you know,

772
01:16:39,105 --> 01:16:53,875
[SPEAKER_16]: my reservations is the design of the circulation in the site, pedestrian circulation in the site, the design of the vehicular circulation in the site, and the resultant space for landscaping.

773
01:16:54,576 --> 01:17:06,284
[SPEAKER_16]: Granted, I love this project, and I very much wanna see it done, but I think there are just certain things, and I'm not a landscape architect, and I'm not a,

774
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:14,571
[SPEAKER_16]: traffic engineer, but there's just certain things that just jump out at me as just seeming like not best practice.

775
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:21,933
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just, those are the things that are, that are making me uncomfortable.

776
01:17:21,953 --> 01:17:31,355
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want to jump in here for a sec, like I've, I've been working on this for three years and we've taken, we've had engineers out there that I've done soil tests and boring tests and all that.

777
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:31,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And so like,

778
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:41,590
[SPEAKER_10]: architects and engineers based on really where it was the best place to put the building.

779
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:52,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we worked off of that because just of the soil conditions and all that, it's, you know, the foundation here is rather extensive.

780
01:17:52,396 --> 01:17:54,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'll bring up a couple things then.

781
01:17:55,538 --> 01:18:07,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go there, let me just because I'm what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to see if we can get to something that won't keep us here all night going through all of the things that we either see and have questions about or things that we don't even see.

782
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:19,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to be positive I'd like to have us reflect our positive feelings for the project for Brian is his development team and so forth but.

783
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:27,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what can, Brian, if you guys want to go offline for five minutes and talk about this, that's fine too.

784
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:28,817
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, we can do it that way.

785
01:18:29,578 --> 01:18:32,859
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I think you're, you've heard from everybody on the board.

786
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:39,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has some questions, some reservations about the, the speed of this, given the materials that are in front of us.

787
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:45,404
[SPEAKER_00]: This would probably go super smoothly for you if your architect put that

788
01:18:46,104 --> 01:19:02,270
[SPEAKER_00]: next level of design thinking into it, and you came back to us you probably have a half a dozen comments to share with you, and you'd be off to the races so how do we, what do you need to get to that point because I don't think the board's going to be comfortable giving you a full acceptance on this thing tonight, just being honest.

789
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:09,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I think Alicia answered some of that already whether or not you know we've met the conditions of what is required.

790
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:24,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean if you understand we're lacking in some areas certainly we do understand that I tried to my best of our ability to explain that but to Alicia's point you know we're required to meet a certain level of conditions and we've provided the materials granted they might not be

791
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:32,972
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, breathtaking landscape imagery, but it's a list of things that were requested by this board a few weeks ago.

792
01:19:33,573 --> 01:19:37,138
[SPEAKER_11]: We provided them a list of them and provided them on an updated plan.

793
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:39,162
[SPEAKER_11]: If there was severe issues with it,

794
01:19:39,972 --> 01:19:41,832
[SPEAKER_11]: we should have been brought to our attention a few weeks ago.

795
01:19:41,892 --> 01:19:44,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we've just, in my opinion, have wasted time.

796
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:59,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mr. Harnish, I'm sorry, I'm going to take the floor away from you because we did an informal meeting with you and you cooperated and came before us in an effort to give you as much information and be as helpful as possible so this meeting would have the best chance of success.

797
01:20:00,817 --> 01:20:12,706
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've heard from some board members already who are uncomfortable giving you a full list of things and feeling like we have to come up with all the things you have to do to the plan and putting that burden on us to come up with the wish list.

798
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:20,251
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you're sort of using that against us by saying, well, I did everything you told me in the last meeting and now that should be good enough.

799
01:20:21,112 --> 01:20:24,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So with all due respect, if somebody could communicate what that is.

800
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:30,953
[SPEAKER_11]: just a landscape architect stamping a plan that shows grass and it's various bushes.

801
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:43,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause you know, we've had several, several meetings, not only I respect the board and what they're, you know, and what they have to do, but we've met with the planning director we've met in several meetings and did the best we possibly could.

802
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:49,665
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all we're asking is that we get a, you know, a fair evaluation to provide providing you the best we possibly could.

803
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:55,129
[SPEAKER_11]: If you tell us, you know, it's just, if you can give us some direction of why it's lacking other than,

804
01:20:56,090 --> 01:21:00,071
[SPEAKER_11]: landscape architect stamping it and telling, you know, specifying the plants and trees.

805
01:21:00,771 --> 01:21:01,851
[SPEAKER_11]: We've given you a site plan.

806
01:21:02,932 --> 01:21:04,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you guys reviewed that.

807
01:21:06,313 --> 01:21:10,013
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a little, a certain level of conditions here of what's required.

808
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:16,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously there's still several steps to get to, to actually put a shovel in the ground on this thing.

809
01:21:17,935 --> 01:21:19,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I jump in here?

810
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:24,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting even more uncomfortable the further this conversation goes on and I

811
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna take a leap here and just say, I would like the city to explain what is this process that we're doing right now?

812
01:21:33,395 --> 01:21:39,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Our department heads aren't here to explain what they have asked for mitigation in their letters.

813
01:21:41,239 --> 01:21:48,903
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being pushed to make a decision without the information that we have set as a standard for this board.

814
01:21:50,193 --> 01:21:53,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So what conversations have happened at the city?

815
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do we need to do as a board?

816
01:21:56,276 --> 01:21:57,076
[SPEAKER_06]: What are our rights?

817
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:01,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been this uncomfortable on a public meeting.

818
01:22:02,138 --> 01:22:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to what Christie is saying, one of the things for the site plan review, right, is that the board has, we're able to control the site design and the layout.

819
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:14,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Clace has already mentioned, the traffic, the parking, the signs, the architectural design, right?

820
01:22:15,043 --> 01:22:15,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we,

821
01:22:16,824 --> 01:22:29,916
[SPEAKER_02]: We discuss future site management so forth so on one of the things that we do for scrutiny obviously is We need to see how this lays out before us now I could sit here and I can give you conditions all night, but am I doing a community?

822
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:38,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice or a service if I'm just guessing based on what you have prevented presented before us now I am very positive about this

823
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:43,046
[SPEAKER_02]: project and I want to see you go forward as fast as possible myself.

824
01:22:43,346 --> 01:22:48,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to make sure that we're doing it based on what we've already spent so much time getting to.

825
01:22:48,749 --> 01:22:52,950
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done so many things at the city level with the city and making sure that we're getting a comprehensive plan.

826
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making sure that we're doing design.

827
01:22:54,671 --> 01:23:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to do our due diligence for the community and making sure that anything that goes up is erected properly.

828
01:23:00,873 --> 01:23:03,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that you can move forward too.

829
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:05,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just don't have enough information.

830
01:23:05,775 --> 01:23:08,957
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not asking for a variance.

831
01:23:08,977 --> 01:23:12,839
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not asking to circumvent any building codes or anything like that.

832
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:19,964
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reality of the situation is that I think this project is so much better for the city and for the land.

833
01:23:20,124 --> 01:23:26,128
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's not passed tonight, then the tow yard and the bus yard, and it's gonna stay the exact same for the next five years.

834
01:23:26,488 --> 01:23:28,629
[SPEAKER_10]: There's options in the leases and that's what's gonna happen.

835
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think this would be just a complete disservice to the city of Medford.

836
01:23:36,398 --> 01:23:37,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, you put us in a tough spot.

837
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:43,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have- I know that, but sometimes I just think common sense is, it should be used.

838
01:23:43,742 --> 01:23:49,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can't believe if you have to choose between a tow yard and the Great American Beer Hall, you're gonna choose a tow yard.

839
01:23:49,445 --> 01:23:52,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unfair, that's not what we're trying to do.

840
01:23:52,246 --> 01:23:53,687
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the reality of the situation.

841
01:23:53,827 --> 01:23:54,767
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a choice.

842
01:23:55,888 --> 01:24:03,112
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to uphold what we are asked to do on behalf of the community and the city of Medford.

843
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:05,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if the city, if Alicia,

844
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:29,327
[SPEAKER_06]: could help guide us on, and maybe Chair Blumberg, if you could get us back to a place where we have a direction, but what conditions do we have to set or why are you telling us that we have to approve and we have no choice based on a certain set of requirements?

845
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:30,828
[SPEAKER_10]: There's options and they expire October 31st.

846
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:40,592
[SPEAKER_10]: and also it's a condition of our 7A loan through Capital One.

847
01:24:41,212 --> 01:24:43,734
[SPEAKER_10]: All of this is conditions on this project happening.

848
01:24:43,754 --> 01:24:47,216
[SPEAKER_10]: And so without tonight, we're just not gonna move forward.

849
01:24:48,997 --> 01:25:00,162
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I might, I think that what I'm hearing from the board, so first of all, I wanna be clear that there are conditions that the board can approve and there are conditions that the board can deny.

850
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:04,385
[SPEAKER_13]: And we provided to the applicant, in addition to the meeting that we,

851
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:13,872
[SPEAKER_13]: the pre-meeting that the applicant had with this board, we provided him with the board's performance standards, section 6.4 of the zoning.

852
01:25:14,352 --> 01:25:25,977
[SPEAKER_13]: In your packet, that's page 40 of the zoning that's been provided to you, as well as section 11.7, which is site plan review, which is page 125.

853
01:25:26,558 --> 01:25:31,180
[SPEAKER_13]: And we asked him to go through that and make sure that he was meeting all of the things in there.

854
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:50,030
[SPEAKER_13]: and that he was providing that in writing that he was meeting these things and if he couldn't meet any of them he should ask for waivers and so what we've heard him say is that he feels that he has met these standards and that it sounds to me that the board says we're not we don't see that you've met the standards but he thinks he has

855
01:25:50,702 --> 01:25:52,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, that's an impasse.

856
01:25:53,143 --> 01:26:03,246
[SPEAKER_13]: And he would actually need you to say which items aren't met because he went through them item by item and sees that he feels that he's met them.

857
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:09,248
[SPEAKER_13]: As we're looking at this, there is 11-7-10 standards for approval.

858
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:25,328
[SPEAKER_13]: and the proper thing to do when this board is the decision maker is to go through items one through seven and are each of these things may met because they'll be needed for the written findings respected to the proposed development as the issuer of this.

859
01:26:25,748 --> 01:26:27,049
[SPEAKER_13]: That's page 125.

860
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:31,632
[SPEAKER_13]: The one thing that we can offer if it's

861
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:44,558
[SPEAKER_13]: something that could be done is a letter to the applicant about the intention to approve this once some more details are provided.

862
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:53,741
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not a guessing, it's because legally this board can't deny it if he provides everything that is requested.

863
01:26:54,641 --> 01:27:06,305
[SPEAKER_13]: In section 11.7.11, the decision, the board may approve with conditions or deny an application for site plan approval when acting as a site plan approval authority.

864
01:27:07,065 --> 01:27:15,976
[SPEAKER_13]: provided, however, that any denial of an application shall be predicated only upon the applicant's failure to provide necessary information.

865
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:20,801
[SPEAKER_13]: So if he provides the information, the board is obligated to approve it.

866
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:27,289
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that we need to understand what's the necessary understanding.

867
01:27:28,033 --> 01:27:50,672
[SPEAKER_13]: information and one might argue that it's meeting section 11 710 standards for approval which we could go through one by one and I will tell you that the zoning board when they are the special permit granting authority which this body is tonight will go through every single standard and discuss whether or not it is met and then that gets reflected in the decision

868
01:27:51,212 --> 01:27:56,535
[SPEAKER_13]: And because this is a permit at this level, there's no zoning board in this one.

869
01:27:57,155 --> 01:28:00,997
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll need to actually write up a response to each of these seven items.

870
01:28:01,437 --> 01:28:08,761
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's actually an exercise that we ought to be going through this evening in order to provide us with the materials to write the decision correctly.

871
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:20,267
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that there is an option to continue this hearing and then have additional information brought forward.

872
01:28:20,832 --> 01:28:24,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the applicant doesn't read minds.

873
01:28:25,077 --> 01:28:26,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not reading minds.

874
01:28:26,638 --> 01:28:32,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand you saying, I heard it, but I don't see it and I need to see it.

875
01:28:33,245 --> 01:28:37,830
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I don't understand is what didn't you hear that you want to see?

876
01:28:39,332 --> 01:28:40,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Because he went through the list.

877
01:28:41,395 --> 01:28:45,457
[SPEAKER_13]: And those things are all on either in the written document or on it.

878
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:50,959
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll need it explained if we were to say to him, here's the stuff you need to provide.

879
01:28:51,599 --> 01:28:59,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't feel that I'm prepared to tell him what the board isn't seeing other than a picture rather than words.

880
01:29:00,343 --> 01:29:03,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Alicia, I appreciate your clarifications there.

881
01:29:03,324 --> 01:29:07,346
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to be fair, I mean, to meet aesthetic standards,

882
01:29:08,757 --> 01:29:11,739
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to evaluate and approve the building materials.

883
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:16,141
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no image of even the building.

884
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:18,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And the materials are to be determined.

885
01:29:19,783 --> 01:29:26,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are elements that are just flat out lacking in the presentation.

886
01:29:26,126 --> 01:29:31,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've never had in my tenure, which is not that long, but in my three to four years,

887
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:41,629
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had an applicant who has refused to continue to work with the board and force a decision on the board we've always had folks.

888
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:47,630
[SPEAKER_00]: who wanted feedback, came back, they'd come back, they'd do the extra work, and we all worked it out together.

889
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:50,892
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a different situation, a unique situation for us.

890
01:29:52,013 --> 01:30:06,263
[SPEAKER_00]: If the applicant's saying, I need a decision tonight, and I have to have it, I guess it's our job, and we can go through all of this, and we can come up with as exhaustive a list as possible, but it would, I don't know that that's approval,

891
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:11,740
[SPEAKER_00]: If the list is so long, how can it be approval?

892
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:12,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

893
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,280
[SPEAKER_13]: So two things.

894
01:30:16,781 --> 01:30:22,362
[SPEAKER_13]: This board did deny an applicant once who did not provide the necessary information.

895
01:30:22,862 --> 01:30:31,964
[SPEAKER_13]: In that case, they were refusing to do the drilling on a site that went to court and it was remanded back to the board when the applicant agreed to do the

896
01:30:32,518 --> 01:30:34,319
[SPEAKER_13]: the drilling for the water testing.

897
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:45,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it was remanded back when you were on the board, but that was, it was a 2019 case that was remanded in 2020.

898
01:30:46,827 --> 01:30:51,971
[SPEAKER_13]: So I did pull up the aesthetic standards that we provided to the applicant, which is what's in the zoning.

899
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:54,252
[SPEAKER_13]: And it says that section 6.48

900
01:30:56,045 --> 01:31:14,540
[SPEAKER_13]: The location, size and design, building materials and operating characteristics of the proposed development shall be compatible with and will not adversely affect the livability or appropriate development of abutting properties with natural and built environment in the area and the surrounding neighborhood.

901
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:22,647
[SPEAKER_13]: And it goes on to talk about compatibility with the neighborhood, harmony and scale bulk exterior building materials, massing and density.

902
01:31:23,906 --> 01:31:29,075
[SPEAKER_13]: consistency with the goals and objectives of the master plan and with other plan that's been adopted by the city.

903
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:35,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I can see where he's having trouble saying, like,

904
01:31:37,362 --> 01:31:38,943
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the board's opinion.

905
01:31:39,263 --> 01:31:41,045
[SPEAKER_13]: We like brick and not metal.

906
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:54,355
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be that if it was a neighborhood that was all houses and you didn't like a metal structure in that neighborhood, you could see that that would not be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.

907
01:31:55,190 --> 01:32:00,735
[SPEAKER_13]: But he has actually given you a drawing of the building and examples of the materials.

908
01:32:00,795 --> 01:32:09,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Alicia I don't have, I don't have a building, I have an image that has been described to me as conceptual only, and not to be reflecting the actual conditions.

909
01:32:11,644 --> 01:32:13,126
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I heard.

910
01:32:13,146 --> 01:32:18,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that what you actually said because I understood this to be the, the building that you guys were planning to build.

911
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, that's not what he said.

912
01:32:20,908 --> 01:32:24,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I said it's a concept image, so you don't get married to the exact image you're seeing.

913
01:32:25,349 --> 01:32:31,731
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it is and I went through this in detail, it's a low pitch roof, metal prefab building looks just like that.

914
01:32:32,271 --> 01:32:34,251
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a specific color picked out yet.

915
01:32:34,751 --> 01:32:47,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And the amount of glazing I said with the indoor outdoor feel on the front side elevation, just because you see a full curtain wall, it might be 75% of that given budget constraints come the time of actual building class goes up periodically.

916
01:32:48,975 --> 01:32:51,276
[SPEAKER_11]: That image is as close as we can provide.

917
01:32:51,296 --> 01:32:57,200
[SPEAKER_11]: That's based on architectural drawings provided by Whitlock Design Group, which we provided floor plans and schematics.

918
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't want the board to get married to the exact color.

919
01:33:00,902 --> 01:33:03,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can improve it dramatically, actually.

920
01:33:04,404 --> 01:33:09,486
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's lacking in some definition, but it is a metal prefab building.

921
01:33:09,546 --> 01:33:11,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna look essentially like that architecturally.

922
01:33:11,988 --> 01:33:16,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't want the board to get married to the specific color, perhaps the roof color.

923
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:25,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to preface that, but if it came across as that's not what we're building, I apologize to the board.

924
01:33:26,019 --> 01:33:28,181
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is pretty indicative.

925
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:32,124
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the color palette and things are going to probably change.

926
01:33:32,705 --> 01:33:33,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And the size?

927
01:33:34,228 --> 01:33:35,109
[SPEAKER_11]: The size is there.

928
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:38,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what we're essentially approved for.

929
01:33:38,331 --> 01:33:41,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, construction costs again are fluctuating mightily.

930
01:33:41,914 --> 01:33:46,117
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only place we really have in value engineering, but that is it.

931
01:33:46,297 --> 01:33:46,977
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the building.

932
01:33:47,037 --> 01:33:48,318
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're asking for.

933
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:51,761
[SPEAKER_11]: We've paid architects to design it.

934
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:56,544
[SPEAKER_11]: As Brian pointed out, we've gone through several iterations of where this building should be based on soil testings.

935
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:58,866
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've dug our test pits.

936
01:33:58,886 --> 01:33:59,987
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done all that stuff.

937
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:01,448
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we've just reached

938
01:34:02,048 --> 01:34:05,911
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the point of kind of, this is the best that we have for you.

939
01:34:06,531 --> 01:34:11,434
[SPEAKER_11]: And I certainly hear the board that, you know, we're lacking in landscape and things of that nature.

940
01:34:11,815 --> 01:34:19,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we can work with the board to achieve what is, you know, what can beautify the space and hopefully improve it.

941
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:30,347
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I just, usually I can get some form of direction or something, but I, you know, I wanna be respectful of the whole process.

942
01:34:32,073 --> 01:34:40,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think for me, interestingly, like I said this before, I don't have, I don't have reservations about the building.

943
01:34:40,296 --> 01:34:43,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I, the building is what the building is.

944
01:34:43,457 --> 01:34:48,799
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think for me, I understand that I have problems with the site plan, the way it's drawn today.

945
01:34:48,819 --> 01:35:00,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and like I, what I was going to say earlier is I think maybe what would help me is to get your, the, the engineer that drew this plan and to get the,

946
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:11,282
[SPEAKER_16]: traffic engineer who did the study on the call with us would really help, because it would help us understand what they were thinking.

947
01:35:11,542 --> 01:35:19,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm looking at the entrance to the building, to the parking lot, and it's just off center from an opposing road.

948
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:30,748
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked about this for hours on end on that other project that Alicia just mentioned about how... And I wanna hear the traffic engineer say, that's okay.

949
01:35:31,918 --> 01:35:59,749
[SPEAKER_16]: um there you drew a five-foot sidewalk from the sidewalk from the street to your front door which is really narrow and and really not welcoming at all you know i want to hear the guy who did the the layout of the site tell us why that's okay uh from a from a pedestrian circulation standpoint um there's just there's just a lot of things that the front parking lot is a dead end

950
01:36:00,248 --> 01:36:02,390
[SPEAKER_16]: What's going to happen three cars are in that space.

951
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:03,290
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be a mess.

952
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:16,280
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I, there are just things I mentioned this last time you were parking right up against the fence, the neighbor's fence, you know, without any kind of buffer, you know, is that really best practice?

953
01:36:17,881 --> 01:36:19,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I, I don't know.

954
01:36:19,302 --> 01:36:22,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this is, I think there are things that are making us uncomfortable.

955
01:36:22,665 --> 01:36:23,125
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think.

956
01:36:24,706 --> 01:36:24,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

957
01:36:24,846 --> 01:36:27,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking about the neighbor on the one 34 mystic side?

958
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:28,930
[SPEAKER_16]: That's that sweet.

959
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:31,567
[SPEAKER_10]: property as well.

960
01:36:31,647 --> 01:36:34,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's okay.

961
01:36:35,949 --> 01:36:56,195
[SPEAKER_16]: But nonetheless, you're parking right up against the property line, you know, I mean, I, these are things that I, you know, we I, and, you know, Alicia, I tell me if I'm wrong, but we consider these projects holistically and right now this is not feeling holistically like where it should be.

962
01:36:56,655 --> 01:36:57,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

963
01:36:58,574 --> 01:37:01,436
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, obviously everybody on this board is feeling discomfort.

964
01:37:02,296 --> 01:37:08,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm hearing is that you don't like some of the designs, but they're, actually, can you guys stop sharing screen?

965
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it looks weird on our end.

966
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,003
[SPEAKER_13]: It's disconcerting.

967
01:37:13,063 --> 01:37:14,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on your screen.

968
01:37:14,364 --> 01:37:15,084
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like gross.

969
01:37:15,384 --> 01:37:17,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it says screen sharing is paused.

970
01:37:18,586 --> 01:37:19,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

971
01:37:19,527 --> 01:37:24,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we actually have, like, can we give those as

972
01:37:25,419 --> 01:37:27,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, is that our job?

973
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what are we, what is our job?

974
01:37:29,703 --> 01:37:36,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we usually do give those comments and we go back and forth and that's how it works, but what do we have to?

975
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:46,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, well, like, if you wanted to say we're not comfortable, like, honestly, I didn't check if the zoning allows the parking lot to be right up against the line.

976
01:37:46,618 --> 01:37:50,682
[SPEAKER_13]: It does say about needing screening between your parking and the neighbors.

977
01:37:51,082 --> 01:37:51,643
[SPEAKER_13]: If you said,

978
01:37:52,983 --> 01:38:04,389
[SPEAKER_13]: we agree that the drive aisle should be narrower, but don't make the island in the middle bigger, pull it away from your neighbor and put screening along your neighbor.

979
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:06,931
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something you can do.

980
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:13,414
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also reasonable for them to come back and say, actually, we own that property and we'd prefer to have it right up against it.

981
01:38:13,714 --> 01:38:15,755
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little weird that they would want, but they could.

982
01:38:17,076 --> 01:38:21,318
[SPEAKER_13]: But those specific things are the kinds of things that this board usually says.

983
01:38:21,765 --> 01:38:25,588
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see this walking path, I don't see the bike racks.

984
01:38:26,008 --> 01:38:39,216
[SPEAKER_13]: And if he had said to you, tell me what changes you want, I'm gonna go make the changes and come back to you in two weeks, then you would have started saying, here are the changes that we wanna see.

985
01:38:40,577 --> 01:38:42,659
[SPEAKER_13]: That is what this board typically does do.

986
01:38:42,919 --> 01:38:47,402
[SPEAKER_13]: And I actually, I'm saying that some of the, Emily and George are relatively new.

987
01:38:48,110 --> 01:39:10,205
[SPEAKER_16]: to is it is it possible to for us just to list I mean I know this isn't what we want to do but we also don't want to put a knife into this project you know I I mean to me the parking layout and the pedestrian circulation the sidewalks this is the problem that I'm seeing and in concert with the landscaping like

988
01:39:12,609 --> 01:39:31,299
[SPEAKER_16]: if they're willing to continue to work with us and come back and really think about those dimensions and work with the fire department as well, I mean, that's the stuff that I'm uncomfortable with.

989
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:35,842
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't seem like you're utilizing best practices for those elements.

990
01:39:36,922 --> 01:39:41,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we look at the list of site plan updates and use that as a starting point?

991
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:52,958
[SPEAKER_07]: for conditions and figure out which ones we wanna go deeper on, which ones we might need to quantify or qualify to make ourselves comfortable with it.

992
01:39:54,418 --> 01:39:57,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And then build in maybe some things that are not reflected on that list.

993
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And that can be our starting point.

994
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:06,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I make the suggestion that Amanda or Amanda, are you prepared to take those notes?

995
01:40:06,321 --> 01:40:10,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I was gonna say, you could share a screen with that document and add in red.

996
01:40:12,978 --> 01:40:16,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the board could see that.

997
01:40:17,101 --> 01:40:18,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to do that or?

998
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the board comfortable with that too?

999
01:40:21,103 --> 01:40:29,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there is David's earlier suggestion of some sort of interim document that allows this amazing project to move forward.

1000
01:40:30,908 --> 01:40:35,211
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe in a way that the board is more comfortable with.

1001
01:40:35,711 --> 01:40:38,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a question for David, not any of the applicants.

1002
01:40:40,314 --> 01:40:40,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1003
01:40:42,087 --> 01:40:59,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like that idea I'm not sure who's holding the gun to your head Brian on this thing about the timeline I'm not hearing anything from the board that would be in the camp of insurmountable in terms of, you know, if you have to move a landscape island a little bit here there.

1004
01:40:59,615 --> 01:41:10,019
[SPEAKER_00]: You move the traveling that, you know, no one's saying move the building no one's saying take it down, cut it in half, you know, yeah, there's when Alicia laid out before if you put

1005
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,031
[SPEAKER_10]: that would be okay with me.

1006
01:41:17,131 --> 01:41:24,554
[SPEAKER_10]: What's gotten to my head is the leases that are in play, the landlords have landlord options, and they do not want the site to go vacant.

1007
01:41:24,795 --> 01:41:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So they don't want us to move forward, we say we're fine, and then ultimately the site plan review says no to us.

1008
01:41:32,618 --> 01:41:40,342
[SPEAKER_10]: The tenants are moving out, or they're asking for concessions, and it just becomes, honestly, like a fireball fence in my shoes.

1009
01:41:40,422 --> 01:41:41,523
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where I'm coming from.

1010
01:41:42,108 --> 01:41:45,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can only deny you for zoning violations if I'm correct.

1011
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:45,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?

1012
01:41:46,453 --> 01:41:52,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't deny your site plan we can only make sure that we get to a better fit for the community.

1013
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,861
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't deny your site plan.

1014
01:41:55,222 --> 01:42:03,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, essentially it is Alicia laid out for us it's like denial because they, they were lacking essential elements or something you know of the application.

1015
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:34,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something that we should be thinking about in terms of an acceptance with conditions and we just have more conditions than usual and it might be a condition that the proponent or applicant returns to the board and addresses circulation of pedestrians and vehicular circulation on the site to the board satisfaction now that's more aspirational that's more general than we usually engage in.

1016
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:48,277
[SPEAKER_00]: but how do the other board members feel like if we went toward an acceptance with conditions and we phrase the conditions in that sort of way, would that make you comfortable?

1017
01:42:48,397 --> 01:42:52,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like a quick thumbs up or nods of the head I can see on that or a comment?

1018
01:42:52,999 --> 01:42:55,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a good path.

1019
01:42:56,401 --> 01:43:04,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I think having the conditions that requires them to come back to us to engage more and having those

1020
01:43:05,001 --> 01:43:13,608
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of safe harbor provisions of looking at, you know, the advancement of the design would make me more comfortable.

1021
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:19,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's still a technical approval and satisfies your goals for tonight.

1022
01:43:20,353 --> 01:43:25,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, allows us to, you know, satisfy our mandate.

1023
01:43:26,716 --> 01:43:52,848
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's helpful, we were actually just consulting with one of our staff who, because this type of issue doesn't come up in Medford very often, but one of our staff has been on the zoning board in Somerville for many years, and she was saying that this sort of situation does come up there where applicants have limited resources, were reluctant to spend a lot of money on landscape architects if they didn't know the project would get approved.

1024
01:43:53,428 --> 01:43:54,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So they would often,

1025
01:43:55,149 --> 01:44:13,870
[SPEAKER_13]: condition that landscaping plans be be updated brought to the staff for review and approval and meet a litany of criteria that they would set but they would basically say here are all the conditions the staff have to approve anything and i will sort of point out so the behind the scenes piece that you all don't see

1026
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:21,093
[SPEAKER_13]: is that we issue the approval to say plant here, they then still need to get a building permit.

1027
01:44:21,593 --> 01:44:25,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And before they can get the building permit, our city engineer has to sign off.

1028
01:44:26,215 --> 01:44:32,378
[SPEAKER_13]: The health and fire will then literally sign off on formal plans and I have to sign off on plans.

1029
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:38,281
[SPEAKER_13]: So they actually can't get my signature until they come back and say here.

1030
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:43,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we wanted it to involve them actually coming back and showing the board the plans,

1031
01:44:44,293 --> 01:44:55,479
[SPEAKER_13]: we can condition it on it because the condition it is held to by them, they don't get the building permit until they meet all the conditions.

1032
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:00,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And in fact, she was saying they tied conditions to points in time.

1033
01:45:01,002 --> 01:45:06,505
[SPEAKER_13]: So there'd be a foundation permit, building permit and the occupancy permits.

1034
01:45:06,965 --> 01:45:11,448
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's something that when you all and the zoning board put conditions on,

1035
01:45:11,918 --> 01:45:15,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Amanda and I behind the scenes break things down, right?

1036
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:25,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Which things do they have to do before they get a building permit and which things are part of the construction and they have to do before they get the occupancy permit, right?

1037
01:45:25,286 --> 01:45:29,469
[SPEAKER_13]: So we already segregate those things with a spreadsheet in our office.

1038
01:45:30,769 --> 01:45:41,356
[SPEAKER_13]: So having them come back to this board as an option, having them reflect these things before they get their building permit, that's standard practice.

1039
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:49,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think what I'm envisioning is a condition that would have them come back because, you know, crisis comments as an example.

1040
01:45:49,943 --> 01:46:08,850
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that's not like a little bullet list that we could provide with specific to do's, but we'd like to hear a little bit more understand that someone's thinking is behind the circulation or the location of the sidewalks and that sort of stuff so I think we would want them to return to us to address

1041
01:46:09,782 --> 01:46:11,765
[SPEAKER_00]: any number of items that we are.

1042
01:46:12,586 --> 01:46:18,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually like the traffic engineer and the landscape architect that will be on the call like Lisa was saying.

1043
01:46:19,436 --> 01:46:23,001
[SPEAKER_07]: But those would be conditions to our acceptance this evening, theoretically.

1044
01:46:23,021 --> 01:46:25,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's that's what I'm contemplating Emily.

1045
01:46:31,112 --> 01:46:35,278
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's the case, we probably should try to, we should probably try to figure out what those are, right?

1046
01:46:37,661 --> 01:46:41,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to go through, Klyce, do you want to start us off?

1047
01:46:41,387 --> 01:46:46,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can just, in terms of questions, maybe there are things that can answer tonight.

1048
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:49,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there are things that you'd like to hear more about later.

1049
01:46:49,926 --> 01:47:02,753
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put, you know, that could be one of our buckets, and then maybe some specific to-dos if that's a third potential bucket as we go through this with Brian and Kyle.

1050
01:47:02,913 --> 01:47:03,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that work for you?

1051
01:47:04,193 --> 01:47:07,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we maybe start with asking the proponents?

1052
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:08,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1053
01:47:09,056 --> 01:47:13,758
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was going to say, should we start by asking the proponents if this works for them?

1054
01:47:14,515 --> 01:47:15,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

1055
01:47:16,775 --> 01:47:17,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Key question.

1056
01:47:18,356 --> 01:47:20,416
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you folks feeling about what we're discussing here?

1057
01:47:20,436 --> 01:47:32,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to have to relay this to obviously my bosses, and I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to go forward.

1058
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:42,621
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did like Alicia's idea that, you know, I fully understand what you're saying, but we are going to be beholden to the building permit and every

1059
01:47:43,797 --> 01:47:46,258
[SPEAKER_10]: every engineer and every department in the city.

1060
01:47:47,238 --> 01:47:50,378
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is our next step in this process.

1061
01:47:51,419 --> 01:48:05,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Patrick Andrews on the call and our next step is literally just a, you know, it's what 218,000 architectural plans and then another, you know, 50,000 engineers and we're fully prepared to spend that to do this the right way.

1062
01:48:07,082 --> 01:48:10,023
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that the board is suggesting tonight,

1063
01:48:14,847 --> 01:48:17,209
[SPEAKER_10]: landlords are going to want to just keep what we have now.

1064
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:23,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, can you restate what you understand our path forward to be?

1065
01:48:25,435 --> 01:48:31,140
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to have some sort of conditions in there that requires us to come back,

1066
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this is gonna if this project is going to happen, because that I don't know the condition for you to come back, I believe would just be to further explain some of the questions that we've had.

1067
01:48:45,351 --> 01:48:47,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, do that.

1068
01:48:47,912 --> 01:48:51,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I don't think there's deny anything.

1069
01:48:52,233 --> 01:48:56,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I just if when I hear like what if places saying all the

1070
01:49:00,773 --> 01:49:07,257
[SPEAKER_10]: gathering that this could just change that the parking can change the sidewalks can change and everything.

1071
01:49:07,277 --> 01:49:11,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so like, everything.

1072
01:49:12,621 --> 01:49:21,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, everything's been, you know, behind the scenes from my group, the landlords to Capital One, everyone's on the same page with this, we're ready to move forward with it.

1073
01:49:22,657 --> 01:49:27,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't it change if the architect and all of them, you know, once they get into the more details.

1074
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, yeah, that could.

1075
01:49:30,141 --> 01:49:30,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just want to.

1076
01:49:31,081 --> 01:49:32,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Might as well have them do it once.

1077
01:49:33,222 --> 01:49:37,725
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just want to be part, yeah, like anything could change anyways once they get into the.

1078
01:49:37,765 --> 01:49:47,229
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would just like to say, sorry, if this is a major concern for you, then I don't know why this board is going to waste their time on the next hour doing conditions.

1079
01:49:49,531 --> 01:49:50,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be honest.

1080
01:49:51,692 --> 01:49:52,352
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we doing here?

1081
01:49:56,407 --> 01:50:01,853
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Brian, it would be, I think it would be characterized as an acceptance.

1082
01:50:01,914 --> 01:50:04,797
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be conditions attached, but, you know, it's not.

1083
01:50:05,017 --> 01:50:05,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do it.

1084
01:50:06,118 --> 01:50:07,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I hope.

1085
01:50:12,629 --> 01:50:33,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel your pain because this is the work that I do, but it's in your best interest as a new developer to engage in a process like this as early as possible so that you're actually minimizing the risk now and engaging in our conditions and having your architects and engineers do it one time.

1086
01:50:33,527 --> 01:50:36,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the amount of money that you spend on drawings

1087
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: is pennies compared to getting farther down the line and having to come back and change.

1088
01:50:42,882 --> 01:50:46,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you really should think that way now that you're a developer.

1089
01:50:48,224 --> 01:50:49,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's why we're here tonight.

1090
01:50:49,804 --> 01:50:51,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we basically laid that out.

1091
01:50:51,805 --> 01:50:54,646
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hoping for an acceptance with conditions.

1092
01:50:54,746 --> 01:50:59,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I've done this several times and that's how other communities handle it and approval with conditions.

1093
01:50:59,447 --> 01:51:12,070
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to meet those conditions before the board, you know, and you guys, if I understand that it might be a lengthy list in this regard, and we're asking for some assistance and help because we're, we're small time, you know, but,

1094
01:51:12,891 --> 01:51:18,175
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the capacity to engage the architects and the designers and the engineers, as Brian said.

1095
01:51:18,235 --> 01:51:27,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just want some clarity and direction on what would help us get back to you guys with everything that you want to see.

1096
01:51:27,242 --> 01:51:30,385
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to go through several iterations and reiterations of this.

1097
01:51:30,425 --> 01:51:36,169
[SPEAKER_11]: We understand that you guys have the community in mind and want to see the best product out there.

1098
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:38,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we totally agree with you.

1099
01:51:39,712 --> 01:51:49,844
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I understand Brian's situation too and it is a difficult one, but I think some form of approval with conditions would be would be instrumental and helpful for us.

1100
01:51:51,481 --> 01:51:56,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're not, you know, objecting to, you will see the final plan and certainly the landscape plan and stuff.

1101
01:51:56,785 --> 01:52:00,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm the one who probably engaged with you guys the most.

1102
01:52:00,968 --> 01:52:02,409
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to hear your thoughts, Clace.

1103
01:52:02,449 --> 01:52:07,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very helpful hearing your thoughts, you know, and what you see concerns with.

1104
01:52:07,532 --> 01:52:13,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can bring that to the attention of our engineers and provide some context and some answers when we come back.

1105
01:52:15,337 --> 01:52:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think from Brian's standpoint, yes, he needs some assurances so that

1106
01:52:21,009 --> 01:52:23,450
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this isn't a waste of time for everybody.

1107
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:26,650
[SPEAKER_16]: I think appreciated.

1108
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:28,751
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I'm going to say this again.

1109
01:52:28,771 --> 01:52:31,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I love this project.

1110
01:52:33,332 --> 01:52:40,274
[SPEAKER_16]: And I envision myself sitting in that beer hall having a beer, hopefully someday soon.

1111
01:52:41,374 --> 01:52:47,035
[SPEAKER_16]: That said, for me, what I want to see is I want to see a team, a

1112
01:52:51,134 --> 01:53:10,701
[SPEAKER_16]: combined team of professionals work together to provide a site plan that puts all best practices of all those trades forward.

1113
01:53:12,582 --> 01:53:18,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Site circulation, landscaping, vehicle circulation.

1114
01:53:20,225 --> 01:53:20,465
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1115
01:53:21,093 --> 01:53:21,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.

1116
01:53:25,275 --> 01:53:25,916
[SPEAKER_11]: That's understood.

1117
01:53:26,116 --> 01:53:30,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we use the city ordinances as our guide and provide what we think is sufficient.

1118
01:53:30,619 --> 01:53:36,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And then obviously, if you have an opinion on it and want to, you know, change it, we can have that discussion.

1119
01:53:36,842 --> 01:53:41,085
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the pathway we give our engineers is, you know, it has to comply.

1120
01:53:42,103 --> 01:53:45,064
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have city ordinances that give us the guidelines.

1121
01:53:46,285 --> 01:53:51,267
[SPEAKER_16]: I, I'm, I, I'm looking for something better than compliance.

1122
01:53:52,287 --> 01:53:52,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Understood.

1123
01:53:52,687 --> 01:53:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: That's helpful.

1124
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:00,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have others while you have the microphone.

1125
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:05,633
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I mean I honestly I'm looking for.

1126
01:54:08,073 --> 01:54:12,577
[SPEAKER_16]: The word is escaping me, but I'm looking for a site plan which checks all those boxes.

1127
01:54:13,037 --> 01:54:15,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1128
01:54:15,939 --> 01:54:27,487
[SPEAKER_16]: That reflects the work of a team that has worked together to sort of provide this under, you know, able leadership of the developer.

1129
01:54:36,313 --> 01:54:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1130
01:54:38,664 --> 01:54:42,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Amanda, can you zoom a little because it's pretty small.

1131
01:54:43,746 --> 01:54:44,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, no problem.

1132
01:54:45,867 --> 01:54:46,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for asking Alicia.

1133
01:54:48,408 --> 01:54:49,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

1134
01:54:49,308 --> 01:54:49,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this any better?

1135
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:51,549
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot better.

1136
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:53,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Do people need a little more?

1137
01:54:53,649 --> 01:54:56,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is good.

1138
01:54:57,251 --> 01:54:57,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1139
01:54:58,984 --> 01:55:12,112
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing, I suggest that you use either a different font or a different color or something, which I realize you're gonna have to go back and forth and keep changing, but that will help us to see what the board said versus what was in the original.

1140
01:55:12,492 --> 01:55:19,176
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also change the entry to suggesting rather than editing, and it's effectively track changes in the top, yep, right there.

1141
01:55:20,757 --> 01:55:22,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully less work for everybody.

1142
01:55:23,619 --> 01:55:24,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Emily.

1143
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:24,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1144
01:55:28,595 --> 01:55:34,498
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can please ask the proponent, there was something mentioned about this south side of Mystic Ave.

1145
01:55:34,938 --> 01:55:39,621
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a pole or something that's there that the proponent wanted to underground.

1146
01:55:40,181 --> 01:55:44,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't understanding what the alternative was or what the purpose of that pole was for.

1147
01:55:44,843 --> 01:55:47,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't even envision it the way it was.

1148
01:55:48,185 --> 01:55:54,368
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the alternative for you're not able to afford or have the underground of that pole done?

1149
01:55:54,883 --> 01:55:55,984
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great question.

1150
01:55:56,024 --> 01:55:57,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a matter of affording it.

1151
01:55:57,644 --> 01:56:00,286
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a matter of the utility company willing to do so.

1152
01:56:00,346 --> 01:56:01,466
[SPEAKER_11]: We can put in a request.

1153
01:56:02,727 --> 01:56:04,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So it depends on who owns the pole.

1154
01:56:04,327 --> 01:56:06,268
[SPEAKER_11]: It's either Eversource, National Grid, Verizon.

1155
01:56:06,869 --> 01:56:10,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you got to put in a request to them to put a transformer in its place.

1156
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,051
[SPEAKER_11]: So the power still goes to the pole.

1157
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:20,655
[SPEAKER_11]: You remove that pole, it'll come from the nearest pole, go underground and go to a pad mount transformer that's still going to have to be located somewhere in our

1158
01:56:21,155 --> 01:56:27,437
[SPEAKER_11]: landscape buffer area, and we'll have to put some shrubs around it and whatnot, but it's still going to be better than the pole that's there.

1159
01:56:27,477 --> 01:56:47,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's just a goal of ours that we're committed to trying to do that, and I think Clay's brought it up, the entrance, the driveway access, the curb cut is proposed in its location, and that's primarily the reason it can't be further slid down, it's off-center, is because we have a utility line right there, and there's no guarantee we can get it moved.

1160
01:56:49,258 --> 01:57:05,559
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just wondering exactly what the purpose of moving the utility pole was because one of the things I know working at the state and work with utility companies is that you can throw a whole monkey wrench into your entire budget and scope just by trying to

1161
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:10,410
[SPEAKER_02]: get all the utility people on schedule with you.

1162
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:15,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can also astronomically rise up your budgets for underground.

1163
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:19,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just didn't know exactly what you were trying to achieve with that.

1164
01:57:19,159 --> 01:57:19,720
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1165
01:57:20,487 --> 01:57:22,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a better look in street and- So aesthetic.

1166
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, aesthetic, yeah.

1167
01:57:24,551 --> 01:57:28,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, we're gonna be running underground utilities anyway to the street.

1168
01:57:28,414 --> 01:57:33,399
[SPEAKER_11]: So you'd be digging one extra line for conduit for the electrical to run to that location.

1169
01:57:33,619 --> 01:57:37,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Eversource or whoever the utility provider is owns it from the pole down.

1170
01:57:38,023 --> 01:57:41,707
[SPEAKER_11]: We would own the excavation from the building to the curb.

1171
01:57:42,207 --> 01:57:45,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that answers your question.

1172
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

1173
01:57:48,036 --> 01:57:57,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions I can't see everyone with the shared screen so shout out if you need to but who would like to go next to asking some questions or sharing comments.

1174
01:58:00,951 --> 01:58:03,955
[SPEAKER_00]: George was that are you just scratching your chin or is that a hands up.

1175
01:58:04,235 --> 01:58:06,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I guess I have some comments I could share David thanks.

1176
01:58:07,659 --> 01:58:08,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.

1177
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:21,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been, well, I kind of appreciate coming back and I know that I was sharing some comments with Amanda halfway through the week about pedestrian access to the project.

1178
01:58:22,091 --> 01:58:35,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I did see that you included a sidewalk, but I would like to see, you know, better, just a more cohesive pedestrian circulation plan that doesn't really just route people, you know, through

1179
01:58:37,645 --> 01:58:43,469
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess, I mean, if it could kind of somehow be integrated, you know, better with the crosswalk.

1180
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:50,693
[SPEAKER_15]: I had some concerns about people crossing the parking lot access, for instance.

1181
01:58:51,594 --> 01:59:01,140
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's inevitable that there are pedestrian vehicular conflicts.

1182
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:05,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I know one of the best practices, one of the better practices is to use

1183
01:59:06,184 --> 01:59:08,165
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of tighter radius curve pieces.

1184
01:59:08,925 --> 01:59:12,806
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, boy, we're really getting in the weeds here, aren't we?

1185
01:59:13,326 --> 01:59:18,908
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, just having a tighter radius causes, you know, forces cars to move more slowly around the site.

1186
01:59:20,068 --> 01:59:32,112
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are kind of the kind of design gestures that I think would really, you know, it's not a big ask, I think, but also, it really does improve the safety and also just the experience of the site.

1187
01:59:33,573 --> 01:59:34,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that another

1188
01:59:36,122 --> 02:00:03,040
[SPEAKER_15]: uh somebody that called in from the public you mentioned that there's a bus stop here um you know how how would if people wanted to get to the project using public transportation you know that's that's a really nice idea then you don't have people drinking and driving um how do people get here from the bus where's the bus stop if we could show it in a plan you know maybe maybe that shows or kind of indicates how people would get on and off the bus or if there's some kind of design gesture for that

1189
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:07,561
[SPEAKER_07]: How would we condition that just to give them as clear of guidance as possible?

1190
02:00:07,581 --> 02:00:11,783
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that should be our kind of question for all of these comments that we're making.

1191
02:00:11,803 --> 02:00:13,504
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we make it actionable?

1192
02:00:13,584 --> 02:00:14,664
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we make it clear?

1193
02:00:15,644 --> 02:00:24,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So that when, you know, if one of our conditions ends up being, we want them to come back, we can say, you know, guys, this is phenomenal because we've been so clear.

1194
02:00:24,448 --> 02:00:28,689
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's really something I've been wondering about myself.

1195
02:00:28,949 --> 02:00:30,410
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you, how do you condition that?

1196
02:00:32,817 --> 02:00:53,563
[SPEAKER_07]: work with, I'm just going to throw it out because it's like, but, you know, work with, you know, city traffic engineers or, you know, Director of Transportation to, I guess this is still a little fluffy, but to maintain existing bus access.

1197
02:00:54,064 --> 02:00:55,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's kind of step one.

1198
02:00:57,945 --> 02:00:58,965
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know,

1199
02:00:59,992 --> 02:01:01,753
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a comment about bike parking.

1200
02:01:01,773 --> 02:01:06,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So like maybe that can be good to do that.

1201
02:01:06,417 --> 02:01:09,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe for now it's just maintaining existing bus access.

1202
02:01:10,559 --> 02:01:17,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm also trying to remember that this is one spot on a mass DOT owned.

1203
02:01:19,085 --> 02:01:19,526
[SPEAKER_07]: You're away.

1204
02:01:19,946 --> 02:01:25,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we ask them to create 16 bus stops, that's not realistic and we're setting them up for failure.

1205
02:01:26,257 --> 02:01:27,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe this tradition works.

1206
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:45,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And on that point, I'd like to add, if other people agree, I know it's a process to go through MassDOT, but when you're developing a site that's on a MassDOT road, I feel like that often just comes with a process that you have to go through.

1207
02:01:46,964 --> 02:01:49,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And many cities and towns go through it all the time.

1208
02:01:51,086 --> 02:01:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that given that this is on a road

1209
02:01:54,897 --> 02:02:05,223
[SPEAKER_09]: a mass DOT owned road that needs work as far as pedestrian activity and crosswalks and potentially flashing beacons or whatnot.

1210
02:02:05,283 --> 02:02:08,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that process has to be done.

1211
02:02:09,686 --> 02:02:17,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a similar condition for the previously approved project that I think was further north on Mystic?

1212
02:02:20,473 --> 02:02:20,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So again,

1213
02:02:22,339 --> 02:02:23,880
[SPEAKER_00]: In what particular way?

1214
02:02:24,561 --> 02:02:29,885
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of like the pedestrian safety crosswalks.

1215
02:02:30,745 --> 02:02:35,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe the thing to do because Todd Blake provided.

1216
02:02:36,389 --> 02:02:37,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he did.

1217
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:40,693
[SPEAKER_11]: He provided us some mitigation efforts that clearly outlined what he would like to see.

1218
02:02:41,233 --> 02:02:43,695
[SPEAKER_11]: We're willing to comply with all that if you want to put that in there.

1219
02:02:44,155 --> 02:02:47,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe that's a way to lead the conversation that

1220
02:02:47,938 --> 02:02:54,401
[SPEAKER_00]: that Kyle and Brian, your team can kind of be responsive to, okay, here are the things that Todd Blake has recommended.

1221
02:02:54,882 --> 02:02:55,922
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things we're embracing.

1222
02:02:55,962 --> 02:03:00,905
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're going to try to get done if DOT approves, and now it's shown on the plan.

1223
02:03:00,925 --> 02:03:05,527
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing might clarify this quite a bit.

1224
02:03:06,608 --> 02:03:09,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he offered two paths, and one of them was the DOT.

1225
02:03:09,269 --> 02:03:14,792
[SPEAKER_11]: The other one was another mitigation effort that we said we would commit to, and we're fine with that, and we can put that in.

1226
02:03:15,784 --> 02:03:16,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but that's helpful.

1227
02:03:16,765 --> 02:03:20,127
[SPEAKER_11]: He made a suggestion, and that gives us clear direction on what he wants.

1228
02:03:20,428 --> 02:03:20,608
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

1229
02:03:21,569 --> 02:03:22,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the sense from George.

1230
02:03:22,769 --> 02:03:23,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, George, you're trying.

1231
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:27,513
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to understand how does someone get off a bus and get onto the site safely, right?

1232
02:03:28,414 --> 02:03:28,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1233
02:03:29,074 --> 02:03:31,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can outline that.

1234
02:03:31,536 --> 02:03:35,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1235
02:03:35,859 --> 02:03:37,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, one other comment that I had.

1236
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:41,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I know that you guys have a space that's kind of labeled as on area.

1237
02:03:42,224 --> 02:03:44,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's like it's kind of a

1238
02:03:47,056 --> 02:03:53,200
[SPEAKER_15]: landscape solution just to put turf places, and some of the evidence is showing that it's not super environmentally friendly.

1239
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,542
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've mentioned developing planting plans.

1240
02:03:57,682 --> 02:04:09,909
[SPEAKER_15]: So could we put in a condition for requiring a more cohesively developed planting plan?

1241
02:04:09,929 --> 02:04:10,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how to say that.

1242
02:04:11,399 --> 02:04:19,621
[SPEAKER_07]: incorporate like xeriscaping or non-grass turf, whether it's clover or something.

1243
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:24,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how specific we can get or would want to get.

1244
02:04:26,663 --> 02:04:31,585
[SPEAKER_11]: What about providing a landscape plan from an actual landscape architect?

1245
02:04:34,145 --> 02:04:39,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's pretty basic, but it outlines what you need from us, I think, without getting into the

1246
02:04:40,397 --> 02:04:41,198
[SPEAKER_11]: literal weeds.

1247
02:04:41,358 --> 02:04:50,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tie it back to section 6.4, wherever those requirements are?

1248
02:04:51,723 --> 02:05:06,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, one of the things that we as the permit granting authority is trying to back check section 6.4 that the documents that were received, we can confirm that performance criteria is actually being met by what's being presented.

1249
02:05:09,162 --> 02:05:14,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, make the landscape plan in accordance to 6.4 by a registered landscape architect.

1250
02:05:15,184 --> 02:05:15,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1251
02:05:16,765 --> 02:05:19,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in fairness it's 6.3 and 6.4.

1252
02:05:19,706 --> 02:05:21,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right, don't quote me.

1253
02:05:24,143 --> 02:05:25,944
[SPEAKER_06]: The appropriate ordinance.

1254
02:05:26,204 --> 02:05:27,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1255
02:05:27,884 --> 02:05:29,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1256
02:05:29,925 --> 02:05:43,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to add further hardship to this project or to that's for sure but one of the things that I want to go back to one of the residents had mentioned was noise and I saw that the Board of Health had mentioned, making sure that there was noise mitigation or something like that and

1257
02:05:43,748 --> 02:05:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know too much about materials and building materials, but I do know that steel makes noise and that I know aside from the structural integrity of like a prefab building so forth, you need lots of insulation.

1258
02:05:53,831 --> 02:06:04,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So does, I don't know if the proponent has, I'm sure you have all that information and how you'll have provide the proper installation for that building, but I don't want to make that a condition.

1259
02:06:04,733 --> 02:06:06,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to take that in mind of,

1260
02:06:07,421 --> 02:06:16,024
[SPEAKER_02]: of the very real thing that one of the city officials have put out there and that the residences are raising with that prefab material.

1261
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:22,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure that you're conforming to that letter so much as far as noise.

1262
02:06:23,588 --> 02:06:24,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, understood.

1263
02:06:24,968 --> 02:06:26,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what's helpful for us.

1264
02:06:26,309 --> 02:06:28,209
[SPEAKER_11]: As we mentioned, this is design build.

1265
02:06:28,249 --> 02:06:29,450
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have the opportunity.

1266
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:36,093
[SPEAKER_11]: We're providing our entire design build team, every letter provided from everybody so that everything is designed to meet within the standards.

1267
02:06:36,133 --> 02:06:36,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously there are

1268
02:06:37,413 --> 02:06:44,636
[SPEAKER_11]: some noise ordinance standards that are published from the city ordinances that we know about, and we're doing the best we can to comply with every single one of them.

1269
02:06:45,676 --> 02:06:56,941
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's definitely, we've acknowledged that we're hearing that, and we will be providing those letters to our design team to effectively manage it the best we possibly can.

1270
02:06:56,961 --> 02:06:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1271
02:06:59,002 --> 02:06:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1272
02:07:00,082 --> 02:07:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1273
02:07:01,063 --> 02:07:02,583
[SPEAKER_00]: George, did you have some more?

1274
02:07:02,603 --> 02:07:03,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we good?

1275
02:07:09,087 --> 02:07:09,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I'm good.

1276
02:07:10,688 --> 02:07:10,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1277
02:07:11,729 --> 02:07:15,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackie, did you want to continue with any other items to share?

1278
02:07:16,631 --> 02:07:18,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything is pretty much covered.

1279
02:07:19,313 --> 02:07:19,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1280
02:07:23,415 --> 02:07:24,916
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, other questions, comments?

1281
02:07:29,999 --> 02:07:36,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I had mentioned in the last meeting some sort of like mural

1282
02:07:37,323 --> 02:07:41,887
[SPEAKER_07]: on the, I believe it's the north side of the building, the same side as like your monumental entrance.

1283
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:52,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not see that in the, what is the document that we're looking at?

1284
02:07:52,636 --> 02:07:53,917
[SPEAKER_07]: The list of site plan updates.

1285
02:07:54,937 --> 02:08:04,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know not everybody loves murals, but I'd be interested in maybe some sort of like either or condition where

1286
02:08:04,727 --> 02:08:29,142
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, if you're not able to add additional windows or openings or fences, whatever you want to call it, to the side of the building, that there is, you know, some sort of, you know, some sort of like art component or I guess, yeah, I'm trying not to get into like into the bricks versus metal debate.

1287
02:08:31,429 --> 02:08:32,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

1288
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:34,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else on the board have any thoughts?

1289
02:08:35,211 --> 02:08:39,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we maybe just in terms of going on to Amanda's list.

1290
02:08:40,334 --> 02:08:54,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we first ask for a more developed rendering or more closer to final rendering it doesn't have to be the absolute final but beyond conceptual into more real.

1291
02:08:54,762 --> 02:09:04,969
[SPEAKER_00]: rendering of the building and one that would show us the type of details that you're interested in, Emily, you know, as opposed to maybe mandating that they put a mural on there.

1292
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:06,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1293
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:09,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a chance to see what the vision is.

1294
02:09:09,493 --> 02:09:10,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys might come up with something better.

1295
02:09:10,733 --> 02:09:12,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

1296
02:09:12,435 --> 02:09:23,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And would that be part of a condition where we ask them to come back and just update us rather than it being, like, that would not be an additional approval step.

1297
02:09:23,643 --> 02:09:24,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just be

1298
02:09:24,927 --> 02:09:26,228
[SPEAKER_07]: know, hey, let us know what you're doing.

1299
02:09:28,610 --> 02:09:31,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would think we're sort of making those up.

1300
02:09:31,452 --> 02:09:33,153
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what we're working towards, right?

1301
02:09:33,594 --> 02:09:44,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I think towards it, whether it's in one meeting, or it's a couple of meetings, or I think we have to hear from the proponent, like when they're ready to address enough things to make it worthwhile to talk about it.

1302
02:09:45,062 --> 02:09:50,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I think we should be reasonable, like one meeting, if we can fit all of it in is, is reasonable.

1303
02:09:50,907 --> 02:09:52,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, we don't want to

1304
02:09:54,276 --> 02:09:56,817
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, be, uh, don't want to be burdensome.

1305
02:09:57,537 --> 02:09:58,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on everyone.

1306
02:09:58,617 --> 02:09:58,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1307
02:09:58,917 --> 02:09:59,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1308
02:10:02,498 --> 02:10:03,398
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to add that.

1309
02:10:03,418 --> 02:10:18,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I always think it's a nice idea to, um Piggybacking on the mural idea to, um, potentially reach out to arts organizations to work with them on those kinds of things.

1310
02:10:18,922 --> 02:10:22,783
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that the dispensary had a similar, um,

1311
02:10:24,222 --> 02:10:25,924
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a similar discussion with them.

1312
02:10:27,225 --> 02:10:28,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to point something out, though.

1313
02:10:28,966 --> 02:10:31,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Finding a mural is super expensive.

1314
02:10:32,889 --> 02:10:40,956
[SPEAKER_13]: And the arts group actually has their own space in the dispensary.

1315
02:10:41,817 --> 02:10:43,999
[SPEAKER_13]: And they wanted the mural on the front.

1316
02:10:44,439 --> 02:10:50,785
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're still asking the marijuana company to pay the artist to design and do it.

1317
02:10:51,285 --> 02:10:58,968
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a pretty, like, I'm gonna say off the cuff, easily upwards of $10,000 to do something like that.

1318
02:10:58,988 --> 02:11:03,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I was gonna add, Alicia, that this was a suggestion.

1319
02:11:03,690 --> 02:11:04,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1320
02:11:05,191 --> 02:11:06,231
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not a condition.

1321
02:11:07,351 --> 02:11:09,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

1322
02:11:10,313 --> 02:11:16,435
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only strongly encouraged underneath the 6.4.8 aesthetic standards anyway.

1323
02:11:19,578 --> 02:11:20,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1324
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:29,221
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we had seen more of the actual, less conceptual, more actual, we probably have a better feel for Brian and Kyle, what your vision is.

1325
02:11:29,361 --> 02:11:32,322
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the absence of that, you know, we're going to ask those sorts of questions.

1326
02:11:35,543 --> 02:11:47,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to share with you that for building permits, they are required to provide elevations and material types sometimes, but they're not required to provide any kind of renderings.

1327
02:11:47,886 --> 02:11:52,747
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be something they're creating just for us, not for any other purpose.

1328
02:11:54,228 --> 02:11:57,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I would consider an elevation a rendering.

1329
02:11:58,048 --> 02:12:00,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not have to have real to life detail.

1330
02:12:00,809 --> 02:12:02,450
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have call outs that say this is,

1331
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is metal siding.

1332
02:12:06,058 --> 02:12:09,079
[SPEAKER_07]: This is material XYZ.

1333
02:12:09,099 --> 02:12:11,400
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, that's fine.

1334
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:15,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not asking for a Revit model or anything.

1335
02:12:18,282 --> 02:12:19,483
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you for that comment, Alicia.

1336
02:12:20,687 --> 02:12:25,989
[SPEAKER_13]: So I actually, our staff person who's on the zoning board, she's watching, but she's not on the Zoom.

1337
02:12:26,029 --> 02:12:38,092
[SPEAKER_13]: So some of her things that I'm remembering, she says that in Somerville, they often require material samples to be brought in to be approved, but they ask the staff in the office to approve those things.

1338
02:12:38,613 --> 02:12:40,773
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't bring it to a board meeting or anything.

1339
02:12:40,793 --> 02:12:43,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1340
02:12:43,294 --> 02:12:44,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily, do you have some more?

1341
02:12:46,275 --> 02:12:48,896
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just thinking back to your comment

1342
02:12:49,914 --> 02:12:51,635
[SPEAKER_07]: when we like set the stage for this meeting.

1343
02:12:54,036 --> 02:12:58,459
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody is like unofficially in attendance at this meeting, you know, is that okay?

1344
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:03,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, all of our meetings are broadcast on TV.

1345
02:13:03,621 --> 02:13:03,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1346
02:13:04,302 --> 02:13:09,564
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're always watched and we often allow people to email in us comments.

1347
02:13:09,864 --> 02:13:10,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

1348
02:13:10,525 --> 02:13:12,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes call in if necessary.

1349
02:13:12,486 --> 02:13:14,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure like we're not like no.

1350
02:13:15,227 --> 02:13:16,488
[SPEAKER_07]: We have big like.

1351
02:13:17,348 --> 02:13:18,309
[SPEAKER_07]: open meeting lines.

1352
02:13:18,449 --> 02:13:19,670
[SPEAKER_07]: These are on TV.

1353
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Somerville redevelopment board.

1354
02:13:21,731 --> 02:13:23,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make sure like we're okay.

1355
02:13:23,813 --> 02:13:23,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1356
02:13:24,173 --> 02:13:24,614
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

1357
02:13:24,874 --> 02:13:25,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1358
02:13:25,214 --> 02:13:25,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1359
02:13:26,175 --> 02:13:30,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're the you guys should know these are all on TV and sometimes they get replayed.

1360
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:35,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We get we get royalties.

1361
02:13:35,442 --> 02:13:35,882
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1362
02:13:37,863 --> 02:13:38,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1363
02:13:39,204 --> 02:13:39,765
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to know.

1364
02:13:43,462 --> 02:13:45,163
[SPEAKER_00]: have some more Emily or should I move to?

1365
02:13:45,723 --> 02:13:58,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I have a few things about like, like landscaping, but I think those will be answered, you know, prioritize native species, any plants that have, you know, a lower, you know, water requirement.

1366
02:14:00,051 --> 02:14:01,992
[SPEAKER_07]: You already mentioned the permeable pavers, that's great.

1367
02:14:05,594 --> 02:14:11,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I don't, I don't think we should condition

1368
02:14:12,065 --> 02:14:16,366
[SPEAKER_07]: the pole relocation, because that sounds like it's just kind of like a gamble.

1369
02:14:16,946 --> 02:14:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But I had that as a note, it's something that was mentioned, but I'm fine if we leave that off.

1370
02:14:21,928 --> 02:14:23,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That shouldn't hold up the project.

1371
02:14:24,349 --> 02:14:25,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, not their pole.

1372
02:14:26,109 --> 02:14:26,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1373
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:36,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Deanna, Christy, you don't have to, but just wanted to be fair.

1374
02:14:37,092 --> 02:14:37,853
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'm all set.

1375
02:14:40,968 --> 02:14:44,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know that these are great.

1376
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:45,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1377
02:14:47,912 --> 02:14:49,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at my list.

1378
02:14:51,353 --> 02:15:03,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys address project team Can you address the two way, the one way I know traffic circulation is a topic that we want to cover in more detail.

1379
02:15:06,081 --> 02:15:07,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't don't belabor it but

1380
02:15:08,893 --> 02:15:12,494
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two way traffic pattern, not the one way.

1381
02:15:13,294 --> 02:15:13,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?

1382
02:15:14,275 --> 02:15:14,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

1383
02:15:15,935 --> 02:15:16,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1384
02:15:17,736 --> 02:15:23,277
[SPEAKER_00]: And going one way would give you more room to do other things on the surface, right?

1385
02:15:25,758 --> 02:15:26,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps, yes.

1386
02:15:27,879 --> 02:15:34,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Biggest thing, biggest parameter we have to abide by is the fire department access and be able to turn around the fire truck.

1387
02:15:37,405 --> 02:15:40,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and then I was sort of wondering whether a loop would be a better idea.

1388
02:15:41,887 --> 02:15:43,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe even with angled parking.

1389
02:15:47,129 --> 02:15:50,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that is that something we can put on our list for you.

1390
02:15:50,850 --> 02:16:00,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And in further consideration of the circulation pattern that you keep that in those in mind, those pieces in mind as possibilities.

1391
02:16:02,811 --> 02:16:06,173
[SPEAKER_11]: We can explore that, sure, and talk with our engineers.

1392
02:16:07,994 --> 02:16:13,157
[SPEAKER_11]: If it improves our site, it improves, you know, and reduces our costs and all that stuff, certainly something.

1393
02:16:13,777 --> 02:16:17,119
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, as Brian said, we've been working on this for a while.

1394
02:16:17,139 --> 02:16:20,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, the engineers have been out several times and they proposed it this way.

1395
02:16:21,081 --> 02:16:25,464
[SPEAKER_11]: We saw it this way, but it's worth noting, I guess, you know, we can look into it.

1396
02:16:26,084 --> 02:16:26,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

1397
02:16:26,684 --> 02:16:27,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

1398
02:16:29,947 --> 02:16:35,688
[SPEAKER_00]: The building at the front corner that's currently there that's going to be correct.

1399
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:36,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1400
02:16:45,471 --> 02:16:51,032
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you were going to all the lighting would match the ordinance so I guess we don't need to hear about that as long as that's true.

1401
02:16:59,153 --> 02:17:13,666
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned in your presentation, Kyle you did the extension of kind of green space for landscaping down the on the south border of the building between the building and Atlas.

1402
02:17:15,348 --> 02:17:15,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there.

1403
02:17:15,768 --> 02:17:24,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, would you consider extending that more like is there a big cost involved into adding that green space just can you give me a flavor for what's going on over there.

1404
02:17:24,923 --> 02:17:28,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so we extended about 200 feet on the right sides, 15 foot wide.

1405
02:17:29,668 --> 02:17:39,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason for that specifically was I was trying to hit the performance standard, which is listed in 6.3 of the landscape city ordinances.

1406
02:17:39,297 --> 02:17:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was, you're supposed to have 10% of the surface area, landscape and open area.

1407
02:17:43,981 --> 02:17:47,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hit it with at least lawn and then additionally with the open area

1408
02:17:48,065 --> 02:17:49,986
[SPEAKER_11]: patio if that was not to be concluded.

1409
02:17:51,687 --> 02:17:54,449
[SPEAKER_11]: But to answer your question why it doesn't go all the way back.

1410
02:17:54,789 --> 02:17:57,270
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just more, it's likely not going to get any sun.

1411
02:17:58,531 --> 02:18:08,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the asphalt on the backside there should, the biggest thing we've learned from the fire department is they need 360 access so they need to be able to park their truck and run all their equipment and everything back.

1412
02:18:08,537 --> 02:18:11,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't necessarily want to give them all lawn to have to do that.

1413
02:18:12,939 --> 02:18:19,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So we extended it as far back as we thought the eye could see, essentially, and then turn it into the asphalt towards the back of the building.

1414
02:18:20,304 --> 02:18:22,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and is this in condition as asphalt?

1415
02:18:24,586 --> 02:18:25,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is, yeah.

1416
02:18:25,506 --> 02:18:28,668
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole parking lot is asphalt, correct.

1417
02:18:28,768 --> 02:18:31,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're always trying to avoid asphalt if we can on the board here.

1418
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:32,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1419
02:18:33,071 --> 02:18:40,835
[SPEAKER_00]: The dumpster location, and I'm relying on kind of the color updated plan, but I didn't... Back by the loading bays there.

1420
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:43,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

1421
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:45,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm not recognized.

1422
02:18:45,890 --> 02:18:47,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it looked like a car with an X through it.

1423
02:18:47,632 --> 02:18:48,313
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the dumpster?

1424
02:18:49,093 --> 02:18:51,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, that's a car parked at that location.

1425
02:18:52,756 --> 02:18:54,258
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a dumpster back there, yeah.

1426
02:18:55,158 --> 02:18:55,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1427
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:57,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1428
02:19:00,003 --> 02:19:04,707
[SPEAKER_00]: The vehicle charging station's conduits there, is there electrical or?

1429
02:19:05,595 --> 02:19:07,676
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be electrical service provided.

1430
02:19:07,836 --> 02:19:10,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, they don't really let you liven it up.

1431
02:19:10,397 --> 02:19:11,817
[SPEAKER_11]: They just let you run the conduit.

1432
02:19:12,877 --> 02:19:16,799
[SPEAKER_11]: You would have, you know, the conduit coming up within our mechanical room somewhere.

1433
02:19:16,819 --> 02:19:21,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, should we get to the stage of installing chargers, everything is laid in place.

1434
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:22,861
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to dig up the asphalt.

1435
02:19:22,901 --> 02:19:25,202
[SPEAKER_11]: You just sneak the wire across and plug in the charger.

1436
02:19:25,942 --> 02:19:26,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1437
02:19:27,975 --> 02:19:32,899
[SPEAKER_00]: The way our ordinance is written it's, it's a little, it's a little fuzzy on that.

1438
02:19:33,379 --> 02:19:46,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder, and maybe there's something to think about and when you come back you can you can mention but, you know, is there a willingness by the applicant to make some sort of commitment.

1439
02:19:47,832 --> 02:19:50,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Within one year, we'll have X number of EV spots.

1440
02:19:51,097 --> 02:19:52,679
[SPEAKER_00]: Within two years, we'll have this many.

1441
02:19:53,841 --> 02:19:58,569
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of a thing, I think, would be well-received if we're not going to have them on day one.

1442
02:20:02,828 --> 02:20:09,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we talked a couple of times with Alicia, because I needed some clarity on that.

1443
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see any specific ordinances.

1444
02:20:12,631 --> 02:20:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought that the best solution would be provided, suggested by her, which I thought was great, was at least run conduit until we determine what that needs to be.

1445
02:20:21,474 --> 02:20:22,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

1446
02:20:22,395 --> 02:20:25,596
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was my solution for it for now.

1447
02:20:25,936 --> 02:20:27,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1448
02:20:27,296 --> 02:20:31,038
[SPEAKER_10]: David, I've actually talked to the state about some grant programs as well.

1449
02:20:31,338 --> 02:20:31,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1450
02:20:32,188 --> 02:20:34,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're willing to pick up the tab on a lot of this.

1451
02:20:34,189 --> 02:20:35,789
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely open to that.

1452
02:20:36,549 --> 02:20:36,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1453
02:20:37,229 --> 02:20:37,509
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1454
02:20:37,549 --> 02:20:40,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you'll have some more thoughts you can share with us when we get back together.

1455
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:41,490
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

1456
02:20:42,491 --> 02:20:44,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really a condition, but just something I'd like to hear about.

1457
02:20:45,031 --> 02:20:45,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1458
02:20:45,591 --> 02:20:49,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like in item 10 on the existing list.

1459
02:20:51,173 --> 02:20:51,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1460
02:20:51,753 --> 02:20:59,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Already kind of accounted for if we turn that into a condition or leave it as is.

1461
02:21:02,347 --> 02:21:05,349
[SPEAKER_07]: include provisions for, I don't know, I can go either way.

1462
02:21:11,473 --> 02:21:27,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like they've probably hit the ordinance, but if we can hear more, if they can have a plan for improving and leading to actual spaces, that would be great.

1463
02:21:28,877 --> 02:21:33,480
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your, your customers are going to want it, I think you're going to want it for marketing purposes if nothing else, I think.

1464
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah we agree.

1465
02:21:34,761 --> 02:21:36,342
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your demographic you know.

1466
02:21:36,922 --> 02:21:38,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna be good for business.

1467
02:21:39,624 --> 02:21:53,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just give you the aside that I'm the economic development planner in our office Yvette is doing a lot of the parking stuff for our public spaces and working with the grant program so she's happy to share what she knows.

1468
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:19,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess the other pieces are customary for us to almost always condition our acceptance on compliance with the department letters.

1469
02:22:21,501 --> 02:22:25,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Board of Health, I imagine it's pretty innocuous stuff.

1470
02:22:26,305 --> 02:22:31,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire department seemed pretty innocuous, although the traveling you can address with us.

1471
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:35,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Was engineering was not problematic for you?

1472
02:22:36,198 --> 02:22:41,727
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they actually been working with Eagle Brook, our civil engineering team on the stormwater management design.

1473
02:22:42,829 --> 02:22:51,141
[SPEAKER_11]: They've seen this already and are privy to it, but no, their standards are pretty normal stormwater management, all stuff that gets flushed out in permitting.

1474
02:22:51,782 --> 02:22:58,146
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're allowed to demolish the existing building actually we have to put in, we have to get a stormwater management plan and permits.

1475
02:22:58,787 --> 02:22:59,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

1476
02:22:59,267 --> 02:22:59,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1477
02:23:00,108 --> 02:23:00,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1478
02:23:01,209 --> 02:23:05,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And then traffic I feel like we've already asked you to respond to that separately.

1479
02:23:06,512 --> 02:23:07,993
[SPEAKER_00]: When we reconvene on that so.

1480
02:23:10,633 --> 02:23:19,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at the very least, you know, in the next plan, we can provide what the traffic department had suggested as the mitigating efforts.

1481
02:23:19,618 --> 02:23:21,880
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we can list those out and put them on the plan.

1482
02:23:28,464 --> 02:23:31,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar is solar required, given the size of the building?

1483
02:23:32,866 --> 02:23:33,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Solar ready?

1484
02:23:36,895 --> 02:23:41,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe I've actually discussed that with the applicant and they are planning to put solar on the building.

1485
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,021
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

1486
02:23:44,622 --> 02:23:46,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that it is required.

1487
02:23:46,984 --> 02:23:48,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Solar requirement, yes.

1488
02:23:48,145 --> 02:24:01,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, the solar ordinance was designed to match anything that was required to go through site plan review was other than the smallest apartments, we're gonna need solar.

1489
02:24:02,659 --> 02:24:02,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1490
02:24:03,486 --> 02:24:12,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And the requirement is that they have to have the study done, they have to show us if they think that they can't put solar on, they have to show us why not.

1491
02:24:13,073 --> 02:24:14,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, they just have to move forward with it.

1492
02:24:16,957 --> 02:24:18,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and where does that condition rear its head then?

1493
02:24:19,058 --> 02:24:22,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that are we talking building permit or should this be something on our list to talk about?

1494
02:24:27,303 --> 02:24:37,308
[SPEAKER_13]: We've really figured out how that fits I don't remember where and it got moved from the building permit section of Medford ordinances to zoning during the recodification.

1495
02:24:37,328 --> 02:24:50,434
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have to admit I don't remember where in here, they stuck it was not in zoning prior to the recodification, but it was a building permit requirements so the building department looks at it.

1496
02:24:50,454 --> 02:24:52,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1497
02:24:52,315 --> 02:24:54,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Amanda's known, I think would suffice for now right.

1498
02:25:11,663 --> 02:25:14,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions or comments.

1499
02:25:18,726 --> 02:25:22,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kyle any last last minute input you want to share.

1500
02:25:23,488 --> 02:25:24,549
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is super helpful.

1501
02:25:26,146 --> 02:25:28,066
[SPEAKER_11]: some roundabout way what we were trying to get to.

1502
02:25:29,287 --> 02:25:33,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate all the board's time they took tonight to help lay these things out with us.

1503
02:25:35,928 --> 02:25:36,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1504
02:25:37,468 --> 02:25:38,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.

1505
02:25:40,009 --> 02:25:50,231
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we got here in a roundabout way, admittedly, but I was trying to make sure we knew what the next steps were going to be and make sure they were productive for everybody.

1506
02:25:51,011 --> 02:25:54,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's what we're headed toward here.

1507
02:25:55,525 --> 02:25:58,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a condition for them to come back?

1508
02:25:59,767 --> 02:26:01,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, do we want that?

1509
02:26:03,028 --> 02:26:03,969
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have it here.

1510
02:26:05,389 --> 02:26:06,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that's this, okay.

1511
02:26:08,211 --> 02:26:12,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We can, if there's a better way to wear this, I'm definitely all ears.

1512
02:26:12,072 --> 02:26:14,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I was just sort of shooting at the hip.

1513
02:26:15,394 --> 02:26:17,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

1514
02:26:18,055 --> 02:26:24,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want it to be with us or is the reassessment by another body?

1515
02:26:26,195 --> 02:26:27,455
[SPEAKER_07]: or is it just by city staff?

1516
02:26:30,056 --> 02:26:31,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need to even specify?

1517
02:26:31,737 --> 02:26:55,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that maybe we lead into 16, Amanda, is it okay to just sort of have this be all encompassing and say conditions that the applicant or proponent return

1518
02:26:59,455 --> 02:27:15,075
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss and share with the board information on the following for the board's approval.

1519
02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:38,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that language mean that we have denial?

1520
02:27:38,302 --> 02:27:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think that's what we were trying to avoid.

1521
02:27:40,303 --> 02:27:41,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's my concern.

1522
02:27:42,445 --> 02:27:42,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1523
02:27:44,066 --> 02:27:52,211
[SPEAKER_13]: You could say for board's approval before staff sign the building permit application.

1524
02:27:52,231 --> 02:27:57,155
[SPEAKER_03]: For prior to building permit.

1525
02:27:57,749 --> 02:28:11,143
[SPEAKER_13]: prior to building permit issuance, which is the same as saying you can't issue the building permit until we review these things, which is what you would do anyway.

1526
02:28:32,743 --> 02:28:46,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So A would be like, Amanda, maybe A is like evaluate and reassess and report to the board.

1527
02:28:52,333 --> 02:28:57,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1528
02:28:58,195 --> 02:29:01,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Certified experts is that,

1529
02:29:02,247 --> 02:29:09,953
[SPEAKER_07]: reasonable for us to ask, like, like people that hold like licensure and their, their field?

1530
02:29:10,033 --> 02:29:11,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you mean by that?

1531
02:29:11,975 --> 02:29:15,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be professional advisors professional?

1532
02:29:26,346 --> 02:29:28,347
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see professional designers and engineers.

1533
02:29:28,787 --> 02:29:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, I would just, I would put that, gotta be careful with the licensure or PE designation.

1534
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:34,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1535
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:36,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It does that.

1536
02:29:42,574 --> 02:29:47,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And this probably should be including, because I don't think we mean just those two Romanets.

1537
02:29:48,817 --> 02:29:49,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1538
02:29:50,297 --> 02:29:51,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I repeat that one more time?

1539
02:29:52,119 --> 02:29:58,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I think after engineers, you want to say comment, including because I think we'd like to hear about the full circulation plan.

1540
02:29:59,406 --> 02:30:01,307
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are two particular.

1541
02:30:01,668 --> 02:30:10,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1542
02:30:10,616 --> 02:30:11,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So demonstrate.

1543
02:30:11,637 --> 02:30:12,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you got that.

1544
02:30:29,057 --> 02:30:35,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you get rid of rendering and provide detailed elevations of proposed building?

1545
02:30:36,563 --> 02:30:38,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Illustrations is fine too.

1546
02:30:38,325 --> 02:30:47,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And elevation is just as broad as possible that capture the information that we want to learn about.

1547
02:30:53,017 --> 02:30:53,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Drawings.

1548
02:31:00,667 --> 02:31:01,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1549
02:31:01,167 --> 02:31:06,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying drawings could be another word for illustrations if we want to be even looser.

1550
02:31:06,149 --> 02:31:08,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1551
02:31:08,229 --> 02:31:08,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Exhibits.

1552
02:31:08,769 --> 02:31:08,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1553
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:12,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And Klaus, you're probably the expert here.

1554
02:31:14,051 --> 02:31:15,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say exhibits.

1555
02:31:15,952 --> 02:31:16,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1556
02:31:20,053 --> 02:31:25,335
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that if at some point, Kyle, you're welcome to run things by us.

1557
02:31:25,355 --> 02:31:29,476
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're not sure if this meets it, I might say to Klaus,

1558
02:31:30,838 --> 02:31:33,721
[SPEAKER_13]: is this enough detail for you, right?

1559
02:31:35,282 --> 02:31:42,388
[SPEAKER_13]: And then on something else, I might ask David, is this enough, or Emily, does this one have the level of detail you're looking for?

1560
02:31:42,788 --> 02:31:51,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we are using looser language to allow for some flexibility, but I'd really hate for them to come back and you say, well, that's not enough detail.

1561
02:31:52,876 --> 02:31:55,959
[SPEAKER_13]: We can middleman some of the checking stuff,

1562
02:31:59,789 --> 02:32:01,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I would welcome that process.

1563
02:32:01,809 --> 02:32:08,051
[SPEAKER_11]: It's obviously various steps in the design build process.

1564
02:32:08,071 --> 02:32:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll give many iterations of this thing.

1565
02:32:10,571 --> 02:32:18,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And the more I could stay on top of it and engage you guys, you can help me understand exactly what you might need for more detail.

1566
02:32:18,713 --> 02:32:25,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I can put it on the onus of the landscape architect and the engineer to provide that, so that we're not wasting your time for these meetings.

1567
02:32:26,995 --> 02:32:28,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Amanda, I've got one more for you.

1568
02:32:29,015 --> 02:32:29,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1569
02:32:31,596 --> 02:32:34,337
[SPEAKER_00]: on E, 17E.

1570
02:32:34,357 --> 02:32:39,778
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stop it at fire.

1571
02:32:40,458 --> 02:32:46,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think, see, I think traffic is different because traffic, I think Todd Blake has put out these alternatives.

1572
02:32:46,699 --> 02:33:00,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd like them to let us know which, I'd like them to work with Todd Blake and determine which mitigation steps will be taken.

1573
02:33:08,981 --> 02:33:10,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to make up new ones necessarily.

1574
02:33:10,864 --> 02:33:21,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want the project team and Todd to actually talk through it and come up with a plan that they can tell us, hey, this is what we've decided to do.

1575
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:22,281
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be ideal.

1576
02:33:23,497 --> 02:33:27,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he kind of gave that or at least some guidance in his letter.

1577
02:33:27,239 --> 02:33:28,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, it's pretty detailed.

1578
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:31,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, yes, he offered two paths of solution.

1579
02:33:31,081 --> 02:33:36,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think our engineers can, you know, final contact him and say, what do you think about this?

1580
02:33:36,363 --> 02:33:40,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this, you know, we tried to work with what you provided us in context.

1581
02:33:40,665 --> 02:33:44,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he gives it his blessing, maybe he can provide a letter of support.

1582
02:33:45,308 --> 02:33:48,409
[SPEAKER_09]: The way I read his letter, though, isn't that it's two paths.

1583
02:33:48,529 --> 02:33:51,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like to try to do the mass DOT thing.

1584
02:33:51,831 --> 02:33:52,291
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that

1585
02:33:52,784 --> 02:33:55,526
[SPEAKER_09]: if they do not accept it, then the other path is acceptable.

1586
02:33:55,546 --> 02:33:57,928
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think going through that process is.

1587
02:33:58,028 --> 02:34:00,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and we're committed to that.

1588
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:02,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly will do that.

1589
02:34:02,131 --> 02:34:09,477
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just becomes at what point, and I'll do it to whatever satisfaction Director Blake feels appropriate.

1590
02:34:10,378 --> 02:34:15,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know from experience with dealing with them in the past, but that's all.

1591
02:34:36,352 --> 02:34:38,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, any last minute thoughts?

1592
02:34:42,434 --> 02:34:45,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're looking to wrap this up with an approval subject to conditions.

1593
02:34:49,636 --> 02:34:50,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda, I think you were.

1594
02:34:50,836 --> 02:34:52,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, that's great.

1595
02:34:53,477 --> 02:34:54,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, perfect.

1596
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:18,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that fair?

1597
02:35:27,257 --> 02:35:31,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we throw an at least in front of the 9.5 in 1C?

1598
02:35:31,581 --> 02:35:40,869
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in case you guys decide to do 10, then we don't have to do anything weird.

1599
02:35:44,309 --> 02:35:46,229
[SPEAKER_07]: but you can do five and that's fine.

1600
02:35:47,070 --> 02:35:48,050
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you do more.

1601
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:55,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the only, so the sidewalk design right now is five foot.

1602
02:35:55,572 --> 02:35:56,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the minimum is four and a half.

1603
02:35:57,452 --> 02:36:01,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So the sidewalk is five, which leaves us nine and a half with a six inch curb.

1604
02:36:01,633 --> 02:36:02,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, sure.

1605
02:36:02,753 --> 02:36:07,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless the sidewalk gets increased and more, but I still think we can make it work.

1606
02:36:07,814 --> 02:36:13,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to make sure that this language does not make it so that we have to

1607
02:36:14,994 --> 02:36:21,860
[SPEAKER_07]: like, do something weird, because you decided to do something slightly different.

1608
02:36:22,581 --> 02:36:25,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so Emily's trying to put as much flexibility into this.

1609
02:36:25,824 --> 02:36:35,713
[SPEAKER_13]: When you say to provide a number, then you have to provide that number, say at least the number, then you have flexibility at that point.

1610
02:36:35,773 --> 02:36:41,558
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we're sort of looking at in a couple of different police places here is just so that

1611
02:36:42,011 --> 02:36:42,891
[SPEAKER_13]: you're not held.

1612
02:36:43,351 --> 02:36:46,492
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you can't do more without getting a change from us.

1613
02:36:48,413 --> 02:36:54,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will I actually just wanted to share with the board that I thought that the sidewalk in front should be larger.

1614
02:36:54,295 --> 02:36:56,496
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had discussed that here.

1615
02:36:57,136 --> 02:37:00,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually Todd came back our director of traffic

1616
02:37:00,681 --> 02:37:16,588
[SPEAKER_13]: and said that it would actually be his preference that they keep it at the same as the rest of the road, and that if in fact DOT decided to change the widths of the sidewalk in this area, they would do that by taking up asphalt.

1617
02:37:17,328 --> 02:37:20,370
[SPEAKER_13]: And they would do that as a complete streets project.

1618
02:37:20,910 --> 02:37:27,873
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we just increase the width of the sidewalk in front of one property, it would look, it would just be weird for a long time.

1619
02:37:27,893 --> 02:37:37,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to share that because I know that there was some like we most of the comments about five foot width was on the property, but it does match what's up the street.

1620
02:37:38,699 --> 02:37:42,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And so there, you know, it's, it's a weird situation.

1621
02:37:43,461 --> 02:37:48,943
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd also love to see this be more walkable, but the reality is the neighborhood isn't yet.

1622
02:37:50,643 --> 02:37:54,024
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a weird line to walk.

1623
02:37:54,605 --> 02:38:01,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you try to make one property more walkable, inviting people to walk through an area that's very dangerous?

1624
02:38:03,727 --> 02:38:04,868
[SPEAKER_13]: It's tough, right?

1625
02:38:04,888 --> 02:38:06,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Because well, if not, where do you start?

1626
02:38:07,188 --> 02:38:07,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1627
02:38:10,489 --> 02:38:12,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I do think though, Alicia, that

1628
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:27,251
[SPEAKER_16]: people will come from the neighborhoods across the street and use the crosswalk or maybe cross a block down and then walk along Mystic for a block or whatever, you know, that will happen happily.

1629
02:38:28,252 --> 02:38:29,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we actually do.

1630
02:38:29,493 --> 02:38:30,994
[SPEAKER_13]: We agree with that.

1631
02:38:31,174 --> 02:38:32,335
[SPEAKER_13]: It's right.

1632
02:38:33,396 --> 02:38:39,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So and in fact, the neighbor in fact mentioned it sounds like she crosses the street at that point, perhaps to take that bus.

1633
02:38:40,362 --> 02:38:40,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1634
02:38:41,378 --> 02:38:45,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do want that to be as comfortable as we can at that area.

1635
02:38:45,762 --> 02:38:46,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

1636
02:38:53,187 --> 02:38:59,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we strike the forefoot in M1M and just say appropriate barrier slash fencing?

1637
02:39:18,783 --> 02:39:18,983
[SPEAKER_05]: folks.

1638
02:39:19,003 --> 02:39:20,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know if I need to scroll.

1639
02:39:20,624 --> 02:39:22,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you can't see the full list.

1640
02:39:24,667 --> 02:39:25,828
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really great work, Amanda.

1641
02:39:25,948 --> 02:39:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1642
02:39:27,309 --> 02:39:27,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

1643
02:39:34,053 --> 02:39:36,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready to entertain a motion item G is

1644
02:39:49,448 --> 02:39:50,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's sort of what I expected.

1645
02:39:50,649 --> 02:39:53,991
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we'd see something that to the on the north edge.

1646
02:39:54,012 --> 02:39:57,494
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I'm not advocating for changing that, but.

1647
02:40:06,481 --> 02:40:11,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that would be worthy of asking Kyle because that was actually something that he included in his items.

1648
02:40:11,365 --> 02:40:12,445
[SPEAKER_13]: What they meant by that?

1649
02:40:14,585 --> 02:40:21,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so this list, basically A through O was all generated by me based on the last preliminary hearing we had.

1650
02:40:21,508 --> 02:40:31,813
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just gathered your notes and I did meet with Brian and we talked about it and his preference was not to have a landscape buffer on that side, given that they own that section of property as well.

1651
02:40:31,893 --> 02:40:39,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we just included it on the front side, on the side facing the building.

1652
02:40:41,077 --> 02:40:42,538
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was the context behind that.

1653
02:40:46,395 --> 02:40:53,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I would definitely encourage you to look at the whole width across the driveway and in the parking and think about.

1654
02:40:54,442 --> 02:41:04,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as long as we can meet the, I know the parking standards were already, so they require, I think, what was it, 19 feet in the depth, and I think we're 18.

1655
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:11,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So the traffic already called that out, but said it was permissible and acceptable by his interpretation.

1656
02:41:12,605 --> 02:41:17,029
[SPEAKER_11]: If we put a landscape buffer in there, we would shrink those parking spots, I believe.

1657
02:41:17,129 --> 02:41:19,271
[SPEAKER_11]: But worth noting, and if we can do it.

1658
02:41:19,691 --> 02:41:26,337
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you did angled spots on a one-way road, you could get another five feet out of that section, probably.

1659
02:41:26,357 --> 02:41:32,822
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I honestly don't think it needs to be seven along the fence, but you know.

1660
02:41:35,042 --> 02:41:48,185
[SPEAKER_16]: The other way to address that would be to just take out three or four spaces and make them ground and add some trees.

1661
02:41:48,625 --> 02:41:56,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's another way to sort of create a... Just some ideas.

1662
02:42:00,786 --> 02:42:12,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess with what you just raised, Klaus, do we still feel like it makes sense to include this in there since, actually, it's not wrapping all the way around?

1663
02:42:12,752 --> 02:42:19,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, in addition, you had mentioned, does it make sense to have seven feet of landscape buffer in all areas?

1664
02:42:19,135 --> 02:42:24,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, maybe we can just say include a landscape buffer.

1665
02:42:30,084 --> 02:42:31,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, that's good.

1666
02:42:31,485 --> 02:42:34,668
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's real good.

1667
02:42:36,509 --> 02:42:38,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean, it leaves it up to your interpretation.

1668
02:42:38,591 --> 02:42:40,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you've heard what we, what our preference is.

1669
02:42:40,813 --> 02:42:55,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're ready to entertain a motion, potentially approval subject to these conditions.

1670
02:43:05,357 --> 02:43:05,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be shy.

1671
02:43:12,578 --> 02:43:12,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

1672
02:43:17,639 --> 02:43:29,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be a motion to accept the site to accept the site plan, subject to the following conditions reflected in items number one and two.

1673
02:43:32,239 --> 02:43:40,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they'll be attached to our decision or something like that, but with the proper reference items one and two on our working page.

1674
02:43:43,708 --> 02:43:46,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody else wants, they can say so moved.

1675
02:43:46,711 --> 02:43:49,673
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to reconstitute what he says.

1676
02:43:51,174 --> 02:43:53,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved, this is Jackie, vice chair.

1677
02:43:53,656 --> 02:43:54,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a second?

1678
02:43:55,878 --> 02:43:56,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second.

1679
02:43:57,800 --> 02:43:58,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

1680
02:43:58,580 --> 02:43:59,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to our roll call vote.

1681
02:44:00,755 --> 02:44:02,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice Chair Jackie for title.

1682
02:44:03,416 --> 02:44:03,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1683
02:44:05,156 --> 02:44:05,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1684
02:44:05,456 --> 02:44:05,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1685
02:44:05,656 --> 02:44:05,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1686
02:44:06,417 --> 02:44:06,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1687
02:44:34,517 --> 02:44:35,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay well I'm, I'm an eye.

1688
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:38,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have enough votes.

1689
02:44:42,164 --> 02:44:46,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Kyle and Brian, thank you very much.

1690
02:44:46,749 --> 02:44:56,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, by way of some twists and turns we've come to something that will allow you to move forward with your project and balances the board's interests at the same time.

1691
02:44:58,625 --> 02:45:17,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the city staff will be in touch with you in terms of scheduling and I don't think we want to rush you to something I think we want, ideally for you to come back one time to address open items and early enough to make a difference but not too late to cost you anything more than you need to face.

1692
02:45:19,251 --> 02:45:20,071
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate that.

1693
02:45:20,392 --> 02:45:24,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Sincerely, I know this was a process, unique circumstances in this

1694
02:45:25,662 --> 02:45:29,104
[SPEAKER_11]: particular case and we appreciate all your time and consideration.

1695
02:45:30,085 --> 02:45:39,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the board sports always been supportive and really want you guys to succeed and want want this thing to get off the ground so thank you.

1696
02:45:40,191 --> 02:45:40,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1697
02:45:40,731 --> 02:45:50,837
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have one more item on our agenda and that's the approval of minutes from October 12.

1698
02:45:54,215 --> 02:46:02,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a few changes, minor, but Amanda updated the minutes today, yesterday, Amanda, I can't remember.

1699
02:46:02,180 --> 02:46:05,122
[SPEAKER_12]: No worries, yeah, I don't remember either.

1700
02:46:05,142 --> 02:46:07,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I put them in the folder today.

1701
02:46:08,384 --> 02:46:10,425
[SPEAKER_12]: They have highlighted changes in yellow.

1702
02:46:10,765 --> 02:46:12,126
[SPEAKER_12]: They were just kind of a handful.

1703
02:46:14,188 --> 02:46:17,089
[SPEAKER_00]: If folks are so inclined to go for it, fine.

1704
02:46:17,169 --> 02:46:22,473
[SPEAKER_00]: If folks would like to call a timeout and put this off to the next meeting, that's fine as well.

1705
02:46:24,775 --> 02:46:29,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just one tiny change, and that was the name of the agency that I work for.

1706
02:46:29,416 --> 02:46:30,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's executive housing.

1707
02:46:30,996 --> 02:46:33,937
[SPEAKER_02]: You have policy right now, but it's housing.

1708
02:46:34,377 --> 02:46:47,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons why I had to, I recused myself is because although that project is partly federal funding, I was a little bit confused, not confused, but it wasn't clear if I was able to even vote on it.

1709
02:46:48,356 --> 02:46:54,398
[SPEAKER_02]: even though the proponent actually clarify, you don't need to put all that in me, just change the word from policy to housing.

1710
02:46:54,458 --> 02:46:55,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1711
02:46:55,559 --> 02:46:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jackie.

1712
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:00,981
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you being conservative on that kind of a topic.

1713
02:47:02,401 --> 02:47:03,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely doing the right thing.

1714
02:47:04,322 --> 02:47:04,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1715
02:47:06,163 --> 02:47:09,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll make that clarification on Jackie's information.

1716
02:47:09,324 --> 02:47:14,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any other comments on the minutes or is does somebody want more time to review them?

1717
02:47:15,366 --> 02:47:17,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, is there a motion to approve them?

1718
02:47:19,576 --> 02:47:23,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make a motion to approve them.

1719
02:47:25,041 --> 02:47:25,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

1720
02:47:26,643 --> 02:47:30,126

[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

1732
02:47:53,157 --> 02:47:53,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

1733
02:47:53,777 --> 02:47:54,197
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

1734
02:47:54,217 --> 02:47:54,977
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enough votes.

1735
02:47:55,357 --> 02:47:56,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a yes as well.

1736
02:48:00,139 --> 02:48:01,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other updates?

1737
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:04,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we good?

1738
02:48:05,461 --> 02:48:06,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia?

1739
02:48:06,661 --> 02:48:07,081
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good.

1740
02:48:07,442 --> 02:48:08,442
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very tired tonight.

1741
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:18,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I just, um, if you guys family saw city council last night I feel like I've talked to you about this before that we've had an open planner position in our office for a long time.

1742
02:48:18,929 --> 02:48:27,197
[SPEAKER_13]: So at city council last night, there was some movement on that we are reclassifying it as a senior planner position.

1743
02:48:28,353 --> 02:48:34,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and after a lot of noise, uh, they voted somewhat for it.

1744
02:48:34,596 --> 02:48:37,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they voted, they approved the position for its first reading.

1745
02:48:37,737 --> 02:48:42,399
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be advertised and then they'll vote again on the 15th.

1746
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:44,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were actually thrilled.

1747
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:48,682
[SPEAKER_13]: We got five out of seven votes in favor, which was one more than we expected.

1748
02:48:49,683 --> 02:48:52,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and so that looks like that's moving forward.

1749
02:48:53,065 --> 02:48:57,767
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a draft housing planner position that we have forwarded to HR for review.

1750
02:48:57,787 --> 02:49:00,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we'll be posting that very soon.

1751
02:49:00,869 --> 02:49:10,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then after the 15th, when we believe that the city council will finish voting, they need to vote on the appropriation paper and the calf change.

1752
02:49:11,134 --> 02:49:14,856
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have the senior planner position and then we'll also be posting.

1753
02:49:15,196 --> 02:49:16,977
[SPEAKER_13]: So we also have a, so we'll have three

1754
02:49:17,967 --> 02:49:27,832
[SPEAKER_13]: full-time position CPA housing and senior planner, where right now we have a part-time CPA in housing and we have an unfilled planner position.

1755
02:49:29,933 --> 02:49:35,636
[SPEAKER_13]: It was all on TV last night, so I thought y'all should know.

1756
02:49:35,856 --> 02:49:40,419
[SPEAKER_13]: The senior planner would end up staffing this board and working closely with this board.

1757
02:49:43,881 --> 02:49:45,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we always have mixed feelings when we hear that because we

1758
02:49:47,255 --> 02:49:48,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so fond of Amanda.

1759
02:49:49,476 --> 02:49:50,716
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of you.

1760
02:49:52,997 --> 02:49:53,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't say that one enough.

1761
02:49:53,957 --> 02:49:54,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1762
02:49:55,818 --> 02:49:57,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn?

1763
02:49:58,618 --> 02:49:59,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1764
02:49:59,459 --> 02:50:02,960
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one, I think this- Don't rush.

1765
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:04,140
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a second.

1766
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:05,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a second.

[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second Clay's motion.

[SPEAKER_16]: I got a burrito waiting for me.
