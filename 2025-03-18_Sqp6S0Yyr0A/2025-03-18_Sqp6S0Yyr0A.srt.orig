[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's one accomplishment that I'm proud of.

[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank Mr. Knight and Mr. Mack for putting this on the agenda tonight.

[SPEAKER_06]: food.

43
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:42,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, here, here's a gentleman that, uh, served this community with distinction for many, many years, was unselfish and gave of his time, uh, no matter what it took.

44
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:49,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, the one thing he said to me that stuck with me is I asked him why he got involved with, uh, Hormel.

45
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:55,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anyone realizes Hormel back some years ago, uh, wasn't the type of field you want to play on.

46
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, there were rocks coming through the, uh, the field itself.

47
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:03,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, um, you know, teams didn't want to even venture on the field.

48
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:13,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, Cosmo, what really caught me, uh, stated his one goal was to make sure there was a field within our community that we can be, first of all, proud of.

49
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:18,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And secondly, a field that would be safe for our students to play on.

50
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm proud to say because of his dedication, uh, and commitment, uh, that was accomplished.

51
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:31,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am so proud to call, as well as Consul Knight, Cosmo, our friend.

52
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish him well, and I'm sure we'll see you around, Cosmo.

53
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,869
How long have you been here?

54
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:09,789
30 years.

55
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,129

Would you like to say anything more?

59
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,012
I'm going to frown like a baseball.

60
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,872
You got a soldier?

61
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,632
I think we can.

62
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:21,633
Are we tracking him?

63
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:38,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone, one, two.

00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,499

00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:24,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, I've got a bunch of people here that have done some great work for this community.

79
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:35,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I was here not too long ago with another group of people who donated some time and services to the city of Medford and another veteran's family.

[SPEAKER_08]: And it's my pleasure, again tonight, to introduce some people here.

[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna introduce some people tonight who've done a great job and there's some people here that aren't here tonight who have also done a lot of work.

85
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,403
[SPEAKER_08]: About five years ago, when I first came on the council, President Mayorkas said to me one night, I'm gonna make you the Veterans Subcommittee Chairman.

86
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:07,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I says, I'm not a veteran, I don't know anything about veterans things.

87
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,246
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, oh trust me, he says, you can do it, you'll do a good job.

88
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:21,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my first week I went down there, I introduced myself to Ernest, and since then we've started some programs, and this is one of the volunteer programs that I'm proud to say I started.

89
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:24,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight, I want to thank some people.

90
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:40,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I introduce her, I want to thank Mayor Burke for having the confidence in me to proceed with the second major veterans project within the last months and for her constant support of the Veterans Services Department and its director, Ernest Lindsay.

91
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor also worked with the management of Hyatt Hotel and was able to obtain a rate of under $100 for the family to stay in while their house was being renovated.

92
00:08:54,263 --> 00:09:05,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we got started, before this started, Rick Bazinga, he's from Haines Square, he has a business there, came to me and said, I have a gentleman who would like to do something in the city of Medford.

93
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,989
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know of anything, let me know.

94
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,569
[SPEAKER_08]: A few months had gone by.

95
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,171
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor got a letter, gave it to Ernest, Ernest gave it to me.

96
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:17,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, Rick, I've got this family that needs something.

97
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick introduced me to Tony Nigro.

98
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:21,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony Nigro.

99
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:28,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford High School, class of 86, doesn't live here anymore, but he felt he had to give something back to the community.

100
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,498
[SPEAKER_08]: He came down, we did a walkthrough.

101
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little nervous if he was gonna keep on walking, but he said, no.

102
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,802
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, I'm gonna help this family.

103
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:44,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And from there, Tony brought in a crew from Mill Creek.

104
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:49,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm gonna announce some of them, even though they're not here.

105
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:56,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin Pike was the supervisor of the job, and Dominic Lusso, a Methodist resident, class of 88.

106
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:07,889
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the guys who were there every day during those times to get this family in and out of there as quick as possible, and they supervised the bulk of the project.

107
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:10,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to mention a few of the companies that did

00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:47,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the family had a van, a handicapped van that needed some work.

112
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:51,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Valsa Automotive stepped in and said, I'll do the work.

113
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:56,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had, through my good friend, where's Dominic?

114
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:58,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's Dominic?

115
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:58,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Come up here.

116
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,596
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy is a veteran's veteran, I'm telling you.

117
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,877
[SPEAKER_08]: He's my resource for everything.

118
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:07,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime I get something, he's like the first guy I call.

119
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,318
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows everything about everything.

120
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sorry, he does.

121
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to say he's my friend, and he's helped me tremendously in anything I've done with the veterans.

122
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,752
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been my mentor, and I wanna thank him.

123
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff Fargo from the building department.

124
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked to him in the beginning, said, listen, we're on a time schedule here.

125
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,394
[SPEAKER_08]: When we call you, can you come right down?

126
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:36,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff came down, got all the permits done in a quick fashion.

127
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominick introduced us to a family who had a hospital bed, because the family had a daughter that was also handicapped.

128
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:54,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And the family was, her name was Eva Weiner, and her husband had passed away last year, and he had a hospital bed.

129
00:11:54,454 --> 00:12:04,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also had a lift, with some things that we offered up to the family, that they needed a bed for the daughter, everything worked out great.

130
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:06,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, among with that,

131
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,147
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some, it was a wheelchair.

132
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic and I donated the wheelchair to the Masons for Veterans out of Woburn.

133
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:18,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also made a donation to Doctors Without Borders from the supplies that Mrs. Weiner gave to us.

134
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:23,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic again, came in again, helped us with the funding.

135
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:33,039
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought we were gonna get this bed out of the apartment by ourselves, and all of a sudden, Dominic comes in and says, we're not doing this ourselves.

136
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:37,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic helped arrange, along with the Weiner family,

137
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,641
[SPEAKER_08]: to get the bed, moved out of the apartment and over to Spring Street.

138
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:47,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic again, he introduced me to Anoush Dadgar.

139
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:52,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Anoush donated 11 nights of hotel stay at the Hyatt for the family.

140
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,895
[SPEAKER_08]: And along with Tony Nigro, who put seven nights of stay out of his own pocket.

141
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, a lot of work.

142
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:05,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once we got to the hotel, we had a couple more issues with, they were supposed to have a handicapped room

143
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,490
[SPEAKER_08]: They were doing construction, they didn't have a handicap room.

144
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic again comes to the rescue.

145
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:18,856
[SPEAKER_08]: He brings in Lou Sirignano to help out with the bathing and getting the family in and out together.

146
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:28,421
[SPEAKER_08]: These people did a lot of work and I personally want to thank them and I think Tony might want to say something about all the great work he did with his team.

147
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:29,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

148
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:33,264
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to say thank you for letting this group

149
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,735
[SPEAKER_17]: really do something that made us feel good.

150
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:40,938
[SPEAKER_17]: We enjoyed thoroughly meeting your family and making a difference.

151
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:50,224
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're thrilled that your new grandparents and that you get to share your new old house built in, what, 1870?

152
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:53,206
[SPEAKER_17]: You get to share that with another generation.

153
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,447
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what Metrod is.

154
00:13:54,827 --> 00:14:00,711
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, if he didn't know a guy and he didn't know a guy and he didn't know a guy, we wouldn't have been able to do this.

155
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,913
[SPEAKER_17]: It was our absolute pleasure.

156
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and at this point, I'd like to make some commendations.

157
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:21,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Memphis City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Tony Nigro in recognition of your donation of goods and services to help rehabilitate the home of a Method veteran.

158
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, this is for you.

159
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another one.

160
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic Masolino.

161
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Dominic's got these all over his house.

162
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick Bazinga.

163
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:49,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick's the guy that started the whole game going.

164
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:59,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dominic is going to take this from the disabled and limber veterans for all their help.

165
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:06,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin Pike.

166
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin for all his services.

167
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Eva Weiner.

168
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,582
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not here this evening, but Dominic will take that one.

169
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Anush Delga, Dominic will take that one also.

170
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:33,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And last, Lucia Rigdale.

171
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:34,566
[SPEAKER_08]: We thank you.

172
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,222
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I want to thank all these gentlemen for making this project come through.

173
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:48,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you'll see some other people back here in another couple of months with maybe something else that we have in the works.

174
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the gentlemen might want to say a couple of words.

175
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Ma'am, you want to say something?

176
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,731
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Mrs. Nelson.

177
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:02,093
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

178
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Carol Nelson, Spring Street, Medford.

179
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:22,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came up here to say thank you, but I don't know how a simple thank you can convey the amount of effort and work that all these fine gentlemen and more have done for us.

180
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:28,086
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made my house so welcoming for my daughter.

181
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:29,647
[SPEAKER_00]: She uses a wheelchair.

182
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:34,029
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took all these people and more to put it together.

183
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say thank you to Kevin and Tony.

184
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,270
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done a remarkable job.

185
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,050
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart is just filled with gratitude for what they have done.

186
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:44,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.

187
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:56,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, can we take a picture?

188
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:00,078
th th

189
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,951
I think we're good.

190
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:43,712
One, two, three.

191
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,234
Again, and again.

192
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,555
Congratulations.

193
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:48,916
Thank you so much.

194
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:49,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, gentlemen.

195
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:50,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

196
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:36,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we're going to take suspension of the rules to receive the Delegate of the Mayor.

197
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,115
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favour?

198
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:40,015
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

199
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,217
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just going to have a brief response from the Mayor.

200
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:49,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Jennifer Deverwood, Chief of Staff of the Mayor.

201
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you Mr. President.

202
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening City Council.

203
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:53,215
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you tonight?

204
00:18:53,856 --> 00:19:08,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Just as a point of information relative to last week and a resident who spoke on behalf of issue he was having with his excise tax, Mr. Croyer, um, he had spoken to multiple people in the mayor's office, myself included.

205
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:15,005
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are aware that, um, the council liaison had worked with specifically two counselors in general to,

206
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:19,474
[SPEAKER_18]: try to, um, research his problem and have a remedy for his problem.

207
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:31,225
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, um, I just wanted to let everybody know that he will be meeting with, um, Mr. O'Neill tomorrow, and hopefully there'll be some sort of, um, remedy to, uh, his issues at hand.

208
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,306
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to bring that to everybody's attention.

209
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:34,567
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you very much.

210
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:36,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for your good work.

211
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes, uh, vice president Longo Kern, uh, who also had a matter on the suspension 16,

212
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:48,225
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-687 offered by Vice President Longo Kern.

213
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:58,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the results of enforcement of city ordinances and health regulations resulting from complaints posted on C-Click Fix.

214
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:09,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it further resolved that the city figure out a better strategy before closing out complaints as many residents are complaining that complaints are being closed out too quickly

215
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:11,458
[SPEAKER_11]: with little or no remedy.

216
00:20:11,758 --> 00:20:12,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President.

217
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,359
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

218
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:22,681
[SPEAKER_21]: C-Click Fix was implemented a number of months ago, and I think it's something that this council repeatedly asked for.

219
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:30,783
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think there is some good that is coming out of it, but I know there are kinks that need to be worked out, and I think there's just a little bit more effort that needs to be put into it.

220
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:39,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Because time and time again, we either have somebody at the podium or we're getting an email or a phone call with regards to a complaint that was

221
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:47,587
[SPEAKER_21]: closed out prematurely or closed out with no resolve, although it says it has been resolved.

222
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:52,991
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think there are a few people who would like to speak up with regards to maybe specific issues.

223
00:20:53,712 --> 00:21:02,620
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think we need, whether it be the council and the mayor's office and the administration together, we need to come up with some better ways of handling the problems.

224
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I know that a lot of this comes with regards to the enforcement.

225
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:14,640
[SPEAKER_21]: enforcement has been lacking in this city for many years, I think on a number of levels, and it's something that has been spoken about time and time again.

226
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,746
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's something that we still need to improve on with regards to enforcement and taking complaints seriously.

227
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:29,833
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to leave some time to allow residents that would like to talk specifics, give them the podium.

228
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:34,857
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think in the future, we do need to sit down and meet and go over this again.

229
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:35,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we got an update

230
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:51,934
[SPEAKER_21]: in June with the budget and kinks were being worked out, but I still am hearing the complaints and would like to figure out a way to better resolve issues that come through C-Click Fix so we can use it as a tool that is obviously getting better results than we are now.

231
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:54,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

232
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:56,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

233
00:21:56,176 --> 00:22:05,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten the same calls that the Vice President has gotten, but in my one comment that I'd like to make on the C-Click Fix is I'd like to keep the comments limited to

234
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:13,404
[SPEAKER_08]: The person who made the original complaint, I don't think we need to have people weighing in on the complaint that was made.

235
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:15,884
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a commentary period.

236
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:19,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The person who makes the complaint reports the problem.

237
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:26,066
[SPEAKER_08]: The only response that they should be getting is from the city, whatever department is handling it.

238
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:35,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people shouldn't be commenting on it because now it turns into a Facebook and we get comment to comment and I don't think that's the right way to handle this.

239
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:44,497
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be my only suggestion that the comment be limited to the person who made the comment and no further discussion other than with the city officials.

240
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

241
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Council chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

242
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:51,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

243
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:51,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

244
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

245
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:54,407
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

246
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:55,949
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Angela Ferrari.

247
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,192
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at two 15 Harvard street and I'm in unit 19.

248
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:04,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm in the Lincoln-Kennedy complex, and I am on the Harvard Street side.

249
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:07,746
[SPEAKER_20]: My condo is on the Harvard Street side.

250
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:11,408
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason I've come this evening is

251
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:16,114
[SPEAKER_20]: a bit out of frustration regarding the click fix issue.

252
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:26,638
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm up very early in the morning, and I guess I've had the luxury, or I'm not sure it is a luxury, of seeing things at 5.15 AM that shouldn't be happening in the neighborhood.

253
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:38,663
[SPEAKER_20]: And on more than one occasion, I saw right down the street from me on the Harvard Street side in the corner of Harvard and Maine in front of the Oasis restaurant, or actually next to it,

254
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:50,750
[SPEAKER_20]: Barriers of the flowerpots that had originally been right around the corners, which would have made sure that no vehicles drove on top of the sidewalk, had been moved.

255
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:58,475
[SPEAKER_20]: And on two occasions, I saw a very large truck edge in between the flowerpots onto the sidewalk.

256
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:05,019
[SPEAKER_20]: And this was at 5.15 a.m., and I took photos on both occasions and reported it.

257
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,881
[SPEAKER_20]: What seems to have happened is basically

258
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:08,838
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing.

259
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:16,645
[SPEAKER_20]: The issue is that, number one, it's 5.15 in the morning and no truck should be doing anything like that.

260
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:22,169
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe there's a city ordinance that says that nothing like that should be occurring until at least 7 a.m.

261
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:22,730
[SPEAKER_20]: in the morning.

262
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:34,359
[SPEAKER_20]: But more importantly, they've moved the flower pots, which actually is a safety hazard, in addition to ruining the sidewalks because big trucks have made large holes in the sidewalks.

263
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,942
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a safety issue for people passing by, the pedestrians.

264
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:38,907
[SPEAKER_20]: me included.

265
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:45,170
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a bit of frustration on both of those issues that I've been personally involved in.

266
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:54,875
[SPEAKER_20]: But in addition, I noticed that the C-Click Fix matters don't even really get acknowledged or are closed out with any sort of resolution.

267
00:24:55,295 --> 00:25:04,839
[SPEAKER_20]: So, it's really frustrating, and being a taxpayer in a pretty expensive condo, I expect a little bit more from the city.

268
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:12,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I also have called in a manhole cover that's directly in front of my condo.

269
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:16,029
[SPEAKER_20]: that makes a very large banging noise when traffic goes over it.

270
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:21,910
[SPEAKER_20]: As you probably know, Harvard Street is a very busy street with cars and trucks.

271
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,431
[SPEAKER_20]: And it has continued to bang.

272
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:34,653
[SPEAKER_20]: And the last four weeks, three weeks in a row, I called the mayor's office and specifically said my name, my address, exactly where the manhole cover was.

273
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:38,235
[SPEAKER_20]: The first time I was told, they would report it to DPW.

274
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:40,056
[SPEAKER_20]: The following week, I called again.

275
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:42,257
[SPEAKER_20]: They said they thought it had been fixed.

276
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:44,158
[SPEAKER_20]: They'd call again down to DPW.

277
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:52,403
[SPEAKER_20]: The third time I called the mayor's office, and I spoke specifically to Linda, to Lauren, and to Linda again the third time.

278
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:56,106
[SPEAKER_20]: The third time I called, I was told that had been fixed.

279
00:25:56,366 --> 00:26:01,509
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, if it had been fixed, then they clearly didn't do a good job because it continues to bang.

280
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:03,730
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm up in the middle of the night because of it.

281
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:12,017
[SPEAKER_20]: Two hours later, I got a call from Brian of DPW who asked me, which manhole cover are you talking about?

282
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,060
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a lot of manhole covers on Harvard Street.

283
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:22,279
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, OK, well, it's, as I said three times before, it's directly in front of my unit on Harvard Street.

284
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:22,900
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't miss it.

285
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,621
[SPEAKER_20]: So he did come out.

286
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:29,045
[SPEAKER_20]: And I met with him at 10 o'clock in the morning on Sunday morning, which was very nice of him to come out.

287
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,008
[SPEAKER_20]: But I took the time to physically go to the manhole cover.

288
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:36,571
[SPEAKER_20]: And he sprayed it and said he would immediately have it fixed.

289
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:39,594
[SPEAKER_20]: That was on Sunday two days ago.

290
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:44,218
[SPEAKER_20]: As of tonight, when I got home from work, the issue still had not been fixed.

291
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:52,081
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't know what else citizens can do to try to help maintain the city.

292
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:55,723
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a taxpayer, I just find it really, really frustrating.

293
00:26:55,823 --> 00:27:14,472
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess I'm looking to all of you to assist and see what we can do both about the see, click, fix issue that doesn't seem to get responded to or resolved, and also when we call the mayor's office and have an honest complaint asking for help, what can be done to make things proceed a little bit better for us?

294
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thank you for your time for considering my, my, my opinion.

295
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:19,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

296
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:20,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

297
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

298
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:23,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

299
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:24,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

300
00:27:24,473 --> 00:27:26,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

301
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:27,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

302
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,875
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Capucci of, uh, 71 Evans street.

303
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:44,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, a bunch of weeks ago, a fellow, uh, resident who lives on Evans street with me in mind, we came down to talk about the bad, very bad condition of, of Evans street.

304
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:44,599
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh,

305
00:27:45,943 --> 00:28:07,025
[SPEAKER_19]: A C click fix item had been posted the Wednesday, I think, uh, before the Tuesday night we came here to speak and that Thursday it was, it was taken down and put, uh, resolved when, when it wasn't, uh, what I think the city needs to do is instead of just like one word,

306
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:18,080
[SPEAKER_19]: in closing it out resolved, put the fixes that were made, the time, and try to be a little bit more specific and transparent.

307
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:37,205
[SPEAKER_19]: With regards to making comments on it, I understand what Councillor Caravaglio is trying to convey by that sentiment, but at the same time, I wouldn't want to see anybody silenced or any ideas that might be offered that might help a situation.

308
00:28:37,702 --> 00:28:38,042
[SPEAKER_19]: as well.

309
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

311
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:42,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

312
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:43,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

313
00:28:43,084 --> 00:28:44,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

314
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Ann Marie Fretz, 215 Harvard street.

315
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:58,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say thank you for listening to me for the past, um, five or six years regarding the public safety and health and safety in our neighborhood.

316
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:13,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm addressing the Council again this evening about the C-Click Fix, being a victim of a bit of bullying and some slanderous comments on C-Click Fix for merely pointing out and reopening an issue that Angela addressed.

317
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:28,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have to reach out to C-Click Fix in their corporate offices and wanted to let everyone know that should you find some comments that are not pleasing or not flattering or perhaps slanderous towards you,

318
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:51,147
[SPEAKER_03]: you can contact them via email, and it's based on their regular website, and ask them to look at their standard of performance and reporting, because they do have standards that they keep comments on across their board to protect the people that report.

319
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:58,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that the report themselves should be addressed by a citizen with an issue,

320
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: resolved or addressed by a person of authority and then issue either closed or resolved and have a report of what is being resolved and how it's being resolved.

321
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:21,347
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't happen in our case and it's unfortunate that my experience was devastating to me personally and an embarrassment.

322
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:42,130
[SPEAKER_03]: The comments have since been taken down by C-Click Fix headquarters, and they have said that they would be reaching out to the city of Medford to ask their contact here to perhaps educate the people that are in the roles of administrators that respond to citizens that have issues.

323
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Moreover, the issues that we still have open, and I have perhaps 50% of the issues that I've reported, whether it be anonymously or under my own name,

324
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:57,030
[SPEAKER_03]: for other people in the area all relate to health and safety issues.

325
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:05,975
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% of them are open and they'll either be closed by me with no resolution or just left behind.

326
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:20,582
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm most concerned about is that as a citizen, asking that trash be taken care of, we keep the streets free of rats, and we do have a rat problem here in Medford, that we are allowed to have the freedom to speak

327
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:29,892
[SPEAKER_03]: without being intimidated, without being bullied by administrators or shut down or treated rudely as in the case that I've experienced during the past six years.

328
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:36,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently supported someone else in another town for something they were trying to do for the good of all people.

329
00:31:36,974 --> 00:31:40,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get a lovely letter back from them saying, thank you for your support.

330
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,296
[SPEAKER_03]: This was absolutely neat.

331
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:47,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had anything like that from the city of Medford except for my neighbors who have been here to support.

332
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:49,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to thank the council for their support.

333
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:57,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as a resident of Lincoln Kennedy condos, I've tried to keep our area neat, clean, free rats.

334
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And we work with the city and the health department to do so.

335
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for your help.

336
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:03,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

337
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:04,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

338
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:06,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

339
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:20,545
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can, um, I, my, I'm sorry to hear that this has been such, um, such a negative experience, but, uh, in regards to the, the trash truck and moving those plants, as I believe,

340
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:34,871
[SPEAKER_05]: we took in the city, took an active stance to making sure that one of the biggest reasons having a child living very close, a newborn being very close in proximity to that, that, uh, dumpster.

341
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:43,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, them, the idea of moving that is totally against what we, what we, why we put that there.

342
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:46,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and made sure that, that those plants were put in place.

343
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:50,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can please ask for a, an update from the health department,

344
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,972
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and reaching out to the trash company to see that never happens again.

345
00:32:56,992 --> 00:33:02,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, um, or if not, that there are penalties and fines to that, that case.

346
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:13,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also look at the time when they are, um, picking up their trash because of the, uh, the ordinance and, and, and get back to us with the report on that.

347
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:14,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.

348
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:14,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

349
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:15,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

350
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:15,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor.

351
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:17,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

352
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

353
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

354
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:28,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 221 Park Street, and C-Click Fix likes to notify you, so I was notified of this thread because of something I had posted.

355
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:48,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the comments from the responding city person were that they knew that the person was making these pickups at 515 in the morning for the oil, but that he didn't have a long enough hose, and they felt badly, so they were letting him pick up at 515 so he could climb on the sidewalk and move the planter.

356
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:52,786
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was a financial hardship for him to buy a longer hose.

357
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of the things that they posted.

358
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:57,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like

359
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:03,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Cclick fix is kind of exposing that some of the rules are a little shaky.

360
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:20,222
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've gotten responses of well It's easier for him to park on the sidewalk and now that I made one post about parking someone parking on the sidewalk I'm constantly getting email notifications every time someone else does and I noticed that those people are getting similar responses from the city so I

361
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:24,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we just need to realize these are overwhelmed.

362
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to change the rules?

363
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:38,433
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was some harassment going on on that particular thread about neighbors were picking on people and things like that.

364
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:45,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oasis has been an issue for a long time, and maybe we need to just figure out what's going on with that.

365
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And if C-Click fixes something that we're just not ready to handle.

366
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:50,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

367
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:51,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

368
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:58,487
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of vice president Lungo Kern as amended by councilor Scott Pelly, a chair recognizes council marks.

369
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:00,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

370
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:07,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, if we can just get the address of the manhole, uh, on Harvard so we can report it as well.

371
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:08,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's been reported.

372
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:13,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, maybe if you could pass it off to the, uh, city messenger.

373
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:19,021
[SPEAKER_06]: so we can ask that Brian Cairns address that issue immediately.

374
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:25,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Councilor Scott Pelley and the speakers that spoke in particular regarding the flower pots.

375
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:29,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a major issue for a long period of time.

376
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought we had a resolve on that.

377
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:39,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Just when you think you're safe and something happened that was positive, it seems to go back again.

378
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:40,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to reverse.

379
00:35:41,477 --> 00:35:43,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm very disappointed to hear that

380
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:46,997
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, the city is allowing these parts to be moved.

381
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:51,639
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not little small flower pots that you buy at a corner store.

382
00:35:51,659 --> 00:36:00,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, these are giant flower pots and, uh, they're concrete and they're very heavy flower pots.

383
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:07,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And to have them manually moved like that, uh, to me, uh, is not, uh, appropriate.

384
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:10,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the second thing, Mr. President was about,

385
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:14,940
[SPEAKER_06]: six months ago, we received an update, uh, from C click fix.

386
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:32,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we all received a report on, I think it was from Lauren felts from the administration on the, uh, number of, uh, requests that were put in, uh, between a certain timeframe, the number that were open, the number that were resolved, the number that were closed.

387
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:39,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really think, uh, hearing from residents that, uh, this may require a committee, the whole meeting,

388
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:45,679
[SPEAKER_06]: to sit down and discuss with the city administration on how these issues are handled.

389
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:51,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it appears that things may be closed, uh, quicker than any results taking place.

390
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a concern because, um,

391
00:36:55,228 --> 00:37:10,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you, in my opinion, file a C-click fix, what should happen immediately is there should be a response from someone from the city administration saying this was delegated to whatever department or head or whatever department that handles it.

392
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:17,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And then secondly, you should get a response within a certain amount of time stating what the appropriate action is going to be.

393
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize not everything is going to require an action.

394
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:24,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes people may call up on something that can't be resolved.

395
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:39,916
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the very least residents deserve to know what's going on and to leave people out in the lurch and not respond back in a timely fashion or close things out saying it'll be addressed in my opinion is not the way to handle it.

396
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what should happen is once a similar to the previous speaker when she called about the manhole cover, once the issue was resolved, then maybe someone from the city should be picking up the phone saying,

397
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, the issue was resolved.

398
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for reporting it.

399
00:37:58,183 --> 00:37:58,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all set.

400
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:05,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but not just to put a blanket open or closed, uh, to me is not the way to go about it.

401
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:22,164
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, so I would ask Mr. President, we have a committee, the whole meeting, uh, to meet with the city administration to discuss some of the issues on C click fix, and also to get, uh, an additional update on the reporting of C click fix from its inception.

402
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:34,761
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, on the number of requests filed by this community, uh, the number of requests that were closed, the number of requests that were addressed, the number of requests that were left open and the reasons why it was left open.

403
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, we put a lot of time and effort into making sure this was going to be a way that residents can contact the city and get results.

404
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:52,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And if residents are contacting the city and getting angry about it and getting upset about it, that's not what I bought into.

405
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:56,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this was supposed to be an easy way of communication and transparency.

406
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:01,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that's not the case, we have to immediately address that with the administration as the president.

407
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:05,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be, I would ask that, uh, that'd be part of the roll call.

408
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:06,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

409
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:06,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

410
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:09,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilmarks chair recognizes vice president Lugo current.

411
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, thank you, president DelaRusso.

412
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:13,826
[SPEAKER_21]: I, along the same lines as council marks.

413
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:20,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, we did get a report back in March and I think from go live date until March 31st, I have some numbers.

414
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,470
[SPEAKER_21]: So,

415
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:27,657
[SPEAKER_21]: just share them, and I, too, would like to see the current numbers as of the—go live date to March 31st.

416
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:30,799
[SPEAKER_21]: There were 745 posts.

417
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:39,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Sixty were open in March, 213 were acknowledged, 145 were closed, and 327 were archived.

418
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:46,865
[SPEAKER_21]: So I, too, would like to see the current numbers from March going forward, or maybe the numbers in their entirety.

419
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,586
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, too, think Rob Capucci made a good point.

420
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,746
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that, I think, would

421
00:39:51,090 --> 00:40:04,313
[SPEAKER_21]: do a lot of good having not only something say it's closed, but what was done, who did it, and if it was referred to another department, that other department then needs to say what they've done and how it's been fixed or why they cannot fix it.

422
00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:13,876
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that would be huge and definitely help the residents and give them a little bit more sense of relief and less frustration.

423
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:18,337
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's something that can't be done, it can't be done, and that's when something should be closed.

424
00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:23,878
[SPEAKER_21]: And I do feel there's a problem with following our ordinances and enforcement.

425
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:31,124
[SPEAKER_21]: And if this is just, I don't think it's just an issue in South Medford, although South Medford does have some issues that need to be worked on.

426
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:37,929
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we need to follow our ordinances and be uniform throughout this entire, the entire city.

427
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:44,475
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's safe to park on some sidewalks, you know, and not safe to park on others, we need to figure that all out.

428
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:47,397
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would think the administration is in process of trying to

429
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:53,908
[SPEAKER_21]: get a little tighter on our enforcement of our ordinances, but that takes manpower and people and more time.

430
00:40:53,928 --> 00:41:10,122
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to put more time into resolving issues on C-Click Fix, because it's the one avenue besides coming to a city council meeting or giving a call to a counselor or the mayor, it's the one avenue the people, the residents of this city have to report a whole host of number of issues.

431
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:14,025
[SPEAKER_21]: And they'd like to see a resolve or an answer in some fashion or form.

432
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:18,100
[SPEAKER_21]: And the complaints that are coming my way are more than I expected.

433
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:30,168
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'd like to see, you know, us do a little bit of a job in trying to educate and give a closure to people's concerns and questions and complaints.

434
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

435
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

436
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

437
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

438
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:43,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the issues that has been plaguing C-Click Fix is the inordinate amount of

439
00:41:44,428 --> 00:42:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: issues that have been piled onto the DPW department and I believe it was Councilman Knight who suggested back a long time ago and also Councilman Scarpelli and Falco who also suggested that the staffing levels at the DPW department did not match what was going to be coming in from C-Click Fix and that's there as well.

440
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:09,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing holds true for the police department as well.

441
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:13,018
[SPEAKER_03]: One particular officer is doing three different jobs at this point and

442
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It has an impact on everyone.

443
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:38,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the reasons I wanted to come back up to speak was because it is now two years since, it will be two years on October 17th, that we did the Chief Sacco safety walk through South Medford when 40 of us stood on the sidewalk and watched Oasis cars driving through the sidewalk and parking on the sidewalk while we were on the sidewalk, all in a mass group.

444
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And my neighbors can remember that.

445
00:42:42,149 --> 00:42:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been improvements.

446
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:48,306
[SPEAKER_03]: but different situations are now arising around that area.

447
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:53,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And as the police have said, we fix one thing and another one pops up.

448
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing we're doing.

449
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a business trying to survive in an area.

450
00:42:57,892 --> 00:43:03,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've just heard that the three MBTA bus stops are not going to be moved.

451
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that someone needs to go again before the traffic commission.

452
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:13,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, asked as Jim Silva and I have asked for designated parking spaces

453
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: for Oasis to be put for their drivers and for their deliveries and time spaces in front.

454
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else is going to have to do it.

455
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:22,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do this anymore.

456
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:30,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's far too much of a risk for me personally to take and have ramifications coming at me as they have with this past week.

457
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again.

458
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

459
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:43,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of vice president, local current amended by council Scott Pelley and marks council marks, just if I could, uh, another issue that I brought up before would see click fix.

460
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:53,775
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm still seeing it when I go on to C-Click Fix, is the fact that residents are writing down they have a pedestrian safety concern.

461
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:55,316
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I saw was on Elm Street.

462
00:43:56,197 --> 00:43:58,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And Elm Street happens to be a state road.

463
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:04,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize it's not under the jurisdiction of the city of Meffitt, but residents may not know that.

464
00:44:04,524 --> 00:44:11,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they go on to C-Click Fix, they expect that whatever their concern is will be addressed by the city.

465
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:18,638
[SPEAKER_06]: and the city should be reaching out to the state police or state highway or someone.

466
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,362
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't be turning around and see click fix saying, here's a number to call the state.

467
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:28,638
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, these are our streets, these are our residents, and we have the concern.

468
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:35,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone brings it to the attention of a public safety official, they should be addressing it, not turning it back.

469
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:39,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Mr. President, there's a number of streetlights that are out.

470
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:44,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Residents are calling, say, at the corner of Riverside Ave and Spring Street, the light's out.

471
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:47,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a posting back from the city, what's the poll number?

472
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:51,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is not what we should be doing, Mr. President.

473
00:44:51,969 --> 00:45:02,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone from the city, if they need the poll number, which I know they do, should be taking a ride out there and getting the poll number, not asking the resident to go back and get the poll number.

474
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:05,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of these polls have multiple numbers on them and so forth.

475
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,005
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the intent.

476
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent isn't to see, click, and then transfer someone else.

477
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It's see, click, and do something about it.

478
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're supposed to be doing, Mr. President.

479
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:23,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a little alarmed by the number of issues that are really being brushed off.

480
00:45:24,076 --> 00:45:25,697
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of state roads in this city.

481
00:45:26,277 --> 00:45:28,659
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, I think they all should be city roads.

482
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:39,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Because how do you tell a taxpayer that lives on Middlesex Ave or Elm Street or any other state road, sorry, you're paying taxes to the city of Method, but we're not going to touch your sidewalk if there's a crack.

483
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:41,769
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to trim your tree if there's a crack.

484
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to do road repairs.

485
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to touch anything on your road, but we'll touch your taxes.

486
00:45:47,093 --> 00:45:48,374
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make sure we get your taxes.

487
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:51,917
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, anything should be addressed by this community.

488
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:57,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they feel that they can't address an issue because it's not our road, they should take the issue over.

489
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,190
[SPEAKER_06]: They should take ownership of the issue.

490
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:12,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the things I'm hoping to discuss at the Committee of the Whole meeting, Mr. President, because this is a very worthy system, but it has to be functioning properly to work to its fullest potential, Mr. President.

491
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:14,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, councillors.

492
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,273
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion as amended.

493
00:46:24,335 --> 00:46:25,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

494
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:39,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

495
00:46:41,484 --> 00:46:56,712
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of feel like also if you're going to make the commitment to use C-Click Fix, that part of what you have to do, and I realize that there are departments that are understaffed, is I agree with Councilor Marks, is that you have to make the commitment to the customer service that goes along with it.

496
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:02,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing technical assistance on the Americans with Disabilities Act for 16 years.

497
00:47:02,997 --> 00:47:16,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of calls and a lot of emails and a lot of, hey, Rachel, can you stop in here for a second, that have nothing whatsoever to do with the ADA because people don't really have, I mean, through no fault of their own, they don't really have a handle on what it covers.

498
00:47:17,943 --> 00:47:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If it involves disability, I often get asked about it.

499
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:25,626
[SPEAKER_04]: My response is not, whoops, not my circus, not my monkeys.

500
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:33,624
[SPEAKER_04]: My response is, that actually is not where that applies, but let me look up where you need to go.

501
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:43,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's at my job, that's on the Disability Commission, because that's what you do.

502
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:56,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody is reporting, and I'm looking at you Main Street and South Street, if somebody is reporting something that is not safe or is not

503
00:47:57,493 --> 00:48:05,560
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that happens to not be a Medford City issue, then yeah, that is what you do.

504
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:12,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Because A, you're going to waste more time when 57 other people ask the same question because it wasn't referred to them.

505
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:16,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to get 97 more calls because that thing ain't going to paint itself or whatever.

506
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you tell people, if you take the 30 seconds or whatever to tell people this is where you go with it,

507
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:32,382
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if you're calling that number yourself on a regular basis, because I bet that the state and the city traffic folks talk to each other every now and then.

508
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:41,204
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got to be part of what we commit to when we commit to doing C-Click Fix, because otherwise we can't do it.

509
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:42,864
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make more work for ourselves.

510
00:48:42,884 --> 00:48:47,505
[SPEAKER_04]: The city's going to make more work for itself, and plus it gets all the fabulous

511
00:48:49,502 --> 00:48:55,705
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, bonus features of having internet and social media things happen and people getting all prickly at each other.

512
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:59,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like if you're going to do it, do it right.

513
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, take it down and do like 311 like Somerville does or whatever where you actually have to talk to a human being and they actually have to tell you something and not just hang up on you and go, not my problem.

514
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:10,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

515
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:18,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

516
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:19,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record.

517
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:20,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

518
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:22,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

519
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:25,415
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to pick up on what Councillor Mark said.

520
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:29,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Residents contacting City Hall and expecting to get results.

521
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:36,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I read the residents' situation with this click fix and it was harrowing.

522
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,262
[SPEAKER_22]: It is harrowing that a citizen wants to ask for help from this city and gets abuse instead.

523
00:49:43,642 --> 00:49:45,762
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we have public records requests.

524
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:47,163
[SPEAKER_22]: We can file them along with

525
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:48,310
[SPEAKER_22]: quick fix.

526
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:56,414
[SPEAKER_22]: We can try to get answers, but the city sometimes just likes to hide things, doesn't want transparency, and that is the job of the city council.

527
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,495
[SPEAKER_22]: They say the city council has no teeth.

528
00:49:58,935 --> 00:49:59,536
[SPEAKER_22]: I disagree.

529
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:00,576
[SPEAKER_22]: You're elected officials.

530
00:50:01,076 --> 00:50:02,457
[SPEAKER_22]: You can flex your muscles.

531
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:09,240
[SPEAKER_22]: No citizen should go through what that citizen went through, and I've read the report on it, and it is harrowing.

532
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,041
[SPEAKER_22]: So we really need to have solutions in the city.

533
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:15,323
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks, I thank you for your excellent essay on this.

534
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:26,442
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Lugo-Kern as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to.

535
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:37,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli, okay.

536
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:41,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking for an update from the health department on the.

537
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:44,513
[SPEAKER_10]: On the rubbish pickups.

538
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, on the rubbish pickups.

539
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:46,874
[SPEAKER_10]: And other services.

540
00:50:46,894 --> 00:50:49,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Who moved it, moved the planter and all that.

541
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:50,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

542
00:50:50,754 --> 00:50:59,157
[SPEAKER_10]: For the fall in the ordinance, uh, we are looking for an address on the, uh, manhole to be fixed that by DPW on amended by council marks.

543
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:00,158

548
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:44,009
[SPEAKER_21]: That we request that the city administration give more specific updates with regards to each instance.

549
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:50,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Each, uh, reported instance be given a more specific updates, uh, to the complaint.

550
00:51:54,639 --> 00:52:11,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's closed out, why so on that, all those in favor, I, all those opposed guys have it brief announcement from council marks.

551
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:14,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to recognize,

554
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:26,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we had, uh, uh, had a heroic event take place on, uh, Whittier road.

555
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, just recently there was a garage fire and the next door neighbor, uh, Fred Roach, anyone that knows Fred knows he's an outstanding person.

556
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:44,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, went, knocked on his neighbor's door, got the neighbors out of the house, uh, called the fire department, went back with his own, uh, uh, house, uh, yard hose,

557
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,140
[SPEAKER_06]: and contain the fire.

558
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:55,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, the house is in close proximity and he did a great job keeping this fire contained until the fire department got there.

559
00:52:56,223 --> 00:53:06,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to, uh, thank him for his heroic efforts, uh, Mr. President, and, uh, ask that a council accommodation, uh, be sent to Mr. Fred Roach.

560
00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:10,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Carviello has the same resolution under suspension.

561
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:13,008
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, you know, I think councilor Mark said it all.

563
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:19,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I've known Fred for some years now, and when I found out about it, I said I wasn't expecting any more from Fred.

564
00:53:19,994 --> 00:53:21,015
[SPEAKER_08]: He's out there all the time.

565
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:28,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I see him every week, and that's what good neighbors do, is they watch out for each other.

566
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank Fred for his heroic duty.

567
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:33,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:36,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And Madam Vice President.

[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

570
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:40,268
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to echo the sentiments of my council colleagues.

571
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:45,661
[SPEAKER_21]: I also have known Fred for a long time, he's a great guy, and this week he's a hero, so thank you.

[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

574
00:53:58,528 --> 00:53:58,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

575
00:53:58,808 --> 00:53:59,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Opposed?

576
00:54:00,129 --> 00:54:00,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Carries.

577
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:03,831
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion, while we're under suspension, Councillor Knight.

578
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:08,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Off the table, 16677.

579
00:54:08,976 --> 00:54:08,576
676.

580
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:22,185
[SPEAKER_11]: 676.

581
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:22,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Approach to creation of $1,200,000 in free cash for the city hall roof.

582
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:33,273
[SPEAKER_11]: The council reported favorably out of committee conversations on these two matters earlier this evening and met with the mayor

583
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:53,596
[SPEAKER_11]: members of her staff, Mr. Moki, the Commissioner of Buildings, and the representative from the contractor, and Mrs. Khan, who is our new Director of Budget and Finance and Purchasing, to take these, to address these matters.

584
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:56,619
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of Council tonight to take them off the table, all those in favor?

585
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:57,639
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

586
00:54:57,659 --> 00:54:58,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

587
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So before us is 16-676,

588
00:55:01,202 --> 00:55:08,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the appropriation from free cash chair waits motion council marks before the motion was called first.

589
00:55:08,366 --> 00:55:13,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to, uh, cause this appeared last week on the council floor, uh, for the first time.

590
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:26,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank my colleagues, uh, for, uh, calling for a committee, the whole meeting and discussing the paper, uh, where it deals with, uh, spending of taxpayer money.

591
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:30,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think tonight's meeting was very fruitful in the fact that,

592
00:55:31,205 --> 00:55:41,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we got more in-depth information and analysis on the type of work that's going to be done here at City Hall and the need for improvements in this building.

593
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:53,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also received tonight, Mr. President, and I want to thank Mayor Burke and the Chief of Staff and her staff for the draft capital plan we received

594
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:58,489
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight, which covers fiscal, uh, FY 17 to FY 21.

595
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:18,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I'm not saying I agree with everything in this plan, but, uh, it's something that we asked for something that, uh, this council has been looking for a long range capital plan, uh, to address some of the concerns we have, uh, throughout, uh, the community.

596
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:22,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is a step in the right direction, Mr. President,

597
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:27,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And it all took place because of a tabling the issue last week.

598
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can get these very important reports.

599
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:37,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be quite frank with you, I was not going to vote on the repairs, even though I knew they were much needed here at city hall.

600
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:41,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been here when the parts of the ceiling caved in.

601
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:47,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been here when some of the parapet around the building collapsed to the ground.

602
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the work that's needed in this building.

603
00:56:51,589 --> 00:57:07,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I wasn't going to vote on it because I, as one member of the council believe, uh, it's my responsibility to look at this city, um, the entire picture and, uh, not to do projects piecemeal.

604
00:57:08,137 --> 00:57:11,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I, uh, take my job very seriously.

605
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that we do have a draft plan, uh, I feel more comfortable knowing that at least there's a foundation here.

606
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:25,050
[SPEAKER_06]: to move forward on many of the needs we have and address some of the concerns.

607
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will, uh, support this paper here tonight, Mr. President.

608
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:29,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

609
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:31,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Counsel Marks chair recognizes constant night.

610
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

611
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:39,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I think consular marks gave a great breakdown as to the legislative history of this piece of legislation that's before us here this evening.

612
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:42,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I was very pleased to have an opportunity to meet with the mayor as well.

613
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think we had a great discussion about the capital plan and the capital projects.

614
00:57:46,123 --> 00:57:48,684
[SPEAKER_13]: This project here before us this evening is outside the capital plan.

615
00:57:48,724 --> 00:57:50,665
[SPEAKER_13]: It's something that's not under the previous administration.

616
00:57:50,765 --> 00:58:01,708
[SPEAKER_13]: It's to address the hole in the ceiling over here that we've all pointed at and looked at at one point or another during our term here on the council, to address the parapet that surrounds the top of the building that we can all see and disarray, Mr. President.

617
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:04,329
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though this is a great appropriation of funds.

618
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:06,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel as though it's a well-thought-out plan, Mr. President.

619
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And for that matter, I will be moving for approval.

620
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:12,472
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion for approval by Councilor Night, you're recognized as Vice President and Local Current.

621
00:58:13,177 --> 00:58:14,557
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

622
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:31,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I, too, am very thankful that we were able to meet with the mayor this evening at 5.30 to discuss any questions that we had with regards to this 1.2 from free cash, which is associated with a $1.8 million bond that is also, I believe, going to be taken off the table tonight.

623
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:39,705
[SPEAKER_21]: More importantly, I think it was extremely important that we do see the big picture as well, and I'm very happy that we got

624
00:58:40,307 --> 00:58:43,569
[SPEAKER_21]: something in our hands with regards to a capital improvement plan.

625
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:48,972
[SPEAKER_21]: This details 6 million in spending, possible 6 million in spending for fiscal year 17.

626
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:55,076
[SPEAKER_21]: It shows us 27 possible in 18, 19 million in fiscal year 19, 11.5 in fiscal year 20, and 7 million in fiscal year 21, probably 50,

627
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:30,937
[SPEAKER_21]: 60 projects that are on this plan, and I know it's a draft plan, and it will take some tweaking, but it's something to start with, and it's a good document to have, and it outlines where the money would come from, whether it be linkage, free cash, Chapter 90 funding, grants, MWRA loans, or the budget, obviously, or going out to bond.

628
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:32,855
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a great starting point.

629
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:37,277
[SPEAKER_21]: It's something that I don't know when we would have received it if we didn't hold off last week.

630
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:41,498
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the one week was well worth it to be able to get that document.

631
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:46,219
[SPEAKER_21]: With regards to the $1.8 million, it was good to be able to ask the questions.

632
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:51,440
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Councilor Marks pointed out last week we were told it was an et cetera.

633
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,821
[SPEAKER_21]: And everybody's been talking about that in the city.

634
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:57,042
[SPEAKER_21]: How are we going to vote on something when we don't know exactly what's going to be

635
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:06,975
[SPEAKER_21]: what exactly the $1.8 million is gonna be put into and all that we're given is a few line items and an et cetera.

636
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:14,658
[SPEAKER_21]: So this filled in those blanks and it was much more detailed and we were able to talk to the engineer, so that was very helpful.

637
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:26,143
[SPEAKER_21]: With regards to the roof, it's important to know that they're gonna start, if we approve this tonight, the appropriation can, the contract can be awarded tomorrow.

638
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:38,109
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's a start date of October 7th, probably taking us with a couple breaks through the winter into the spring for a finish of before June 30th, 2017.

639
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,851
[SPEAKER_21]: At the same time, the council chambers will take about two months to fix.

640
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:51,253
[SPEAKER_21]: And it looks like we got to ask a number of questions about the front entry renovations.

641
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,514
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's part of the thing that needs to be

642
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:57,214
[SPEAKER_21]: issues that needed to be more detailed, and we did get that detail.

643
01:00:57,274 --> 01:01:09,419
[SPEAKER_21]: So hopefully we can get this up on our website, we can educate the people on what this $1.8 million bond is gonna be used for, and we can keep educated, and I'm very happy that we had that meeting.

644
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:17,883
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice President, on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Falco, on 16-676, the appropriation of $1,200,000 from free cash

645
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:24,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councillor Marks.

646
01:01:25,253 --> 01:01:37,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to personally thank last week during the discussion that we had when the paper originally appeared before us, Councillor Scott Pelly brought up a very valid point about the interior of the building.

647
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the discussion was, uh, uh, surrounding, uh, the exterior of the building.

648
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, for those that have been in this building, realize the public restrooms,

649
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:57,533
[SPEAKER_06]: have been in really deplorable condition for many, many years, lacking the proper fixtures and proper hygiene and so forth.

650
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:07,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley because it was his insight that I believe got that matter attended to that we spoke about tonight.

651
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is part of the project.

652
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a phase two or phase three, but it does include the updating of the restrooms here, Mr. President.

653
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:28,325
[SPEAKER_06]: which, um, you know, it may not sound like a juicy issue, but, uh, it's something important when people come into this community and come into city hall, they shouldn't be looking at caution tape in a restroom.

654
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't be using both hands to put warm water.

655
01:02:32,509 --> 01:02:33,910
[SPEAKER_06]: One side's cold, one side's hot.

656
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,551
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta mix them up in the middle.

657
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:40,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, there's a lot that be, uh, needs to be done in these restrooms.

658
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:43,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to personally thank councilor Scott Pelly.

659
01:02:43,682 --> 01:02:44,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councillor.

660
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,704
[SPEAKER_11]: On that motion, all those in favour, Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

661
01:02:49,305 --> 01:02:50,146

01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:04,534
[SPEAKER_11]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the appropriation passes.

676
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:08,516
[SPEAKER_11]: On the request of Councillor Knight to take 16-674 off the table, Councillor.

677
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:17,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, loan order of $1,800,000, City Hall roof facade.

678
01:03:18,024 --> 01:03:19,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we discussed this.

679
01:03:19,984 --> 01:03:21,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion is before us.

680
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:22,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

681
01:03:22,986 --> 01:03:30,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, yes, this paper for a loan order of $1.8 million would allow us to complete phase one of the project and also put the design portion of phase two out to bid.

682
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:34,452
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my understanding.

683
01:03:34,892 --> 01:03:46,155
[SPEAKER_13]: And this paper also would ask that if the loan order is approved, that after its third reading, the administration would come back and rescind the vote or ask for the rescinding of the vote of paper number 16676.

684
01:03:46,675 --> 01:03:56,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So the $1.2 million free cash appropriation would go back into the free cash account, and we would bond out the total amount of $1.2 million plus an additional $600,000 for phase two, Mr. President.

685
01:03:57,377 --> 01:03:57,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I move for approval.

686
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:06,254
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for the first reading of this loan order.

687
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:08,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caviello?

688
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:09,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

689
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:10,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Felco?

690
01:04:10,258 --> 01:04:10,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

691
01:04:10,938 --> 01:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Haynes?

692
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:11,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

693
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice-President McKern?

694
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:13,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

695
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Moxley?

696
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:15,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

697
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:15,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

698
01:04:15,903 --> 01:04:16,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

699
01:04:17,464 --> 01:04:23,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion is approved.

700
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:26,230
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in a suspension, Mr. President.

701
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:35,117
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-673, taxicab operator license off the table for Madochi Esteneville of 130 Day Street, number one.

702
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:41,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello for the Department of Licensing.

703
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:42,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

704
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:45,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I have a motion.

705
01:04:46,957 --> 01:04:47,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. Senator.

706
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:48,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

707
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I reviewed the gentleman's papers, and they appear to be in order.

708
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:53,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And motion for approval.

709
01:04:53,902 --> 01:04:57,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

710
01:04:59,546 --> 01:05:00,566
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

711
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:01,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

712
01:05:01,787 --> 01:05:02,548

01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:11,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

721
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:13,735
[SPEAKER_11]: We're under suspension.

722
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:20,405

01:05:16,824 --> 01:05:20,405

01:05:16,984 --> 01:05:20,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Common Victuals License.

01:05:20,765 --> 01:05:22,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Common Victuals License.

[SPEAKER_11]: On that motion, 16-690, petition for Common Victuals License by Fong-Pin Chen, manager, 116 Center Street, Quincy Mass, 02169, for Lenny and Yee, LLC, doing business as Lisa's Family Pizzeria at 283 Boston Avenue,

727
01:05:45,877 --> 01:05:47,038
[SPEAKER_11]: in Medford.

728
01:05:47,078 --> 01:05:50,979
[SPEAKER_11]: The chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio, and is the petitioner present?

729
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

730
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:52,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

731
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Through council.

732
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:55,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, good evening to the council.

733
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:58,663
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Ken Levin, an attorney in East Boston.

734
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to be working with Fengping Chen and Lidia Peña-Reyes.

735
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:09,828
[SPEAKER_09]: They are in the process of purchasing Lisa's Family Pizzeria at 283 Boston Street.

736
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to give you some background, Mr. Chen,

737
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:30,095
[SPEAKER_09]: is a graduate of the Cordon Bleu Culinary School and has been working for the last six years at the Langham Hotel downtown Boston, formerly the Meridian, and is a chef there currently.

738
01:06:30,516 --> 01:06:39,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Reyes is also working at the Langham and started out as a third cook, then moved to second cook, and is now first cook.

739
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:44,222
[SPEAKER_09]: They've worked together for years and they enjoy working together.

740
01:06:44,342 --> 01:07:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: They found that Lisa's family pizzeria was for sale and felt that it was a great way for them to change their routine and be in business for themselves and take their skills and management ability and apply it in a different context.

741
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:03,654
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're excited about the opportunity.

742
01:07:04,815 --> 01:07:06,456
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to take over the restaurant.

743
01:07:06,476 --> 01:07:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not looking to make changes to the staff.

744
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:20,730
[SPEAKER_09]: and the menu, but they will gradually incorporate their own talents and abilities into the menu as time goes on.

745
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:22,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you and welcome.

746
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:23,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Caviello.

747
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:24,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

748
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:30,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I reviewed their papers and the papers appear to be in order.

749
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:34,457
[SPEAKER_08]: The hours of operation you're looking to have?

750
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:36,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's currently 11 to 11.

751
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:39,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to keep it that way.

752
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:40,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Stick with that.

753
01:07:40,697 --> 01:07:40,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

754
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:45,740
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, you know, I knew, I know the old owner, Tony, he was a very generous man throughout the community.

755
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you gentlemen will, uh, continue, uh, with Tony's, uh, practices.

756
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:55,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and again, I commend you for, um, uh, opening a new business in our city.

757
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:56,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

758
01:07:57,328 --> 01:07:57,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

759
01:07:57,788 --> 01:07:58,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Max.

760
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:00,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

761
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:05,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, knowing this is located up in the hillside area, um,

762
01:08:06,568 --> 01:08:13,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know if the current owner has the Tufts meal plan as part of the offerings?

763
01:08:16,456 --> 01:08:19,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe so.

764
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:28,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Tufts has an agreement with a lot of the local businesses where they provide a mail ticket and they allow them to go into these establishments.

765
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:32,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's called Tufts.

766
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:32,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor.

767
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:35,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may wanna look into that.

768
01:08:35,206 --> 01:08:38,808
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not already within that business, you may wanna reach out to Tufts.

769
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:44,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly we can speak to the current owner, to Tony about that.

770
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:45,372
[SPEAKER_09]: To see.

771
01:08:45,532 --> 01:08:47,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe tomorrow to see if that's already incorporated.

772
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:49,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it isn't, we can look into that.

773
01:08:49,215 --> 01:08:49,735
[SPEAKER_11]: You can request it.

774
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:50,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish you well.

775
01:08:51,316 --> 01:08:56,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations on the motion for approval by Councilor Caravaglio, seconded by Councilor Marks.

776
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:57,199
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

777
01:08:57,219 --> 01:08:57,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

778
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,780
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

779
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion granted, license granted.

780
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:02,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck, stay engaged.

781
01:09:03,299 --> 01:09:04,280
[SPEAKER_11]: committed to your community.

782
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:04,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

783
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

784
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,322
[SPEAKER_11]: While we're in suspension, we're going to take Mr. Cormier.

785
01:09:09,462 --> 01:09:11,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, counselor Knight, uh, reminded me.

786
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:13,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

787
01:09:13,204 --> 01:09:31,174
[SPEAKER_11]: 16 dash six, six, six 91 petition by Richard Cormier, 26 Barbara lane, Medford mass to address the council on the upcoming stem cell registration drive to be held at the Harvard harvest, your energy fest at the McGlynn school on Saturday, October 1st, 2016.

788
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:34,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome, Professor.

789
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:37,010
[SPEAKER_11]: State your name and address for the record.

790
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

791
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Rich Cormier, 026 Barbara Lane Medford.

792
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:42,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight I'm just kind of asking your support.

793
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:47,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the fact you're allowing me to speak on this very important subject.

794
01:09:48,215 --> 01:09:54,539
[SPEAKER_14]: On Saturday at the Harvester Energy Fest at the McGlynn School, we will be hosting a stem cell registration drive.

795
01:09:55,219 --> 01:10:03,143
[SPEAKER_14]: The good folks at Be The Match will be looking for people between the ages of 18 and 44 to simply swab their cheeks and possibly save a life.

796
01:10:04,388 --> 01:10:08,812
[SPEAKER_14]: In 2013, I was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer, myelofibrosis.

797
01:10:09,412 --> 01:10:12,935
[SPEAKER_14]: The only cure was a stem cell transplant, something I knew nothing about.

798
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:16,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I know more about it than I care to know.

799
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:19,321
[SPEAKER_14]: The first person tested as a match was my sister, and she didn't match.

800
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:25,166
[SPEAKER_14]: The doctors at Dana-Farber told me not to worry, that they would search the world for a donor to be the match.

801
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:28,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Fortunately, a donor was found in Germany.

802
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:31,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I received his life-saving cells on October 22, 2013.

803
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:41,304
[SPEAKER_14]: After a few bumps in the road, I'm happy to tell you that I no longer take any medication for my cancer, and I'm pretty much a survivor.

804
01:10:42,344 --> 01:10:53,048
[SPEAKER_14]: My friend here, Frank Zizzle, is also a recipient of stem cells, and he, too, is well on his way to survivorship.

805
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:57,250
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very important to people that have any kind of blood cancer.

806
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:02,832
[SPEAKER_14]: At our last registration two years ago, one of our registrants was chosen to donate

807
01:11:03,182 --> 01:11:04,883
[SPEAKER_14]: And last year, he made his donation.

808
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:08,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of you may know this hero as Curtis Tooden, who works at the high school.

809
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:14,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you guys to support this extremely important and life-saving event.

810
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:20,129
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't cost a dime to register, and it's an opportunity for the average person to become a genuine hero.

811
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could please get behind this and send as many people down to the McGlynn on Saturday, that would be outstanding.

812
01:11:25,892 --> 01:11:26,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

813
01:11:27,193 --> 01:11:27,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

814
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:28,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

815
01:11:29,073 --> 01:11:31,955
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can, first of all, thank you so much for bringing this forward.

816
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:40,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the two men in front of me and what you've done for our community is frightening to think this world without you two.

817
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:52,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you're both new grandparents and thanks to this process, it saves lives and I think it's so important.

818
01:11:52,395 --> 01:12:02,480
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could request the mayor's office to maybe put some information on the billboard and really push that effort and get the word out, not just to Medford residents,

819
01:12:03,283 --> 01:12:05,724
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody driving down 93, I think it's very important.

820
01:12:05,764 --> 01:12:09,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for bringing this up and thank God you with us.

821
01:12:09,286 --> 01:12:10,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations.

822
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:11,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

823
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:14,009
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended by councilor Scott Pelley, councilor Carr-Viello.

824
01:12:14,249 --> 01:12:14,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

825
01:12:14,849 --> 01:12:17,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you know, you know, I know these two gentlemen, I see them on a regular basis.

826
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:19,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they were there last year.

827
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:20,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Rick was there last year.

828
01:12:21,513 --> 01:12:23,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I tried to donate, but he told me I was too old.

829
01:12:24,814 --> 01:12:28,996
[SPEAKER_14]: They will, um, they will accept people above 44, but you have to pay a hundred dollars.

830
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:31,818
[SPEAKER_14]: And really statistics really show that.

831
01:12:32,353 --> 01:12:35,695
[SPEAKER_14]: The most successful ones are the ones between 18 and 44 years old.

832
01:12:36,296 --> 01:12:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, you guys do great work, and you're living proof of the great work that you do.

833
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll see you down there on Saturday.

834
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:43,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

835
01:12:43,982 --> 01:12:44,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

836
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:45,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

837
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:46,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

838
01:12:47,724 --> 01:12:48,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Pratt.

839
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:53,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank both Richard, Frank, and I appreciate their diligence on this.

840
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:55,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did have a question.

841
01:12:56,891 --> 01:13:00,894
[SPEAKER_06]: When you were out there last year, were you welcomed by people?

842
01:13:00,934 --> 01:13:01,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Were people skeptical?

843
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the type of feedback you got?

844
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:08,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's kind of funny because the name be the match.

845
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people think it's a dating service.

846
01:13:12,887 --> 01:13:14,067
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had that comment before.

847
01:13:14,127 --> 01:13:14,787
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm already married.

848
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:30,054
[SPEAKER_14]: But the fact of the matter is, um, once we explain to people what it is, uh, they do get the, the feeling that, you know, I believe this is becoming more and more, um, notable in, in the world when it started, when we, when Frank and I were sick, you know, just a couple of years ago,

849
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:36,329
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I knew about it was I thought stem cells had something to do with babies umbilical cords.

850
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:37,510
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'd ever heard about.

851
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:40,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I realize that there's so much more to it.

852
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:43,795
[SPEAKER_14]: The registry right now is up to about 13 million people worldwide.

853
01:13:44,355 --> 01:13:45,736
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I said, I got mine in Germany.

854
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:49,379
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I contacted my donor and we speak on a regular basis.

855
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:54,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just an amazing thing and we really do need them because

856
01:13:55,813 --> 01:14:00,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Frank and I both know a gentleman who 10 years ago died after having a bone marrow transplant.

857
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had both talked to our doctors about the same person.

858
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:08,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And the doctors all said, had this happened now, he would still be alive.

859
01:14:08,568 --> 01:14:09,890
[SPEAKER_14]: So the research is crazy.

860
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:12,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fact that they can do this, and it really

861
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, uh, I talked to Curtis.

862
01:14:15,269 --> 01:14:21,153
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a little painful for a couple of days before he did it because you've got to take medication that builds up your stem cells.

863
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:27,656
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the day of the donation, uh, you get a little tired, but he said, really the next day he was fine and it really wasn't so bad.

864
01:14:27,736 --> 01:14:31,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, um, and he probably saved somebody's life.

865
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:37,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even know that if he, if he knows his recipient yet, but, uh, I had to wait two years cause he was from Germany.

866
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:41,064
[SPEAKER_14]: I think people in the United States have to wait a year before they can find out who the donor is.

867
01:14:41,795 --> 01:14:42,215
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

868
01:14:42,255 --> 01:14:43,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks so much for your work, both of you.

869
01:14:43,835 --> 01:14:44,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

870
01:14:45,016 --> 01:14:45,776
Thank you.

871
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:47,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval as amended.

872
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,076
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

873
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:48,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

874
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:48,997
Opposed?

875
01:14:49,137 --> 01:14:50,197
Congratulations.

876
01:14:50,217 --> 01:14:52,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I have some papers I can leave with some information if you want.

877
01:14:52,998 --> 01:14:53,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do.

878
01:14:53,598 --> 01:14:56,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Messenger will take them.

879
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your ride.

880
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:11,162
While we're on suspension, we take 15-16-692, Philadelphia, Ocina, with 55 Grand Avenue Avenue to discuss

881
01:15:12,932 --> 01:15:21,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening councils.

882
01:15:23,798 --> 01:15:24,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

883
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me address you guys.

884
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:32,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, since the last meeting that we had in July 19,

885
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:39,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing has been done that nobody comes to the park to check if these people are still there or not.

886
01:15:40,067 --> 01:15:41,908
[SPEAKER_02]: These are outgoing every single day.

887
01:15:42,808 --> 01:15:54,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets frustrated, the people that cannot go down the park, because they see 15, 20 people standing around with 14, 15 dogs.

888
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of threatening to people that they want to go down the park.

889
01:16:00,863 --> 01:16:05,185
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last few months, one of my dogs was attacked by a half-fleshed dog.

890
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:11,608
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to be hospitalized and he had to be fixed.

891
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:17,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately to these people here, they don't care about nothing else but themselves.

892
01:16:21,377 --> 01:16:26,260
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a city ordinance that says no dogs allowed without leash.

893
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:41,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I was watching the AOL or Facebook, and there's people that criticize the police department because they're not enforcing that there isn't the Fourth of July fireworks.

894
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:45,133
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet for them, it's okay to break the laws, two laws.

895
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:49,917
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the half leash law, and second of all, the city ordinance.

896
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:57,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, come to find out that there is another ordinance that there is by the rules of the park, that there is no dogs allowed on the park.

897
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:04,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these dogs, they come near, they do whatever they have to do, they pee in the barrels and everything else.

898
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:12,278
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a city workers that they go and pick up those barrels to empty it out, and they have to touch those barrels.

899
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no line inside the barrels, and at times, there is the barrels, they don't get picked up, because they are off the side.

900
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:39,551
[SPEAKER_02]: When the mayor was down at South Method, at Tuff's Park, I pointed out to her that there was a barrel that, near the fence, there was a couple that had a brand-newborn baby.

901
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:45,128
[SPEAKER_02]: and the barrel was there that everybody threw dog poop inside there.

902
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:50,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell of that in the summertime, to me, affects the little baby.

903
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:54,393
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, it was moving across the park.

904
01:17:55,434 --> 01:18:02,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, across the park, there is a playground, and the other side of the fence, that there is two toddlers that they're there.

905
01:18:02,838 --> 01:18:08,422
[SPEAKER_02]: They're playing every day, but still they have to smell what's inside those barrels.

906
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:13,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I called the police several times at the time.

907
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:14,478
[SPEAKER_02]: There is nothing they can do.

908
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:21,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can we do something to break up this group and everything else?

909
01:18:23,346 --> 01:18:28,910
[SPEAKER_02]: To have it, you know, if they work the dogs by themselves and everything else, that's fine.

910
01:18:29,731 --> 01:18:33,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's intimidating when you try to go and watch a ball game.

911
01:18:34,592 --> 01:18:37,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is these dogs that, you know, they're jumping all over the place.

912
01:18:38,534 --> 01:18:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night I was down the park, there were a bulldog and a German shepherd that they were going after each other.

913
01:18:48,499 --> 01:18:50,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, to me, it's no safety.

914
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:56,442
[SPEAKER_02]: There is people that go down the park, young kids that were there, and they were petrified.

915
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:03,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They want their benefits for themselves.

916
01:19:03,066 --> 01:19:03,686
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look.

917
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: for the safety of people around.

918
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:17,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come to find out tonight that there is one of the guys that lives on Morton Ave, and he was talking with them.

919
01:19:17,316 --> 01:19:25,641
[SPEAKER_02]: There is people that come from Somerville, Cambridge, Arlington, and they come to the park because they're told that this is a great park to train their dogs.

920
01:19:26,882 --> 01:19:32,025
[SPEAKER_02]: These people, they want to police themselves, but yet, that to me is not policing.

921
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bullying people not to go down the park.

922
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I'm here, because there is a couple of things that happens.

923
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:48,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I address one person that says, you know, there is a leash law.

924
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:51,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was trying to be an Italian using the middle finger.

925
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: The next night, one of his friends that they're going down the park and socialize,

926
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:03,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It was trying to harass me and my wife that we were walking on Winchester Street.

927
01:20:06,054 --> 01:20:08,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not right, not for anybody.

928
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:12,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for me, not for anybody that lives in the neighborhood.

929
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:20,997
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can do something, let's try to find a solution so that nobody gets hurt.

930
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a couple of incidents in South Memphis that dogs on the other side of Main Street

931
01:20:29,035 --> 01:20:33,417
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be beating people and they'd be beating the dogs for themselves.

932
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a dog is a dog, no matter which way you look at it.

933
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:47,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there is a ball running and everything else, so the dog is going to go after the ball, there is a child, what is going to happen to that child or to that kid?

934
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:54,388
[SPEAKER_02]: South Memphis has been one of the greatest parks that there is for play ball and everything else.

935
01:20:55,282 --> 01:21:01,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is the way I understand that it's all true to the whole city.

936
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:07,126
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a community that people have been living in the city for a long period of time.

937
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:10,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there is new people coming in.

938
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:13,628
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the regular that they go down the park and take the leash off.

939
01:21:14,349 --> 01:21:18,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people moving in in the neighborhood, they're going to see the same thing, and they're going to be doing the same thing.

940
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we don't have 15, 20 dogs.

941
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:24,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got 30 or 40 dogs coming all over the place.

942
01:21:26,203 --> 01:21:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Tusk Park used to be full with people watching the ball game.

943
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:36,772
[SPEAKER_02]: The other night I went down there, it was like a ghost town because of the half-leashed dogs.

944
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:45,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do something about these half-leashed dogs because either kids or grown-ups, they're going to get hurt.

945
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the safety that I'm looking at.

946
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:52,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I raised my three kids up there at Tufts Park.

947
01:21:52,622 --> 01:22:01,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure other people that lived in the area that raised their children, they went down the park to play, not to watch dogs running around.

948
01:22:02,086 --> 01:22:10,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We always see that and respect that rule because the consequences of that can be played.

949
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:18,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you all to listen to me and see if we can do something about it.

950
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is coming down.

951
01:22:19,661 --> 01:22:23,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I called the police department that they don't even want to bother coming down.

952
01:22:27,766 --> 01:22:28,487
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not right.

953
01:22:30,588 --> 01:22:31,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all.

954
01:22:31,769 --> 01:22:32,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming down.

955
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:37,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ocino, the chair recognizes the gentleman from East Medford.

956
01:22:38,514 --> 01:22:38,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

957
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:42,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Please state your name and address for Andrew Castaneda, Cushman street method mass.

958
01:22:44,247 --> 01:22:45,969
[SPEAKER_16]: The man makes perfect sense.

959
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:47,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, I'm not a politician.

960
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:51,053
[SPEAKER_16]: You can tell by my choice of words or lack of choice words thereof.

961
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:57,418
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the name of safety, the law should not be broken, especially when there's children around.

962
01:22:58,419 --> 01:23:00,120
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not against all dogs.

963
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:03,162
[SPEAKER_16]: I like some dogs better than some people, I've stated many times.

964
01:23:03,823 --> 01:23:06,505
[SPEAKER_16]: However, please.

965
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:18,065
[SPEAKER_16]: have it fenced in, number one, and enforce your city ordinance or law, whatever you want to call it, as a leash law before someone gets maimed.

966
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:20,886
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, I repeat, the risk of being crude.

967
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:30,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I said this in front of higher-ups than here, that the average lawsuit in the United States for a dog biter is over $40,000 U.S.

968
01:23:30,729 --> 01:23:31,089
[SPEAKER_16]: dollars.

969
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:31,909
[SPEAKER_16]: Beware.

970
01:23:36,627 --> 01:23:37,728
[SPEAKER_16]: It's only a recommendation.

971
01:23:38,468 --> 01:23:42,130
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I'd never enjoy being bitten by any dogs.

972
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:44,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Please be careful.

973
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:46,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

974
01:23:47,874 --> 01:23:50,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes the citizen from Evans Street.

975
01:23:50,756 --> 01:23:51,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

976
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

977
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:56,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, not, not a rhetorical question.

978
01:23:56,839 --> 01:24:02,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Any update on the dog park, Mr. President that we know of?

979
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:03,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, nothing to report.

980
01:24:04,727 --> 01:24:08,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, with regards to dogs, I understand the man's concerns.

981
01:24:09,209 --> 01:24:24,917
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe the city should just utilize the reverse 311 or 911 it is and just, you know, remind people that when you got your dog out there to have them leashed, maybe periodic checks of proper registration and licensing.

982
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:32,340
[SPEAKER_19]: But by the same token, I mean, dogs are more than just pets to a lot of us out here.

983
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:34,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, they're, they're family members.

984
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:35,489
[SPEAKER_19]: They're, they're beloved.

985
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:39,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, they provide comfort, joy, protection.

986
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:48,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I don't want to see the dogs get a bad reputation on this cause I'm, I'm of the opinion that there are no bad dogs, just some bad owners.

987
01:24:49,135 --> 01:24:49,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

988
01:24:50,356 --> 01:24:50,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sir.

989
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:52,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

990
01:24:53,157 --> 01:24:55,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to refer the matter to the animal control officer, Mr. President.

991
01:24:55,498 --> 01:24:59,640
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to refer the matter to the animal control officer.

992
01:25:00,248 --> 01:25:02,990
[SPEAKER_11]: On that motion, the chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

993
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:03,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

994
01:25:04,611 --> 01:25:05,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel for Mr. Osino.

995
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:07,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a dog owner.

996
01:25:07,953 --> 01:25:09,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't let my dog off leash.

997
01:25:10,354 --> 01:25:14,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But the problem is, the group that's out there, they don't want a fence.

998
01:25:15,437 --> 01:25:22,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we do have a dog park, they don't want to go down there because they feel that they want their dogs to run around the park whenever they want.

999
01:25:23,382 --> 01:25:25,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not fair to the kids from St.

1000
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:27,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Clements who go down there and practice football.

1001
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:32,364
[SPEAKER_08]: that they'd be stepping in feces.

1002
01:25:32,384 --> 01:25:36,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they get out there to mow the lawn, they spread the feces all over.

1003
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:40,245
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't expect the DPW guys when they're mowing the lawn to get out there and clean up the feces.

1004
01:25:40,545 --> 01:25:43,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that ends up spreading it all over the place.

1005
01:25:43,566 --> 01:25:52,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I agree with Councilor Knight that we have the enforcement officer down there in the evening when they're out there in force, when St.

1006
01:25:53,008 --> 01:25:53,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Clement's kids leave.

1007
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:55,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and again,

1008
01:25:58,545 --> 01:26:05,768
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, you know, these people can say all they want about, you know, the dogs being in control, dogs awfully shot that, you know, they, they have the mind of their own.

1009
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:07,109
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to do what they want to do.

1010
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:15,813
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, uh, I would think, uh, I think we, we talked about this before about keeping the dogs in the fences, but this group doesn't want their dog fenced in.

1011
01:26:17,274 --> 01:26:17,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1012
01:26:17,654 --> 01:26:19,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor chair recognizes council Scott.

1013
01:26:20,135 --> 01:26:20,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that.

1014
01:26:21,036 --> 01:26:22,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1015
01:26:22,456 --> 01:26:26,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the last conversation we had about this, uh, this issue,

1016
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:46,072
[SPEAKER_05]: we're waiting on the park department to get back to us to see what affects having that area fenced off, how would it affect kids at play and permitting for that area before we gave up a viable athletic field to dogs.

1017
01:26:47,313 --> 01:26:54,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that Council Marks has worked very hard with his group and I know, you know, they just had their fundraiser last week and,

1018
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:59,386
[SPEAKER_05]: putting together a true dog park and, um, in our community.

1019
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:05,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but, uh, I, I, I can understand, uh, Mr Sino's, um, frustration.

1020
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:16,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know if we can ask the park board for that, that information, then look into moving forward of putting in, um, that fence, if so be it.

1021
01:27:16,769 --> 01:27:23,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we talked about that being a pilot program and, um, and then waiting for the health department,

1022
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: to get back to us, too, with some information.

1023
01:27:27,188 --> 01:27:35,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other issue was whether it was a business or not, whether someone was holding a private business on our field for dog training.

1024
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:39,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that has to be investigated, too.

1025
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:47,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe that's what we can have the health department was doing an investigation and some research to see if that was happening.

1026
01:27:47,993 --> 01:27:48,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1027
01:27:50,293 --> 01:27:52,735
[SPEAKER_11]: on the motion of a point of information.

1028
01:27:52,755 --> 01:27:53,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel Max.

1029
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:54,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1030
01:27:54,577 --> 01:28:02,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to address council Scott Pelley's, uh, concern with, uh, the paper that we did forward, there were a number of questions we forward to the park board.

1031
01:28:02,563 --> 01:28:11,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I happened to bump into a chairman Graham, uh, last week and I asked him about the pay because it's been some time and he said they never received any paper from the council.

1032
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:17,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so that's what he stated to me, uh, because I know there was a number of requests,

1033
01:28:17,662 --> 01:28:24,524
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, for them to look at maybe alternate parks, other areas that may be suitable for, uh, dog parks and so forth.

1034
01:28:25,164 --> 01:28:29,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so that's the response I received from him.

1035
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:29,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so you know.

1036
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

1037
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:35,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have the clerk look, uh, revisit that and go back to that?

1038
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:37,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I can call in the morning.

1039
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:41,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I have my paperwork at home on that date and see if we can send that out.

1040
01:28:41,908 --> 01:28:43,708
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, if we can ask again,

1041
01:28:44,497 --> 01:28:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: for the Park Board to update us on those concerns.

1042
01:28:47,978 --> 01:28:48,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1043
01:28:48,678 --> 01:28:52,659
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1044
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:54,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1045
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

1046
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all are tired of my sob story.

1047
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:04,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I'm tired of my sob story about off-leash dogs.

1048
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:10,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Caveat that what happened to me did not happen in the city of Medford, but off-leash dogs is off-leash dogs.

1049
01:29:10,782 --> 01:29:11,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they know where they live.

1050
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: While I am extremely grateful for and proud of my new guide, Doug, who is making her debut here tonight, I am terribly sorry that people don't want a fence.

1051
01:29:29,478 --> 01:29:31,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you a little bit about what I want.

1052
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my old guide, Doug, back.

1053
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I want not to have to have dug a Pomeranian out of his back paw while he screamed.

1054
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:40,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

1055
01:29:41,124 --> 01:29:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I want not to have had to end

1056
01:29:44,365 --> 01:29:53,812
[SPEAKER_04]: our partnership after three years because he was attacked by off-leash dogs multiple times and became overly reactive as a result.

1057
01:29:54,972 --> 01:30:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the two weeks back that I just spent while I had a lovely time on Long Island getting this dog.

1058
01:30:02,437 --> 01:30:03,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to take time off work.

1059
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:12,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my colleagues would like to have had me back there so that I could submit the reports that were due to our funding agency, but no, I had to bail on them.

1060
01:30:13,028 --> 01:30:22,253
[SPEAKER_04]: because my independence and my safety were compromised because people couldn't leash their frickin' dogs.

1061
01:30:24,474 --> 01:30:32,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that my guide dog school would probably like back the $50,000 that it cost to train a guide dog team.

1062
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:41,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like maybe to not have to have experienced the trauma that we went through

1063
01:30:42,087 --> 01:30:49,270
[SPEAKER_04]: The two months that my dog was at the guide dog school trying to be retrained while I waited to see if it was a fixable situation, it was not.

1064
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:52,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like that.

1065
01:30:53,351 --> 01:30:57,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, as the philosopher Jagger once said, you can't always get what you want.

1066
01:30:59,494 --> 01:31:02,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry those guys don't want a fence.

1067
01:31:04,867 --> 01:31:12,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even tell you how high I jumped when we practiced dog distraction when I was on class with this girl, who is a gem, by the way.

1068
01:31:13,982 --> 01:31:18,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And we walked by a house with a fence around it that had

1069
01:31:19,633 --> 01:31:21,514
[SPEAKER_04]: this little, you know, barky dog.

1070
01:31:22,094 --> 01:31:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: They do that, it's cool, it was behind a fence.

1071
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:30,218
[SPEAKER_04]: But it reminded me so much of what had happened, and I just jumped a mile, and she handled it like it was nothing.

1072
01:31:31,379 --> 01:31:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bring that with me everywhere I go, whenever I leave my house with my dog, that I don't know if this dog is gonna be attacked again, if I'm gonna have to go through that again, if we're gonna have to go through that.

1073
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:46,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I want not to have that happen, but I don't get that.

1074
01:31:48,242 --> 01:31:51,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry they don't want a fence.

1075
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:55,091
[SPEAKER_04]: What we need is a dog park because I also believe that dogs need to run free.

1076
01:31:55,131 --> 01:31:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: This dog works really hard.

1077
01:31:56,633 --> 01:31:57,895
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to blow off steam.

1078
01:31:57,915 --> 01:32:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: When she blows off steam, she looks like a psychotic rabbit.

1079
01:32:00,358 --> 01:32:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's amazing.

1080
01:32:04,373 --> 01:32:08,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So I realize that's an important part of happy, healthy dogs, particularly dogs who have stressful jobs.

1081
01:32:09,218 --> 01:32:10,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you need a dog park.

1082
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:12,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you need places with fences.

1083
01:32:13,422 --> 01:32:20,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe your dog likes to run wild and free, and you don't have a fenced-in yard, which I can sympathize with that.

1084
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:28,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to share the world with people, and some of those people also have dogs that have particular things that they do.

1085
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:35,614
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm able to get around in more or less one piece in part because of the work that my dog does.

1086
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:40,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say, if you've got a dog, leash it.

1087
01:32:41,137 --> 01:32:41,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to kill it.

1088
01:32:42,498 --> 01:32:44,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It might kill mine otherwise.

1089
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, even your special snowflake dog.

1090
01:32:48,502 --> 01:32:55,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can do something to help make sure that this city is safe for

1091
01:32:56,988 --> 01:33:06,333
[SPEAKER_04]: dogs and people, particularly people with service dogs, but you know, dogs and people in general, I'm in favor of doing that because I really don't ever, ever, ever want to go through that again.

1092
01:33:06,453 --> 01:33:06,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1093
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:08,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1094
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:15,898
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of counseling night, it's your cue not working.

1095
01:33:16,598 --> 01:33:16,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1096
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:17,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1097
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:24,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Mr. Capucci asked for an update on the dog park and there actually is an update, uh, tomorrow evening,

1098
01:33:25,303 --> 01:33:33,249
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, at 6 PM in the mayor's office, the dog park committee is meeting with the mayor and the architect for a new dog park.

1099
01:33:34,089 --> 01:33:41,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, by this time next year, we anticipate to have the full build out of, uh, the park for larger dogs.

1100
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:50,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, hopefully shortly after that, we'll have an adjacent park right next to the big dog park for small dogs.

1101
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:52,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh,

1102
01:33:53,257 --> 01:33:59,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the reason why we're having some fundraisers to pay for the additional small dog park.

1103
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:01,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're almost there at our goal.

1104
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: The committee's working very hard and I think people can anticipate by this time next year, we will have a place where dogs can socialize and exercise.

1105
01:34:12,509 --> 01:34:14,670
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the state of the art dog park.

1106
01:34:15,431 --> 01:34:22,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing I do want to say, and I've spoken to Mr. Orsino a number of times, and I think he said one word that

1107
01:34:22,835 --> 01:34:25,836
[SPEAKER_06]: really struck home with me, he said, solution.

1108
01:34:27,117 --> 01:34:32,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And from what I'm hearing from Mr. Orsino is, I don't think he's anti-dogs.

1109
01:34:32,779 --> 01:34:37,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he's anti having people run their dogs, but he wants a solution.

1110
01:34:38,742 --> 01:34:43,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my opinion, we have the luxury of having 23 parks.

1111
01:34:43,864 --> 01:34:47,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to any surrounding community and say, do you have 23 parks throughout your city?

1112
01:34:48,706 --> 01:34:49,566
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unheard of.

1113
01:34:50,466 --> 01:34:51,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't see why,

1114
01:34:52,484 --> 01:35:04,932
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't accommodate, and I realize a dog park is a fence and so forth, but we can't accommodate the needs of maybe a group or many people that feel they want to run their dogs free.

1115
01:35:05,353 --> 01:35:18,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't imagine in the city that we can't create some type of area that has natural barriers that wouldn't be nestled within a neighborhood of homes, which does create a concern.

1116
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:23,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't believe we can't resolve this issue to allow it.

1117
01:35:24,235 --> 01:35:32,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, in my opinion, I've said this since I've been on the council, you know, years ago, these parks were utilized 110% throughout the community.

1118
01:35:33,099 --> 01:35:37,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're at half capacity at best throughout the community.

1119
01:35:37,842 --> 01:35:39,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we really need to utilize it.

1120
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:48,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really, there's a group of citizens working on finding a park area that's not nestled in within the neighborhood,

1121
01:35:48,553 --> 01:35:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: that may have natural barriers.

1122
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:57,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be the perfect place to run your dog that's not going to have interference with people that may want to use the park.

1123
01:35:58,001 --> 01:36:07,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may be the starting point in this community because, you know, I've been active in the last couple of years with people that are pushing for a dog park.

1124
01:36:07,949 --> 01:36:09,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you 99.9% of them are responsible dog owners.

1125
01:36:12,913 --> 01:36:13,594
[SPEAKER_06]: They really are.

1126
01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:15,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And they pick up after themselves.

1127
01:36:16,576 --> 01:36:17,997
[SPEAKER_06]: These dogs become their kids.

1128
01:36:18,978 --> 01:36:21,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it the last weekend when we did the dog wash.

1129
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:27,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't want to paint a broad stroke about people that own dogs and so forth.

1130
01:36:28,084 --> 01:36:30,846
[SPEAKER_06]: But what Mr. Orsino said really struck a chord with me.

1131
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, find a solution.

1132
01:36:33,308 --> 01:36:35,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So he didn't say, I never want to see a dog in a park again.

1133
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,251
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, find a solution.

1134
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:39,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And the solution, in my opinion,

1135
01:36:40,487 --> 01:36:55,532
[SPEAKER_06]: exists within our community, we just have to put all our heads together and say, what's the best way of providing public safety but also allowing people in an area that's, you know, appropriate to run their dog free?

1136
01:36:56,493 --> 01:37:00,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't see a problem with it, Mr. President.

1137
01:37:00,694 --> 01:37:02,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope we get to that point.

1138
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:08,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope CAMA heads prevail and we're able to get to a point where

1139
01:37:08,814 --> 01:37:14,436
[SPEAKER_06]: We can all coexist together, and everyone can have their little piece of the pie in the community.

1140
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:16,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, why they move to the city?

1141
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:19,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people may move here because there's a lot of parks.

1142
01:37:19,518 --> 01:37:21,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people may move here because it's dog-friendly.

1143
01:37:21,979 --> 01:37:24,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people may move here because we have parking enforcement.

1144
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:25,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1145
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:27,982
[SPEAKER_06]: People come to the city for many different reasons.

1146
01:37:28,702 --> 01:37:32,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would hate to limit those reasons, Mr. President, in this community.

1147
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:34,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So, those are my thoughts, Mr. President.

1148
01:37:34,945 --> 01:37:38,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope we can all get together and try to resolve this important issue.

1149
01:37:39,419 --> 01:37:41,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say something?

1150
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:46,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a park on Main Street, Brooke Park.

1151
01:37:47,807 --> 01:37:53,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got trees all over the place that have closed up the park, and it's a way open.

1152
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:56,236
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no children going in there.

1153
01:37:58,078 --> 01:38:02,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can deviate these people to go over there.

1154
01:38:04,934 --> 01:38:07,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I say, I had three kids, they grew up there.

1155
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:17,380
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last 40 years that I've been there, that I've lived in the city of Memphis, I noticed many, many kids that come through the park.

1156
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:20,261
[SPEAKER_02]: The youth league was there.

1157
01:38:20,581 --> 01:38:23,843
[SPEAKER_02]: The soccer practice is over there.

1158
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:27,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a park where kids come in, there is the pool that they go there.

1159
01:38:29,662 --> 01:38:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying, you know, don't give them the freedom that the dog deserve, but also let's put them someplace where there is no children that they're involved.

1160
01:38:39,648 --> 01:38:41,129
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to police themselves.

1161
01:38:41,389 --> 01:38:47,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's a word that was used many times.

1162
01:38:47,832 --> 01:38:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we bullying people not to come down the park when we are here.

1163
01:38:53,898 --> 01:38:59,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one is from six o'clock in the morning to eight o'clock in the morning, and six o'clock at night to eight o'clock at night.

1164
01:39:00,523 --> 01:39:03,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, six o'clock, that is the games, the ball games are going on.

1165
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:08,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have dogs running around, who wants to go and watch it?

1166
01:39:09,289 --> 01:39:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we go to the Red Sox game and take our dogs with us?

1167
01:39:16,817 --> 01:39:19,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can go see the Patriots and we take the dogs with us.

1168
01:39:22,661 --> 01:39:23,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I got three of them.

1169
01:39:25,743 --> 01:39:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you know what, if we can demediate them to go to Brook Park, which there is, you know, more enough space to let them running around, I would appreciate it.

1170
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:39,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1171
01:39:39,994 --> 01:39:40,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1172
01:39:40,954 --> 01:39:41,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Cappiello.

1173
01:39:42,055 --> 01:39:42,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1174
01:39:44,397 --> 01:39:46,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Osino off at Brooks Park, I think,

1175
01:39:46,923 --> 01:39:51,588
[SPEAKER_08]: The neighbors of Brooks Park will tell you, you get down there, the park is loaded with feces.

1176
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:58,895
[SPEAKER_08]: DPW has been down there many times to pick their feces from dogs who run around there and the owners who don't pick up after them.

1177
01:39:59,496 --> 01:39:59,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

1178
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:01,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1179
01:40:01,358 --> 01:40:02,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we want to enrage another group.

1180
01:40:05,282 --> 01:40:05,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, ma'am.

1181
01:40:06,082 --> 01:40:07,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1182
01:40:08,226 --> 01:40:09,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Cheryl Rodriguez.

1183
01:40:09,607 --> 01:40:15,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street, and I have a skittish rescue dog who's been attacked by an off-leash dog in the city of Medford.

1184
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:19,752
[SPEAKER_01]: But what no one is mentioning is that we do have the sheepfold.

1185
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:29,818
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate enough to have the fowls in the city of Medford, and that is an off-leash area in the natural setting, which I don't go to because my dog is afraid.

1186
01:40:30,578 --> 01:40:34,201
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's perfectly fine for people who want their dogs to run loose.

1187
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:47,112
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest complaint I hear about that is that people don't pick up their dog feces, but it is something that maybe these groups can embrace and take care of and clean up because we're very fortunate to have the Fells.

1188
01:40:47,132 --> 01:40:50,214
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't have all this green space and we should take advantage of it.

1189
01:40:51,015 --> 01:40:52,896
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Knight as amended.

1190
01:40:52,956 --> 01:40:53,817
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1191
01:40:54,177 --> 01:40:54,698
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1192
01:40:54,718 --> 01:40:55,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

1193
01:40:56,539 --> 01:40:59,862
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran to return to the regular order of business.

1194
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:01,206
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favour?

1195
01:41:01,386 --> 01:41:02,126
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1196
01:41:02,467 --> 01:41:04,568
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion carries.

1197
01:41:04,588 --> 01:41:07,230
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-684 offered by Vice President Lungo Kern.

1198
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:25,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that our administration ensure that the traffic engineer for the proposed development at the old Malden Hospital site studies the surrounding Medford roads and does a traffic impact study in Medford in addition to any study being done in Malden and its traffic impact.

1199
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:29,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas Malden will be getting a donation of two acres of land

1200
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:40,308
[SPEAKER_11]: a $440,000 donation for public improvements and seven acres of trees preserved if the proposal at the Malden Hospital site comes to fruition.

1201
01:41:40,748 --> 01:41:52,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford get in contact with the potential developer to discuss what donations Medford will receive for the impact we will have on our traffic and roads.

1202
01:41:53,176 --> 01:41:54,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Vice President.

1203
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:02,871
[SPEAKER_21]: You're there, thank you.

1204
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:03,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.

1205
01:42:04,412 --> 01:42:04,832
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

1206
01:42:04,872 --> 01:42:06,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

1207
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:15,601
[SPEAKER_21]: I think my resolution basically sums it up, but last Thursday there was a meeting at the actual site of the Malden Hospital.

1208
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:24,849
[SPEAKER_21]: Tents were set up, donuts and coffee was being passed out, and the developers, including their team, were present at this meeting.

1209
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:28,512
[SPEAKER_21]: And there was a number of Medford residents and a number of Malden residents.

1210
01:42:29,341 --> 01:42:42,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Maldon City officials that were present and this is the same developer that proposed a project there last year and this year obviously they heard the concerns of Maldon residents and they toned it down.

1211
01:42:44,287 --> 01:42:58,552
[SPEAKER_21]: The site was toned down a significant amount from last year but it's still a massive, massive development with apartments, condos, townhouses, and obviously an issue

1212
01:42:59,929 --> 01:43:08,216
[SPEAKER_21]: There's definitely issues concerning the environment and traffic and the swimming pool that's going to be very close to Medford.

1213
01:43:08,236 --> 01:43:23,087
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a number of different things that were brought up at that meeting, but one of the big things that was discussed was the traffic impact, and I think that's something that Medford is very concerned with, and we should be, because you're looking at 450 potential plus cars that are going

1214
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:38,724
[SPEAKER_21]: be on this site and traveling through our neighborhoods, through our streets, Murray Hill Road, which already gets a significant amount of traffic, is going to be greatly impacted.

1215
01:43:39,324 --> 01:43:50,807
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would just ask that we make sure, and I know the administration, I'm not sure if the administration is, how on top of it they are, but I know we are, we have requested an update from the administration.

1216
01:43:50,827 --> 01:43:56,188
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a little concerned that nobody from the administration was at this meeting, but I'm hoping

1217
01:43:56,649 --> 01:44:07,156
[SPEAKER_21]: In the background, they are discussing this with the Malden administration to make sure that our needs are met, and the traffic engineer, a big part of this is the traffic engineer that's gonna be hired.

1218
01:44:07,576 --> 01:44:15,061
[SPEAKER_21]: He has not done his study yet, and he is the same traffic engineer that worked on the Locust Street development, which concerns me.

1219
01:44:15,581 --> 01:44:22,946
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would just ask that we make sure that traffic study is done on our roads on that side of the project.

1220
01:44:23,865 --> 01:44:38,449
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that is gonna be huge, and I just don't wanna come two, three months from now looking at a traffic study where Medford wasn't included in this, and that was the loudest voice in the audience, the Medford residents worried about traffic.

1221
01:44:39,229 --> 01:44:41,170
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's my first part of the resolution.

1222
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:46,431
[SPEAKER_21]: The second part is with regards to what these developers are gonna give the city of Malden.

1223
01:44:46,771 --> 01:44:50,052
[SPEAKER_21]: It's seven acres of land, donation of $448,000 for public improvements,

1224
01:44:55,308 --> 01:45:12,858
[SPEAKER_21]: what is the developer, if this potentially moves forward, what are we doing to ensure that we're gonna get, number one, a traffic study done on our side of the project, but also what else, has anybody been negotiating anything, I guess is my question.

1225
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:23,245
[SPEAKER_21]: If the city of Memphis wasn't there and I'm not sure what action we've taken, I just wanna push this issue and make sure our administration gets into,

1226
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:29,153
[SPEAKER_21]: really understands what this project entails and see what we can do to protect our neighborhood.

1227
01:45:30,153 --> 01:45:33,374
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would just ask for support of the resolve.

1228
01:45:33,394 --> 01:45:36,836
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there are two big things that came out of Thursday's meeting.

1229
01:45:37,396 --> 01:45:47,921
[SPEAKER_21]: Another thing that we probably will be doing is setting up an ad hoc second meeting, inviting the neighbors down, inviting the chief of police, and working to protect our roads and neighborhood.

1230
01:45:48,781 --> 01:45:52,203
[SPEAKER_21]: But for now, I think this is important, and I would hope

1231
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:56,313
[SPEAKER_21]: we can pass this and we can get some movement from city hall.

1232
01:45:57,513 --> 01:46:00,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Vice President chair recognizes councilor Falco.

1233
01:46:00,555 --> 01:46:00,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1234
01:46:01,096 --> 01:46:01,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1235
01:46:02,116 --> 01:46:05,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, I want to thank, uh, council Longo current for bringing this forward tonight.

1236
01:46:05,879 --> 01:46:13,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, it's an important resolution and this is an issue that really, uh, impacts the North Bedford neighborhoods, um, in a major way.

1237
01:46:13,724 --> 01:46:18,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the, the project has been scaled down, but the number of cars that are, um,

1238
01:46:19,765 --> 01:46:28,329
[SPEAKER_12]: As Councillor Longo-Kern said, the number of cars that are going to impact or going to be added to the daily traffic patterns in that neighborhood are up to 400, 500 cars.

1239
01:46:28,349 --> 01:46:29,870
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a major impact.

1240
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:34,071
[SPEAKER_12]: My concern, I guess, is with the traffic engineer.

1241
01:46:34,592 --> 01:46:42,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Earlier in the year, I mentioned or actually offered a resolution that the city hire a traffic engineer, and this is one of the best examples why we should have one.

1242
01:46:43,175 --> 01:46:46,457
[SPEAKER_12]: We should not be trusting the traffic study

1243
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:49,391
[SPEAKER_12]: from a developer in run with that.

1244
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:58,654
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the developers paying the traffic engineer for a study, I'm sure the traffic engineer is going to benefit the developer in a lot of ways.

1245
01:46:58,734 --> 01:47:04,396
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to have an independent traffic engineer take a look at this situation and take a look at the method roads.

1246
01:47:04,856 --> 01:47:15,320
[SPEAKER_12]: If the city's not going to hire a full-time traffic engineer, I look at a case like this, I look at a case like Locust Street, we should be consulting or hiring our own traffic engineer as a consultant

1247
01:47:15,723 --> 01:47:18,906
[SPEAKER_12]: to work on specific projects if we're not going to hire one full time.

1248
01:47:19,506 --> 01:47:32,036
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where we need an independent voice to take a look at the traffic patterns and how a development like this is going to impact our community and especially the North Bedford area.

1249
01:47:33,117 --> 01:47:39,643
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an important topic and it's going to affect and impact the quality of life for many residents.

1250
01:47:40,784 --> 01:47:44,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyone that drives through North Bedford knows the small roads, the winding roads,

1251
01:47:45,631 --> 01:47:51,696
[SPEAKER_12]: And the traffic is bad now, trying to add 500 cars to that, I can't even imagine.

1252
01:47:52,196 --> 01:47:54,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the major safety concerns there.

1253
01:47:54,738 --> 01:48:09,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like to amend the resolution to actually, to have the city hire a traffic consultant to look at this project and give us an independent view of how the traffic is going to impact the North Bedford neighborhoods.

1254
01:48:10,751 --> 01:48:14,234
[SPEAKER_11]: On the main motion amended by Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli.

1255
01:48:15,093 --> 01:48:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1256
01:48:16,094 --> 01:48:23,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I, too, would like to thank my colleagues Solongo Kern and John Falco.

1257
01:48:23,819 --> 01:48:25,980
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our neighborhood.

1258
01:48:26,361 --> 01:48:44,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And the phone calls I received over the past week, especially with the frustration of neighbors that are so upset that the talk of even moving out of that neighborhood where they've lived and their families have grown up for years

1259
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: over something this daunting is frightening.

1260
01:48:49,030 --> 01:49:01,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what's important is we really need to inform our neighbors in that area in what is happening on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis, because their voices need to be heard.

1261
01:49:01,995 --> 01:49:14,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's so important that not only that project, but as you move further down the road on the other side of Highland, you have the New England Memorial site that still

1262
01:49:14,645 --> 01:49:17,767
[SPEAKER_05]: has to be vetted and figured out what was going to happen there.

1263
01:49:17,867 --> 01:49:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, with those two projects, the size of those two projects, that will destroy that neighborhood.

1264
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:26,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, one alone is frightening.

1265
01:49:27,091 --> 01:49:29,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to figure out a way.

1266
01:49:29,272 --> 01:49:34,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there was a moratorium in Malden to hold off on that site.

1267
01:49:34,255 --> 01:49:37,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And as obviously it's been lifted and they're moving forward.

1268
01:49:37,856 --> 01:49:42,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to really get on board and ask our administration to

1269
01:49:43,706 --> 01:49:51,450
[SPEAKER_05]: have a sit down if not, uh, us request to sit down with the delegates from Malden to maybe educate us a little bit.

1270
01:49:51,950 --> 01:50:00,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and what's going on because I knew there was, there were a few Malden, uh, representatives, uh, that were totally against this project.

1271
01:50:00,454 --> 01:50:03,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So it, it didn't flow too easily there either.

1272
01:50:03,915 --> 01:50:10,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I say we, you know, I, I, like I said, I echo my, my concerns.

1273
01:50:10,889 --> 01:50:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: for my neighbors and my colleagues.

1274
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1275
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:15,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

1276
01:50:15,891 --> 01:50:16,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1277
01:50:17,492 --> 01:50:18,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1278
01:50:18,352 --> 01:50:22,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Councilor Longo-Kern for her persistency on this issue.

1279
01:50:23,455 --> 01:50:27,997
[SPEAKER_06]: She's kept it at the forefront, uh, and, uh, uh, the issue out there.

1280
01:50:28,517 --> 01:50:32,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's going to reap benefits the longer we stay on top of this.

1281
01:50:33,079 --> 01:50:35,640
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the, the one thing I did find interesting,

1282
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:45,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it was regarding the locus street project is that, uh, I talked to a few people while that was going on and, uh, we heard tonight that you're right.

1283
01:50:45,835 --> 01:50:55,038
[SPEAKER_06]: The developer comes in, they do their traffic study, they do their environmental study and they're paying for these tens of thousands of dollars in studies.

1284
01:50:55,898 --> 01:50:59,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, the residents don't get a chance to get a study.

1285
01:51:00,597 --> 01:51:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: But during the Locust Street project, I had someone state to me that there's a general law.

1286
01:51:06,739 --> 01:51:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget the site and section of the general law, but it states that the developer is on the hook.

1287
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:25,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So when a developer comes in and they do their, you know, public safety site study, traffic study, they also have to foot the bill for the local municipality at the request of the local municipality.

1288
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,423
[SPEAKER_06]: In the case of Locust street, this city didn't request our own study.

1289
01:51:30,883 --> 01:51:33,165
[SPEAKER_06]: We went based on the study of the developer.

1290
01:51:33,665 --> 01:51:42,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever that study said about the traffic impact and the congestion and so forth, um, the environmental impact, we took that as gospel.

1291
01:51:43,592 --> 01:51:51,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, I don't know if it's too late or not with this particular project, but I think we should offer a motion if council longer doesn't mind.

1292
01:51:51,532 --> 01:52:03,377
[SPEAKER_06]: that this city requests from the developer our own traffic study, our own environmental impact study from our own independent hiree, Mr. President.

1293
01:52:04,037 --> 01:52:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would, in my opinion, be a suggestion.

1294
01:52:07,539 --> 01:52:10,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to go based on what we're hearing.

1295
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:14,242
[SPEAKER_06]: We heard on Locust Street, no impact.

1296
01:52:14,262 --> 01:52:18,264
[SPEAKER_06]: 490 units on a street that's the width of a dime.

1297
01:52:18,784 --> 01:52:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no impact on traffic.

1298
01:52:21,842 --> 01:52:24,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So, these studies, it's like expert witnesses.

1299
01:52:25,043 --> 01:52:26,383
[SPEAKER_06]: You have two doctors that come in.

1300
01:52:26,723 --> 01:52:31,264
[SPEAKER_06]: One doctor in court swears by one thing, and the other doctor swears by something totally different.

1301
01:52:32,424 --> 01:52:46,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I would ask that if my council colleague doesn't mind that we amend the paper to request the administration ask that an independent traffic study and environmental study be done at the expense of the developer, Mr. President.

1302
01:52:47,126 --> 01:52:49,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could find that site and section.

1303
01:52:49,907 --> 01:52:50,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have it with me.

1304
01:52:51,382 --> 01:52:52,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a general law.

1305
01:52:54,264 --> 01:52:55,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counselor.

1306
01:52:55,165 --> 01:52:56,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Vice President La Lucre.

1307
01:52:57,166 --> 01:52:59,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Deller, so I'll be brief.

1308
01:52:59,448 --> 01:53:13,398
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with my colleagues, and I think maybe we should pursue all three avenues, because to get a traffic engineer or to get money for a traffic study, I mean, that sounds all well and good, but we didn't even have anybody from the administration at this meeting.

1309
01:53:14,638 --> 01:53:15,719
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is happening soon.

1310
01:53:17,759 --> 01:53:24,502
[SPEAKER_21]: moratorium is being lifted in December, and then the city council is going to be asked to vote for a zoning change of that district.

1311
01:53:24,602 --> 01:53:44,812
[SPEAKER_21]: I've reached out to one city councilor, who I'm going to have a phone call with either Thursday or Friday, and then move on to the rest, trying to get an idea where the council stands, because there was a number of councilors in the attendance on Thursday, and there were some with concerns, how many children it's going to add to the Malden public schools, et cetera, et cetera.

1312
01:53:45,195 --> 01:53:51,758
[SPEAKER_21]: But for Medford, it's our streets, it's our neighborhoods, it's the residents that live and are gonna deal with the traffic.

1313
01:53:51,858 --> 01:53:53,219
[SPEAKER_21]: It's us who live in the area.

1314
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,380
[SPEAKER_21]: I can barely get down Fulton Street on any given day.

1315
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:59,802
[SPEAKER_21]: It takes me 25 minutes and my kids are almost late for school.

1316
01:54:00,142 --> 01:54:01,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Forget about Elm Street.

1317
01:54:01,222 --> 01:54:06,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't even think any of us even wanna dare go down Elm Street, but it's gonna affect all those roads.

1318
01:54:07,385 --> 01:54:09,386
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is something that we need to stay on top of.

1319
01:54:09,446 --> 01:54:10,346
[SPEAKER_21]: I like the amendments.

1320
01:54:10,426 --> 01:54:13,948
[SPEAKER_21]: I think any avenue we can get to make sure that the traffic study is done

1321
01:54:15,086 --> 01:54:19,008
[SPEAKER_21]: on our roads as well is a plus in my book.

1322
01:54:19,028 --> 01:54:19,768
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get it done.

1323
01:54:19,808 --> 01:54:22,049
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's ask the administration, please get on top of this.

1324
01:54:22,469 --> 01:54:23,649
[SPEAKER_21]: We've been asking for a year.

1325
01:54:23,689 --> 01:54:26,170
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a developer who, it is massive.

1326
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:29,132
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a six story complex.

1327
01:54:29,212 --> 01:54:39,536
[SPEAKER_21]: It's shaped like an E and there are houses all around with, you know, it's still massive, better than before, but it's massive and we need to get a handle on it before it's too late.

1328
01:54:40,336 --> 01:54:41,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1329
01:54:41,496 --> 01:54:42,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Cavillo.

1330
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:44,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1331
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:54,764
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can further amend that, if we could have invited the developer to come down to Medford and make a presentation to the council, the whole, or to this whole body with residents here.

1332
01:54:55,425 --> 01:55:04,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, for the ones who weren't able to go to that meeting, uh, and would give us a chance to question that developer personally, uh, without the Malden people there.

1333
01:55:05,028 --> 01:55:11,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I, if I could add that to the paper also, Mr. President, as amended by council Caviello chair recognizes the citizen at the podium,

1334
01:55:11,801 --> 01:55:14,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome again, and please state your name and address for the record.

1335
01:55:14,942 --> 01:55:16,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1336
01:55:16,263 --> 01:55:17,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1337
01:55:18,103 --> 01:55:29,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended the Malden Hospital meeting, and they scaled down the project from 350 to 314, 444 parking spaces, and they were also asking to be able to park on street.

1338
01:55:29,822 --> 01:55:31,904
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about at least 500 cars.

1339
01:55:32,645 --> 01:55:45,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another meeting after that meeting and I map quested how to get to 93 from there and it takes you down Murray Hill Road, right onto Fells Ave, right onto Vista Ave, which becomes Fulton Street Road.

1340
01:55:46,517 --> 01:55:47,678
[SPEAKER_01]: than left onto Fulton.

1341
01:55:48,038 --> 01:55:56,865
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been down Fulton Street Road, my daughter's best friend lives off of there, the cars are parked on both sides of the street and it is single wide down the middle.

1342
01:55:57,265 --> 01:56:05,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone is coming during rush hour, I often see people backing up because two cars can't fit down at the same time.

1343
01:56:05,471 --> 01:56:14,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add an additional 500 cars to that road because the traffic engineer there did state, yeah, this is probably not a transit community

1344
01:56:15,012 --> 01:56:17,053
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a car-heavy community.

1345
01:56:17,534 --> 01:56:22,857
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to expect hundreds of cars going down these very small roads, and we need to be concerned.

1346
01:56:22,917 --> 01:56:28,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to make strong efforts to make sure that the neighbors are aware so this doesn't sneak up on them.

1347
01:56:29,421 --> 01:56:29,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1348
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:30,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1349
01:56:30,982 --> 01:56:36,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the motion of Vice President Lungel-Kern, as amended by Councilors Falco, Marks, and Caviello.

1350
01:56:37,239 --> 01:56:38,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1351
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:46,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion of approval by Vice President Lungo Kern as amended, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1352
01:56:47,404 --> 01:56:48,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caviello?

1353
01:56:48,245 --> 01:56:48,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1354
01:56:49,285 --> 01:56:49,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco?

1355
01:56:50,186 --> 01:56:50,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1356
01:56:50,906 --> 01:56:51,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

1357
01:56:51,546 --> 01:56:51,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1358
01:56:52,187 --> 01:56:53,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Lungo Kern?

1359
01:56:53,187 --> 01:56:53,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1360
01:56:53,747 --> 01:56:54,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks?

1361
01:56:54,648 --> 01:56:54,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1362
01:56:55,128 --> 01:56:55,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1363
01:56:55,869 --> 01:56:56,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1364
01:56:56,989 --> 01:56:57,770
[SPEAKER_11]: President Del Rosso?

1365
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:58,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1366
01:56:58,370 --> 01:57:02,752
[SPEAKER_11]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes as amended.

1367
01:57:02,772 --> 01:57:04,193
[SPEAKER_11]: 16-685 offered by Councilor Marks.

1368
01:57:06,939 --> 01:57:18,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the city solicitor, Mark Rumley, update the Medford City Council regarding the current legal status of the Hegner Center property located on Maple Park Avenue.

1369
01:57:18,709 --> 01:57:19,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor.

1370
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1371
01:57:21,491 --> 01:57:30,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Within the past year, we received a paper from the administration regarding the potential sale of the Hegner Center.

1372
01:57:31,499 --> 01:57:36,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time, Bridgewell, who merged with the Hegner Center,

1373
01:57:37,044 --> 01:57:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: was looking to sell the building to a Revere-based church for $650,000.

1374
01:57:43,668 --> 01:57:50,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So the mayor sent us a paper stating that the city of Method was negotiating that we get a piece of the $650,000.

1375
01:57:52,433 --> 01:57:55,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was $100,000 or $135,000.

1376
01:57:55,735 --> 01:58:02,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But come to find out, Mr. President, many members behind this council were outraged when the paper came before us.

1377
01:58:03,312 --> 01:58:27,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did our homework and found out that this particular piece of property, which was a field house back some many years ago, built by the city of Method, the property was transferred by the city ownership to the Hegner Center, which did tremendous service to adult residents in our community with developmental disabilities for a lot of years.

1378
01:58:28,283 --> 01:58:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And in June of 1999, the property was transferred

1379
01:58:32,458 --> 01:58:33,378
[SPEAKER_06]: to the Heckner Center for $1.

1380
01:58:33,498 --> 01:58:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a stipulation within the deed that stated that if the property was no longer going to be used for a nonprofit educational purpose, that it would revert back to the city.

1381
01:58:49,542 --> 01:58:54,204
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometime in 2007, the Heckner Center merged with Bridgewell.

1382
01:58:54,804 --> 01:58:59,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Bridgewell eventually grew too large for the facility itself.

1383
01:59:00,117 --> 01:59:06,039
[SPEAKER_06]: They moved out in November of 2013 and the building laid vacant since November 2013.

1384
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:28,587
[SPEAKER_06]: When we were presented with the paper that Bridgewell was going to sell the property, you know, I know myself and I know many members of this council where I rate saying, wait a minute, how do you get a building from the city for $1 for the purpose for nonprofit educational purposes for people with developmental disabilities?

1385
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:35,053
[SPEAKER_06]: and then be able to turn around and get a great windfall off the city.

1386
01:59:35,073 --> 01:59:56,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, uh, at the time I know I requested it and other members of this council requested that the city solicited to do more research on this particular issue and, uh, find out why if it laid vacant since November, 2013, automatically it wasn't being used for that purpose for the last several years.

1387
01:59:57,869 --> 02:00:01,590
[SPEAKER_06]: it should have reverted back to the city, and it never did.

1388
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:24,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So needless to say, I believe there's some ongoing negotiations and talks being had between the city solicitor, Bridgewell, and whatever other entities that are involved in this now, and I'm only asking that we get an update, because it's been some time, and as we all know, property in this community is at a premium right now, and we have a number of needs.

1389
02:00:25,277 --> 02:00:26,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the Method Arts Council,

1390
02:00:27,307 --> 02:00:29,028
[SPEAKER_06]: that doesn't even have a place to call home.

1391
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:30,810
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have an office at all.

1392
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:44,881
[SPEAKER_06]: We got cache, we got PTOs, we got youth sports in this community, we got all sorts of non-profits that would love to have a facility, a budding a park, and a place to call home.

1393
02:00:45,401 --> 02:00:54,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that we get a positive response from the city solicitor, and I'm hoping that the city moves forward in taking this particular piece of property back

1394
02:00:55,818 --> 02:01:18,678
[SPEAKER_06]: and the eventual, uh, uh, reuse of this property for a real true community use the arts, youth sports, PTO, whatever it may be, Mr. President, maybe a combination of all, but it's about time we take back the property that rightfully was purchased by method owned by method, uh, transferred for a particular purpose.

1395
02:01:19,018 --> 02:01:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no longer used for that purpose.

1396
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, uh, in my opinion,

1397
02:01:23,405 --> 02:01:25,746
[SPEAKER_06]: it should revert back to the city, Mr. President.

1398
02:01:26,046 --> 02:01:29,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask that we get a response from Mr. Rumley on that.

1399
02:01:30,008 --> 02:01:30,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1400
02:01:30,968 --> 02:01:32,809
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

1401
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:35,350
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1402
02:01:35,391 --> 02:01:37,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Carries 16-686 offered by Councilor Knight.

1403
02:01:39,112 --> 02:01:51,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas the American Society of Civil Engineering's 2013 report card for America's infrastructure show that more than 1.3 million miles of US roadways

1404
02:01:52,042 --> 02:02:20,395
[SPEAKER_11]: are in poor or mediocre condition, and whereas American motorists average 324 in additional expenses for repairs and operating costs attributable to roadways in poor or mediocre conditions, and whereas the historic trend in municipal roadway maintenance shows that cities allocate limited maintenance budgets based on a reliance of outdated, costly, and time-consuming pavement condition studies

1405
02:02:21,157 --> 02:02:36,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association finds that 12.5% of Massachusetts interstates, expressways, and other major roads are in need of total resurfacing or restructuring.

1406
02:02:36,462 --> 02:02:50,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas, according to the Federal Highway Administration, the overall rating of roadway quality in Massachusetts is designated as fair to mediocre, and that 89% of all roadways in Massachusetts

1407
02:02:51,148 --> 02:03:09,577
[SPEAKER_11]: are maintained by local cities and towns, and that local roads in Massachusetts carry 66% of the total traffic volume, and whereas there is an evident need for the implementation of a pavement inspection and management program in the city of Medford.

1408
02:03:10,498 --> 02:03:19,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved, the Medford City Council requests the city administration to explore the services developed by Burlington Mass-Based

1409
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:39,252
[SPEAKER_11]: street scan incorporated, or any other entity with similar technology to perform a pavement conditions study of Medford's roadways and establish a pavement inspection and management program for the city of Medford.

1410
02:03:39,853 --> 02:03:41,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight, how did I do?

1411
02:03:42,414 --> 02:03:43,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent, Mr. President.

1412
02:03:43,635 --> 02:03:43,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1413
02:03:44,095 --> 02:03:44,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1414
02:03:46,501 --> 02:04:10,995
[SPEAKER_13]: StreetScan, Mr. President, is a group of business and entity and organization that has developed technology where they retrofit motor vehicles with ground-penetrating radar, some acoustic engineering, and some optical engineering so that they can actually take a picture of the ground based upon what they've found on the radar underground, what they see through the optics, and what data they've gathered through the acoustical engineering.

1415
02:04:11,375 --> 02:04:15,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they can establish what's called a pavement

1416
02:04:16,448 --> 02:04:18,549
[SPEAKER_13]: inspection and management program, Mr. President.

1417
02:04:18,589 --> 02:04:21,411
[SPEAKER_13]: It grades each roadway and it does so in the normal flow of traffic.

1418
02:04:21,451 --> 02:04:26,014
[SPEAKER_13]: The car drives down the street just like you and I were going to work and it takes this data and it records it all.

1419
02:04:26,474 --> 02:04:36,441
[SPEAKER_13]: It brings it into one central location and they can actually put together a map using GIS technology to show you where your worst roads are, where your best roads are, what condition they're in.

1420
02:04:36,941 --> 02:04:41,964
[SPEAKER_13]: So say we had street scan here in Medford and they drove up High Street and they took pictures of High Street.

1421
02:04:42,457 --> 02:04:48,139
[SPEAKER_13]: They generate the map, and it would show that this section of High Street is in very poor condition, serious condition.

1422
02:04:48,659 --> 02:04:49,079
[SPEAKER_13]: It's red.

1423
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:54,541
[SPEAKER_13]: You click on the map, and it would pop up, and it would show an actual picture of that stretch of roadway, Mr. President, what it looks like.

1424
02:04:54,581 --> 02:05:03,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it would also give you a series of recommendations as to what they feel as though would be the best solution to repair this at the current time based upon the data that they've collected.

1425
02:05:04,145 --> 02:05:07,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So there might be cracks in the roadway, and the recommendation might be seal the cracks.

1426
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:10,247
[SPEAKER_13]: There might be a pothole, and the recommendation might be fill the pothole.

1427
02:05:11,951 --> 02:05:16,400
[SPEAKER_13]: such damage underneath the ground that the recommendation is there's a need for total resurfacing and reconstruction.

1428
02:05:18,747 --> 02:05:33,494
[SPEAKER_13]: tool does, Mr. President, is ultimately, within a day, someone can drive this vehicle around every street in our city, can collect all this data, and then in a few short weeks' time, can produce us with a map, with a pavement condition study of what exactly it is that's going on, not only above our roads, but also underground.

1429
02:05:33,914 --> 02:05:46,400
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think this will help us when we run into situations like we did at the Winthrop Street Rotary Project, where there was some cost overruns in the amount of, I believe, $300,000, because we brought an engineer in there to tell us where we can dig and where we can't dig, and they missed the mark.

1430
02:05:47,398 --> 02:05:54,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is a tool, Mr. President, that we need to investigate, we need to look at, and we need to further develop because I really think it's going to be beneficial to the city.

1431
02:05:54,884 --> 02:05:57,126
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll save us a lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of effort.

1432
02:05:57,667 --> 02:06:03,031
[SPEAKER_13]: And ultimately, once the pavement inspection is done, the management program is right there with it.

1433
02:06:03,051 --> 02:06:03,511
[SPEAKER_13]: It comes up.

1434
02:06:03,631 --> 02:06:05,653
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do set short-term goals, long-term goals.

1435
02:06:05,993 --> 02:06:10,317
[SPEAKER_13]: You can figure out what direction you want to go in in terms of resurfacing plan, restructuring plans.

1436
02:06:10,677 --> 02:06:13,199
[SPEAKER_13]: They also can help forecast.

1437
02:06:14,614 --> 02:06:17,777
[SPEAKER_13]: the rate of deterioration that the roads that they've monitored are going to come out at.

1438
02:06:17,837 --> 02:06:20,039
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's really a great piece of technology.

1439
02:06:20,059 --> 02:06:22,641
[SPEAKER_13]: It's certainly something that I feel as though the city of Medford would benefit from.

1440
02:06:22,681 --> 02:06:25,563
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's worthy of something that needs a further look, Mr. President.

1441
02:06:25,583 --> 02:06:27,445
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this.

1442
02:06:28,045 --> 02:06:41,017
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing that amazes me, counselor, is that, uh, among the, uh, uh, many statistics you shared with us that, um, uh, local roads in Massachusetts carry 66%

1443
02:06:43,443 --> 02:06:45,985
[SPEAKER_11]: of total volume of traffic in the Commonwealth.

1444
02:06:46,245 --> 02:06:47,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It's astounding.

1445
02:06:47,846 --> 02:06:51,428
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're in Middlesex County, and Middlesex County is one quarter of the state's population.

1446
02:06:51,488 --> 02:06:58,032
[SPEAKER_13]: So can you imagine that 66% of the traffic for one quarter of the state's population is congested to Middlesex County, Mr. President?

1447
02:06:58,712 --> 02:07:01,554
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing, with all the highways we have.

1448
02:07:02,454 --> 02:07:02,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1449
02:07:03,435 --> 02:07:04,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1450
02:07:05,136 --> 02:07:05,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1451
02:07:06,236 --> 02:07:08,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up again.

1452
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:12,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I met with Street Skiing two years ago at the MMA show,

1453
02:07:12,955 --> 02:07:23,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And I brought it up to the council and they would have been happy to come down two years ago to make a presentation to the city, which we had sent a letter to the mayor.

1454
02:07:24,981 --> 02:07:27,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, it went nowhere.

1455
02:07:27,182 --> 02:07:29,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We're back here asking for them to do it again.

1456
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:31,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I've met with them a couple of times.

1457
02:07:31,924 --> 02:07:35,806
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who haven't gone to the MMA show in January, it's a good tool.

1458
02:07:35,846 --> 02:07:37,807
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of stuff you can learn there.

1459
02:07:38,388 --> 02:07:41,029
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I say, these guys, they explained to me how it works.

1460
02:07:42,033 --> 02:07:45,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, they're more than happy to come down and do a demonstration for us.

1461
02:07:47,295 --> 02:07:48,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So I support this also, again.

1462
02:07:49,936 --> 02:07:50,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1463
02:07:51,577 --> 02:07:53,298
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1464
02:07:53,338 --> 02:07:54,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1465
02:07:55,158 --> 02:07:56,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1466
02:07:56,519 --> 02:07:58,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1467
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:05,483
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could ask, please, through the chair, at what cost does street scan, what would it cost the city of Medford?

1468
02:08:05,883 --> 02:08:06,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Any idea on that?

1469
02:08:06,263 --> 02:08:11,145
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we're asking the administration to support.

1470
02:08:12,109 --> 02:08:16,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I've come down here a couple times now and spoke about Evans Street.

1471
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:21,373
[SPEAKER_19]: Reports are that it's been 65 years since it's been repaved.

1472
02:08:22,454 --> 02:08:25,875
[SPEAKER_19]: We know that the gas lines have been redone.

1473
02:08:26,276 --> 02:08:32,779
[SPEAKER_19]: We're waiting on the water pipes to be redone, and then we can finally get our street paved.

1474
02:08:34,322 --> 02:08:41,525
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope that this doesn't cost too much because, I mean, we've all lived in Medford for a number of years, running for office.

1475
02:08:41,686 --> 02:08:43,146
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been through every neighborhood.

1476
02:08:44,127 --> 02:08:46,648
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we know what the problems are.

1477
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:57,533
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we talked about see, click, fix earlier and, you know, people putting reports on there and having one word resolved and the thing closed and nothing actually being done.

1478
02:08:58,053 --> 02:09:01,335
[SPEAKER_19]: I've spoken about the huge pothole that still exists.

1479
02:09:02,138 --> 02:09:07,181
[SPEAKER_19]: right at the end of Evans street at the entrance way that has rocks all over the place.

1480
02:09:07,781 --> 02:09:26,292
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we know enough about the infrastructure of the city of Medford from, uh, from roof here to the police station to, uh, Fulton Heights where, I mean, when I ran for a state Senate a couple of years ago, when I went through Fulton Heights, I mean, there were roads up there that should be closed.

1481
02:09:27,473 --> 02:09:28,533
[SPEAKER_19]: They're dilapidated.

1482
02:09:30,114 --> 02:09:42,603
[SPEAKER_19]: We know the water pipes under the city of Medford, the streets that need to be fixed, and whatever streets that are controlled by the state, we need to reach out to the state to have them fix it.

1483
02:09:42,973 --> 02:09:57,066
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we need to incur another cost for the citizens of Medford who are already paying excise taxes, water taxes, property taxes, surcharge now on the property tax coming up, that I hope people are prepared for.

1484
02:09:57,106 --> 02:10:01,230
[SPEAKER_19]: That first payment in January is going back to the 1st of July.

1485
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:04,793
[SPEAKER_19]: That first payment on the CPA is going to be pretty big, and we're not seeing

1486
02:10:05,389 --> 02:10:05,969
[SPEAKER_19]: anything done.

1487
02:10:06,389 --> 02:10:10,931
[SPEAKER_19]: That woman that came up here before talked about her manhole cover out in front of her condo.

1488
02:10:11,291 --> 02:10:14,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we know what the problem is.

1489
02:10:14,272 --> 02:10:18,894
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we need to put any more cost on the city or another layer of government.

1490
02:10:19,274 --> 02:10:21,935
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I appreciate, I definitely appreciate and understand

1491
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:25,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight's motives, and I'm all for it.

1492
02:10:25,652 --> 02:10:27,133
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think we already know what the problem is.

1493
02:10:27,473 --> 02:10:33,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just think we need to have an administration that's finally going to light a fire under these problems and get them done.

1494
02:10:34,197 --> 02:10:38,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the capital improvement project is supposed to start, I believe, next month.

1495
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:43,043
[SPEAKER_19]: But then the winter's going to set in, and we're not going to get to these things until the spring.

1496
02:10:44,444 --> 02:10:45,364
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been waiting too long.

1497
02:10:45,865 --> 02:10:46,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Evans Street, 65 years.

1498
02:10:48,126 --> 02:10:52,368
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, I'm only 46 almost 20 years before I was born.

1499
02:10:52,408 --> 02:10:53,808
[SPEAKER_19]: That street need to be repaved.

1500
02:10:54,349 --> 02:11:01,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Mr. President, I understand and I appreciate the motives of, of counselor night, but I think we know what the problem is.

1501
02:11:01,451 --> 02:11:03,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think we need to incur any costs.

1502
02:11:03,372 --> 02:11:13,276
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think these problems need to be, uh, addressed, taken care of and finally fixed for the, for the citizens who are paying a lot of money in the city of Medford.

1503
02:11:13,336 --> 02:11:14,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1504
02:11:14,577 --> 02:11:15,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1505
02:11:15,717 --> 02:11:17,578
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I may, uh, constant night,

1506
02:11:17,867 --> 02:11:22,250
[SPEAKER_13]: A wise man once said, if we do things the same way over and over again, we're going to get the same results.

1507
02:11:23,891 --> 02:11:25,933
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an opportunity for us to take a look at a street.

1508
02:11:26,213 --> 02:11:29,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Gentleman comes up here and says the street hasn't been paved in 65 years.

1509
02:11:30,476 --> 02:11:30,716
[SPEAKER_13]: 65 years.

1510
02:11:30,736 --> 02:11:33,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how he knows that, because someone said it.

1511
02:11:33,158 --> 02:11:35,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone must have told him that it's been 65 years.

1512
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:37,541
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have street scan, you know what we're going to have?

1513
02:11:37,881 --> 02:11:38,542
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have data.

1514
02:11:39,122 --> 02:11:41,384
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to be able to make data-driven decisions, Mr. President.

1515
02:11:41,704 --> 02:11:45,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And database decision-making is the best practice in municipal government.

1516
02:11:46,285 --> 02:11:51,866
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, with that being said, I still feel as though this data collection tool is very, very valuable to us here in the city.

1517
02:11:52,186 --> 02:11:54,567
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows us to make decisions that are informed.

1518
02:11:54,887 --> 02:11:56,567
[SPEAKER_13]: It allows us to bite off bigger pieces.

1519
02:11:57,227 --> 02:12:00,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that it will really help us out in the long run in our long-term planning.

1520
02:12:00,888 --> 02:12:01,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor.

1521
02:12:01,668 --> 02:12:03,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1522
02:12:04,409 --> 02:12:05,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1523
02:12:06,729 --> 02:12:14,571
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, over the years, we've asked for a number of audits in the community, one being for

1524
02:12:15,543 --> 02:12:16,123
[SPEAKER_06]: tree stumps.

1525
02:12:16,303 --> 02:12:18,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked the city to go out and do a complete audit of tree stumps.

1526
02:12:19,045 --> 02:12:23,167
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked the city to go do a complete audit of sidewalks and so forth.

1527
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:30,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I tend to agree with a counselor night that, um, the information would be valuable to have.

1528
02:12:31,531 --> 02:12:40,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's an expense, but to be able to map out every street and I realize a lot of them need work and it's not rocket science to drive down the street and see how much work it needs.

1529
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:59,504
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think to have that at your fingertips where you can explore and see that you have a list and see that a street that hasn't been done in 60 something years or see that a street that has four layers of asphalt that may need a total rip up rather than just a top layer repair.

1530
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:09,627
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the things I think you can catch with this type of system and we have hundreds of miles of street in this community.

1531
02:13:10,315 --> 02:13:17,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we did the mapping and the complete audit of the water and sewer pipes, that's exactly what we did.

1532
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:19,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We hired a company to come in.

1533
02:13:19,462 --> 02:13:20,583
[SPEAKER_06]: We know our pipes are old.

1534
02:13:20,703 --> 02:13:21,743
[SPEAKER_06]: We know they're 100 years old.

1535
02:13:21,984 --> 02:13:23,845
[SPEAKER_06]: We know we have pipes that are lead.

1536
02:13:23,865 --> 02:13:26,827
[SPEAKER_06]: We know we have even asbestos pipes on the ground that are old.

1537
02:13:27,367 --> 02:13:34,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But in order to get a complete and accurate picture, we hired a company to come in with a camera, and they scoped out the pipes.

1538
02:13:35,373 --> 02:13:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And they told us where the hot spots are, where we're getting infiltration, where there might be leakage, and so forth.

1539
02:13:42,339 --> 02:13:44,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And that information was valuable.

1540
02:13:44,801 --> 02:13:47,303
[SPEAKER_06]: The other issue is, will the city follow up?

1541
02:13:47,903 --> 02:13:50,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree with doing something to this magnitude.

1542
02:13:50,946 --> 02:13:54,509
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I don't think the city will follow up, to be quite honest with you.

1543
02:13:54,829 --> 02:13:56,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a great tool.

1544
02:13:56,540 --> 02:14:03,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the city wanted to use it as a tool, this would be invaluable to have, but I don't think the city is going to follow up on this.

1545
02:14:03,764 --> 02:14:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I do think it, it merits, uh, some review.

1546
02:14:07,886 --> 02:14:14,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, maybe we should send it down Evans street and have the car break down on Evans street when it hits through all those potholes.

1547
02:14:15,575 --> 02:14:25,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they could give us a report just on Evans street and see when the bells and whistles goes off when that, when it's dragging its equipment down your street to see what happens.

1548
02:14:25,379 --> 02:14:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't mean to make light of it, but, um, you know, and by the way, we heard tonight, I think it was council Longo Kern that asked about Evans street, that, uh, Evans street is going to be done, uh, with it by the spring was council Longo.

1549
02:14:41,166 --> 02:14:42,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we hear the spring in the spring?

1550
02:14:42,607 --> 02:14:42,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

1551
02:14:43,007 --> 02:14:43,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Fargo.

1552
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,041
[SPEAKER_06]: In the spring, it's going to be done.

1553
02:14:46,241 --> 02:14:49,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to finally get some relief.

1554
02:14:57,668 --> 02:15:00,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it sounded more like on the fast track that it's already been out.

1555
02:15:00,349 --> 02:15:01,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I talked to him actually the other day.

1556
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:02,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I can read the email to you.

1557
02:15:03,551 --> 02:15:03,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1558
02:15:04,752 --> 02:15:05,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman.

1559
02:15:06,313 --> 02:15:06,673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

1560
02:15:06,693 --> 02:15:08,114
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to thank council tonight.

1561
02:15:08,154 --> 02:15:13,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to think outside the box and, um, you know, and I think this is a worthy project.

1562
02:15:14,078 --> 02:15:19,702
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably one of the major concerns I hear in this community, the condition of our streets, the potholes, and so forth.

1563
02:15:20,282 --> 02:15:23,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And why not have a complete audit of the roads?

1564
02:15:23,704 --> 02:15:30,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Mr. President, we have public utilities that come into our community, and they request permits to do trench work.

1565
02:15:31,329 --> 02:15:37,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And they do trench work, and they say they're going to restore the ground to the same or better condition, the city of Medford standards.

1566
02:15:37,734 --> 02:15:42,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then we come into a situation like we're dealing with right now on Doonan Street, where the street got torn up,

1567
02:15:43,113 --> 02:15:49,758
[SPEAKER_13]: They've come in, the trench work's been replaced, and it doesn't really live up to what I would find to be city of Medford standards, Mr. President.

1568
02:15:50,298 --> 02:15:52,220
[SPEAKER_13]: They left it in worse condition than it was when they got there.

1569
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:59,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll be able to have this tool to drive over the street that they just resurfaced, and we can tell them, no, your trench doesn't meet the standards.

1570
02:15:59,165 --> 02:15:59,946
[SPEAKER_13]: It's less dense here.

1571
02:15:59,966 --> 02:16:00,706
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more dense here.

1572
02:16:01,046 --> 02:16:02,347
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't pack where you were supposed to pack.

1573
02:16:02,367 --> 02:16:03,728
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't tamp where you were supposed to tamp.

1574
02:16:04,049 --> 02:16:08,572
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really think it's going to be a great tool for accountability as well as for database decision making, Mr. President.

1575
02:16:08,852 --> 02:16:09,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Researcher.

1576
02:16:11,174 --> 02:16:12,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a point of information.

1577
02:16:13,607 --> 02:16:23,195
[SPEAKER_21]: I did ask the mayor at our earlier meeting, she said Evans Street Chapter 90 funds repaving, that the contract was awarded and it will be repaved in the spring.

1578
02:16:23,836 --> 02:16:24,677
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the answer we got.

1579
02:16:25,257 --> 02:16:27,419
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was happy to hear some movement.

1580
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:28,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1581
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:33,424
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, one more thing, Mr. Capucci.

1582
02:16:33,584 --> 02:16:34,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1583
02:16:34,925 --> 02:16:35,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Just really quick.

1584
02:16:35,706 --> 02:16:39,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you to Councilor Longo Kern for that information.

1585
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:42,031
[SPEAKER_19]: Just really quick.

1586
02:16:43,451 --> 02:16:50,773
[SPEAKER_19]: It was actually Mark Twain who said doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.

1587
02:16:51,073 --> 02:16:54,954
[SPEAKER_19]: But finally, something's being done on Evans Street.

1588
02:16:55,374 --> 02:17:06,216
[SPEAKER_19]: But like I said, it was my neighbor, Mrs. Mottola, who's 86 years old, who's lived on that street since I believe she was in her 30s, who told me that that street hasn't been paved in 65 years.

1589
02:17:08,216 --> 02:17:09,117
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not against

1590
02:17:11,522 --> 02:17:16,086
[SPEAKER_19]: what Councillor Knight is proposing, but I think we already know what the problems are.

1591
02:17:16,386 --> 02:17:20,150
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's fix them first before we throw more money into it.

1592
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:26,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the technology he's talking about is great, but let's fix what we have first and then start monitoring it.

1593
02:17:27,517 --> 02:17:35,124
[SPEAKER_19]: This technology actually used to work for a company that built these x-ray machines, and they did projects on like the

1594
02:17:35,928 --> 02:17:42,011
[SPEAKER_19]: the suspension bridge in Boston, where they scanned it and they found the holes in the cracks.

1595
02:17:42,852 --> 02:17:48,454
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with what Councillor Knight has proposed, and I think it would be invaluable to the city of Medford.

1596
02:17:48,734 --> 02:17:59,940
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think first, let's, I mean, we're talking about all sorts of people going on see click fix and myself coming to the podium and reporting these problems, and we're not seeing anything done.

1597
02:18:00,781 --> 02:18:03,602
[SPEAKER_19]: And now we want to come in and spend more money to get

1598
02:18:04,085 --> 02:18:08,726
[SPEAKER_19]: information and data that will be valuable that we could work on, but we're not seeing the work done.

1599
02:18:09,766 --> 02:18:14,267
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get the work done first, fix the streets and roads, and then stop monitoring it.

1600
02:18:14,447 --> 02:18:15,167
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my point.

1601
02:18:15,327 --> 02:18:16,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1602
02:18:16,567 --> 02:18:17,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1603
02:18:18,268 --> 02:18:21,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And we welcome again, back to the microphone, Mr. Castanetti.

1604
02:18:21,628 --> 02:18:23,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Council President.

1605
02:18:23,048 --> 02:18:24,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice to see you again.

1606
02:18:25,569 --> 02:18:32,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Feeling I'm a just and fair person, after hearing Mr. Capucci talk about his Evans Street

1607
02:18:32,477 --> 02:18:36,739
[SPEAKER_16]: many, many times along with his neighbors about being in disrepair.

1608
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:44,982
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore, about three weeks ago, after hitting some baseballs at Morrison Park, I went across the street, drove my bicycle down there.

1609
02:18:45,803 --> 02:18:55,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never ever seen a street in such disrepair as an understatement, as he may quote him, I think in the past, look like a war zone of some sort.

1610
02:18:56,588 --> 02:19:00,449
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really, I've never seen one so bad, I've never seen one that bad.

1611
02:19:00,749 --> 02:19:02,170
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got like the red rocks in it.

1612
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:04,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he's very astute of you, Mr. President.

1613
02:19:05,412 --> 02:19:10,395
[SPEAKER_16]: However, Councilor Marks brought up a good point.

1614
02:19:13,057 --> 02:19:14,057
[SPEAKER_16]: The Heckner Center.

1615
02:19:15,398 --> 02:19:32,249
[SPEAKER_16]: If the contract originally, when it was sold, was written properly by the city, and the stipulation was it would revert back to the city instead of being sold for a dollar if it was not

1616
02:19:32,877 --> 02:19:38,099
[SPEAKER_16]: use no longer for a non-profit educational purpose.

1617
02:19:39,059 --> 02:19:39,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct, Counselor?

1618
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:41,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Marks.

1619
02:19:42,881 --> 02:20:00,608
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore, I would presume, not being a lawyer, however, that there would be a cloud on the title, and that deed should be duly noted and registered at the Cambridge Clerk

1620
02:20:01,707 --> 02:20:02,407
[SPEAKER_16]: of deeds.

1621
02:20:04,749 --> 02:20:19,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And that money could be used to maybe pave a street or something, or give it to some arts organization that was promised a locale after the Swan School fell to a four to three vote midnight during a snowstorm.

1622
02:20:21,978 --> 02:20:22,939
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have today.

1623
02:20:22,979 --> 02:20:23,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

1624
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:25,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1625
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:30,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1626
02:20:31,412 --> 02:20:32,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1627
02:20:32,633 --> 02:20:33,353
[SPEAKER_11]: The ayes have it.

1628
02:20:33,853 --> 02:20:34,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion is approved.

1629
02:20:36,194 --> 02:20:38,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, 16 dash six 89 offered by counselor night.

1630
02:20:39,756 --> 02:20:47,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Be resolved that this city council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Frank Andre on his recent passing.

1631
02:20:47,119 --> 02:20:47,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor.

1632
02:20:48,019 --> 02:20:49,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1633
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:56,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, many of us that grew up here in the city of Medford know Mr. Andre is a longtime Medford resident, a business owner, entrepreneur,

1634
02:20:57,249 --> 02:21:06,593
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, thoroughbred racing aficionado and uh, most importantly, the number one fan of the Andre chiefs, Mr. President and uh, recently passed away and his presence is going to be greatly missed in this community.

1635
02:21:07,073 --> 02:21:11,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to extend my deep and sincere condolences to the family and ask the council to join me in doing such.

1636
02:21:13,636 --> 02:21:13,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

1637
02:21:14,116 --> 02:21:17,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion of council night, uh, Oh, counselor max.

1638
02:21:18,618 --> 02:21:20,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with all the comments.

1639
02:21:20,419 --> 02:21:22,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I thank counselor night for putting this on.

1640
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:26,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I think his biggest accomplishment is the type of family man he was.

1641
02:21:26,965 --> 02:21:30,848
[SPEAKER_06]: He raised a great family, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1642
02:21:31,128 --> 02:21:37,213
[SPEAKER_11]: The President And he gave everybody in this community lasting.

1643
02:21:37,613 --> 02:21:49,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Who grew up in this community doesn't remember at one time a significant part of their life being there in that theater, having a wonderful time.

1644
02:21:50,102 --> 02:21:52,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We can be grateful to that family and to Miss Andrea.

1645
02:22:03,133 --> 02:22:07,456
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councillor Marks for us to go into suspension.

1646
02:22:07,476 --> 02:22:08,176
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favour?

1647
02:22:08,196 --> 02:22:08,897
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1648
02:22:09,637 --> 02:22:12,859
[SPEAKER_11]: On to suspension 16-693 offered by Councillor Knight.

1649
02:22:13,419 --> 02:22:29,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas, beginning in 2006, the Granada Scary Trust was established for the purpose of, first, to bring to public attention and heightened awareness of pancreatic cancer, the third leading cause of death among cancer victims.

1650
02:22:31,218 --> 02:22:44,221
[SPEAKER_11]: to raise and distribute funds for research to combat this silent killer in most insidious form of cancer, and third, to provide support and comfort to the families of victims of pancreatic cancer.

1651
02:22:44,841 --> 02:22:58,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas, in remembrance of its founder, Kathy Grinard-Skerry, the Grinard-Skerry Trust has worked tirelessly to meet Kathy's commitment to raise $1 million in support of this cause.

1652
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:08,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas on September 24th, 2016, the Granada Scary Trust announced that their goal of raising $1 million has been met and exceeded.

1653
02:23:09,265 --> 02:23:29,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council commend and congratulate the Granada Scary Trust in recognition of their tireless fundraising work on behalf of pancreatic cancer research, and be it further resolved that the Metro City Council extend an invitation to the Granada Scary Trust to appear at an upcoming council meeting for a presentation

1654
02:23:29,632 --> 02:23:30,833
[SPEAKER_11]: of a council commendation.

1655
02:23:31,093 --> 02:23:32,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

1656
02:23:32,794 --> 02:23:38,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you to the Granada Scary Trust for all their work that they've done, Mr. President.

1657
02:23:38,998 --> 02:23:53,568
[SPEAKER_13]: A number of years ago, Kathy Granada Scary was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and she inspired us all by creating the Granada Scary Trust and making a commitment to raise $1 million for pancreatic cancer research, Mr. President.

1658
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:59,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, earlier this evening, you saw the city council spend $1.2 million in two weeks.

1659
02:24:00,484 --> 02:24:06,707
[SPEAKER_13]: From 2006 to 2016, the Granada Scary Trust worked tirelessly to raise funds, Mr. President.

1660
02:24:06,747 --> 02:24:09,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And they set a goal, Kathy set a goal, a goal of a million dollars.

1661
02:24:10,629 --> 02:24:15,172
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Granada Scary Trust, after Kathy's passing, continued to work tirelessly to meet this goal.

1662
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:24,472
[SPEAKER_13]: And on Sunday, at their 10th annual walk, they were pleased to announce that they've met and exceeded Kathy's goal of raising $1 million for pancreatic cancer research, Mr. President.

1663
02:24:24,512 --> 02:24:31,254
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really think that this is something that the whole community has rallied behind, not for one year, not for two years, but for the last decade.

1664
02:24:31,714 --> 02:24:34,115
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, they always say, follow the money.

1665
02:24:34,135 --> 02:24:35,675
[SPEAKER_13]: If you follow the money, it's not going to lie.

1666
02:24:35,695 --> 02:24:37,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just proof, Mr. President.

1667
02:24:37,296 --> 02:24:42,037
[SPEAKER_13]: They've been able to raise $1 million from residents in this community and surrounding communities.

1668
02:24:42,784 --> 02:24:46,367
[SPEAKER_13]: to fight this terrible disease all in the memory of Kathy, all based on Kathy's vision.

1669
02:24:46,847 --> 02:24:49,269
[SPEAKER_13]: And they didn't quit after a week or a month or a year.

1670
02:24:49,289 --> 02:24:51,471
[SPEAKER_13]: They worked for a decade, Mr. President.

1671
02:24:51,551 --> 02:24:55,154
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is something that warrants recognition, Mr. President.

1672
02:24:55,174 --> 02:25:00,858
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd ask my colleagues here on the Council to support me in voting in favor of this measure.

1673
02:25:02,019 --> 02:25:02,399
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1674
02:25:02,599 --> 02:25:04,181
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to second the resolve.

1675
02:25:04,201 --> 02:25:05,842
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

1676
02:25:06,376 --> 02:25:08,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Sunday marks the 10th annual.

1677
02:25:08,057 --> 02:25:16,802
[SPEAKER_21]: It used to be a walk and then it turned into a walk run and I believe it's going to be the last walk run as they moved on and created this lovely gala they have in April.

1678
02:25:17,363 --> 02:25:26,468
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just want to thank them for their hard work and a million dollars is going so far towards research for pancreatic cancer and the walk will be missed.

1679
02:25:26,508 --> 02:25:28,309
[SPEAKER_21]: I didn't miss one in the last 10 years.

1680
02:25:28,329 --> 02:25:30,711
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think my kids have missed one in eight.

1681
02:25:31,171 --> 02:25:32,512
[SPEAKER_21]: So it was,

1682
02:25:33,035 --> 02:25:41,779
[SPEAKER_21]: This Sunday, there were hundreds and hundreds of people that probably have to stop the walk because it's just going to get so out of hand with people, crazy amounts of people.

1683
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:47,862
[SPEAKER_21]: So it just shows the efforts that went into Kathy when she started 10 years ago.

1684
02:25:47,982 --> 02:25:49,743
[SPEAKER_21]: So she is missed.

1685
02:25:49,923 --> 02:25:52,925
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you, Councilor Knight, for putting this on.

1686
02:25:52,945 --> 02:25:53,785
[SPEAKER_21]: And I second the resolution.

1687
02:25:54,303 --> 02:25:58,025
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Vice President Leclerc.

1688
02:25:58,166 --> 02:25:58,866
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1689
02:25:59,046 --> 02:25:59,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1690
02:25:59,406 --> 02:26:00,087
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1691
02:26:00,127 --> 02:26:00,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

1692
02:26:01,308 --> 02:26:02,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have anything else in your hand?

1693
02:26:04,009 --> 02:26:05,370
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1694
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:06,031
[SPEAKER_11]: The records.

1695
02:26:07,752 --> 02:26:08,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor?

1696
02:26:08,112 --> 02:26:11,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if I could, Steven Scaparrotti.

1697
02:26:11,114 --> 02:26:12,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if anyone knows him.

1698
02:26:13,115 --> 02:26:16,717
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a great, great young man in this community.

1699
02:26:17,518 --> 02:26:19,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to recognize him, Mr. President.

1700
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:23,962
[SPEAKER_06]: He won the silver medal in the Special Olympic softball

1701
02:26:24,338 --> 02:26:25,079
[SPEAKER_06]: just recently.

1702
02:26:25,599 --> 02:26:30,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know his mother, Janice, and his father, Tony, are very, very proud of him.

1703
02:26:31,104 --> 02:26:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know he watches this meeting religiously.

1704
02:26:34,207 --> 02:26:38,991
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to congratulate Stephen and say you're doing a great job, Steve, and keep up the good work.

1705
02:26:39,331 --> 02:26:40,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations, Steve.

1706
02:26:46,030 --> 02:26:47,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1707
02:26:47,051 --> 02:26:56,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the Scaparrotti family, I remember them way back in the day, Walton Glenwood Baseball, so it's great to see the tradition carry on with the Walton Glenwood Pride.

1708
02:26:56,759 --> 02:26:58,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations.

1709
02:26:58,600 --> 02:26:58,940
