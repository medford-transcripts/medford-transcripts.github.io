00:00:00,912 --> 00:00:06,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Police officers were hard to miss at Medford High School as students returned to class one day after a stabbing here.

2
00:00:07,098 --> 00:00:14,985
[SPEAKER_01]: All the police up there, it's not creating a nice environment for like students to learn and it's just turning the school into sort of like a prison.

3
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:20,190
[SPEAKER_01]: By now, nearly everyone at school has seen the cell phone video of two boys fighting in a bathroom.

4
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,915

[SPEAKER_02]: The guy in the video, I know he's in my Spanish class.

7
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:39,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Students say the bathrooms are where most of the fighting takes place and that the school's efforts to restrict bathroom access haven't changed that.

8
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:42,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the schools are more focused on like something called a hall pass.

9
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to like request online, you go to the bathroom, but half the bathrooms are broken to begin with.

12
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:57,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Some say the schools need to give harsher punishment to troublemakers.

13
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:58,588
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to suspensions?

14
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,930
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to just common sense dignity?

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.

16
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,452
[SPEAKER_02]: School committee needs to go.

17
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good enough.

18
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:12,157
