    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ZN4cjaNIRg&t=0.912s">[Reporter]</a>:  Police officers were hard to miss at Medford High School as students returned to class one day after a stabbing here.
 All the police up there, it's not creating a nice environment for like students to learn and it's just turning the school into sort of like a prison.
 By now, nearly everyone at school has seen the cell phone video of two boys fighting in a bathroom.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ZN4cjaNIRg&t=21.571s">[Student 1]</a>:  One of them appears to have a knife in his hand as he lunges at the other.
 That other boy was wounded in the abdomen and went to the hospital.
 The guy in the video, I know he's in my Spanish class.
 Students say the bathrooms are where most of the fighting takes place and that the school's efforts to restrict bathroom access haven't changed that.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ZN4cjaNIRg&t=39.252s">[Student 2]</a>:  Well, the schools are more focused on like something called a hall pass.
 So you have to like request online, you go to the bathroom, but half the bathrooms are broken to begin with.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ZN4cjaNIRg&t=46.798s">[Student 1]</a>:  Our kids are afraid my daughter doesn't want to go back to school.
 Parents and students gave school leaders an earful at a school committee meeting.
 Some say the schools need to give harsher punishment to troublemakers.
 What happened to suspensions?
 What happened to just common sense dignity?
 It's gone.
 School committee needs to go.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ZN4cjaNIRg&t=64.733s">[Bienick]</a>:  It's just not good enough.
 Medford police say the increased security will last at least through the end of this week.
 Medford's mayor says the district is also working on a culture and climate study that she says should help.
