    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=51.221">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=53.545">I</a>  don't see Councilor Scarpella. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=54.625">Councilor</a>  Sagan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=55.346">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=56.406">Chair</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=57.366">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=58.407">For</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=59.807">Meeting</a>  is called to order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=61.868">The</a>  first thing we're going to do is try to knock out this newsletter, which was so graciously drafted by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=73.711">Thank</a>  you very much for <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=75.992">pulling</a>  up all of those links. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=78.313">I'm</a>  just going.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=79.074">So</a>  many links.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=81.675">Well,</a>  yeah, especially during budget season.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=83.836">I</a>  mean, it was really fun, creative linking there, especially with it felt like it wasn't necessary to have a new bullet point for every single board and commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=97.323">So</a>  I just linked where it says every link, board link and link <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=105.942">commission</a>  link for each of the boards and commissions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=109.804">So</a>  I tried to make it a little bit less painful to read, just a little bit more readable that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=116.647">So</a>  I mean, yeah, see, there it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=118.888">All</a>  of Medford's boards and commissions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=123.61">That's</a>  a fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=124.431">That</a>  was fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=125.611">But</a>  it was painstaking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=127.472">Anyway,</a>  yeah, take a look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=130.454">Let</a>  me know.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=131.389">Yeah,</a>  so basically the only edits that I made to this draft and this is the formatted version where I added the Memorial Day resolution and and yeah tracking those suspended resolutions as always.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=146.881">Oh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=147.582">I</a>  missed those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=148.282">Yes,</a>  they weren't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=149.383">On</a>  the website.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=150.865">Oh,</a>  yeah, no, that's I've done that multiple times before the resolutions under suspension are hard to keep track of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=157.972">I</a>  added what we're doing today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=160.215">So,</a>  assuming that we do get done with these 2 things, might as well just throw that on retroactively. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=168.452">Um,</a>  I added yesterday's meeting, uh, saying we hosted facilities manager, Paul Reilly to offer an update to the city council regarding the estimated costs of repairing and maintaining all city on facilities in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=181.954">Um,</a>  and let's see, what else did I just a quick point of information, chair looming.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=191.256">Um,</a>  his name is pronounced Paul Ricky.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=194.797">Shoot.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=195.757">Well,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=197.252">there</a>  aren't that many people in this meeting to catch my.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=199.693">For</a>  the future.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=201.133">So,</a>  but I'm sure that my pronunciation will be correct over text in this newsletter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=210.635">And</a>  I also added just an extra link to the planning and permitting committee because this other corridors business was discussed on both May 14th and May 28th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=220.157">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=226.262">Oh,</a>  um, you can go through yourself first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=228.764">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=229.445">Um,</a>  well, I think I'm just trying, I'm just trying to look and remember, but I think I want to say that that was about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=238.632">Just</a>  those couple of those extra meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=241.874">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=242.295">Just</a>  a few details that were missed, but overall, yeah, this was a pretty, you know, it was, it was good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=249.04">So</a>  yeah, feel free to bring up what you'd, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=252.367">uh,</a>  whatever was on your mind.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=253.908">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=254.809">Um,</a>  for the HRC ordinance, um, I would probably just mention that it like empower, empowers the HRC to do more somehow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=263.176">Like,</a>  I think it's kind of an effective, like to make it more effective, but, um, maybe, I mean, if you can, can I, can you, okay, there, there we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=275.565">It's</a>  line 204, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=277.167">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=279.183">Prove</a>  for first reading the governance origins for HRC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=284.606">Maybe</a>  instead of which will make it run, to empower it to run more effectively and respond to new challenges, I don't know, something like that.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=310.054">On</a>  May 13th, after much review and committee, we approve for first reading the governing ordinance from Edwards Human Rights Commission to empower it to run more effectively and respond to any challenges.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=319.098">Um,</a>  yeah, that's my note for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=321.539">And</a>  then, generally, there's another, um, there was the common Vic one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=327.701">Oh,</a>  yeah, right above it for 203. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=329.622">It</a>  reads like <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=332.785">we</a>  voted for it to stay open on that one particular day on May 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=341.85">That's</a>  the right to stay open on May 3rd of every year.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=345.132">I</a>  like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=348.174">Good</a>  catch.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=350.175">And</a>  then just generally, I don't know if Veterans is capitalized.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=354.798">Not</a>  until 1am forever though, like on every day.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=357.94">Oh</a>  yeah, do we know which</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=360.619">I</a>  actually think we approved them to stay open until, well, this is actually something that is going to come up a lot more for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=369.781">We</a>  are, all of our businesses, we're aligning them with their common victualers license and their liquor licenses are often misaligned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=382.964">So</a>  we're bringing them into alignment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=385.837">And</a>  sometimes their liquor licenses say they can stay open later than their convicts do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=392.059">So</a>  I think what we did for the establishment was we told them that they can stay open until 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=397.14">They</a>  don't always do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=398.62">This</a>  is what kind of happens with many restaurants is they have the capacity to stay open later and they- I thought it was on weekends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=406.882">I</a>  didn't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=407.882">I</a>  don't remember, but usually- That's possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=411.603">I</a>  think the way that the licenses work <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=416.192">I</a>  can't remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=416.752">I</a>  can't remember. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=418.033">I</a>  had a meeting about this with a couple of people from City Hall about how a lot of people's approvals say that they actually can stay open until one, and then they have this other approval that says they can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=436.142">And</a>  it's actually whatever's latest is the thing that it applies to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=441.044">It's</a>  something we're working on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=444.166">getting</a>  aligned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=446.187">All</a>  of that being said, I don't remember specifically what it was except that they were asking to stay open until when we approved it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=453.272">I</a>  don't remember the details.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=455.993">I</a>  only mention it because this is the kind of thing like restaurants staying open until one is a kind of thing that occasionally some residents are not happy about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=463.858">So</a>  I know they're kind of apart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=465.76">They're</a>  not in a residential area, so it's probably fine.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=468.261">They</a>  are in the first floor of a building where people live. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=473.162">I</a>  mean, it is to some degree residential over there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=476.945">I</a>  didn't realize that was mixed use there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=479.227">It</a>  is, yeah, I think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=482.87">Let</a>  me pull up the agenda and look at what the paperwork says actually.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=489.135">Councilor</a>  is saying, oh, you put your hand down.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=491.717">Yeah,</a>  I think I covered everything I wanted to say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=494.219">The</a>  other thing was just, I think we're choosing to capitalize veterans generally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=499.463">I</a>  don't know if that's common use, but yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=505.422">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=507.143">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=509.345">It's</a>  not that important.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=511.106">Well,</a>  we should be, we should have it be correct based on my impression of this was that if we're like referring to the veteran's office, it's, I mean, yeah, yeah, we, we can, that's we'd like, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=530.276">Um,</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=536.652">Okay,</a>  I have the piece from the packet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=542.536">It's</a>  every day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=544.517">Opening</a>  hours, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=548.359">We</a>  would like to extend our license to 1 a.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=550.601">We</a>  have events that go into a later hour and don't wanna have to end them, sports games that go late, that kind of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=559.466">Yeah,</a>  that one was for every day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=562.628">And</a>  again, it's the sort of thing that like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=566.034">Restaurants</a>  don't always use it, but, and this was the same for Mrs. Murphy's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=572.577">We</a>  ended up approving it as like a blanket thing because they already had, I mean, we approved it sort of at the discretion of the restaurant, but since they already have the license on one hand with the approval, it doesn't, we don't really have, I mean, it's a little tricky to say now, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=595.788">Um,</a>  now that we, I mean, in my personal opinion, I don't think it makes sense to say to restrict it because often you're like telling people they should leave in the middle of an event or like, um, like a sports game, you're like halfway through the game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=615.3">And</a>  then you're like, where you have to close. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=617.061">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=620.129">Yeah,</a>  and I do know that there are, sorry, if I can butt in, I do know that there are residents who are concerned about it, but I, you know, I think there are even more residents who want it open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=632.559">From</a>  my past experience, last term, we came up across a few of these books, and a lot of them generated big discourse, and I think it was quite in one direction rather than the other.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=647.23">Oh,</a>  I just wanted it to accurately say what days that I'm not whether it should be open or not open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=655.394">I'm</a>  in favor, but I just want to reflect what we had actually decided.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=659.295">So</a>  I would just propose. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=663.635">For</a>  for that point, just to say to permit this to permit the establishment to stay open until 1 am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=670.639">That</a>  way, it's not because as councils are said, it's not like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=675.422">It's</a>  not that we're. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=676.943">That</a>  they're going to be open until 1 am every night and it's like, they can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=680.565">So,</a>  yeah, that's probably better clear wording.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=684.187">Okay,</a>  we approved your request to amend the comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=691.251">For</a>  the that permitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=694.833">establishment</a>  to stay up until 1am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=697.077">Permits,</a>  present tense probably. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=700.984">Quit</a>  correcting my grammar law school boy.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=703.309">No,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=706.741">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=707.021">And</a>  while, while that discussion was happening, I also noticed that there was one item under general business that, uh, was probably should have been under, uh, public health and community safety. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=718.97">Uh,</a>  the C cops.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=721.813">Oh,</a>  yeah, that I wasn't sure, but yeah, we can move that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=725.515">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=728.718">Because</a>  we did it in, in a regular meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=732.761">I</a>  wasn't sure where to put it.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=735.373">Yeah,</a>  that's always that's always kind of troublesome because like it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=740.74">They</a>  do eventually move to those right.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=746.976">That</a>  wasn't public health.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=748.677">The</a>  thing about it is that the police report started in public health and community safety, but the other portions of it, like the parking department's report, was never in public health and community safety. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=763.085">That</a>  was straight into a committee of the whole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=765.707">And</a>  there are some other parts of it that are all the surveillance reporting that was never in public health community safety.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=776.709">I</a>  just feel like general business is too big, and I like to... Great, just for visuals.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=782.093">It's</a>  just the newsletter, who cares? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=784.714">No,</a>  it hasn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=785.835">It's</a>  our beautiful newsletter, which I love.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=788.697">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=790.038">Okay,</a>  it's... Okay, so still, obviously, I have to extract YouTube links, but other than that, is anybody okay with what's written here so far?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=804.167">Mm-hmm.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=805.768">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=806.371">Motion</a>  to approve this and publish and circulate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=813.713">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=816.893">Wait,</a>  Emily, did you second that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=819.154">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=820.974">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=822.214">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=826.015">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=832.816">And</a>  this is to approve as edited and then publish?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=836.47">Yes,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=838.591">Councilor</a>  Callahan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=839.872">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=840.893">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=842.053">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=843.034">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=844.795">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=845.495">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=846.395">Chair</a>  Leming?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=847.256">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=848.597">Four</a>  approved, one absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=853.219">We</a>  will publish the May newsletter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=858.202">Moving</a>  on, we have, let me just get back to my digital copy of the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=864.766">Resolution</a>  for a public engagement plan for the FY26 budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=870.969">This</a>  is basically, if you recall at the last meeting, we permitted Councilor Tseng to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=882.805">keep</a>  the budget survey open for a little bit longer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=887.848">And</a>  I just asked him to come up with a description of the overall trends, asks, so on, that we've seen in the FY26 budget survey so far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=900.415">So</a>  whenever you're ready, just kind of tell us what people are saying in the survey, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=906.765">Yeah,</a>  I didn't have time this time to make a fancy PowerPoint but I did put things in a Word doc so I figured I'll just share the screen with you guys I will end up reading from a little bit, but we can move it faster that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=920.642">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=921.503">Um,</a>  so we got 110 responses which is decent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=926.348">And</a>  these responses, I wanted to start with the demographic data just to frame our sense of what kinds of people are engaging with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=936.755">Of</a>  course, we always see that with anything with city government, anything with political participation, really, it most reflects the people who are best able to engage with city, with politics. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=952.044">And</a>  so I think it's important to look at the demographic data first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=955.526">So</a>  this survey, excuse female, we did get a decent representation from across the city, maybe a little bit less from East Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=969.568">But</a>  we compared to my last version of the survey, this is a bigger, more diverse spread in terms of neighborhood representation in responding to the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=983.375">We</a>  also see that the survey is disproportionately high income. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=991.178">So</a>  that's something to keep in mind when we review the results of this survey as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1000.908">And</a>  it very much heavily skews towards homeowners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1007.695">According</a>  to the census estimates, the current spread of homeowner versus renter in the city is 53% homeowner, 47% renter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1014.202">So</a>  this is a very, very big skew. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1021.609">And</a>  the median age in the city, I believe is around 35 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1026.411">So</a>  this very much skews older as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1030.252">And</a>  so that's another thing to keep in mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1035.175">And</a>  I couldn't find any clear numbers of parents, like percentages of parents in the city, according to the census. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1048.467">This</a>  is just for us to know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1052.39">So</a>  that ended up being around 54% saying that they didn't have kids under the age of 18, 42% saying that they did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1063.566">Again,</a>  very expectedly skews white as well, although we did do better with getting Asian American responses than the last time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1075.95">And</a>  I actually will say, compared to my last survey, there are more people in their 20s answering as well, but it's still a lot less than the actual proportion in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1087.247">Um,</a>  and it's very English speaking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1090.051">That's</a>  the other thing I forget what the census estimates are, but it very much skews towards English speakers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1098.381">So,</a>  um, with the kind of caveat that we shouldn't treat this as a poll. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1105.243">there</a>  are kind of common themes that came up in a lot of the responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1110.165">So</a>  depending on how you cut it, schools and education was the most mentioned kind of topic when it came to the short-term needs question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1123.75">But</a>  if you combine the different kind of infrastructure questions into a bigger infrastructure thing,</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1129.572">Sorry,</a>  can you repeat how many responses total we got? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1133.575">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1135.096">So</a>  almost half of the responses mentioned schools and education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1140.841">And</a>  almost half mentioned some form of infrastructure, DPW street sidewalk as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1147.786">These</a>  numbers aren't, so this is saying 46 responses mentioned schools and education. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1154.731">It's</a>  not saying that like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1157.607">Oh,</a>  if you add up the number of responses, it's going to add up to more than 110, because some responses mentioned more than one category. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1169.854">And</a>  yeah, the DPW question really depends on how you cut it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1174.337">So</a>  I should update this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1176.939">This</a>  should read 46. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1184.158">So</a>  we basically got even number of responses talking about schools and education, and an even number of responses like my streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1191.982">And</a>  these were the two that really dominated the short term needs section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1196.785">When</a>  it came to schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1201.398">The</a>  focus was on Medford Public Schools and just getting adequate staffing adequate funding for the schools, but there were a number of residents who brought up after school care as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1212.489">When</a>  it came to streets and sidewalks, I think the heavy emphasis was on improving <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1218.672">road</a>  conditions, cracked streets and sidewalks, potholes, stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1224.634">But</a>  there was actually a lot of talk, comments about crosswalk safety, safer pedestrian infrastructure, cycling infrastructure as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1235.892">And</a>  then there are five responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1237.734">That's</a>  why I changed it from 41 to 46. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1239.155">There</a>  are five responses that talked about DPW funding more generally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1244.099">I</a>  think it's fair to infer that it's about streets and sidewalks, but they talked about just getting more funding for staffing in the office and better responsiveness there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1259.157">Um,</a>  we saw we had 25 responses mentioned non street infrastructure projects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1265.268">So</a>  these are projects that are kind of like public buildings, the high school city hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1274.106">We</a>  got 21 responses talking about affordable housing and development, particularly asking for more help for renters and kind of more just spending more money on housing as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1289.74">And</a>  then this is a very new jump is there 16 responses that explicitly mentioned more support for vulnerable low income immigrant residents, particularly putting it in the frame of what the federal government is doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1303.872">When</a>  I did the survey, two years ago, that was only mentioned by three or four people with a bigger, bigger sample size. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1312.238">And</a>  so this is a really, really big change from two years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1316.342">And</a>  then some other frequently mentioned priorities, transit, transportation, 14 responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1324.309">That</a>  was kind of more focused on public transit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1327.452">So</a>  safer cycling routes, better bus service, better MBTA access. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1334.818">Blue</a>  bike expansion, public safety 13 responses but this one public safety is kind of a big bucket to put this in it's not just about police, and honestly there were responses that cut both ways some asking for more police funding and a pretty much equal amount asking for cuts to police funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1353.751">But</a>  there were also calls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1356.453">I</a>  think a lot of it didn't talk explicitly in the frame of police. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1360.294">A</a>  lot of it was about fire, EMS, and just helping vulnerable populations in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1367.578">We</a>  got 13 responses mentioning funding for the library, asking for full funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1372.7">Four</a>  responses about trees, floods, like climate issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1377.261">And</a>  then there were five responses about losing federal funding and concerns about patching those holes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1384.363">Before</a>  I move on to the things that are statistically significant, I see Councilor Lazzaro has her hand, and I don't know if you want to.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1391.204">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, feel free to ask your question.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1394.118">I</a>  just thought I just wanted to highlight how interesting it is that our two override issues are the two things that people I mean the things that passed in the overrides are the two things that people were most commonly mentioning that the schools and the streets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1413.745">And,</a>  you know, even though they pass they're still like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1417.131">And</a>  we have more funding for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1418.534">There's</a>  still something that people think about a lot as something that we are still in need of more attention for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1425.826">I</a>  just wanted to highlight it.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1430.658">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1430.998">And</a>  that's an excellent point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1433.82">It</a>  is what the majority of Medford we know for sure cares about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1440.223">Councilor</a>  is saying it said 46 responses for both of them, like for each of those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1444.786">And</a>  do you have any, I don't know if you know this off the top of your head, but like, do you have an idea of like how many mentioned either one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1451.67">Like,</a>  was it like 60 or 80 that mentioned either schools or roads or both?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1457.675">Oh,</a>  I don't have that number right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1459.916">I</a>  could probably get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1461.097">But,</a>  um, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1463.938">If</a>  you if you look through it, it's, it is quite a few. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1466.799">It's</a>  not insignificant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1468.38">The</a>  overlap is not insignificant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1471.241">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1472.461">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1473.362">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1474.946">Yeah,</a>  no, it's certainly really interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1477.647">I</a>  mean, I think speaks to why the overrides were at least seen by a majority of residents in the city is really important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1486.632">Yeah,</a>  and I think if I can add my own commentary to this, in reading through the responses, I got a sense that a lot of residents saw the override as just <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1498.304">Like,</a>  1 step in the solution, rather than the complete answer to the solution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1504.405">I</a>  don't, I didn't really get the impression that people thought. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1507.106">That</a>  the overrides would solve everything about school funding or street, you know, street repair funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1514.747">Rather</a>  that they kind of just saw it as like, okay, this is what we need right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1519.108">Before</a>  we kind of either develop a more long term plan or come back to the voters in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1525.19">And</a>  there are a lot of, like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1528.079">This</a>  came up especially with the schools. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1529.64">A</a>  lot of responses were kind of about, we know that we have good funding this year for the schools, but we need to make sure that we maintain this going forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1541.363">And</a>  so that was kind of, that was a decent like chunk of responses focusing on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1549.565">I</a>  also thought it was really interesting to see what was statistically significant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1556.971">I,</a>  this isn't completely unsurprising but young like younger respondents, particularly in the, in their 30s were more likely to highlight housing library, public safety issues, middle aged, like 4040 to 59 year olds were kind of more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1576.319">more</a>  emphasizing roads and sidewalks and big capital projects like buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1580.921">And</a>  then older adults, 60 to 69, that category, more consistently mentioned street repairs and public infrastructure as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1590.286">So</a>  the kind of focus on infrastructure seems to be correlated with older age and the focus on housing and library and some education issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1604.253">seem</a>  to be a little bit more correlated with youth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1607.058">And</a>  I think that's important to keep in mind because we know that this survey skews towards older older voters as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1616.308">Parents,</a>  unsurprisingly, much more, you know, frequently mentioned after school programs, schools, etc. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1624.19">And</a>  then another kind of important thing to titrate with is income, because we know that this survey is huge towards much, much towards much, much higher incomes and, you know, our median here in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1639.304">So</a>  higher income respondents were more likely to emphasize non-street infrastructure and library services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1646.929">And</a>  then mid to lower income respondents were much more likely to bring up affordable housing and support for vulnerable communities as the short-term priority in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1662.25">When</a>  we go to long term needs, schools and education remains at the top, a little bit fewer responses but still, you know, up there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1672.821">Um,</a>  we see the kind of framing change from just getting funding to kind of more long term like big picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1683.092">Goals</a>  for the schools so stronger leadership staffing curriculum equity after school care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1690.999">Housing</a>  jumps up when you ask about long term priorities as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1695.563">It</a>  jumps up to 31 responses becomes the 2nd most. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1700.287">frequently</a>  mentioned topic, and there was a lot of calls for proactive zoning reform, so more aggressive zoning reform, funding for the affordable housing trust, and tenant protections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1718.193">Non-street</a>  infrastructure, so this is again like buildings, 30 responses, which is also quite significant, and there is the water and sewer system as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1730.262">Um,</a>  and then, um, there was also, like, people linked this to climate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1737.286">Uh,</a>  so they're, they're asking for, um, like, when it came to the sewer system, there were a few responses that linked it to flooding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1744.47">When</a>  it came to buildings, a lot of people, um, linked it to emissions as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1749.293">Um,</a>  economic development becomes a lot more, um, mentioned as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1755.517">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1756.517">There</a>  were a few different ways of going about it, but I think residents were really focused on business development, supporting small businesses, improving the aesthetics of Medford Square and our smaller squares as well, and then also bringing up the idea of placemaking and community building through economic development and redesigning our squares. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1784.2">Climate</a>  also becomes much more mentioned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1788.525">So</a>  again, a lot of this is about trees and heat islands, but generally kind of climate becomes a lot more mentioned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1796.334">And</a>  then roads and sidewalks, still very frequently mentioned, drops a lot in kind of dimensions, but the difference <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1805.044">With</a>  the old responses is that these responses focus more on long term strategy and proactive maintenance, rather than just potholes and then there are more mentions here for that kind of talked about complete streets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1819.996">And</a>  then statistically significant demographic patterns, younger residents were more likely to mention housing, climate, economic development, older residents were more likely to mention infrastructure and infrastructure in general. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1837.543">And</a>  we actually didn't see that many statistically significant differences with this question when it came to income like we like in the other, like the short-term priorities question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1850.794">And</a>  then this is just so you guys can see things that were raised a lot more under this kind of framing, economic development, climate, housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1861.423">That</a>  was these three in particular. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1865.446">I</a>  think people see these as long-term priorities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1870.771">And</a>  then when it came to the question about what new programs and services Medford should fund, there are quite a lot of responses about youth or teen programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1881.22">So</a>  some of it was in the frame of after-school care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1884.362">Some</a>  of it was in the frame of teen centers, job programs, volunteer enrichment opportunities, and mental health. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1893.431">The</a>  framing of mental health. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1895.654">We</a>  also got a lot of mentions of city services, some of them went into more detail, some of the comments went into more detail than others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1905.703">When</a>  they went into details, I think things that came up were code enforcement, housing inspection, customer service, communication, and focusing on kind of like permitting reforms, internal reforms that we can make due to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1923.33">make</a>  City Hall more efficient. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1926.713">Public</a>  transportation and mobility also is frequently mentioned under this as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1933.118">So</a>  public transit, cycling infrastructure, multimodal planning, and then shuttles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1940.864">I</a>  know there's a transportation task force out there right now working on the shuttle idea as well because the federal funding is going to change for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1953.112">Economic</a>  development, people kind of, there's some appetite for us to look into new programs when it comes to incentivizing economic development and SOAR fronts, tackling vacancies, and then also increasing mixed use in our city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1978.547">Housing</a>  support as well, housing navigation, stabilization programs, eviction support, homelessness prevention and outreach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1988.257">These</a>  were things that residents wanted us to do more and to create more programs about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=1994.584">And</a>  then new programs related to climate, five people mentioned that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2002.367">very</a>  similar to what I mentioned before already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2004.948">Infrastructure</a>  roads as well, also very similar to what I mentioned before, the only kind of new things coming in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2012.092">Curb</a>  ramps came up, private way improvements, which we know is a really tricky issue, but a lot of, you know, given that I think 36% of our roads are private ways, I know it is a really important issue in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2028.0">And</a>  then recreation and like funding for <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2033.087">more</a>  culture and recreation programming through the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2036.87">There</a>  were six responses about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2038.811">And</a>  then there were responses that mentioned mental health programs and equity and access programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2046.618">This</a>  question had a lot fewer responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2050.101">These</a>  were optional questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2053.383">But</a>  younger residents were a lot more statistically likely to propose new programming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2062.905">And</a>  then there's some miscellaneous ideas that came up that didn't really fit neatly into any of the categories, participatory budgeting, third spaces, and leveraging our relationships with nonprofits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2079.358">This</a>  is a typo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2080.539">This</a>  isn't there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2083.321">I</a>  also integrated that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2087.484">When</a>  it came to kind of the last page of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2091.753">The</a>  survey participation updates. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2093.774">These</a>  were the options we we offered and honestly, there was a lot of kind of a lot of responses for all of them besides robo calls and attending listening sessions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2108.743">The</a>  most popular responses were this, the council newsletter and social media posts but this also skews. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2116.547">Towards</a>  those responses, because those were the channels where we were most aggressive about distributing the survey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2123.951">Those</a>  are the channels that were most open to us, so we should kind of keep keep that in mind when it comes to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2131.655">But</a>  I think this kind of suggests that we should find a holistic approach. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2137.479">To</a>  reach our residents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2140.361">And</a>  then this was the second question more specifically about participating in the budget process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2149.747">I</a>  think people, again, the newsletters, they're very high. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2156.032">I</a>  think there's an explanation for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2157.813">But</a>  I think there's some people want to be able to email us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2164.637">very</a>  common as a response. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2166.62">And</a>  then there is interest in a special budget-related Zoom meeting, listening sessions, and town halls. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2179.244">And</a>  then when it came to the open-ended question about questions and comments about the budget process, I kind of looked at them and then broadly categorized them, although I think it's worth just going through it on our own and reading through what people responded, because there aren't that many responses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2198.76">I</a>  think there are probably around 30 responses to that question, 30 to 50, somewhere there, maybe 30, 40. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2210.175">But</a>  broadly, I think there's six buckets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2214.417">People</a>  want to know how the budget process is structured and decided. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2218.759">They</a>  want to know where the money is going and how we track it and how we explain that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2227.384">They</a>  want to know how they can, residents want to know how they can participate meaningfully. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2234.841">They</a>  want to know who is being included in the process and who is being left out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2243.599">They</a>  want to know why aren't, why does it feel like board services aren't more functional than they are? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2250.482">And</a>  I think a lot of this is actually perception. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2252.883">That's</a>  something we can talk about after too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2255.964">And</a>  then people want to know if we are addressing urgent and long-term needs and how we keep track of stuff like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2263.967">And</a>  this is the last page, the last part of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2268.109">I</a>  think these questions go to talking about <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2274.206">like,</a>  communicating better about things that we already are doing as a city, and especially as a city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2280.508">A</a>  lot of what residents raised are covered in the zoning reform process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2288.311">A</a>  lot of it is in the Medford Square Revitalization Plan, the RFP, that is being proposed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2294.914">But</a>  I think more work has to be done to let residents know that a lot of their ideas are in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2302.517">I</a>  think <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2303.797">I</a>  think a good kind of encapsulation of that point I just made are the comments about permitting and about City Hall being slow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2315.4">I</a>  think the perception is there, but as we heard in our budget meetings, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have talked to our business and planning staff about this, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2325.945">and</a>  building department staff about this, on the city council side actually, or on the Medford side, the city of Medford side, a lot of that actually happens very quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2335.328">We</a>  can get permitting done within a day or two, but a lot of it is at the state level as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2340.349">The</a>  state has its whole litany of regulations and permitting processes as well, and that oftentimes can take up to two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2348.932">And</a>  so there's a, you know, I think we might need to educate the public more about what is city controlled and what is state controlled, but also do more advocacy on behalf of the city to get the permitting done quicker on the state level. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2367.195">So</a>  there's my summary.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2369.916">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2370.316">That</a>  was a very thorough summary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2372.457">Much</a>  appreciated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2373.377">And</a>  I'm also glad that it got written down in a document that can be distributed after the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2381.44">Do</a>  we have any questions from from Councilors? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2391.168">Yep,</a>  Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2392.849">I</a>  don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2393.789">I</a>  just really appreciate you going through and distilling the data this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2398.231">I</a>  mean, qualitative data like this is really hard to, sometimes hard to put into cohesive, like a cohesive narrative this way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2408.196">So</a>  I appreciate you doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2410.678">Something</a>  I think is really interesting was, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2413.839">that</a>  you figured out that people would be interested in a zoom meeting that functions as like a listening session around the budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2421.364">I</a>  do think that that could be a useful thing maybe for a lot of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2428.009">We</a>  could potentially do in person even but yeah I mean I think budgeting is <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2433.95">um</a>  really abstract to people sometimes and it can be very easy to say to be as as an average resident to be like a naysayer to be like what are they even spending all this money on it's such a huge amount of money and then you know uh it was so useful i thought in one of our meetings when um councilor callahan pulled up like the <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2456.543">pie</a>  chart and it's like this much is going to insurance no matter what no matter what this much is going to paying off the bonds and you know the interest on our loans and we can't we have nothing to do with that and we can't change it so like always know that these numbers are immovable and this much is our is what we pay for the schools and it's huge <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2479.701">There's</a>  that, there's fire, there's police. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2481.581">These</a>  are huge amounts of money and we can't, we don't, we wouldn't want to make those lower because then we really are putting our city at risk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2490.303">So</a>  like these things are, but I think these, like those conversations, I think most people when they heard them, they would be like, oh yeah, absolutely super reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2498.665">And</a>  the more you have those conversations openly and transparently, the better people understand things on like, this is how you have, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2506.457">a</a>  transparent government and people being interested in that is really good, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2511.979">So</a>  it's nice to have that all laid out for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2516.941">So</a>  really useful data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2519.602">Thank</a>  you for sharing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2520.423">Thank</a>  you for putting it forward for us.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2526.045">Do</a>  we have any comments from members of the public? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2530.966">If</a>  anybody would like to <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2533.223">Ask</a>  any questions on Zoom, feel free to raise your hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2537.826">I</a>  see two members of the public there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2539.987">This</a>  is one of the more informal committees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2543.269">All</a>  right, well, seeing none, just like to, once again, express my appreciation for all the work that you clearly put into this, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2555.637">I'm</a>  also generally happy that the <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2562.202">Demographics</a>  seem to have got, it seems to have gotten like a slightly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2566.484">Less</a>  biased in terms of its demographics from last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2570.305">So,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2572.706">I</a>  think that's good that progress is being made on that end of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2577.147">Um,</a>  cool. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2580.829">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2581.569">Do</a>  we need a motion to keep the paper and committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2584.91">Or</a>  a motion to release the survey report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2589.252">Something</a>  like that.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2591.5">I</a>  guess we can do a motion to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2594.902">Distribute</a>  the survey or should we, I guess it makes sense to distribute it to Councilors and then Councilors can see what they want to do with the data. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2604.646">And</a>  then, so I guess motion to distribute to Councilors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2611.45">We</a>  could keep the paper in committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2613.03">This</a>  is the last big thing related to it, but what we could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2617.862">unless</a>  we hold a Zoom meeting as a committee, but I think that's a question for Councilors, whether we should do it as maybe two Councilors do it, or we do a committee listings like Zoom listings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2635.096">We</a>  also don't, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2642.922">I</a>  think it could make make more sense to just let Councilors do it individually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2647.225">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2649.067">I</a>  mean, as a committee thing.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2650.928">I</a>  do think at some point, we do kind of need to, like, say, you know, the survey, the survey at this point is done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2658.074">Let's</a>  distribute more of a final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2660.576">And</a>  then if we want to follow up on that, like you said, we could just do it on our own initiative doesn't necessarily have to be doesn't necessarily have to be a motion here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2673.111">Okay,</a>  but I think a motion to distribute the full results of the survey to Councilors publicly distribute the report that you just presented and receive in place the paper on file would probably be an appropriate motion.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2694.66">and</a>  adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2695.56">I'll</a>  move that and then I'll add and adjourn.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2697.561">No,</a>  no, we still have to review the actual listening sessions themselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2701.002">So</a>  I just want a small description from you and Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2704.664">So</a>  sorry, I forgot about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2707.085">Slipped</a>  my mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2708.545">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2710.306">Okay,</a>  I'll move what you just said.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2712.507">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2713.047">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2714.267">Okay,</a>  on the motion from Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2720.109">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2725.262">Councilor</a>  Callahan?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2726.463">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2727.744">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2728.965">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2730.407">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli is absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2732.008">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2732.969">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2733.91">Chair</a>  Lennon?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2735.171">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2736.332">For</a>  affirmative, one absent, the motion passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2740.355">And</a>  the last, the very last is a update on our listening session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2747.001">So</a>  I understand that councilors <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2749.228">Lazzaro</a>  and Sang had a listening session recently at the senior center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2755.352">So</a>  just an update on how that went. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2758.994">Any</a>  interesting topics came up, how the vibe was, whichever of you would like to go.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2764.157">Quick</a>  vibe check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2766.979">It</a>  was great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2767.959">We</a>  had a really productive session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2769.961">We</a>  heard from a lot of <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2773.058">a</a>  lot of Medfair residents who we tend to get I in my experience they're usually it's it's a listening session. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2782.444">it's</a>  also kind of constituent services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2785.085">So</a>  people will have like specific concerns about, you know, things in their neighborhood or on their particular property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2793.929">So,</a>  um, I've been following up with some folks and, um, there's still a couple other things I want to circle back on, but, um, yeah, it was very pleasant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2803.333">I</a>  mean, I always like visiting the senior center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2805.193">It's</a>  really nice to connect with people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2806.634">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2807.258">We</a>  had a really nice time Councilor Tseng I don't think has been to one before so I mean he can he can weigh in as well.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2814.855">No,</a>  I think he captured it pretty well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2817.097">I</a>  mean, we talked about infrastructure, of course, came up quite a bit, like potholes and traffic came up, like making sure that we are enforcing our speed limits. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2832.711">Things</a>  like that came up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2835.414">We</a>  had some general conversation about <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2840.305">the</a>  override funds, especially when it came to infrastructure but I think Councilor Lazzaro pretty much captured a lot of it a lot of it was constituent service based. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2851.832">I</a>  think I'm just very focused on, you know, like certain things that have come up with residents and and helping us helping link them to the people who can get that solve for them.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2865.472">people</a>  with people in City Hall who can provide services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2868.694">Because,</a>  you know, I mean, the thing about City Council is that we are happy to connect people with the services that they can access, but we don't provide really any services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2878.399">We</a>  really just can let people know where they can access services. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2883.142">So</a>  that's a lot of what we do.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2885.239">Oh,</a>  some residents did bring up that they find it hard to know how to access the like phone numbers and emails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2892.228">So</a>  I think that's something for for us to think about, especially for residents that don't have computers or don't have ready access to computers.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2901.522">That</a>  was on my list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2902.462">Councilor</a>  Tseng had an idea to have a one pager of like frequently referred to phone numbers in city hall, people that you would want to be able to give contact info at listing sessions, you know, a person to call at DPW, a person to call at like maybe housing access, maybe Medford Housing Authority, you know, that kind of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2929.571">just</a>  like a list of people that you would want to make a phone call to with phone numbers.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2936.334">It's</a>  a good idea, especially for, yeah, I think serving people who don't have computer access quite to the same degree that most do is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2948.943">Definitely</a>  good initiative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2950.043">Out</a>  of curiosity, I noticed when I went to the listening session that some residents were, it was a little bit like a public meeting almost, and some residents were afraid to speak up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2960.165">So</a>  there is a thing, and I think Councilor Callahan went through this as well, where a few residents would approach us after and sort of ask questions in private. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2969.247">Did</a>  the same thing sort of happen, or were people more like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2974.792">uh,</a>  willing to, yeah, I see the sunlight, uh, were people more sort of like willing to just like say what was on their mind openly.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2982.755">They</a>  seem fairly comfortable at this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2987.177">Um,</a>  we have a couple of people who always, I mean, there's, there's a couple of people that always get us started, but everybody seems pretty comfortable jumping in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=2995.96">Um,</a>  at this, at this particular one, there's always a different energy, but everybody seems pretty comfortable.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3002.823">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3004.557">All</a>  right, cool.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3007.258">Well,</a>  thank you all for the update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3010.339">Is</a>  there any other questions from councillors or members of the public? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3017.202">Do</a>  we have a motion to keep the paper in committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/city-council-resident-services-and-public-engagement-06-04-25&start=3020.203">Or</a>  Councilor Callahan.</p>
