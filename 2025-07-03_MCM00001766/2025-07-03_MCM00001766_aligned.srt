1
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:07,067
Okie dokie, looks like everyone is here right now.

2
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:13,693
So we have a quorum anyway, not everybody, everybody on the committee.

3
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:17,636
So yeah, we can go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:24,142
Clark, I always forget, when we're on Zoom, we have to call the roll or not, or can we just go?

5
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:28,446
Because the meeting is on Zoom, you do have to call the roll.

6
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:29,526
All right.

7
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:34,311
We will have a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting.

8
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,052
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

9
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,553
Just a second, please.

10
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,214
I gotta let Councilor Callahan in.

11
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:40,855
Hang on just a quick second.

12
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:44,557
Okay, here comes the roll call.

13
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:46,558
Councilor Callahan?

14
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:47,119
Present.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,500
Councilor Lozaro?

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,201
Present.

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,022
Councilor Scarpelli?

18
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:54,585
I don't see Councilor Scarpella.

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,246
Councilor Sagan?

20
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:55,786
Present.

21
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:56,906
Chair Lemming?

22
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,886
Present.

23
00:00:58,407 --> 00:00:59,787
For present, one absent.

24
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:00,927
Meeting is called to order.

25
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:13,651
The first thing we're going to do is try to knock out this newsletter, which was so graciously drafted by Councilor Lozaro.

26
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:14,992
Thank you very much for

27
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,673
pulling up all of those links.

28
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:19,054
I'm just going.

29
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:20,995
So many links.

30
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:23,756
Well, yeah, especially during budget season.

31
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:37,303
I mean, it was really fun, creative linking there, especially with it felt like it wasn't necessary to have a new bullet point for every single board and commission.

32
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:45,107
So I just linked where it says every link, board link and link

33
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:49,324
commission link for each of the boards and commissions.

34
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:54,766
So I tried to make it a little bit less painful to read, just a little bit more readable that way.

35
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,328
So I mean, yeah, see, there it is.

36
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:03,070
All of Medford's boards and commissions.

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,111
That's a fun.

38
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:04,871
That was fun.

39
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:07,152
But it was painstaking.

40
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:10,394
Anyway, yeah, take a look.

41
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:10,774
Let me know.

42
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:26,681
Yeah, so basically the only edits that I made to this draft and this is the formatted version where I added the Memorial Day resolution and and yeah tracking those suspended resolutions as always.

43
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,502
Oh, thank you.

44
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,222
I missed those.

45
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,043
Yes, they weren't.

46
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,484
On the website.

47
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:37,131
Oh, yeah, no, that's I've done that multiple times before the resolutions under suspension are hard to keep track of.

48
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:39,254
I added what we're doing today.

49
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:46,942
So, assuming that we do get done with these 2 things, might as well just throw that on retroactively.

50
00:02:48,452 --> 00:03:01,934
Um, I added yesterday's meeting, uh, saying we hosted facilities manager, Paul Reilly to offer an update to the city council regarding the estimated costs of repairing and maintaining all city on facilities in the future.

51
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:09,916
Um, and let's see, what else did I just a quick point of information, chair looming.

52
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,277
Um, his name is pronounced Paul Ricky.

53
00:03:14,797 --> 00:03:15,117
Shoot.

54
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:15,937
Well,

55
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,673
there aren't that many people in this meeting to catch my.

56
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:20,873
For the future.

57
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:27,014
So, but I'm sure that my pronunciation will be correct over text in this newsletter.

58
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:40,097
And I also added just an extra link to the planning and permitting committee because this other corridors business was discussed on both May 14th and May 28th.

59
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:40,677
Councilor Seng.

60
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,064
Oh, um, you can go through yourself first.

61
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:48,884
Oh.

62
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:57,951
Um, well, I think I'm just trying, I'm just trying to look and remember, but I think I want to say that that was about it.

63
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:01,074
Just those couple of those extra meetings.

64
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:02,135
Yeah.

65
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:08,500
Just a few details that were missed, but overall, yeah, this was a pretty, you know, it was, it was good job.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,362
So yeah, feel free to bring up what you'd,

67
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,888
uh, whatever was on your mind.

68
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:14,109
Yeah.

69
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:22,535
Um, for the HRC ordinance, um, I would probably just mention that it like empower, empowers the HRC to do more somehow.

70
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:35,485
Like, I think it's kind of an effective, like to make it more effective, but, um, maybe, I mean, if you can, can I, can you, okay, there, there we go.

71
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:36,546
It's line 204, right?

72
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:37,247
Um,

73
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:43,726
Prove for first reading the governance origins for HRC.

74
00:04:44,606 --> 00:05:07,441
Maybe instead of which will make it run, to empower it to run more effectively and respond to new challenges, I don't know, something like that.

75
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:18,297
On May 13th, after much review and committee, we approve for first reading the governing ordinance from Edwards Human Rights Commission to empower it to run more effectively and respond to any challenges.

76
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,339
Um, yeah, that's my note for that one.

77
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:27,681
And then, generally, there's another, um, there was the common Vic one.

78
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,582
Oh, yeah, right above it for 203.

79
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:29,962
It reads like

80
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:39,029
we voted for it to stay open on that one particular day on May 3rd.

81
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,112
That's the right to stay open on May 3rd of every year.

82
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,074
I like it.

83
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:48,874
Good catch.

84
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:54,778
And then just generally, I don't know if Veterans is capitalized.

85
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,920
Not until 1am forever though, like on every day.

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,181
Oh yeah, do we know which

87
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:09,361
I actually think we approved them to stay open until, well, this is actually something that is going to come up a lot more for us.

88
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:22,224
We are, all of our businesses, we're aligning them with their common victualers license and their liquor licenses are often misaligned.

89
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,305
So we're bringing them into alignment.

90
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:29,838
And sometimes their liquor licenses say they can stay open later than their convicts do.

91
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,020
So I think what we did for the establishment was we told them that they can stay open until 1 a.m.

92
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,480
They don't always do it.

93
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:46,482
This is what kind of happens with many restaurants is they have the capacity to stay open later and they- I thought it was on weekends.

94
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:47,842
I didn't know.

95
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:51,163
I don't remember, but usually- That's possible.

96
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,644
I think the way that the licenses work

97
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:56,732
I can't remember.

98
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,013
I can't remember.

99
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:15,462
I had a meeting about this with a couple of people from City Hall about how a lot of people's approvals say that they actually can stay open until one, and then they have this other approval that says they can't.

100
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:20,824
And it's actually whatever's latest is the thing that it applies to.

101
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,186
It's something we're working on.

102
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,727
getting aligned.

103
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:33,192
All of that being said, I don't remember specifically what it was except that they were asking to stay open until when we approved it.

104
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,293
I don't remember the details.

105
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:43,818
I only mention it because this is the kind of thing like restaurants staying open until one is a kind of thing that occasionally some residents are not happy about.

106
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,720
So I know they're kind of apart.

107
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,521
They're not in a residential area, so it's probably fine.

108
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:51,843
They are in the first floor of a building where people live.

109
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,984
I mean, it is to some degree residential over there.

110
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,646
I didn't realize that was mixed use there.

111
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,468
It is, yeah, I think so.

112
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,353
Let me pull up the agenda and look at what the paperwork says actually.

113
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,377
Councilor is saying, oh, you put your hand down.

114
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:14,179
Yeah, I think I covered everything I wanted to say.

115
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,443
The other thing was just, I think we're choosing to capitalize veterans generally.

116
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,866
I don't know if that's common use, but yeah.

117
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,483
Yeah.

118
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:27,664
Okay.

119
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:30,145
It's not that important.

120
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:48,915
Well, we should be, we should have it be correct based on my impression of this was that if we're like referring to the veteran's office, it's, I mean, yeah, yeah, we, we can, that's we'd like, that's fine.

121
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:53,478
Um, sure.

122
00:08:56,652 --> 00:09:01,135
Okay, I have the piece from the packet.

123
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:04,217
It's every day.

124
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:08,299
Opening hours, yeah, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

125
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:10,561
We would like to extend our license to 1 a.m.

126
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:19,026
We have events that go into a later hour and don't wanna have to end them, sports games that go late, that kind of thing.

127
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,088
Yeah, that one was for every day.

128
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,670
And again, it's the sort of thing that like,

129
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:30,876
Restaurants don't always use it, but, and this was the same for Mrs. Murphy's.

130
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:55,086
We ended up approving it as like a blanket thing because they already had, I mean, we approved it sort of at the discretion of the restaurant, but since they already have the license on one hand with the approval, it doesn't, we don't really have, I mean, it's a little tricky to say now,

131
00:09:55,788 --> 00:10:14,820
Um, now that we, I mean, in my personal opinion, I don't think it makes sense to say to restrict it because often you're like telling people they should leave in the middle of an event or like, um, like a sports game, you're like halfway through the game.

132
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,041
And then you're like, where you have to close.

133
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:17,101
So.

134
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:32,138
Yeah, and I do know that there are, sorry, if I can butt in, I do know that there are residents who are concerned about it, but I, you know, I think there are even more residents who want it open.

135
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:46,590
From my past experience, last term, we came up across a few of these books, and a lot of them generated big discourse, and I think it was quite in one direction rather than the other.

136
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:55,254
Oh, I just wanted it to accurately say what days that I'm not whether it should be open or not open.

137
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:59,215
I'm in favor, but I just want to reflect what we had actually decided.

138
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:01,736
So I would just propose.

139
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:09,899
For for that point, just to say to permit this to permit the establishment to stay open until 1 am.

140
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,022
That way, it's not because as councils are said, it's not like that.

141
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:16,262
It's not that we're.

142
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,004
That they're going to be open until 1 am every night and it's like, they can.

143
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:24,167
So, yeah, that's probably better clear wording.

144
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:30,290
Okay, we approved your request to amend the comments.

145
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,832
For the that permitted.

146
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,596
establishment to stay up until 1am.

147
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:38,780
Permits, present tense probably.

148
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,289
Quit correcting my grammar law school boy.

149
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:44,070
No, sorry.

150
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:46,941
Yeah.

151
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:58,950
And while, while that discussion was happening, I also noticed that there was one item under general business that, uh, was probably should have been under, uh, public health and community safety.

152
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,392
Uh, the C cops.

153
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:05,235
Oh, yeah, that I wasn't sure, but yeah, we can move that.

154
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:05,896
Okay.

155
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:12,741
Because we did it in, in a regular meeting.

156
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,162
I wasn't sure where to put it.

157
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:19,539
Yeah, that's always that's always kind of troublesome because like it.

158
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,643
They do eventually move to those right.

159
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,517
That wasn't public health.

160
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:43,065
The thing about it is that the police report started in public health and community safety, but the other portions of it, like the parking department's report, was never in public health and community safety.

161
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:45,687
That was straight into a committee of the whole.

162
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:55,933
And there are some other parts of it that are all the surveillance reporting that was never in public health community safety.

163
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,672
I just feel like general business is too big, and I like to... Great, just for visuals.

164
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:03,273
It's just the newsletter, who cares?

165
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:05,675
No, it hasn't.

166
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,956
It's our beautiful newsletter, which I love.

167
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:08,897
Yes.

168
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:23,406
Okay, it's... Okay, so still, obviously, I have to extract YouTube links, but other than that, is anybody okay with what's written here so far?

169
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,167
Mm-hmm.

170
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:25,928
Yeah.

171
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:32,372
Motion to approve this and publish and circulate it.

172
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,113
Okay.

173
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:39,074
Wait, Emily, did you second that?

174
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:39,854
Councilor Lozaro?

175
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:41,194
Great.

176
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:45,855
On the motion of councilor saying to approve, seconded by Councilor Lozaro.

177
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,315
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

178
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,557
And this is to approve as edited and then publish?

179
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,870
Yes, yes.

180
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,272
Councilor Callahan?

181
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,092
Yes.

182
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:01,793
Councilor Lazaro?

183
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:02,313
Yes.

184
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,234
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

185
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:05,415
Councilor Singh?

186
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:05,735
Yes.

187
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:06,856
Chair Lemming?

188
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:07,536
Yes.

189
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,759
Four approved, one absent.

190
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,841
We will publish the May newsletter.

191
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:23,605
Moving on, we have, let me just get back to my digital copy of the agenda.

192
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:29,308
Resolution for a public engagement plan for the FY26 budget.

193
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:39,994
This is basically, if you recall at the last meeting, we permitted Councilor Sang to

194
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:47,328
keep the budget survey open for a little bit longer.

195
00:14:47,848 --> 00:15:00,275
And I just asked him to come up with a description of the overall trends, asks, so on, that we've seen in the FY26 budget survey so far.

196
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:06,379
So whenever you're ready, just kind of tell us what people are saying in the survey, Councilor Sang.

197
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:20,622
Yeah, I didn't have time this time to make a fancy PowerPoint but I did put things in a Word doc so I figured I'll just share the screen with you guys I will end up reading from a little bit, but we can move it faster that way.

198
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:21,282
Cool.

199
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,406
Um, so we got 110 responses which is decent.

200
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:36,134
And these responses, I wanted to start with the demographic data just to frame our sense of what kinds of people are engaging with it.

201
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:50,383
Of course, we always see that with anything with city government, anything with political participation, really, it most reflects the people who are best able to engage with city, with politics.

202
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:55,266
And so I think it's important to look at the demographic data first.

203
00:15:55,526 --> 00:16:07,259
So this survey, excuse female, we did get a decent representation from across the city, maybe a little bit less from East Medford.

204
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:22,314
But we compared to my last version of the survey, this is a bigger, more diverse spread in terms of neighborhood representation in responding to the survey.

205
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:31,098
We also see that the survey is disproportionately high income.

206
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:38,142
So that's something to keep in mind when we review the results of this survey as well.

207
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:47,155
And it very much heavily skews towards homeowners.

208
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:54,182
According to the census estimates, the current spread of homeowner versus renter in the city is 53% homeowner, 47% renter.

209
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:55,943
So this is a very, very big skew.

210
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:06,010
And the median age in the city, I believe is around 35 years old.

211
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,552
So this very much skews older as well.

212
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:13,534
And so that's another thing to keep in mind.

213
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:26,420
And I couldn't find any clear numbers of parents, like percentages of parents in the city, according to the census.

214
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,349
This is just for us to know.

215
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,036
So that ended up being around 54% saying that they didn't have kids under the age of 18, 42% saying that they did.

216
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:55,290
Again, very expectedly skews white as well, although we did do better with getting Asian American responses than the last time.

217
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:05,754
And I actually will say, compared to my last survey, there are more people in their 20s answering as well, but it's still a lot less than the actual proportion in the city.

218
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,891
Um, and it's very English speaking.

219
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:16,779
That's the other thing I forget what the census estimates are, but it very much skews towards English speakers.

220
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:23,427
So, um, with the kind of caveat that we shouldn't treat this as a poll.

221
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:29,445
there are kind of common themes that came up in a lot of the responses.

222
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:43,170
So depending on how you cut it, schools and education was the most mentioned kind of topic when it came to the short-term needs question.

223
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,672
But if you combine the different kind of infrastructure questions into a bigger infrastructure thing,

224
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:52,835
Sorry, can you repeat how many responses total we got?

225
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:52,835
110.

226
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:54,456
Thank you.

227
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:59,820
So almost half of the responses mentioned schools and education.

228
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:06,965
And almost half mentioned some form of infrastructure, DPW street sidewalk as well.

229
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:14,671
These numbers aren't, so this is saying 46 responses mentioned schools and education.

230
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:16,433
It's not saying that like,

231
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:27,713
Oh, if you add up the number of responses, it's going to add up to more than 110, because some responses mentioned more than one category.

232
00:19:29,854 --> 00:19:33,737
And yeah, the DPW question really depends on how you cut it.

233
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:36,919
So I should update this.

234
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:37,579
This should read 46.

235
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:51,682
So we basically got even number of responses talking about schools and education, and an even number of responses like my streets and sidewalks.

236
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,004
And these were the two that really dominated the short term needs section.

237
00:19:56,785 --> 00:19:57,785
When it came to schools.

238
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:10,527
The focus was on Medford Public Schools and just getting adequate staffing adequate funding for the schools, but there were a number of residents who brought up after school care as well.

239
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:17,234
When it came to streets and sidewalks, I think the heavy emphasis was on improving

240
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:23,974
road conditions, cracked streets and sidewalks, potholes, stuff like that.

241
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:34,818
But there was actually a lot of talk, comments about crosswalk safety, safer pedestrian infrastructure, cycling infrastructure as well.

242
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,693
And then there are five responses.

243
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:38,935
That's why I changed it from 41 to 46.

244
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:44,079
There are five responses that talked about DPW funding more generally.

245
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:57,690
I think it's fair to infer that it's about streets and sidewalks, but they talked about just getting more funding for staffing in the office and better responsiveness there.

246
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:05,247
Um, we saw we had 25 responses mentioned non street infrastructure projects.

247
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:11,518
So these are projects that are kind of like public buildings, the high school city hall.

248
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:28,840
We got 21 responses talking about affordable housing and development, particularly asking for more help for renters and kind of more just spending more money on housing as well.

249
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:43,351
And then this is a very new jump is there 16 responses that explicitly mentioned more support for vulnerable low income immigrant residents, particularly putting it in the frame of what the federal government is doing.

250
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:51,418
When I did the survey, two years ago, that was only mentioned by three or four people with a bigger, bigger sample size.

251
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:55,201
And so this is a really, really big change from two years ago.

252
00:21:56,342 --> 00:22:03,228
And then some other frequently mentioned priorities, transit, transportation, 14 responses.

253
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,611
That was kind of more focused on public transit.

254
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:14,037
So safer cycling routes, better bus service, better MBTA access.

255
00:22:14,818 --> 00:22:32,191
Blue bike expansion, public safety 13 responses but this one public safety is kind of a big bucket to put this in it's not just about police, and honestly there were responses that cut both ways some asking for more police funding and a pretty much equal amount asking for cuts to police funding.

256
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:35,932
But there were also calls.

257
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:40,254
I think a lot of it didn't talk explicitly in the frame of police.

258
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:46,657
A lot of it was about fire, EMS, and just helping vulnerable populations in the city.

259
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:52,100
We got 13 responses mentioning funding for the library, asking for full funding.

260
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,121
Four responses about trees, floods, like climate issues.

261
00:22:57,261 --> 00:23:03,863
And then there were five responses about losing federal funding and concerns about patching those holes.

262
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:11,124
Before I move on to the things that are statistically significant, I see Councilor Lazaro has her hand, and I don't know if you want to.

263
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,545
Councilor Lazaro, feel free to ask your question.

264
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:31,564
I just thought I just wanted to highlight how interesting it is that our two override issues are the two things that people I mean the things that passed in the overrides are the two things that people were most commonly mentioning that the schools and the streets.

265
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,126
And, you know, even though they pass they're still like.

266
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,514
And we have more funding for them.

267
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:45,806
There's still something that people think about a lot as something that we are still in need of more attention for.

268
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:49,432
I just wanted to highlight it.

269
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:50,978
No, no.

270
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:53,780
And that's an excellent point.

271
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,803
It is what the majority of Medford we know for sure cares about.

272
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:04,666
Councilor is saying it said 46 responses for both of them, like for each of those.

273
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:11,630
And do you have any, I don't know if you know this off the top of your head, but like, do you have an idea of like how many mentioned either one?

274
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,633
Like, was it like 60 or 80 that mentioned either schools or roads or both?

275
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,636
Oh, I don't have that number right now.

276
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,817
I could probably get it.

277
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:23,778
But, um, yeah.

278
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:26,619
If you if you look through it, it's, it is quite a few.

279
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,900
It's not insignificant.

280
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,441
The overlap is not insignificant.

281
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:31,441
Yeah.

282
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:32,982
Okay.

283
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:33,602
But yeah.

284
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,047
Yeah, no, it's certainly really interesting.

285
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:44,851
I mean, I think speaks to why the overrides were at least seen by a majority of residents in the city is really important.

286
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:57,398
Yeah, and I think if I can add my own commentary to this, in reading through the responses, I got a sense that a lot of residents saw the override as just

287
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:03,685
Like, 1 step in the solution, rather than the complete answer to the solution.

288
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,726
I don't, I didn't really get the impression that people thought.

289
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:12,867
That the overrides would solve everything about school funding or street, you know, street repair funding.

290
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:18,088
Rather that they kind of just saw it as like, okay, this is what we need right now.

291
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:24,049
Before we kind of either develop a more long term plan or come back to the voters in the future.

292
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,150
And there are a lot of, like.

293
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,600
This came up especially with the schools.

294
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:39,642
A lot of responses were kind of about, we know that we have good funding this year for the schools, but we need to make sure that we maintain this going forward.

295
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:47,645
And so that was kind of, that was a decent like chunk of responses focusing on that.

296
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:54,627
I also thought it was really interesting to see what was statistically significant.

297
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:12,618
I, this isn't completely unsurprising but young like younger respondents, particularly in the, in their 30s were more likely to highlight housing library, public safety issues, middle aged, like 4040 to 59 year olds were kind of more.

298
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,241
more emphasizing roads and sidewalks and big capital projects like buildings.

299
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:29,286
And then older adults, 60 to 69, that category, more consistently mentioned street repairs and public infrastructure as well.

300
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:43,373
So the kind of focus on infrastructure seems to be correlated with older age and the focus on housing and library and some education issues.

301
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,357
seem to be a little bit more correlated with youth.

302
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:53,550
And I think that's important to keep in mind because we know that this survey skews towards older older voters as well.

303
00:26:56,308 --> 00:27:03,630
Parents, unsurprisingly, much more, you know, frequently mentioned after school programs, schools, etc.

304
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:18,215
And then another kind of important thing to titrate with is income, because we know that this survey is huge towards much, much towards much, much higher incomes and, you know, our median here in Medford.

305
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:26,789
So higher income respondents were more likely to emphasize non-street infrastructure and library services.

306
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:40,317
And then mid to lower income respondents were much more likely to bring up affordable housing and support for vulnerable communities as the short-term priority in the city.

307
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:52,241
When we go to long term needs, schools and education remains at the top, a little bit fewer responses but still, you know, up there.

308
00:27:52,821 --> 00:28:01,490
Um, we see the kind of framing change from just getting funding to kind of more long term like big picture.

309
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:10,118
Goals for the schools so stronger leadership staffing curriculum equity after school care.

310
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,962
Housing jumps up when you ask about long term priorities as well.

311
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:18,846
It jumps up to 31 responses becomes the 2nd most.

312
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:36,012
frequently mentioned topic, and there was a lot of calls for proactive zoning reform, so more aggressive zoning reform, funding for the affordable housing trust, and tenant protections.

313
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:48,896
Non-street infrastructure, so this is again like buildings, 30 responses, which is also quite significant, and there is the water and sewer system as well.

314
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:56,346
Um, and then, um, there was also, like, people linked this to climate.

315
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:04,390
Uh, so they're, they're asking for, um, like, when it came to the sewer system, there were a few responses that linked it to flooding.

316
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,112
When it came to buildings, a lot of people, um, linked it to emissions as well.

317
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:14,816
Um, economic development becomes a lot more, um, mentioned as well.

318
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:15,617
Um,

319
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:43,119
There were a few different ways of going about it, but I think residents were really focused on business development, supporting small businesses, improving the aesthetics of Medford Square and our smaller squares as well, and then also bringing up the idea of placemaking and community building through economic development and redesigning our squares.

320
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,403
Climate also becomes much more mentioned.

321
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:56,254
So again, a lot of this is about trees and heat islands, but generally kind of climate becomes a lot more mentioned.

322
00:29:56,334 --> 00:30:04,423
And then roads and sidewalks, still very frequently mentioned, drops a lot in kind of dimensions, but the difference

323
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:18,117
With the old responses is that these responses focus more on long term strategy and proactive maintenance, rather than just potholes and then there are more mentions here for that kind of talked about complete streets.

324
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:36,164
And then statistically significant demographic patterns, younger residents were more likely to mention housing, climate, economic development, older residents were more likely to mention infrastructure and infrastructure in general.

325
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:49,974
And we actually didn't see that many statistically significant differences with this question when it came to income like we like in the other, like the short-term priorities question.

326
00:30:50,794 --> 00:31:00,942
And then this is just so you guys can see things that were raised a lot more under this kind of framing, economic development, climate, housing.

327
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:03,685
That was these three in particular.

328
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,349
I think people see these as long-term priorities.

329
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:19,558
And then when it came to the question about what new programs and services Medford should fund, there are quite a lot of responses about youth or teen programs.

330
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,322
So some of it was in the frame of after-school care.

331
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:31,789
Some of it was in the frame of teen centers, job programs, volunteer enrichment opportunities, and mental health.

332
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:34,552
The framing of mental health.

333
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:42,805
We also got a lot of mentions of city services, some of them went into more detail, some of the comments went into more detail than others.

334
00:31:45,703 --> 00:32:02,050
When they went into details, I think things that came up were code enforcement, housing inspection, customer service, communication, and focusing on kind of like permitting reforms, internal reforms that we can make due to

335
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,572
make City Hall more efficient.

336
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:12,638
Public transportation and mobility also is frequently mentioned under this as well.

337
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:19,864
So public transit, cycling infrastructure, multimodal planning, and then shuttles.

338
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:30,072
I know there's a transportation task force out there right now working on the shuttle idea as well because the federal funding is going to change for it.

339
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:57,387
Economic development, people kind of, there's some appetite for us to look into new programs when it comes to incentivizing economic development and SOAR fronts, tackling vacancies, and then also increasing mixed use in our city.

340
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:07,456
Housing support as well, housing navigation, stabilization programs, eviction support, homelessness prevention and outreach.

341
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:14,323
These were things that residents wanted us to do more and to create more programs about.

342
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:19,749
And then new programs related to climate, five people mentioned that.

343
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,168
very similar to what I mentioned before already.

344
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:30,411
Infrastructure roads as well, also very similar to what I mentioned before, the only kind of new things coming in here.

345
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:46,079
Curb ramps came up, private way improvements, which we know is a really tricky issue, but a lot of, you know, given that I think 36% of our roads are private ways, I know it is a really important issue in the city.

346
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,142
And then recreation and like funding for

347
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,490
more culture and recreation programming through the library.

348
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,391
There were six responses about that.

349
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:04,456
And then there were responses that mentioned mental health programs and equity and access programs.

350
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:08,840
This question had a lot fewer responses.

351
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,201
These were optional questions.

352
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:21,470
But younger residents were a lot more statistically likely to propose new programming.

353
00:34:22,905 --> 00:34:38,637
And then there's some miscellaneous ideas that came up that didn't really fit neatly into any of the categories, participatory budgeting, third spaces, and leveraging our relationships with nonprofits.

354
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:40,459
This is a typo.

355
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:41,119
This isn't there.

356
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,382
I also integrated that.

357
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:50,066
When it came to kind of the last page of the

358
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:53,694
The survey participation updates.

359
00:34:53,774 --> 00:35:07,022
These were the options we we offered and honestly, there was a lot of kind of a lot of responses for all of them besides robo calls and attending listening sessions.

360
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:15,307
The most popular responses were this, the council newsletter and social media posts but this also skews.

361
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:22,631
Towards those responses, because those were the channels where we were most aggressive about distributing the survey.

362
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:30,215
Those are the channels that were most open to us, so we should kind of keep keep that in mind when it comes to this.

363
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:36,658
But I think this kind of suggests that we should find a holistic approach.

364
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,440
To reach our residents.

365
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:48,687
And then this was the second question more specifically about participating in the budget process.

366
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:55,792
I think people, again, the newsletters, they're very high.

367
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,333
I think there's an explanation for that.

368
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:01,636
But I think there's some people want to be able to email us.

369
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:06,459
very common as a response.

370
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:16,753
And then there is interest in a special budget-related Zoom meeting, listening sessions, and town halls.

371
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:38,440
And then when it came to the open-ended question about questions and comments about the budget process, I kind of looked at them and then broadly categorized them, although I think it's worth just going through it on our own and reading through what people responded, because there aren't that many responses.

372
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,725
I think there are probably around 30 responses to that question, 30 to 50, somewhere there, maybe 30, 40.

373
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,636
But broadly, I think there's six buckets.

374
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,739
People want to know how the budget process is structured and decided.

375
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:06,243
They want to know where the money is going and how we track it and how we explain that.

376
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:11,626
They want to know how they can, residents want to know how they can participate meaningfully.

377
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,728
They want to know who is being included in the process and who is being left out.

378
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,402
They want to know why aren't, why does it feel like board services aren't more functional than they are?

379
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,383
And I think a lot of this is actually perception.

380
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,483
That's something we can talk about after too.

381
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:42,527
And then people want to know if we are addressing urgent and long-term needs and how we keep track of stuff like that.

382
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,489
And this is the last page, the last part of it.

383
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:52,451
I think these questions go to talking about

384
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:59,548
like, communicating better about things that we already are doing as a city, and especially as a city council.

385
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:07,851
A lot of what residents raised are covered in the zoning reform process.

386
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:14,053
A lot of it is in the Medford Square Revitalization Plan, the RFP, that is being proposed.

387
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:21,656
But I think more work has to be done to let residents know that a lot of their ideas are in there.

388
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:22,797
I think

389
00:38:23,797 --> 00:38:34,780
I think a good kind of encapsulation of that point I just made are the comments about permitting and about City Hall being slow.

390
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,962
I think the perception is there, but as we heard in our budget meetings, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have talked to our business and planning staff about this,

391
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:55,128
and building department staff about this, on the city council side actually, or on the Medford side, the city of Medford side, a lot of that actually happens very quickly.

392
00:38:55,328 --> 00:39:00,249
We can get permitting done within a day or two, but a lot of it is at the state level as well.

393
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:08,212
The state has its whole litany of regulations and permitting processes as well, and that oftentimes can take up to two years.

394
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:25,172
And so there's a, you know, I think we might need to educate the public more about what is city controlled and what is state controlled, but also do more advocacy on behalf of the city to get the permitting done quicker on the state level.

395
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,956
So there's my summary.

396
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,296
Thank you.

397
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:32,417
That was a very thorough summary.

398
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,337
Much appreciated.

399
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:41,420
And I'm also glad that it got written down in a document that can be distributed after the meeting.

400
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,482
Do we have any questions from from Councillors?

401
00:39:51,168 --> 00:39:52,709
Yep, Councilor Lazaro.

402
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,749
I don't have any questions.

403
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:58,071
I just really appreciate you going through and distilling the data this way.

404
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:07,716
I mean, qualitative data like this is really hard to, sometimes hard to put into cohesive, like a cohesive narrative this way.

405
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:09,857
So I appreciate you doing that.

406
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:12,238
Something I think is really interesting was,

407
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,944
that you figured out that people would be interested in a zoom meeting that functions as like a listening session around the budget.

408
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:26,207
I do think that that could be a useful thing maybe for a lot of people.

409
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,472
We could potentially do in person even but yeah I mean I think budgeting is

410
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:55,683
um really abstract to people sometimes and it can be very easy to say to be as as an average resident to be like a naysayer to be like what are they even spending all this money on it's such a huge amount of money and then you know uh it was so useful i thought in one of our meetings when um councilor callahan pulled up like the

411
00:40:56,543 --> 00:41:19,121
pie chart and it's like this much is going to insurance no matter what no matter what this much is going to paying off the bonds and you know the interest on our loans and we can't we have nothing to do with that and we can't change it so like always know that these numbers are immovable and this much is our is what we pay for the schools and it's huge

412
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:21,521
There's that, there's fire, there's police.

413
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:30,243
These are huge amounts of money and we can't, we don't, we wouldn't want to make those lower because then we really are putting our city at risk.

414
00:41:30,303 --> 00:41:36,924
So like these things are, but I think these, like those conversations, I think most people when they heard them, they would be like, oh yeah, absolutely super reasonable.

415
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:44,906
And the more you have those conversations openly and transparently, the better people understand things on like, this is how you have,

416
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:51,959
a transparent government and people being interested in that is really good, I think.

417
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:56,721
So it's nice to have that all laid out for us.

418
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:59,582
So really useful data.

419
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:00,403
Thank you for sharing it.

420
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:02,163
Thank you for putting it forward for us.

421
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:10,926
Do we have any comments from members of the public?

422
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:12,127
If anybody would like to

423
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:17,806
Ask any questions on Zoom, feel free to raise your hand.

424
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,927
I see two members of the public there.

425
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:23,249
This is one of the more informal committees.

426
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:35,597
All right, well, seeing none, just like to, once again, express my appreciation for all the work that you clearly put into this, Councilor Sang.

427
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,338
I'm also generally happy that the

428
00:42:42,202 --> 00:42:45,803
Demographics seem to have got, it seems to have gotten like a slightly.

429
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:50,065
Less biased in terms of its demographics from last year.

430
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:51,986
So, um.

431
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:56,687
I think that's good that progress is being made on that end of things.

432
00:42:57,147 --> 00:43:00,809
Um, cool.

433
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:00,869
So.

434
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:03,730
Do we need a motion to keep the paper and committee?

435
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,251
Or a motion to release the survey report.

436
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:09,792
Something like that.

437
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,661
I guess we can do a motion to.

438
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:22,585
Distribute the survey or should we, I guess it makes sense to distribute it to counselors and then counselors can see what they want to do with the data.

439
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:28,008
And then, so I guess motion to distribute to counselors.

440
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,010
We could keep the paper in committee.

441
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,392
This is the last big thing related to it, but what we could.

442
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:53,835
unless we hold a Zoom meeting as a committee, but I think that's a question for counselors, whether we should do it as maybe two counselors do it, or we do a committee listings like Zoom listings.

443
00:43:55,096 --> 00:44:01,021
We also don't, yeah, yeah.

444
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:07,205
I think it could make make more sense to just let counselors do it individually.

445
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:08,166
Yeah.

446
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:10,908
I mean, as a committee thing.

447
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:18,034
I do think at some point, we do kind of need to, like, say, you know, the survey, the survey at this point is done.

448
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:20,035
Let's distribute more of a final report.

449
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:32,345
And then if we want to follow up on that, like you said, we could just do it on our own initiative doesn't necessarily have to be doesn't necessarily have to be a motion here.

450
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:53,900
Okay, but I think a motion to distribute the full results of the survey to counselors publicly distribute the report that you just presented and receive in place the paper on file would probably be an appropriate motion.

451
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,100
and adjourn.

452
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,281
I'll move that and then I'll add and adjourn.

453
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,962
No, no, we still have to review the actual listening sessions themselves.

454
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:04,564
So I just want a small description from you and Councilor Lozaro.

455
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:06,304
So sorry, I forgot about that.

456
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:07,645
Slipped my mind.

457
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:08,705
Yep.

458
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:11,966
Okay, I'll move what you just said.

459
00:45:12,507 --> 00:45:12,667
Yep.

460
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:13,267
Great.

461
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:20,049
Okay, on the motion from Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

462
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:21,690
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

463
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:25,923
Councilor Kellyanne?

464
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:26,663
Yes.

465
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:28,645
Councilor Lozaro?

466
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:29,165
Yes.

467
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:31,668
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

468
00:45:32,008 --> 00:45:32,649
Councilor Seng?

469
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:33,169
Yes.

470
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,410
Chair Lennon?

471
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:35,411
Yes.

472
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:40,295
For affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

473
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:46,981
And the last, the very last is a update on our listening session.

474
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:48,382
So I understand that councilors

475
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:54,811
Lazaro and Sang had a listening session recently at the senior center.

476
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,574
So just an update on how that went.

477
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:04,137
Any interesting topics came up, how the vibe was, whichever of you would like to go.

478
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:05,478
Quick vibe check.

479
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:07,439
It was great.

480
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,940
We had a really productive session.

481
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,081
We heard from a lot of

482
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:21,787
a lot of Medfair residents who we tend to get I in my experience they're usually it's it's a listening session.

483
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:24,705
it's also kind of constituent services.

484
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:33,789
So people will have like specific concerns about, you know, things in their neighborhood or on their particular property.

485
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:43,212
So, um, I've been following up with some folks and, um, there's still a couple other things I want to circle back on, but, um, yeah, it was very pleasant.

486
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,153
I mean, I always like visiting the senior center.

487
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,534
It's really nice to connect with people.

488
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:46,774
So.

489
00:46:47,258 --> 00:46:54,084
We had a really nice time counselor saying I don't think has been to one before so I mean he can he can weigh in as well.

490
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,077
No, I think he captured it pretty well.

491
00:46:57,097 --> 00:47:11,670
I mean, we talked about infrastructure, of course, came up quite a bit, like potholes and traffic came up, like making sure that we are enforcing our speed limits.

492
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:14,833
Things like that came up.

493
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:17,896
We had some general conversation about

494
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:31,271
the override funds, especially when it came to infrastructure but I think Councillor Lazaro pretty much captured a lot of it a lot of it was constituent service based.

495
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:42,558
I think I'm just very focused on, you know, like certain things that have come up with residents and and helping us helping link them to the people who can get that solve for them.

496
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:48,614
people with people in City Hall who can provide services.

497
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:58,339
Because, you know, I mean, the thing about City Council is that we are happy to connect people with the services that they can access, but we don't provide really any services.

498
00:47:58,399 --> 00:48:03,082
We really just can let people know where they can access services.

499
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:04,323
So that's a lot of what we do.

500
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:11,366
Oh, some residents did bring up that they find it hard to know how to access the like phone numbers and emails.

501
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:20,678
So I think that's something for for us to think about, especially for residents that don't have computers or don't have ready access to computers.

502
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:22,362
That was on my list.

503
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:49,047
Counselor Singh had an idea to have a one pager of like frequently referred to phone numbers in city hall, people that you would want to be able to give contact info at listing sessions, you know, a person to call at DPW, a person to call at like maybe housing access, maybe Medford Housing Authority, you know, that kind of thing.

504
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:54,153
just like a list of people that you would want to make a phone call to with phone numbers.

505
00:48:56,334 --> 00:49:08,018
It's a good idea, especially for, yeah, I think serving people who don't have computer access quite to the same degree that most do is a

506
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:10,023
Definitely good initiative.

507
00:49:10,043 --> 00:49:20,105
Out of curiosity, I noticed when I went to the listening session that some residents were, it was a little bit like a public meeting almost, and some residents were afraid to speak up.

508
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:28,707
So there is a thing, and I think Councilor Callahan went through this as well, where a few residents would approach us after and sort of ask questions in private.

509
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:31,588
Did the same thing sort of happen, or were people more like,

510
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:42,735
uh, willing to, yeah, I see the sunlight, uh, were people more sort of like willing to just like say what was on their mind openly.

511
00:49:42,755 --> 00:49:46,697
They seem fairly comfortable at this one.

512
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:55,940
Um, we have a couple of people who always, I mean, there's, there's a couple of people that always get us started, but everybody seems pretty comfortable jumping in.

513
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,143
Um, at this, at this particular one, there's always a different energy, but everybody seems pretty comfortable.

514
00:50:02,823 --> 00:50:03,023
Okay.

515
00:50:04,557 --> 00:50:05,177
All right, cool.

516
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:10,279
Well, thank you all for the update.

517
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:13,801
Is there any other questions from councillors or members of the public?

518
00:50:17,202 --> 00:50:20,103
Do we have a motion to keep the paper in committee?

519
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:21,164
Or Councillor Callahan.

520
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,045
I was going to make a motion.

521
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:27,026
Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

522
00:50:27,406 --> 00:50:27,746
That's it.

523
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:28,447
Second.

524
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:32,853
On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

525
00:50:32,893 --> 00:50:34,513
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

526
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,861
Councilor Callahan.

527

Yes.

528
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:54,562
Thank you.

529
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:55,422

530
00:50:55,943 --> 00:50:56,143
Yes.

531
00:50:57,197 --> 00:50:58,862

532
00:50:59,163 --> 00:50:59,363
Yes.

534
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:00,988
Yes.

535
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:05,360

Thanks everybody.

537
