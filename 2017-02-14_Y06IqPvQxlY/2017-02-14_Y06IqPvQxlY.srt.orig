[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

10
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:08,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Longo-Kurin?

11
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:09,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

12
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:10,759

13
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:11,500

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:13,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

[SPEAKER_09]: President Caviello?

17
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:14,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

18
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:44,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wish everybody a happy holiday, and we'll do our best to get everybody home to be with their wives and husbands.

19
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:53,699
[SPEAKER_06]: 17072, offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, be it resolved that in light of the recent accidents, speeding and heavy trucking on Winthrop Street, that the City of Medford

20
00:28:54,304 --> 00:28:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Increase enforcement in that area.

21
00:28:55,924 --> 00:29:10,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that a list be created with regard to the locations of our new speed monitor signs need to be placed in that Winthrop Street should be the first on the list once the monitors are received.

22
00:29:10,428 --> 00:29:11,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor De Kern.

23
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:14,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Carviello.

24
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:23,412
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice we have the department here to maybe help us out on this one, but I've been getting complaints with regards to and concerns with regards to the speeding on Winthrop Street.

25
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:29,680
[SPEAKER_15]: We always, you know, get a call or once a week or once a month with a different area.

26
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,423
[SPEAKER_15]: We have, you know, like every other town, city, we have people that speed, heavy trucking that shouldn't be going down certain streets.

27
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:40,084
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last concerns that I've got were on Winthrop Street.

28
00:29:40,124 --> 00:29:47,247
[SPEAKER_15]: There was an accident, I think a week ago, two weeks ago, where a car went into a home.

29
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:50,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there's an issue with regards to people trying to pass on that road.

30
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:57,297
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did approve money last week for two speed limit monitoring signs.

31
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,418
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that was about 25,000.

32
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Two of them hopefully will be coming in.

33
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,399
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe they said in June.

34
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:12,320
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would ask that, I would ask if maybe we can get, get our chief of police to maybe come up and just comment on this, let the citizens speak and voice their concerns.

35
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,461
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the ones with children that live in the neighborhood.

36
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:18,922
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, when a car goes into a home, it is a traumatic event for the whole, for the whole neighborhood.

37
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:19,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

38
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:27,760
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could get those monitors out as soon as we get them and put one on Winthrop Street, hopefully to deter some speeding.

39
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:33,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we have our sergeant here of traffic and pick up the enforcement in the area as well.

40
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:37,765
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be greatly appreciated by the residents, especially in light of the recent accidents.

41
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:38,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

42
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

43
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:45,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr., Police Chief, City of Medford, 227 Elm Street, Medford.

44
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:49,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Winthrop Street's probably one of our more heavily enforced streets.

45
00:30:49,895 --> 00:31:03,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of complaints from the Winchester residents who get stopped coming over the line into Medford, complaining about it, to the point that we've had to move the officers around a little bit more, and we'll put them right back on Wizard Street.

46
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, a lot of it is self-directed.

47
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:10,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to where the crashes are, and then they perform the enforcement that's necessary.

48
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:12,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be done.

49
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:18,552
[SPEAKER_03]: The speed monitors, as soon as they come in, we will put them out, and we will provide a list.

50
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:25,867
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the first radar monitor people called and asked to be placed on the list for their street.

51
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:30,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just check them off and move them a week or two and just move it around.

52
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:34,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we have two, we'll be able to tell there's twice as much area.

53
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:36,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

54
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:44,856
[SPEAKER_15]: While I have you through the chair, the speed monitor signs that are stationary on Elm Street, for example, are those city of Medford property?

55
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you said those DCR.

56
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a DCR road.

57
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Medford bought those signs because of Rights Pawn.

58
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And on any state road, we have concomitant jurisdiction.

59
00:31:58,203 --> 00:31:59,864
[SPEAKER_03]: We can perform enforcement as well.

60
00:32:00,924 --> 00:32:03,004
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could just amend my resolve.

61
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:15,066
[SPEAKER_15]: And for those stationary signs, if we could get the speed limit posted either above the move of traffic or below so that people know speed limit's 30 and I'm going 50, got to slow down.

62
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:16,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be very helpful.

63
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:17,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Because when you're coming down Elm,

64
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:22,073
[SPEAKER_15]: 30 isn't posted for another several, several blocks.

65
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,634
[SPEAKER_15]: So just right on the pole, if we could get a small sign.

66
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice if we could get the state to, to lower that to 25, like the rest of the city streets.

67
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:29,937
25.

68
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:31,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that would be even better.

69
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:39,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have a few citizens that want to, uh, councilor, um, I, chief Sacco actually just took the words right out of my mouth.

70
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:45,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to ask if the city had jurisdiction over, uh, Elm street relative to the recent ordinance that, uh, I mean the recent change that the,

71
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Traffic Commission put in place with thickly settled areas and their speed limits.

72
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering if that would apply there, but it's a state controlled roadway, so I don't think it will.

73
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: State controlled roadway, we can't do it.

74
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do have a jurisdiction for enforcement.

75
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:02,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's 25 or 30, we can still cite for the roadway.

76
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:02,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

77
00:33:02,944 --> 00:33:03,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chief.

78
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:03,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

79
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:04,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

80
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

81
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:12,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

82
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Daniel O'Reilly, 707 Winthrop Street in Medford.

83
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:20,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I ended up voicing my concern to the council last week or the week before.

84
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:22,755
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot, I've been busy.

85
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:29,758
[SPEAKER_12]: But Brianna and George both responded to me and it made me feel better.

86
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:38,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Chief Sacco and the rest of the police department are doing what they can with the amounts of police officers that they have.

87
00:33:39,823 --> 00:33:40,744
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a big issue.

88
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:50,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than this accident, we know the mailboxes at the corner of Winford Way and Winthrop Street have been hit several times.

89
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:57,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there are bollards on the sidewalk, so you've got to walk around the bollards to get onto the sidewalk.

90
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:07,660
[SPEAKER_12]: But particularly last week, as I was pulling into my driveway, taking a right, a vehicle was behind me, tailgating me, and tried to surpass me on the right.

91
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:11,183
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a weekly occurrence.

92
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,245
[SPEAKER_12]: or a monthly occurrence, it's a daily occurrence.

93
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:25,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And the speeding is a lot, and to the point where I don't want to take my little girls outside and go for a walk.

94
00:34:25,588 --> 00:34:30,449
[SPEAKER_12]: So any other in Medford, yes, it is heavily used.

95
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:34,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see a little care towards it.

96
00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:38,311
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I can, if there's anything I can do.

97
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:40,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

98
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

99
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:47,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the chief has had on many different occasions to slow that down.

100
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:51,749
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councillor Long-Term.

101
00:34:57,611 --> 00:35:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Come forward, please.

102
00:35:00,913 --> 00:35:03,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

103
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Sharon Wentworth, 694 Winthrop street.

104
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:09,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Like he said, you can't turn into your driveway.

105
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:12,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I've lived here many years, and it's just increasing.

106
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:14,413
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't sleep at night.

107
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:18,256
[SPEAKER_14]: The trucks are so heavy coming by.

108
00:35:19,157 --> 00:35:24,661
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another house where the bushes were all torn down from a car hitting it.

109
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:33,769
[SPEAKER_14]: The buses, I brought this up before, between Playset and Winthrop, you can't see.

110
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody's going to get hit there.

111
00:35:36,912 --> 00:35:37,753
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bus here.

112
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:41,193
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a bus here and there's a bus here.

113
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:42,774
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't pull out.

114
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:47,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I brought this up last year.

115
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:49,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

116
00:35:49,978 --> 00:35:50,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

117
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

118
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield at Medford mass.

119
00:35:57,362 --> 00:36:01,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why we have paid a park when we need to put enforcement on the road.

120
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:04,246
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen a number of accidents on Salem.

121
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:09,370
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's all over Medford, it's not just Winsor Street, it's not just Playstead Road.

122
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:13,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Salem Street, they come at you in the crosswalk, they don't care.

123
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:16,075
[SPEAKER_19]: I have photos, I sent them to Chief Sacco.

124
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:21,618
[SPEAKER_19]: I have photos of people just dodging and going on the right of cars to try to pass them on the right.

125
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:24,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Completely out of control, we need to have some enforcement.

126
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:26,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

127
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,303

148
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:20,014
[SPEAKER_06]: 073 petition for sign denial reversal by Daniel O'Rourke insurance 429 High Street Medford OCD application 2017-1A exceeds allowable number of signs.

149
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:21,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Banner signs are not allowed.

150
00:37:23,056 --> 00:37:26,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Mark, Vice President Marks, Chairman of the Sign Committee.

151
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:29,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, is the petitioner present?

152
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:36,383
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could come to the podium, please.

153
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:41,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

154
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:44,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrew La Fuente, 429 High Street.

155
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,535
[SPEAKER_17]: My address is 137 Sycamore in Somerville.

156
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:50,258
[SPEAKER_17]: As I was saying, I got diagnosed with a muscle disease, so I have to hold my neck.

157
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:50,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

158
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:57,755
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could just give us a brief synopsis on what the request is, of course.

159
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:04,117
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, I, I'm asking for four banners and brackets projecting off of the building in addition to an awning on the side.

160
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I think it's important to understand the signage that he has now.

161
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:11,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it's just a hard sign projecting off the building, but it's old.

162
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,039
[SPEAKER_17]: He actually asked me to take it off.

163
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:18,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, the problem is that folks are having trouble because he's on the second floor, the second level.

164
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Even finding his business.

165
00:38:20,844 --> 00:38:42,089
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason I'm proposing a projecting sign is because it's so high up and cars move relatively quickly there There's not a light to stop Even if he did a flat sign folks would drive by it without even recognizing the sign And his business has actually dipped a little bit obviously with my businesses He's seen a little bit of a decline as well, which is why I'm proposing it this way

166
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:46,233
[SPEAKER_17]: So how far do they project off the building itself?

167
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:48,995
[SPEAKER_17]: So the brackets themselves, it's 36 inches.

168
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,416
[SPEAKER_17]: The banners will be 30 inches.

169
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:55,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So three inches in on, on either side to allow for the, uh, the threaded bolts to tighten the banners.

170
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

171
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And you plan on moving, removing the awnings?

172
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that, is that going to?

173
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,385
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a blue awning on the right side that goes up.

174
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:10,369
[SPEAKER_17]: That's coming down and a new one is going up that just says entrance with his logo and 429 High Street, just to identify it for people to know to go in that way.

175
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:14,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the front of the building has two awnings that belong to the preschool.

176
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:22,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, based on the information we received tonight and this particular location, I find no problem with the approval.

177
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:24,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

178
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,118
[SPEAKER_06]: On the second of Councilor Marks' approval,

179
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:31,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Second on council.

180
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:40,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Marks approval.

181
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:41,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, president.

182
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:42,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, curvy yellow.

183
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:44,226
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the width of the building?

184
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:46,608
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like you're looking for four, correct?

185
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:47,829
[SPEAKER_15]: For the sign.

186
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:48,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And so five total.

187
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:49,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

188
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,472
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's the width of the building?

189
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,173
[SPEAKER_15]: You think you need all four?

190
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:54,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yes.

191
00:39:54,714 --> 00:39:57,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So, uh, initially when I spoke to the owner,

192
00:39:57,986 --> 00:40:01,027
[SPEAKER_17]: He actually asked for six, and I thought six was too much.

193
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:10,990
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason I'm proposing four is because of the way the windows are set up, you can keep it so it comes in 12 feet on either side with nothing, and then it's one, two, three, four.

194
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:17,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Less, it would look foolish, because I believe the width of the building is like 58 or 59 feet wide, so it's pretty big.

195
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:24,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And the spacing between each of the banners, I believe, is around 12 or 13 feet, so it gives proper visibility.

196
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:26,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

197
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,097
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Marks.

198
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

199
00:40:30,718 --> 00:40:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

200
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:40,305
[SPEAKER_13]: The design that's been presented to us, Mr. President, has a proportionality that seems seemly for that building.

201
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:49,412
[SPEAKER_13]: In the lack of anybody here in opposition to this from the most active and organized business district in the city, I second approval.

202
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Councilor DelaRusso.

203
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:52,314
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

204
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:52,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

205
00:40:53,355 --> 00:40:53,915
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

206
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:55,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean all those opposed?

207
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:55,256
[SPEAKER_06]: None.

208
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:56,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

209
00:40:56,818 --> 00:40:57,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

210
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:00,540
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-0-7-4.

211
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:10,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Method Mass, to address the council about two specialized police officers.

212
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:15,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

213
00:41:15,426 --> 00:41:16,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

214
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:19,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

215
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:24,609
[SPEAKER_01]: In light of the fact that we have the fire department here,

216
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:31,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And the police department, I'd just like to say that these are people that don't toot their own horns.

217
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:37,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of them are needed and necessary by the city.

218
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:44,644
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fire department does a whole lot of things that we don't really give notice to until we need them.

219
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:47,847
[SPEAKER_01]: In nursing homes and when a patient

220
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,210
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the bed.

221
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,911
[SPEAKER_01]: We called the fire department because the aides couldn't pick them up and put them in the bed.

222
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:56,612
[SPEAKER_01]: They rolled them on a stretcher and lifted them up, four people, into the bed.

223
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:01,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody had a flood in their basement.

224
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:03,214
[SPEAKER_01]: A little old lady friend of mine called me.

225
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:07,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over there and I called the fire department and instantly they knew how to cut off the water.

226
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,096
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a whole lot of things that we need to appreciate.

227
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:12,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say that.

228
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:20,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I first need to acknowledge the great victory of the council on behalf of the people.

229
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:28,550
[SPEAKER_01]: We were instrumental in locking up the built out of the new police station, this council.

230
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:35,014
[SPEAKER_01]: This was no small accomplishment and the city will be much better off for it and with it.

231
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to thank the mayor for acknowledging the importance of this new station.

232
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:43,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure that this was not an easy political sell.

233
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:45,725
[SPEAKER_01]: and shows strength on her part.

234
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:53,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to thank the newcomers in the more liberal establishment in this city who met the majority of the city halfway.

235
00:42:54,907 --> 00:43:00,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some of their expectations for city resources have been delayed.

236
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:03,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for your sacrifice.

237
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:11,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The police officers have just gotten a moral boost, morale boost, that will help them do their jobs better for you.

238
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the police officers,

239
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:19,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I now hold you more accountable to do the right thing, and when you are wrong, I expect better from you now.

240
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:33,146
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last five years, I have fought on behalf of you from this podium and beyond, and I expect you to thank me by doing right by the people of this city.

241
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I thank the whole city for backing our police officers.

242
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:40,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for a more sensitive but necessary request of the city.

243
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:42,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Since September 11th, 2001,

244
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:47,834
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been in a continuous war with a perverse version of Islam.

245
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:54,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more importantly, we have been hit here at home by jihadist-inspired lone wolves.

246
00:43:55,439 --> 00:44:05,925
[SPEAKER_01]: While we need to continue our fight, we must also be acutely aware of the innocent Muslims that have been and are caught up in the crossfire.

247
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:16,440
[SPEAKER_01]: As recently as January 29th, 2017, a mosque in Quebec, Canada was attacked by a hate-filled white man who equated Muslim with terrorist.

248
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:24,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Alex Bissonette murdered six innocent victims and injured another eight others while they were worshiping God.

249
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:27,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec is only five hours away from here.

250
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:30,709
[SPEAKER_01]: An equivalency would be Boston to New York.

251
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec borders Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.

252
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:37,855
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think this could not happen here, you are mistaken.

253
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:44,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We as a city have an obligation to defend our Muslim population against directed violence.

254
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:55,711
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we need to solve as a city is the misinterpretation or the misperception that all Muslims are guilty by association, which by definition is both

255
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:12,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two objectives, to protect this religious minority from physical harm and to engage young Muslims in a way that prevents them from growing alienated, leaving them susceptible to radicalization.

256
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: While it is easier for most of us to place Muslims in a box, it is not only unfair to them, it is unsafe for us.

257
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:29,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Many Muslim men and women have risked their lives in our war on terror and are living in the states because of that sacrifice.

258
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Quebec never saw it coming.

259
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:37,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want Medford to miss the signs of religious hostility which can translate into violence.

260
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:42,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we do not hear about the resentment doesn't mean it isn't there.

261
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:54,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I am therefore recommending the following, that we hire three new female police officers who will specialize in all racial harassment with an emphasis on Muslim sensitivity.

262
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:58,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer four for this task force, but I will take what I can get.

263
00:45:58,478 --> 00:45:58,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Why women?

264
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:03,650
[SPEAKER_01]: This role will require trust in order to be effective, and men are less likely to gain it.

265
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Intuition is women's other long suit and irreplaceable skill.

266
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:17,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Women are also less likely to be called a racist, which male officers often fear being called this career-ending name.

267
00:46:18,377 --> 00:46:24,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Women can also reach women and children in the community in ways that male officers are unable to.

268
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:28,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe at least one female officer who is also a mother

269
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:30,322
[SPEAKER_01]: would be another asset to this role.

270
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:42,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I am recommending at least two black women to work side by side with one white woman, because frankly, white women wouldn't be seen by a Muslim woman as having anywhere near the same experience as them.

271
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:49,472
[SPEAKER_01]: The department must also have access to a female contact who is considered an expert in their culture.

272
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,655
[SPEAKER_01]: This expert would be hired as an independent contractor when needed.

273
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:57,617
[SPEAKER_01]: These three women officers will be first and foremost sworn officers

274
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:03,927
[SPEAKER_01]: and will be counted in the total number of rank and file police personnel, but with a side specialty.

275
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:08,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend them as new hires because as you know, we are understaffed.

276
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to take any more testosterone off the streets.

277
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:17,513
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were fully staffed, I might have suggested just switching them out.

278
00:47:25,982 --> 00:47:29,824
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who would like to see women veterans hired, I applaud that.

279
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:35,828
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the city finds it in their budget to complete a proper search, I agree that this is the best route to go.

280
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:42,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding only two women on the Eastern Seaboard search is very achievable.

281
00:47:44,213 --> 00:47:49,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you argue that this does not conform to the civil service exam process, I don't want to hear it.

282
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:55,400
[SPEAKER_01]: This country is at war and local police departments are now faced with frontline combat responsibilities.

283
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,242
[SPEAKER_01]: that the military discriminates all the time.

284
00:47:58,783 --> 00:48:04,047
[SPEAKER_01]: An applicant can be too short for the Marines, too tall for the Navy, too fat for the Army, and too dumb for the Air Force.

285
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:09,212
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time for civilian police departments to catch up with that reality.

286
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:12,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Ignore me and innocent people get hurt.

287
00:48:13,876 --> 00:48:21,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Without this new tool for a new era, our police department can't protect this religious minority, who, given the current climate,

288
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:25,843
[SPEAKER_01]: is reasonably at risk of receiving threats of harm, if not harm itself.

289
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:31,427
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our duty as a city to provide this protection with this new technique.

290
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:45,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I'd just like to say that the Marines have also reinstituted their female engagement teams, which was very successful in Iraq and Afghanistan.

291
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:48,756
[SPEAKER_01]: They reinstituted that program in 2015 because it was so successful.

292
00:48:51,835 --> 00:48:52,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

293
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:52,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

294
00:48:53,316 --> 00:48:55,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Falco, to receive and place on file.

295
00:48:56,939 --> 00:48:57,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Councilor Knight.

296
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:58,400
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

297
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

298
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

299
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:06,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Communications from the Mayor.

300
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-075 to Council President Carabiello, members of the Method City Council, from Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

301
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:18,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I read, loan order, architectural services, new police station.

302
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:21,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Mr. President,

303
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:29,187
[SPEAKER_06]: and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

304
00:49:30,628 --> 00:49:32,969
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Medford, Massachusetts, loan order.

305
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:36,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Architectural services, new police station.

306
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:50,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it ordered by the city that the sum of $2 million be hereby is appropriate for the cost of architectural services for a new police station and for the payment of costs

307
00:49:51,404 --> 00:50:18,109
[SPEAKER_06]: incidental or related thereto, in that to meet said appropriation, the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow such amounts under and pursuant to chapter 44, section 7-7 of the general laws as amended or pursuant to any authority and to issue bonds or notes of the city therefore.

308
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:47,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Any premium received by the city upon the sale of any bonds or notes approved by this vote, lest any such premium apply to the payment of the cost of such issuance of bonds or notes, may be applied to the payment of costs approved by this vote in accordance with Chapter 44, Section 20 of the General Laws, thereby reducing the amount authorized to be borrowed to pay such costs by a like amount and further ordered.

309
00:50:48,876 --> 00:51:11,473
[SPEAKER_06]: that the City Treasurer is authorized to file an application with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Municipal Filing Board to qualify under Chapter 44A of the General Laws in any and all bonds and notes of the City authorized by this vote or pursuant to any other vote of the City in any connection therein to provide such information and execute such documents.

310
00:51:12,107 --> 00:51:17,631
[SPEAKER_06]: as the municipal finance oversight board of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require.

311
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Stephanie M. Burke, mayor.

312
00:51:29,778 --> 00:51:31,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a presentation by the city?

313
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:35,902
[SPEAKER_07]: President members of the council.

314
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:37,083
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Mark Brumley.

315
00:51:37,123 --> 00:51:41,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

316
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:47,485
[SPEAKER_07]: What's before you tonight, similar to other papers in terms of form, is a loan order.

317
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:50,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a loan order for $2 million.

318
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:56,910
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose would be to provide architectural services for a new police station.

319
00:51:57,491 --> 00:52:01,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, it also says for any costs which are incidental or related thereto.

320
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The authorization is based on, under municipal finance,

321
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:22,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 7, Subparagraph 7, which allows a municipality to bond for architectural services, for plans for a project, for a period of up to five years.

322
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if the project ultimately was going forward to be constructed, then that would roll into another period of time, which deals with the construction of a project, which would be 30 years.

323
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:41,706
[SPEAKER_07]: What's before you this evening is a request for the first reading, like so many different papers that come before this council.

324
00:52:42,146 --> 00:52:44,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires three readings.

325
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:46,990
[SPEAKER_07]: The first would be your approval this evening.

326
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,313
[SPEAKER_07]: That would require at minimum four votes of the council.

327
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:56,456
[SPEAKER_07]: The next reading would be advertisements in a newspaper by the city clerk.

328
00:52:56,476 --> 00:53:01,160
[SPEAKER_07]: And that usually happens about two, sometimes three weeks later, depending upon circumstances.

329
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:10,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it comes back before the council no earlier than 10 days after the last publication vote of the council.

330
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:15,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would require five votes in order for it to pass.

331
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's occurring tonight is the first part of a step towards the architectural services to design a new police department.

332
00:53:25,037 --> 00:53:31,481
[SPEAKER_07]: As was stated last week by the mayor, both at a press conference and also during the state of the city address,

333
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:54,486
[SPEAKER_07]: She has determined that the appropriate site for the construction of a new police station would be on the plot of land where the police station is right now, over in the area to the northern part of that lot, which would allow ultimately for the police station to be taken down.

334
00:53:55,347 --> 00:53:56,587
[SPEAKER_07]: But this would be the first step.

335
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:00,070
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the best way to describe this paper tonight is

336
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:12,304
[SPEAKER_07]: The only determination that has been made is this is, not that it's the best imagery to give by way of analysis, but this is a launching pad.

337
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:13,665
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a landing spot.

338
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:21,511
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the beginning of many different steps which would be necessary in order to actually see the construction of a police department.

339
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:27,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the paper that's before you tonight, members of the council.

340
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:32,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have colleagues with me this evening, including the chief of police, to answer any questions.

341
00:54:35,177 --> 00:54:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Solis.

342
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:36,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

343
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Alongo-Kern.

344
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:41,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Carviello.

345
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:45,124
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could maybe educate the public on our meeting.

346
00:54:45,164 --> 00:54:47,286
[SPEAKER_15]: We did meet on this from six to seven.

347
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:54,170
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could go over maybe what's... We did have a meeting of the council of the whole earlier for about an hour and 15 minutes.

348
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,292
[SPEAKER_06]: That was because that's why you had a delay.

349
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:58,470
[SPEAKER_06]: and the council meeting starting late.

350
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:06,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we've heard from both the police and the firemen in regards to their concerns, uh, in regards to this project.

351
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:07,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I think they're all duly noted.

352
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:15,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I say it was, and we, and the committee, uh, we'll report it out this evening.

353
00:55:15,784 --> 00:55:16,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct?

354
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:22,709
[SPEAKER_06]: We will adopt the committee report, uh, sometime this evening.

355
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:25,091
[SPEAKER_06]: But I said, uh, I think everyone had a chance.

356
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:32,900
[SPEAKER_06]: to air their concerns, and again, this is a point, if anyone else has concerns, this is an opportunity to air them again.

357
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:46,824
[SPEAKER_15]: About it last week, with regards to trying to get all boards and commissions and meetings publicized, because it would be nice if we could address the ten concerns and questions we had.

358
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:53,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That can just be a starting point, because I know... We'd have to report it out.

359
00:55:53,126 --> 00:55:55,067
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not reported it out of the committee.

360
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:56,338
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll yield.

361
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:58,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

362
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill O'Brien, president, local 10 32 officer three 40 Salem street.

363
00:56:02,762 --> 00:56:04,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we had a lot of discussion earlier.

364
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:20,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just want to inform the public at large, um, that, uh, we were here to support the, the, the, the building of a police station, but we're here to also address more importantly, our concerns about what's going to happen to our training facility, uh, storage area, so on and so forth.

365
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:23,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we're not going to have much of a discussion, but,

366
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:24,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to reiterate that.

367
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:31,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, councils, for looking into this, and hopefully we can go forward and come up with a better master plan that's currently being discussed.

368
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:32,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

369
00:56:33,593 --> 00:56:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

370
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:38,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Langel-Kernan.

371
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:45,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to report the committee notes out so that we can further discuss any questions that we had.

372
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:47,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Langel-Kernan.

373
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

374
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:58,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Councilor Lungo-Kern took the words right out of my mouth in terms of attempting to report the committee report out.

375
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,771
[SPEAKER_11]: However, procedurally, it's going to be very difficult because we have this paper before us.

376
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:15,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, the committee report included a number of items, one of which would be to include retrofitting the existing structure to expand for the allowance of fire service expansion.

377
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,035
[SPEAKER_11]: The next item would be a cost

378
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:22,240
[SPEAKER_11]: breakdown as to the whole entire cost of the total project.

379
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, a breakdown of our bonded indebtedness at this point in time going out, I believe 15 years counselor, is that correct?

380
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:39,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the life of the box or 30 years, I believe, um, discuss and look at the feasibility of a combined police and fire department in the creation of a construction of a new one.

381
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:47,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, a listing of all the locations that were examined to establish, uh, the, the selected location for where this structure is going to be built.

382
00:57:48,778 --> 00:58:02,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, when the fire department and the fire chief knew and, um, that the administration established a working group requiring, uh, that members of the fire service and members of the administration work to address some of the concerns with the training academy.

383
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:07,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and also that, um, the training academy is an important and vital.

384
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:12,366
[SPEAKER_11]: asset that we have here in the community and that that's something that we'd like to see continue as we move on.

385
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:17,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I believe that is reflective of, um, issues that were brought up in the committee report.

386
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, just, uh, for an informational purpose.

387
00:58:20,828 --> 00:58:21,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

388
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:21,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor.

389
00:58:21,649 --> 00:58:37,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I'm leaving anything out, one of the information counselor Della Russo, uh, counselor Knight had made a two point, uh, uh, intervention into our, uh, committee of the whole meetings, uh,

390
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:38,900
[SPEAKER_13]: proceedings.

391
00:58:38,960 --> 00:59:01,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe one was to establish a working group, and the second was to recommend an examination, if I'm remembering this correctly, an examination into maintaining a portion of the existing building in the architectural drawings to maintain the training tower.

392
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:04,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I understand, through the Chair, the Councillor correctly?

393
00:59:04,592 --> 00:59:05,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Councillor Knight.

394
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:05,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you did.

395
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:18,996
[SPEAKER_11]: former Mr. President, and also discussion of grant funding for the construction of a new training academy underneath the Urban Area Securities Initiative grant program that the federal government has put out.

396
00:59:19,016 --> 00:59:33,204
[SPEAKER_13]: The President Yes, hopefully the previous administration didn't, in their dispersal of tens of millions of dollars in the final days of their administration, hopefully some of that money wasn't sent to the Middle East.

397
00:59:34,544 --> 00:59:34,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

398
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

399
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:36,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

400
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:45,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to take an opportunity to go over the salient point, the points that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, because procedurally we weren't able to adopt that report at this point in time.

401
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:47,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

402
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

403
00:59:50,512 --> 00:59:51,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other discussion?

404
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:54,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

405
00:59:56,595 --> 00:59:57,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

406
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:02,538
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can appreciate the fact that some members of this council

407
01:00:03,217 --> 01:00:10,202
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, would be interested in retrofitting, uh, the fire station, uh, if we do move forward with the police side.

408
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:20,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to call to the council's attention the, uh, report that was commissioned by this city back in January, 2013.

409
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It's entitled, uh, method, police and fire station feasibility study.

410
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:29,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It was prepared by Dunman Sweeney, uh, architects,

411
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:37,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And I won't go through the hundreds of pages of this report, but I will go to the conclusion and recommendation.

412
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:46,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was commissioned, I believe the study was $100,000 to see what we should do with our police and fire station.

413
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And the conclusion and recommendation, Mr. President, states, based on our analysis, evaluation of the existing facilities,

414
01:00:57,075 --> 01:01:10,523
[SPEAKER_08]: amount space needed by the departments, and weighing the cost and code implications of renovation, it is our recommendation that all buildings should be replaced with new construction.

415
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Our recommendation is based on the information above, but the following factors are most prominent.

416
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:21,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it goes on to state, Mr. President, and this is to address the retrofit.

417
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:26,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It says building a separate police department where the academy building now stands

418
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:35,412
[SPEAKER_08]: may appear on face to be the best alternative to building entirely new facilities, given the cost savings between the two.

419
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:43,256
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the savings would not be sufficient to renovate the fire station to meet code in the future.

420
01:01:44,036 --> 01:01:53,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Thus, the total cost to the city for the combined work at both stations over time would be far greater than any of the options presented in this study.

421
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:56,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, this option would result

422
01:01:57,109 --> 01:02:00,251
[SPEAKER_08]: utilize space for the fire department in the interim.

423
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:20,640
[SPEAKER_08]: So the report that we commissioned, and maybe the mayor doesn't like to look at reports that the city spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on, but states quite clearly, Mr. President, that a retrofit of the fire department, which I'm hearing now, is not cost effective and in the long term would be cheaper to build

424
01:02:21,157 --> 01:02:22,358
[SPEAKER_08]: brand new facility.

425
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:23,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the report.

426
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:25,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone can go look.

427
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:25,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's online.

428
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,463
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be a copy, I assume, within the city website.

429
01:02:30,444 --> 01:02:34,546
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's Donovan Sweeney that we contracted with in January 2013.

430
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:47,956
[SPEAKER_08]: So as was recommended by this council in the committee of the whole meeting, is that we also view, Mr. President, the fact that we want a combined center.

431
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:52,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's extremely important to discuss it now.

432
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,778
[SPEAKER_08]: For whatever reason, it's cost prohibitive.

433
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,960
[SPEAKER_08]: For whatever reason, it doesn't pan out.

434
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,041
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we have the discussion.

435
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:01,602
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we offered it.

436
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:08,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember in the past when we went through with different bonding issues, we'd get four or five different recommendations.

437
01:03:09,228 --> 01:03:10,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And the council would sit down.

438
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:12,050
[SPEAKER_08]: In particular, I'm talking about

439
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:25,197
[SPEAKER_08]: the schools we went through, the science spending for the schools, the pool, some of the larger cost items in the community, we had three or four items that we'd have to pick from.

440
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:29,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Say this is option one, this is option two, this is option three.

441
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight we're being presented with option mayor.

442
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:35,744
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the mayor's option.

443
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:40,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're hearing tonight that, you know what, let's get the ball rolling.

444
01:03:40,993 --> 01:03:41,974
[SPEAKER_08]: This is $2 million.

445
01:03:42,295 --> 01:03:54,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, uh, if we waited a few more weeks to sit down Russian about a combined center that addresses both police and fire, that building was built in 1962.

446
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:07,246
[SPEAKER_08]: The conditions on both sides are no different, although I agree the fire probably because of their own upkeep has kept the building up a little different than the police department.

447
01:04:07,766 --> 01:04:16,071
[SPEAKER_08]: But both buildings are used seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President, and we got a lot of use out of them for the past 50-something years.

448
01:04:17,432 --> 01:04:20,534
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of use with very little spending in these buildings.

449
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:22,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's the time to rebuild.

450
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:38,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the support, and I'm not gonna speak for members of this council, you have support of this council, Mr. President, to move forward, I believe, with the combined facility that benefits both police and fire, as well as the community.

451
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:47,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping tonight, Mr. President, that we're able to at least put this off for a few weeks so we can have.

452
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:59,155
[SPEAKER_08]: with the administration about some of the things we brought up tonight, whether it's the training academy, whether it's what's going to take place with the old station, if we build a new station at the training academy.

453
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:03,938
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the things I think we need answered, Mr. President, before we hastily move forward.

454
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:06,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know people aren't going to like hastily, but guess what?

455
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,738
[SPEAKER_08]: We got this last Wednesday.

456
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:12,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been six days and we got nothing last Wednesday.

457
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:15,443
[SPEAKER_08]: We were presented with a fact sheet tonight that you read off.

458
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:19,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have not received anything until today, really, on this.

459
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:28,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see anything hastily about waiting a few weeks, going over, seeing what our options are about including this discussion.

460
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:31,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes fiscal sense, Mr. President.

461
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,617
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense from a

462
01:05:35,152 --> 01:05:36,412
[SPEAKER_08]: public safety in this community.

463
01:05:37,053 --> 01:05:39,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, that would be my recommendation tonight.

464
01:05:39,794 --> 01:05:44,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, I hope we can all get together and not divide us, but say, you know what?

465
01:05:44,855 --> 01:05:46,436
[SPEAKER_08]: We want a meeting with the administration.

466
01:05:47,036 --> 01:05:48,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very disappointed.

467
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,257
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor's not here tonight.

468
01:05:49,877 --> 01:05:59,501
[SPEAKER_08]: We invited her, as you know, you invited her to the community, the whole meeting and a very, and a, a, a, a potential bonding of over $22 million.

469
01:06:00,988 --> 01:06:05,449
[SPEAKER_08]: that the mayor didn't see fit to come to our meeting to discuss her proposal.

470
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:11,851
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not the city solicitors, chief of staff proposal, and it's not a treasurer's proposal.

471
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:13,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the mayor's proposal.

472
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:17,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation.

473
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:28,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'd like to hear what, uh, you know, people in the audience have to say and then so, but my recommendation would be a full and thorough explanation why we can't move forward on a combined center, Mr. President.

474
01:06:31,076 --> 01:06:32,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

475
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:38,740
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

476
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

477
01:06:40,141 --> 01:06:44,683
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Robert Penta, former member of the Zargas body, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

478
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,025
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to go over some points that were brought up before the committee.

479
01:06:49,045 --> 01:06:54,008
[SPEAKER_18]: The whole meeting wasn't televised, but it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President.

480
01:06:54,548 --> 01:06:56,729
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a 3,500 square foot building.

481
01:06:56,769 --> 01:06:59,130
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a 35,000 square foot building.

482
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,211
[SPEAKER_18]: That's number one.

483
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:00,731
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two,

484
01:07:01,379 --> 01:07:03,920
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, in the report, it states it's going to be three story.

485
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:10,921
[SPEAKER_18]: And our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go.

486
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:18,703
[SPEAKER_18]: The sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing two and a half million.

487
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:23,145
[SPEAKER_18]: And we don't even know what the contingencies might be proposal here for the city of method.

488
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:28,426
[SPEAKER_18]: This present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing.

489
01:07:28,994 --> 01:07:31,935
[SPEAKER_18]: And because of that, and because of that, I agree with council marks.

490
01:07:31,955 --> 01:07:32,935
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor should be here tonight.

491
01:07:33,236 --> 01:07:38,697
[SPEAKER_18]: This is her proposal because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years.

492
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:40,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Howard got sped up to this point.

493
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:52,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, but thankfully because of the police department going out there and, uh, and, and having their demonstrations and speaking up and folks coming forward saying it's about time, but there are some issues.

494
01:07:52,782 --> 01:07:54,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Counsel Longo Kern is correct.

495
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:57,084
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates.

496
01:07:57,628 --> 01:07:59,990
[SPEAKER_18]: places, people that you met with, whoever it might be.

497
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:09,135
[SPEAKER_18]: And if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it.

498
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:12,978
[SPEAKER_18]: At least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might've been.

499
01:08:13,778 --> 01:08:17,581
[SPEAKER_18]: There wasn't one police union representative committee.

500
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:19,462
[SPEAKER_18]: So what does that tell you there?

501
01:08:19,822 --> 01:08:23,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Where was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be?

502
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,423
[SPEAKER_18]: The other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all.

503
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:35,828
[SPEAKER_18]: You're hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day.

504
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:37,870
[SPEAKER_18]: That's great for transparency.

505
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,572
[SPEAKER_18]: This administration was going to be so transparent.

506
01:08:41,353 --> 01:08:43,474
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about as transparent as this rug on the floor.

507
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:50,100
[SPEAKER_18]: More importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted.

508
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:54,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't answer for the chief of police because I did speak with him last Tuesday night.

509
01:08:54,767 --> 01:09:00,849
[SPEAKER_18]: at the council meeting and there was going to be an announcement the next day, whether he knew what the announcement was or not.

510
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:01,429
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

511
01:09:01,789 --> 01:09:09,932
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't get to the finality of it, but if the fire department, like I have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play.

512
01:09:11,052 --> 01:09:16,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Now let's talk about the bonding, because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January, 2013.

513
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:22,349
[SPEAKER_18]: as Councilor Marks has alluded to, there is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed.

514
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:37,315
[SPEAKER_18]: And the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's going to be to bond the police station.

515
01:09:37,795 --> 01:09:43,438
[SPEAKER_18]: But over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code.

516
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:49,140
[SPEAKER_18]: mechanically, electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time.

517
01:09:49,900 --> 01:10:07,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it.

518
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:13,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't it best to sit down and discuss these things rather than she made the decision?

519
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:19,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Who is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and that she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner?

520
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:22,503
[SPEAKER_18]: boxing you in, like a rubber stamp.

521
01:10:22,543 --> 01:10:24,364
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't vote for it, that means you're against it.

522
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:25,145
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not true.

523
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:27,607
[SPEAKER_18]: What's true is you should be a part of it.

524
01:10:28,027 --> 01:10:34,893
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all part of this, whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're be.

525
01:10:35,133 --> 01:10:37,695
[SPEAKER_18]: But more importantly, you have fire and police out here.

526
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And to some degree, they are divided.

527
01:10:40,037 --> 01:10:40,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you know something?

528
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:43,820
[SPEAKER_18]: The fire department is starting to realize things that they need.

529
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital

530
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,187
[SPEAKER_18]: program, what does that say?

531
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is that going?

532
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:53,614
[SPEAKER_18]: How does that affect them on their side of the building?

533
01:10:54,615 --> 01:11:00,566
[SPEAKER_18]: You just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines.

534
01:11:02,243 --> 01:11:09,828
[SPEAKER_18]: 6, 3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive.

535
01:11:10,489 --> 01:11:12,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter?

536
01:11:13,491 --> 01:11:15,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that going to be something that's going to be a challenge?

537
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:17,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I would hope not.

538
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:19,495
[SPEAKER_18]: You pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another.

539
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:24,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis.

540
01:11:25,488 --> 01:11:26,529
[SPEAKER_18]: The city treasurer is here.

541
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:33,132
[SPEAKER_18]: She has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating.

542
01:11:33,772 --> 01:11:42,376
[SPEAKER_18]: And by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project.

543
01:11:43,077 --> 01:11:43,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see that.

544
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:48,179
[SPEAKER_18]: As a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that.

545
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Because is the city saying your taxes won't go up?

546
01:11:53,462 --> 01:11:54,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Your rates won't go up because of this?

547
01:11:56,207 --> 01:12:00,431
[SPEAKER_18]: And where is all the grants from the federal government and the state?

548
01:12:00,831 --> 01:12:06,175
[SPEAKER_18]: The city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building.

549
01:12:07,016 --> 01:12:10,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Where is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

550
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone received one?

551
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:13,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you become aware of it?

552
01:12:14,282 --> 01:12:15,883
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't even know if they've even applied for it.

553
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:19,685
[SPEAKER_18]: It would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation.

554
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:29,972
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back.

555
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:32,514
[SPEAKER_18]: But she shut you out too, which is wrong.

556
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:35,576
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't do it by yourself, your own way.

557
01:12:37,497 --> 01:12:40,299
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you get elected to do a job.

558
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:42,642
[SPEAKER_18]: transparent.

559
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:45,064
[SPEAKER_18]: You talk about being independent voices.

560
01:12:45,424 --> 01:12:51,309
[SPEAKER_18]: How can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process?

561
01:12:52,490 --> 01:13:00,675
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we spent dollars for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014.

562
01:13:02,056 --> 01:13:04,919
[SPEAKER_18]: You had a committee of the whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up.

563
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:08,201
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think any one fireman or any one policewoman

564
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:12,980
[SPEAKER_18]: police man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman.

565
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,402
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it.

566
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:20,663
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is crunch time right now.

567
01:13:21,043 --> 01:13:25,745
[SPEAKER_18]: You're talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police.

568
01:13:26,565 --> 01:13:40,174
[SPEAKER_18]: And unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you.

569
01:13:41,075 --> 01:13:43,777
[SPEAKER_18]: The report talks about a merger of the buildings.

570
01:13:44,157 --> 01:13:46,759
[SPEAKER_18]: It talks about the irregular space that you have over there.

571
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:55,165
[SPEAKER_18]: It also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation.

572
01:13:55,712 --> 01:13:58,033
[SPEAKER_18]: You're only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land.

573
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So your space requirements are already confirmed.

574
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:04,696
[SPEAKER_18]: And to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination?

575
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:06,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the parking facility going to go?

576
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:12,259
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you're going to have a schematic design, you talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months.

577
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Six to eight months are going to prove to be what?

578
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:15,380
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to go out there for a design.

579
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,241
[SPEAKER_18]: But to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision.

580
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:20,322
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have to agree and disagree on things.

581
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:21,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're going to have to move forward.

582
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:25,244
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're going to have to have people input, your input.

583
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:27,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Taxpayers' input.

584
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:28,677
[SPEAKER_18]: It's their money.

585
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:30,618
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the taxpayers' money.

586
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:39,303
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job.

587
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:48,167
[SPEAKER_18]: They should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon.

588
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:55,591
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day.

589
01:14:56,432 --> 01:15:00,193
[SPEAKER_18]: The stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly.

590
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:06,576
[SPEAKER_18]: And right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there.

591
01:15:07,256 --> 01:15:12,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Why would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion in the fire department?

592
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:26,654
[SPEAKER_18]: without you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa?

593
01:15:26,914 --> 01:15:27,554
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't know.

594
01:15:28,495 --> 01:15:29,695
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we live in a great city.

595
01:15:30,355 --> 01:15:35,197
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community.

596
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:39,118
[SPEAKER_18]: But we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be,

597
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:42,778
[SPEAKER_18]: understanding that we all can't think the same way.

598
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:50,042
[SPEAKER_18]: But if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything.

599
01:15:50,062 --> 01:15:51,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Today is Valentine's Day.

600
01:15:51,943 --> 01:15:53,824
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day.

601
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:57,665
[SPEAKER_18]: But with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused.

602
01:15:58,026 --> 01:15:58,366
[SPEAKER_18]: OK?

603
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:01,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

604
01:16:02,248 --> 01:16:02,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

605
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:18,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Member Kern.

606
01:16:18,589 --> 01:16:20,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Carviello.

607
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:23,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to repeat myself.

608
01:16:23,553 --> 01:16:25,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we had a lengthy 6 to 7 p.m.

609
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:31,620
[SPEAKER_15]: meeting, but just reiterate probably a couple things, so forgive me.

610
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:38,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a really terrible situation that we've been put in tonight, that our two departments have been put in tonight.

611
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:45,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that flows from the lack of transparency in the closed door meetings with regards to this proposal.

612
01:16:46,524 --> 01:16:51,408
[SPEAKER_15]: When we met with the mayor in the spring, we went over a plan.

613
01:16:53,029 --> 01:16:59,173
[SPEAKER_15]: We were told that the preliminary studies weren't going to be done for new police station until 2018.

614
01:16:59,874 --> 01:17:05,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the fire department, um, 2 million were for later in that 2019, 2020.

615
01:17:06,798 --> 01:17:08,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you have the plan in front of you.

616
01:17:10,777 --> 01:17:26,710
[SPEAKER_15]: We thought we were going to have ample opportunity to sit down and discuss it as a council, with the community, where every issue, every concern would be vetted properly before any decisions were made.

617
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:31,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We did push for it to happen far sooner than 2018.

618
01:17:32,034 --> 01:17:38,359
[SPEAKER_15]: So on one hand, I'm very happy that the administration wants to move to a police station.

619
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:46,421
[SPEAKER_15]: or anything at all with regards to spending of that sort, I am happy and that's something that our men and women do deserve.

620
01:17:47,722 --> 01:18:04,516
[SPEAKER_15]: But to be told through text message last Tuesday night after a council meeting that there was a press conference, we weren't told what it was about, I couldn't make it, I think I was in court on Wednesday, I found out Wednesday afternoon that we have a new police station and I found out the location.

621
01:18:05,737 --> 01:18:07,999
[SPEAKER_15]: No idea of any details until tonight.

622
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:14,327
[SPEAKER_15]: questions that we have that need to be answered before we take this vote.

623
01:18:14,407 --> 01:18:16,288
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that we could have asked.

624
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:18,510
[SPEAKER_15]: These questions we could have asked back in January.

625
01:18:21,772 --> 01:18:29,358
[SPEAKER_15]: I went back and just read some of the relates from the state of the city address and some of the quotes.

626
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:36,123
[SPEAKER_15]: We are here as one city because we are strong and believe in writing this chapter together.

627
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:45,745
[SPEAKER_15]: working in collaboration with elected officials in a high level dialogue to renew and improve our city.

628
01:18:45,765 --> 01:18:48,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I felt sick.

629
01:18:49,367 --> 01:18:54,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to go back and read some campaign, some campaign promises, but I really would have got sick.

630
01:18:57,573 --> 01:19:04,157
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a police station that needs to be redone, but we also have a building just as old from the fire department.

631
01:19:04,617 --> 01:19:08,340
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't, I said it in the committee of the whole meeting, we haven't toured that facility.

632
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:10,408
[SPEAKER_15]: We toured the DPW yard in 2011.

633
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:12,629
[SPEAKER_15]: We toured the police station.

634
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:16,131
[SPEAKER_15]: I toured the police station in August, ran out of there, felt filthy.

635
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,233
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know that needs to be redone.

636
01:19:18,873 --> 01:19:22,615
[SPEAKER_15]: But whether it's a couple weeks or a month, we need to do it the right way.

637
01:19:23,616 --> 01:19:30,020
[SPEAKER_15]: The fire department and the chief of fire has to come back from Florida to be able to sit with the mayor and voice his concerns.

638
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:40,364
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole process is done wrong, and we're left in a position where we're going to look like big jerks for not voting for it, or heroes.

639
01:19:40,464 --> 01:19:43,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, either way, we're going to lose tonight.

640
01:19:44,986 --> 01:19:48,008
[SPEAKER_15]: But the bottom line is, we haven't been given any information.

641
01:19:48,128 --> 01:19:53,471
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a $2 billion that is going to be spent on architecture for a police station.

642
01:19:54,522 --> 01:20:07,011
[SPEAKER_15]: If we have the commitment of the administration, and they really want to do a new police station, and we ask them to do a dual facility, or at least explore the option, then we need to take a week and do it.

643
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,633
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get some quotes.

644
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:13,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been in Malden's police facility, and it's amazing.

645
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:19,980
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get some quotes from surrounding towns.

646
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Put this on the books and delay new fire updates.

647
01:20:23,817 --> 01:20:26,998
[SPEAKER_15]: fire department station one for 20 years.

648
01:20:27,098 --> 01:20:27,918
[SPEAKER_15]: It just can't happen.

649
01:20:28,778 --> 01:20:31,339
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have the fire department picketing in two, three years.

650
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:42,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's really lousy way to, to run a business, let alone a city lack of transparency close.

651
01:20:43,061 --> 01:20:47,282
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was stated closet telephone booth discussions.

652
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:48,402
[SPEAKER_15]: I loved that quote.

653
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:52,303
[SPEAKER_15]: I used it in a different context, but I loved it because that's what happened.

654
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:55,643
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's wrong.

655
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:59,665
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we need to explore all options and we need to take a week or two to do it.

656
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:05,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We've delayed this years, like it was said before, we can, we can sit and meet next week and discuss it.

657
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:08,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Have the mayor come, come tonight.

658
01:21:08,107 --> 01:21:14,830
[SPEAKER_15]: And she, you know, she, she wasn't present and answers couldn't, we couldn't even get some answers because department heads weren't here.

659
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:21,052
[SPEAKER_15]: So I asked that, I asked too, that we just get the figures of doing a dual

660
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:22,393
[SPEAKER_15]: station.

661
01:21:22,553 --> 01:21:25,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the police and fire study from 2013 in front of me too.

662
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:35,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Very clear that that site, if we're going to keep it on that site, it should be done together as a dual station, police and fire.

663
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:46,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you address to the record, please?

664
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President.

665
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:48,861
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Mark Rumley.

666
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:49,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the city solicitor.

667
01:21:49,882 --> 01:21:52,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

668
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:56,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the one who used the expression, closet and telephone booth discussions.

669
01:21:57,188 --> 01:22:00,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And I used that in the context of saying that that is not what occurred.

670
01:22:01,251 --> 01:22:13,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Administrations of every city and township throughout the Commonwealth, throughout the country, when the chief executive of a city or town makes a decision on how to proceed, they have to do so by way of checking things out.

671
01:22:14,571 --> 01:22:22,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Check things out by going into the newspaper and saying, this afternoon I'm going here, next week I'm going there, next month I'm going here.

672
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:27,987
[SPEAKER_07]: He or she who operates as an executive goes out with their administration and they check out different sites.

673
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:32,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It was represented to this council earlier that that's indeed what Mayor Burke did.

674
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:36,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And she went to many different sites and talked to many different people.

675
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:39,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I was involved in many of those discussions also.

676
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:45,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those owners said, we will talk with you, but only if this is kept on a confidential basis.

677
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:46,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But not all of them did.

678
01:22:47,231 --> 01:22:51,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the locations that you've alluded to, yes, we talked about those places.

679
01:22:51,412 --> 01:22:56,993
[SPEAKER_07]: But most of them had one particular deficiency, and that was acquisition cost.

680
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:57,693
[SPEAKER_07]: At least

681
01:22:58,905 --> 01:22:59,645
[SPEAKER_07]: deficiencies.

682
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:02,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was millions of dollars for acquisition costs.

683
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:11,449
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the great positives, which has been chosen by Mayor Burke is this, the acquisition cost is absolute zero.

684
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:17,970
[SPEAKER_07]: And that puts the city so far ahead as far as finance, that it cannot be denied.

685
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:25,833
[SPEAKER_07]: It cannot be overlooked by anyone who's going to be prudent with taxpayer money and the city's budgetary needs.

686
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:26,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

687
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

688
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

689
01:23:35,496 --> 01:23:39,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Leo A. Sacco, Jr., 227 Elm Street, Medford, Chief of Police.

690
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:45,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, once again, I'm here to ask you to vote in favor of this tonight, to move it forward.

691
01:23:46,244 --> 01:23:49,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the process in its entirety.

692
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:56,032
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I understand it is that it would take a few weeks for it to be posted if it were passed tonight.

693
01:23:56,543 --> 01:23:57,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Crosswalk would be chief.

694
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Four votes would give it a first reading.

695
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:02,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Five votes would pass the bond.

696
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:08,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue is that we've gotten to this point.

697
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:11,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that the blood is on your hands if something happens.

698
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:13,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that all the time myself.

699
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:16,859
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't pass a crosswalk or something like that, I get that.

700
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is we have an opportunity to move forward.

701
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're missing an opportunity as the police chief and as a citizen that lives in the city and pays taxes.

702
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good thing.

703
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that should be done.

704
01:24:30,267 --> 01:24:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

705
01:24:32,049 --> 01:24:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

706
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:39,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been something I've been fighting for for about 20 years to get a new police station, but so have everyone that's been seated behind me tonight.

707
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been fighting for the same thing.

708
01:24:42,388 --> 01:24:48,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Why things have happened in the way that they happened, I can't give you that answer, but you'll have plenty of time to get those answers.

709
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:52,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Why some of these things can't happen on a parallel track, I'm not sure.

710
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that they could.

711
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:59,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But to delay this now at this point, I just think it's wrong.

712
01:24:59,873 --> 01:25:04,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the bashing has to go, and the leadership has to begin.

713
01:25:04,555 --> 01:25:06,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs to begin right now, right here.

714
01:25:07,075 --> 01:25:07,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

715
01:25:08,056 --> 01:25:08,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Chief.

716
01:25:15,164 --> 01:25:16,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

717
01:25:16,686 --> 01:25:17,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval.

718
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso.

719
01:25:22,752 --> 01:25:23,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

720
01:25:24,754 --> 01:25:25,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

721
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:27,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street.

722
01:25:29,138 --> 01:25:34,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say that I think the biggest concern that I have is that when I showed up at this meeting there were

723
01:25:35,022 --> 01:25:38,665
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of police and fire here who had questions that they wanted answers to.

724
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:40,527
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us had questions.

725
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:44,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here at the meeting last week and nobody knew anything about this announcement.

726
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:50,815
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty upsetting to hear that when I voted in November of 2015, I selected a mayoral candidate.

727
01:25:51,283 --> 01:25:54,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected city councilors and I expected that they would all work together.

728
01:25:55,387 --> 01:26:00,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Both mayoral candidates said that they wanted to run the city open and transparent.

729
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:08,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So either person who won should have been in a position to go to our city council and have these conversations about the police station.

730
01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:16,602
[SPEAKER_00]: To hear that a text message was sent out that said, hey, show up at this place and I have a great announcement, it's pretty upsetting.

731
01:26:16,662 --> 01:26:18,363
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how the city is supposed to run.

732
01:26:18,823 --> 01:26:27,028
[SPEAKER_00]: As a citizen, I don't expect to be apprised of everything happening in the city, but I do hope that my city council is involved in big decisions such as this.

733
01:26:28,008 --> 01:26:34,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find out that the fire station, the fire department still doesn't know exactly what's going to happen for them with their training.

734
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,712
[SPEAKER_00]: to approve $2 million in funding for an architectural study.

735
01:26:41,853 --> 01:26:43,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Air station also needs to be repaired.

736
01:26:44,294 --> 01:26:45,835
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so much money in the city.

737
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:55,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to undertake a huge project on this site, then we need to make sure it's the best possible project for our city and for public safety.

738
01:26:56,782 --> 01:27:02,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that if you don't have questions, then this isn't the time to vote for it.

739
01:27:02,805 --> 01:27:06,908
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely pursue a combination police and fire and get the best that we can.

740
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,574
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of these hardworking men and women who are keeping us safe.

741
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:12,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

742
01:27:17,435 --> 01:27:19,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

743
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:22,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Massachusetts.

744
01:27:24,897 --> 01:27:31,638
[SPEAKER_16]: As I said many times in the past, if you need something, let's get it done in a smart, smart, full way.

745
01:27:32,658 --> 01:27:35,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, what I don't understand this, however,

746
01:27:36,206 --> 01:27:49,378
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a building that's only 55 years old, made of brick and mortar, and it's on, it's teetering on being condemned as was the DPW yard.

747
01:27:49,858 --> 01:27:55,463
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like we have a problem, Houston, as far as maintenance in this city with our hardware and tax money.

748
01:27:56,183 --> 01:28:00,988
[SPEAKER_16]: And now you're talking or someone's talking here and all the

749
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:06,886
[SPEAKER_16]: cost to do an architectural study of some sort.

750
01:28:08,126 --> 01:28:12,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I bet back in 62, when I visited that station, when it was brand spank, I knew a part in.

751
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:26,095
[SPEAKER_16]: However, just for inflation, I understand I'm behind the times, but over 10,000 wood frame homes are in the city.

752
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:35,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And they seem to be in fine order even though I don't have $160 million budget every year to take care of my two feet.

753
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:41,996
[SPEAKER_16]: The old high school built in 1830 something, I believe.

754
01:28:43,356 --> 01:28:47,098
[SPEAKER_16]: And my old high school will still be there and these new schools will long be gone.

755
01:28:48,518 --> 01:28:57,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm concerned if our children can afford to live in this city today at 2017 prices, if they can, and that's debatable.

756
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: What are we going to be paying for another station if it transpires next year?

757
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:12,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And 55 years, Marge, because the city's not taking care of our taxpayer property.

758
01:29:13,524 --> 01:29:18,367
[SPEAKER_16]: If the police need a decent building to take care of police business, so be it.

759
01:29:18,627 --> 01:29:19,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get it done.

760
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:22,530
[SPEAKER_16]: But it has to be done smart.

761
01:29:24,952 --> 01:29:26,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of understand.

762
01:29:27,671 --> 01:29:31,292
[SPEAKER_16]: How come we, the middle-class gets over the coals?

763
01:29:33,132 --> 01:29:36,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't people care to take care of us?

764
01:29:36,453 --> 01:29:39,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause without a middle-class, we're not going to have a society worth a damn.

765
01:29:41,534 --> 01:29:45,375
[SPEAKER_16]: And then again, I repeat, you may have a second revolution.

766
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:50,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Please take care of our hard earned investments.

767
01:29:51,077 --> 01:29:51,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Please.

768
01:29:51,697 --> 01:29:52,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

769
01:29:54,918 --> 01:29:55,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

770
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by councilor dollar Russo.

771
01:30:02,338 --> 01:30:07,579
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a second vice president marks.

772
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:16,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought at this particular point that we were going to go through the different recommendations made in the committee of the whole.

773
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:19,642
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not reported the paper out of committee yet.

774
01:30:21,142 --> 01:30:24,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to, we're going to vote on the 2 million without reporting our recommendations from the previous.

775
01:30:24,743 --> 01:30:26,323
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to vote the paper out of committee first.

776
01:30:27,065 --> 01:30:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's do that.

777
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:32,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I think it was asked for by council Longo current that we vote that out of, uh, do we vote?

778
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a motion to vote the paper out of committee?

779
01:30:36,092 --> 01:30:51,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we, uh, motion to table this while we report the other one out of, uh, out of committee motion by council along the table this while we take the committee paper.

780
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:52,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

781
01:30:55,333 --> 01:31:00,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Mr. President, all we need to do is call for a suspension of the rules to take the committee report.

782
01:31:00,196 --> 01:31:00,956
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we need to do.

783
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:03,097
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to table any particular paper.

784
01:31:03,718 --> 01:31:10,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Suspension of the rules to take up the suspension of rules been called by council marks to take up the committee, to take up the committee report.

785
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:11,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, take out the committee report.

786
01:31:11,622 --> 01:31:12,162
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

787
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:12,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

788
01:31:12,763 --> 01:31:14,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm opposed.

789
01:31:14,704 --> 01:31:15,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

790
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:18,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso is a, Mark is a, as opposed.

791
01:31:18,146 --> 01:31:18,666
[SPEAKER_06]: How's the night?

792
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:21,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the aligner.

793
01:31:23,428 --> 01:31:24,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, just,

794
01:31:24,753 --> 01:31:26,814
[SPEAKER_10]: to make a point of procedure relative to.

795
01:31:29,236 --> 01:31:30,156
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a motion to take.

796
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:33,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a paper.

797
01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:41,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion to take the committee to adopt the committee paper and read it out.

798
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:46,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have?

799
01:31:48,246 --> 01:31:51,688
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

800
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:53,469
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we're at.

801
01:31:54,511 --> 01:31:57,954
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to adopt, we're going to read the committee report.

802
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:04,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so do we have a motion to take the, bring the committee report up?

803
01:32:10,884 --> 01:32:11,524
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

804
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:14,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already suspended the rules.

805
01:32:17,849 --> 01:32:20,792
[SPEAKER_06]: The committee, the committee of the whole report that we had earlier this evening.

806
01:32:21,392 --> 01:32:22,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso.

807
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:23,474
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

808
01:32:25,297 --> 01:32:25,937
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

809
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

810
01:32:29,498 --> 01:32:32,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the paper out of the committee and read it on the floor.

811
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:35,340
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

812
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

813
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:40,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair seems to be in doubt here.

814
01:32:40,881 --> 01:32:42,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

815
01:32:42,201 --> 01:32:42,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Solison.

816
01:32:52,961 --> 01:33:02,467
[SPEAKER_07]: If I understand what's going on, which I'm not sure I do, there was the paper which was in the committee of the whole.

817
01:33:03,128 --> 01:33:08,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order for the paper in the committee of the whole to get to the council, it's got to go from there to here.

818
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:09,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's correct.

819
01:33:10,533 --> 01:33:17,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the other motion which preceded that, at least in terms of time, was councilor DelaRusso moving approval of a paper, which was in the committee of the whole.

820
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,459
[SPEAKER_07]: but the paper wasn't before you.

821
01:33:19,619 --> 01:33:20,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

822
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:20,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

823
01:33:22,321 --> 01:33:24,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, some of the chair is going to have to rule on that.

824
01:33:27,804 --> 01:33:28,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

825
01:33:30,565 --> 01:33:35,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So we move suspension of the rules so we can take the paper out of the committee to read out to make the recommendations.

826
01:33:36,049 --> 01:33:37,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Sallisa.

827
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:38,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

828
01:33:44,019 --> 01:33:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Del Rosso, would you rescind your question so we can take the paper off the table?

829
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:57,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

830
01:34:01,013 --> 01:34:02,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Del Rosso.

831
01:34:05,897 --> 01:34:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: He's withdrawing his motion.

832
01:34:07,678 --> 01:34:07,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

833
01:34:07,999 --> 01:34:12,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the suspension of the rules, we will now move to take the paper.

834
01:34:14,152 --> 01:34:15,353
[SPEAKER_06]: the committee report and read it out.

835
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:16,914
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

836
01:34:17,795 --> 01:34:17,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

837
01:34:18,175 --> 01:34:18,776
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

838
01:34:19,536 --> 01:34:20,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion has it.

839
01:34:23,499 --> 01:34:25,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, could you please read the committee report?

840
01:34:27,823 --> 01:34:29,544
[SPEAKER_06]: The recommendations that we had in the committee.

841
01:34:29,564 --> 01:34:35,209
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a committee report.

842
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:39,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Earlier this evening, Tuesday, February 14th.

843
01:34:41,451 --> 01:34:49,413
[SPEAKER_09]: in regards to funding proposals, funding mechanisms for the police station.

844
01:34:50,613 --> 01:35:01,376
[SPEAKER_09]: The RFP includes a retrofitting of the current fire station to accommodate the needs of the fire department.

845
01:35:03,076 --> 01:35:06,777
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the cost to put in a new training facility?

846
01:35:06,797 --> 01:35:10,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Feasibility of grant funding on the municipal training facility.

847
01:35:11,384 --> 01:35:16,207
[SPEAKER_09]: a breakdown of all city bonds and debtors, breakdown of all financial aspects of the loan order.

848
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:25,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I look at a combined police and police and fire facility, uh, listing of all locations that were viewed and proposed.

849
01:35:30,076 --> 01:35:37,000
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the chief, when was the fire chief apprised of the administration

850
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:53,555
[SPEAKER_09]: put together a working group with fire to deliberate on the existing fire stations, training facility, and with the, with the demolition of the existing facility, the city council support a new training, a training facility to be replaced.

851
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:55,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

852
01:35:56,657 --> 01:35:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept that point of information.

853
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:01,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Scott Pelly.

854
01:36:02,461 --> 01:36:05,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we said executive session to go over those sites.

855
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there was confidential issues?

856
01:36:10,302 --> 01:36:13,244
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be wise, Madam President.

857
01:36:13,264 --> 01:36:13,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

858
01:36:14,165 --> 01:36:14,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

859
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:16,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something you've got to take up.

860
01:36:16,246 --> 01:36:16,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, coach.

861
01:36:16,766 --> 01:36:19,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if we could add.

862
01:36:19,368 --> 01:36:19,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

863
01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:21,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lundquist.

864
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:24,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Just add possible grant funding.

865
01:36:24,331 --> 01:36:26,892
Do we grant funding for a dual facility?

866
01:36:27,092 --> 01:36:27,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

867
01:36:27,993 --> 01:36:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: He has it in there.

868
01:36:31,835 --> 01:36:32,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Mox.

869
01:36:35,486 --> 01:36:37,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Jelena constantly occurring.

870
01:36:37,488 --> 01:36:38,108
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your letter.

871
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:39,349
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I was doing.

872
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:42,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Grant funding for the dual, for a potential do for facility.

873
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:44,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept the paper.

874
01:36:46,774 --> 01:36:47,295
[SPEAKER_06]: All of them.

875
01:36:48,496 --> 01:36:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept the paper with the committee report.

876
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by council night to revert back to regular business.

877
01:37:03,787 --> 01:37:04,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion.

878
01:37:06,401 --> 01:37:06,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

879
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:13,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Return my motion to the floor for approval of 17 dash zero seven five loan order.

880
01:37:13,363 --> 01:37:14,263
[SPEAKER_13]: City of Medford.

881
01:37:16,923 --> 01:37:21,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you on move for approval.

882
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:23,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, vice president marks.

883
01:37:24,945 --> 01:37:32,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think at this point, I don't think anyone behind the reel wants to walk away tonight with, you know, not a deal in hand.

884
01:37:33,668 --> 01:37:42,077
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's difficult to negotiate when you have members of the council willing to discuss and we don't have the other potty at the table.

885
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:44,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very difficult, Mr. President.

886
01:37:45,539 --> 01:38:03,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I would ask is for maybe a two-week, three-week, whatever grace period we need, under your leadership, to sit down with the mayor and discuss these nine or 10 issues that we brought up on behalf of this council, behalf of both departments, and behalf of the citizens, and discuss them with the mayor.

887
01:38:03,906 --> 01:38:07,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if we come to an impasse or we're unable to move forward,

888
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:13,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it'll be up to this council to come back again and decide what they want to do, if they want to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down the station.

889
01:38:14,576 --> 01:38:17,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's do our due diligence now, Mr. President.

890
01:38:17,859 --> 01:38:19,841
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wait the two weeks, whatever that week.

891
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:21,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm willing to meet tomorrow, Mr. President.

892
01:38:22,184 --> 01:38:23,045
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter to me.

893
01:38:23,325 --> 01:38:25,508
[SPEAKER_08]: That's do our homework and our due diligence.

894
01:38:25,928 --> 01:38:27,288
[SPEAKER_08]: get these questions answered.

895
01:38:27,589 --> 01:38:33,090
[SPEAKER_08]: If the mayor is adamantly opposed to building one combined public safety facility, then we have our answer.

896
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:35,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have our answer, Mr. President.

897
01:38:35,271 --> 01:38:38,152
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be up to this council whether they want to move forward or not.

898
01:38:38,852 --> 01:38:40,313
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, we don't have the answer.

899
01:38:40,933 --> 01:38:43,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And I personally think that's the best answer.

900
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:49,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's the best answer for all parties, and I think it's one we can afford, Mr. President, in this community.

901
01:38:50,247 --> 01:38:52,229
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't spent anything on public safety.

902
01:38:52,489 --> 01:38:56,052
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to beg, borrow, and steal to get new cars, new apparatus.

903
01:38:57,513 --> 01:39:01,216
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not spending anything in public safety in this community.

904
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that within the next two weeks, that you call for a meeting with the mayor, and we sit down and go over these particular items.

905
01:39:11,564 --> 01:39:16,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're unable to come to a resolve, then the paper's right before us again.

906
01:39:16,468 --> 01:39:18,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The paper's not going anywhere with the police department.

907
01:39:19,092 --> 01:39:22,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right before us again, Mr. President, and we'll take a vote on it.

908
01:39:23,014 --> 01:39:23,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm prepared to do that.

909
01:39:24,555 --> 01:39:25,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm prepared to do that.

910
01:39:25,815 --> 01:39:28,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Give the process a little time.

911
01:39:29,157 --> 01:39:30,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had no time.

912
01:39:30,557 --> 01:39:31,718
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had no process.

913
01:39:33,057 --> 01:39:38,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Admittedly, even some of the representatives from the mayor's office, I think admittedly have said the process has been lax.

914
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:40,945
[SPEAKER_08]: There hasn't really been a process.

915
01:39:41,365 --> 01:39:53,237
[SPEAKER_08]: They may be working behind the scenes, Mr. President, but surely it hasn't involved us as a council or other city employees that have the largest impact on Mr. President.

916
01:39:53,717 --> 01:39:56,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

917
01:39:58,408 --> 01:40:00,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor DelaRusso does have a motion on the floor.

918
01:40:00,389 --> 01:40:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

919
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:02,250
[SPEAKER_08]: He can have all the motions he wants.

920
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:04,832
[SPEAKER_08]: He sat on the subcommittee that recommended something else.

921
01:40:05,192 --> 01:40:06,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Now he's saying he's going with the mayor.

922
01:40:07,413 --> 01:40:08,534
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine, Mr. President.

923
01:40:08,834 --> 01:40:14,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do the right thing on behalf of the employees in this city and in the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President.

924
01:40:14,937 --> 01:40:19,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no rush to judgment over the next two weeks to sit down with the mayor.

925
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,041
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't sat down with her once since she offered this proposal.

926
01:40:22,402 --> 01:40:22,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Not once.

927
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:25,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not spending $20.

928
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:25,723
[SPEAKER_08]: It's $2 million.

929
01:40:28,074 --> 01:40:28,614
[SPEAKER_08]: for a study.

930
01:40:31,255 --> 01:40:32,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

931
01:40:32,775 --> 01:40:48,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, Mark Rumley, there is not one item on that list that cannot be discussed, whether it's this week, next week, or the week after, which would be prohibited if this paper took its first reading tonight.

932
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:54,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Not one issue on that paper which came out of committee would be prohibited from being discussed.

933
01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:55,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, with all due respect,

934
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:58,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I'm confused.

935
01:40:59,325 --> 01:41:03,328
[SPEAKER_08]: The gentleman here is acting on behalf of the mayor as the mayor's spokesperson.

936
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:03,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I object.

937
01:41:03,929 --> 01:41:05,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on behalf of the city.

938
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:05,830
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a court.

939
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:06,871
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't object to this.

940
01:41:07,011 --> 01:41:07,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I can.

941
01:41:07,692 --> 01:41:10,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll object to you today, tomorrow, and the next day.

942
01:41:10,654 --> 01:41:11,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, if I could finish my comment.

943
01:41:12,536 --> 01:41:13,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very confused.

944
01:41:13,837 --> 01:41:16,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Very confused is an apt description.

945
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:16,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

946
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:24,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, the gentleman comes up here as the mayor's spokesperson.

947
01:41:25,046 --> 01:41:31,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he's coming up here based on legal maneuvers that we're doing as a council and voting on issues to give his opinion on that.

948
01:41:32,088 --> 01:41:33,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what he's acting as.

949
01:41:33,149 --> 01:41:35,189
[SPEAKER_08]: City solicitor, the mayor's spokesperson.

950
01:41:35,529 --> 01:41:36,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't understand, Mr. President.

951
01:41:36,610 --> 01:41:38,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'll make it clear to you, Counselor.

952
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:38,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand, Mr. President.

953
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the city solicitor.

954
01:41:40,371 --> 01:41:42,812
[SPEAKER_07]: You should act as the city solicitor, not pay his spokespersons.

955
01:41:42,932 --> 01:41:47,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And as to procedure, perhaps the council should get its act together on procedure.

956
01:41:47,673 --> 01:41:48,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can't be both.

957
01:41:48,594 --> 01:41:49,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You're wearing two hats tonight.

958
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:50,274
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wear one.

959
01:41:50,294 --> 01:41:52,635
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be the mayor's spokesperson and the city solicitor.

960
01:41:53,255 --> 01:41:55,057
[SPEAKER_07]: You will not be insulted in this fashion.

961
01:41:55,077 --> 01:41:56,098
[SPEAKER_08]: You should not be.

962
01:41:56,898 --> 01:41:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor, Mr. Solicitor, please.

963
01:41:59,240 --> 01:41:59,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Decorum, please.

964
01:42:00,882 --> 01:42:01,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

965
01:42:01,663 --> 01:42:03,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

966
01:42:05,046 --> 01:42:07,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And happy Valentine's Day, Mr. Solicitor.

967
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:08,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Knight.

968
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:11,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

969
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:14,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this council in 2014, 2015, 2016, now 2017, has made it adamantly clear that

970
01:42:20,482 --> 01:42:23,643
[SPEAKER_11]: a new police station is a priority, the number one priority for this body.

971
01:42:24,384 --> 01:42:27,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, however, we also did just adopt a committee report that asked questions.

972
01:42:28,825 --> 01:42:34,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if we're going to be making expenditure of the taxpayer dollar and we have questions, we need to have those questions answered.

973
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

974
01:42:35,908 --> 01:42:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

975
01:42:36,228 --> 01:42:36,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Knight.

976
01:42:36,648 --> 01:42:39,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

977
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:40,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record please.

978
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:43,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Bedford, Mass, former member of this board.

979
01:42:43,911 --> 01:42:47,392
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this is the problem that's happening here.

980
01:42:47,472 --> 01:42:49,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Knight just hit it right in the head.

981
01:42:49,807 --> 01:42:50,988
[SPEAKER_18]: You have questions to be asked.

982
01:42:51,008 --> 01:42:52,589
[SPEAKER_18]: You've waited some 15, 20 years.

983
01:42:52,609 --> 01:42:55,851
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief says it's been some 20 years looking for a new police station.

984
01:42:55,971 --> 01:42:57,052
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not going to happen overnight.

985
01:42:57,072 --> 01:43:00,114
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to have to take six to eight months before you even get the groundwork going.

986
01:43:01,315 --> 01:43:08,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me make an offering here that maybe you folks through the presidency, go to the mayor tomorrow morning, because I saw her walking out of the building tonight.

987
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:11,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently she decided not to come to the meeting.

988
01:43:12,382 --> 01:43:13,243
[SPEAKER_18]: This is her baby.

989
01:43:13,363 --> 01:43:14,324
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not your baby.

990
01:43:14,584 --> 01:43:15,164
[SPEAKER_18]: It's her baby.

991
01:43:15,204 --> 01:43:16,685
[SPEAKER_18]: She's the one that made the presentation.

992
01:43:17,306 --> 01:43:19,327
[SPEAKER_18]: You tell her that you want to sit down and talk with her.

993
01:43:20,165 --> 01:43:21,826
[SPEAKER_18]: You have all the questions you want to ask.

994
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:32,695
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be nice, maybe the first time in somewhat 16 months, that you had an opportunity of all of you to sit down, break some bread in our office, and just saying, hey, these are the questions we're going.

995
01:43:32,735 --> 01:43:34,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do this all together.

996
01:43:34,436 --> 01:43:36,758
[SPEAKER_18]: And maybe you can come to some sense of resolution.

997
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:39,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think a week or two is going to make any difference right now.

998
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:41,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think the first reading is going to make any difference.

999
01:43:41,702 --> 01:43:44,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the fact of the matter is you don't have your questions answered.

1000
01:43:44,505 --> 01:43:47,447
[SPEAKER_18]: And until those questions are answered, you won't be able to go anywhere.

1001
01:43:48,212 --> 01:43:52,239
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Councilor Falco, you had a concern over the tower, okay?

1002
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:57,668
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you don't have that answer yet, but we can get into all the minutiae of the questions that need to be asked.

1003
01:43:58,369 --> 01:43:59,692
[SPEAKER_18]: So why don't you just reverse it?

1004
01:44:00,353 --> 01:44:01,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Call her up tomorrow morning.

1005
01:44:03,298 --> 01:44:12,044
[SPEAKER_18]: 8.30 when she comes to work, like everybody else at City Hall, 8.30 in the morning, go knocking on her door and just saying, we're having a meeting with you, Madam Mayor and the City Council.

1006
01:44:12,324 --> 01:44:13,305
[SPEAKER_18]: She needs you.

1007
01:44:13,405 --> 01:44:14,225
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't need her.

1008
01:44:14,305 --> 01:44:14,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember that.

1009
01:44:15,466 --> 01:44:16,627
[SPEAKER_18]: You're her breadstrings.

1010
01:44:16,947 --> 01:44:17,928
[SPEAKER_18]: You're her lifeline.

1011
01:44:18,768 --> 01:44:27,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you don't hold her feet to the fire, she'll just use you each and every time she wants something done for her, to make her look politically good, and to embarrass you folks.

1012
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,370
[SPEAKER_18]: And right now, that's the position you're in, an embarrassing position.

1013
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:32,791
[SPEAKER_18]: But you don't need to be.

1014
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:40,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Now's the time to turn around, put your big boy suits on, and your shoes, and your girl, and your high heels, and go knock on that door and say, we're here to do business.

1015
01:44:40,772 --> 01:44:42,912
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to do business, we're ready to do it.

1016
01:44:43,173 --> 01:44:44,513
[SPEAKER_18]: If not, we're shutting down.

1017
01:44:44,813 --> 01:44:45,613
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I would do.

1018
01:44:51,908 --> 01:44:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Neistat.

1019
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:56,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't support a government shutdown, Mr. President.

1020
01:44:59,634 --> 01:45:01,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion by Councilor DelaRusso.

1021
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Max.

1022
01:45:04,777 --> 01:45:09,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I would respectfully ask my colleague to withdraw his motion so we can compromise.

1023
01:45:10,401 --> 01:45:13,323
[SPEAKER_08]: All we're asking is for two weeks and then we'll take a vote.

1024
01:45:13,623 --> 01:45:19,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, it's going to be a guaranteed vote so we can iron out some of the issues.

1025
01:45:19,768 --> 01:45:21,349
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be a commitment by this council.

1026
01:45:21,845 --> 01:45:24,507
[SPEAKER_08]: There's seven of us here, and I think we're all on the same page.

1027
01:45:25,108 --> 01:45:28,070
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councilor Knight just said, let's get some answers, we'll come back to the table.

1028
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:29,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a guarantee.

1029
01:45:30,192 --> 01:45:33,174
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not gonna go, this issue is not going away by any stretch.

1030
01:45:33,495 --> 01:45:36,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So no one's gonna leave here tonight saying we're not gonna get a station or whatever.

1031
01:45:37,558 --> 01:45:40,140
[SPEAKER_08]: There's gonna be a guaranteed cement answer within two weeks.

1032
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:45,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I would respectfully ask my colleague in the suggestion to compromise.

1033
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1034
01:45:47,727 --> 01:45:48,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think that

1035
01:45:50,454 --> 01:45:53,835
[SPEAKER_11]: In the spirit of compromise, Councilor Marks raises a very good point, number one.

1036
01:45:54,175 --> 01:46:03,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, I think that it's very important that if, in fact, we are going to sit down and discuss this, that there is a date certain that we come back to further discuss this debate in this forum.

1037
01:46:03,877 --> 01:46:08,378
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can't get our questions answered, then we should have a date certain that we're gonna come back and actually vote on the paper.

1038
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:11,058
[SPEAKER_11]: So I certainly appreciate that.

1039
01:46:11,138 --> 01:46:13,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's an excellent suggestion.

1040
01:46:13,419 --> 01:46:13,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1041
01:46:20,286 --> 01:46:21,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Longo-Kearns.

1042
01:46:21,406 --> 01:46:23,787
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say, we just want questions answered too.

1043
01:46:23,867 --> 01:46:24,988
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just sitting in meeting.

1044
01:46:25,008 --> 01:46:27,049
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes both ways.

1045
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:27,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1046
01:46:28,169 --> 01:46:28,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1047
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:34,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso, your colleague has asked that you.

1048
01:46:34,992 --> 01:46:37,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I acknowledge that my colleague has asked the question.

1049
01:46:38,233 --> 01:46:39,714
[SPEAKER_13]: My motion stands, Mr. President.

1050
01:46:39,954 --> 01:46:40,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion.

1051
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:43,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso's motion has made a motion.

1052
01:46:44,516 --> 01:46:46,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second on Councilor DelaRusso's motion?

1053
01:46:47,737 --> 01:46:49,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mr. President, just so I understand,

1054
01:46:50,772 --> 01:46:59,574
[SPEAKER_08]: If we vote against Councilor Del Rosso's motion, is it true the paper cannot come back to us, the police station paper, for six months, Mr. President?

1055
01:46:59,594 --> 01:47:00,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 90 days.

1056
01:47:00,534 --> 01:47:02,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Solicitor, could you?

1057
01:47:02,734 --> 01:47:04,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Solicitor, would that be correct?

1058
01:47:04,515 --> 01:47:04,555
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1059
01:47:04,595 --> 01:47:05,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1060
01:47:05,095 --> 01:47:05,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1061
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:33,862
[SPEAKER_13]: There's ample opportunity within the intervening weeks after the first reading to have conversation about the matters that are presented tonight, in my estimation.

1062
01:47:45,304 --> 01:47:52,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I have a motion for approval.

1063
01:47:52,107 --> 01:47:58,649
[SPEAKER_13]: If somebody feels that they can't get their questions answered in that time.

1064
01:47:58,929 --> 01:48:08,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I just think people at home and people in the audience should know that if Councilor De La Russo's motion does not prevail, we cannot discuss that for another 90 days.

1065
01:48:10,236 --> 01:48:14,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So just want you to know that, that people will be disposed of.

1066
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:21,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm asking is a two-week compromise to be back at this table in two weeks for a vote.

1067
01:48:21,603 --> 01:48:22,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a win-win.

1068
01:48:22,924 --> 01:48:31,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, the two weeks intervening is ample opportunity, and this is not a final vote on the matter.

1069
01:48:33,691 --> 01:48:35,512
[SPEAKER_13]: The logic doesn't follow, Mr. President.

1070
01:48:35,532 --> 01:48:36,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, if I could.

1071
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:45,585
[SPEAKER_08]: The vote is to move forward on a paper that solely looks at the architectural design for a police station.

1072
01:48:45,625 --> 01:48:46,225
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

1073
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:55,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if we include a fire station, I'm sure whoever is going to do this design is going to say, you're not getting it for $2 million, it's going to cost you, City of Medford, $2.3 million.

1074
01:48:56,625 --> 01:49:00,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm saying is... The paper does not ask for a fire station.

1075
01:49:00,167 --> 01:49:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1076
01:49:00,927 --> 01:49:06,389
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm saying is, by moving forward on a paper that doesn't address the issues, doesn't make sense.

1077
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:07,970
[SPEAKER_08]: You're putting the cart before the horse.

1078
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:13,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get this ironed out, and then we'll know the exact dollar amount we need to move forward.

1079
01:49:13,552 --> 01:49:16,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be a combined center, or it might just be the police department.

1080
01:49:16,574 --> 01:49:16,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1081
01:49:17,374 --> 01:49:19,335
[SPEAKER_08]: But that vote will come in two weeks, Mr. President.

1082
01:49:19,355 --> 01:49:23,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So I respectfully ask my colleague again to withdraw his motion, Mr. President.

1083
01:49:23,917 --> 01:49:24,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso?

1084
01:49:27,865 --> 01:49:30,706
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, do we have a second?

1085
01:49:32,387 --> 01:49:36,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not seconding that.

1086
01:49:39,469 --> 01:49:42,190
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have a second, Councilor DelaRusso.

1087
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:46,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I ask that my motion be taken, Mr. President.

1088
01:49:47,432 --> 01:49:48,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1089
01:49:49,592 --> 01:49:56,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to postpone the matter 14 days.

1090
01:50:00,578 --> 01:50:01,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting there.

1091
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:01,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting there.

1092
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying.

1093
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm practicing.

1094
01:50:07,141 --> 01:50:08,922
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1095
01:50:09,322 --> 01:50:11,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to postpone for 14 days.

1096
01:50:11,103 --> 01:50:22,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and in the interim, uh, have a meeting with the administration to, um, discuss some of the questions that were raised this evening and, uh, on the motion by councilor night to postpone the meeting.

1097
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you, you guys, you guys, you can, you can make it a joint motion.

1098
01:50:28,453 --> 01:50:28,973
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be yours.

1099
01:50:29,013 --> 01:50:31,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll withdraw it.

1100
01:50:31,974 --> 01:50:32,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll withdraw it.

1101
01:50:32,994 --> 01:50:33,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1102
01:50:33,935 --> 01:50:36,335
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by counselor and counselor mocks.

1103
01:50:37,516 --> 01:50:38,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Imitations of flattery.

1104
01:50:40,457 --> 01:50:40,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1105
01:50:41,017 --> 01:50:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: To postpone this for 14 days.

1106
01:50:43,718 --> 01:50:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

1107
01:50:46,059 --> 01:50:48,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1108
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:54,920
[SPEAKER_06]: to meet with the mayor and to discuss the issues.

1109
01:50:58,622 --> 01:50:59,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is essentially your table.

1110
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Del Rosso?

1111
01:51:11,411 --> 01:51:11,731
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1112
01:51:12,311 --> 01:51:13,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco?

1113
01:51:13,112 --> 01:51:13,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1114
01:51:14,032 --> 01:51:14,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Nye?

1115
01:51:14,613 --> 01:51:15,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1116
01:51:15,273 --> 01:51:16,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Leopold?

1117
01:51:17,335 --> 01:51:17,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1118
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:22,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1119
01:51:24,539 --> 01:51:26,859
[SPEAKER_06]: One in the affirmative, six in the negative.

1120
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1121
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:35,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1122
01:51:35,181 --> 01:51:37,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion is tabled for 14 days.

1123
01:51:37,062 --> 01:51:39,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a five minute recess.

1124
01:59:28,717 --> 01:59:43,515
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-070, report of the Subcommittee on Zoning and Audiences, held on February 6, 2017, to review and discuss all papers assigned to the Subcommittee on Zoning and Audiences.

1125
01:59:45,718 --> 01:59:46,098
[SPEAKER_06]: That's me.

1126
01:59:46,699 --> 01:59:47,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1127
01:59:48,428 --> 01:59:49,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1128
01:59:50,389 --> 01:59:56,032
[SPEAKER_11]: The subcommittee on zoning and ordinances asks that you call a committee of the whole to go over the following paper.

1129
01:59:56,812 --> 01:59:58,913
[SPEAKER_11]: We did adopt a committee report.

1130
01:59:59,314 --> 02:00:00,994
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee report is rather extensive.

1131
02:00:01,755 --> 02:00:09,779
[SPEAKER_11]: For a brief synopsis, I will tell you that the council addressed paper 16771, the wage theft ordinance.

1132
02:00:10,459 --> 02:00:15,882
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee also addressed council paper 15749, an ordinance regulating replica firearms.

1133
02:00:18,437 --> 02:00:22,561
[SPEAKER_11]: These two matters were reported out of the committee favorably in motion to refer to the committee of the whole Mr. President.

1134
02:00:23,642 --> 02:00:35,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we also called a meeting relative to paper one six seven zero five, a short term rental ordinance paper one six five five five related to demolition delay that was scheduled for two 1317 at 6 p.m.

1135
02:00:35,892 --> 02:00:38,374
[SPEAKER_11]: which was yesterday, Mr. President, but city hall was closed.

1136
02:00:38,835 --> 02:00:41,537
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, we canceled the meeting.

1137
02:00:42,518 --> 02:00:42,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1138
02:00:43,698 --> 02:00:47,680
[SPEAKER_11]: We took up paper 1, 2, 3, 9, 5, satellites antennas receivers ordinance.

1139
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:51,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we voted to receive it and place it on file, but give notice to the building commissioner.

1140
02:00:51,981 --> 02:00:55,863
[SPEAKER_11]: The measure was introduced at his request and the paper has been in subcommittee for an extended period of time.

1141
02:00:56,543 --> 02:01:00,564
[SPEAKER_11]: We requested that if the building commissioner feels as though it's still an issue that he can reintroduce the paper.

1142
02:01:01,805 --> 02:01:05,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we looked at paper 1, 4, 7, 0, 8 regulating e-cigarettes in an ordinance.

1143
02:01:05,686 --> 02:01:09,728
[SPEAKER_11]: We received it in place on file with a notice to the sponsor that the matter is currently governed by board of health.

1144
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: We also looked at paper 1 6 6 0 amending the graffiti ordinance 6 2 dash 9 4 to authorize fines to property owners for the non removal of graffiti on private property.

1145
02:01:21,258 --> 02:01:36,943
[SPEAKER_11]: We voted Mr. President to keep this matter into in committee and reconvene on 2 2017 as well representative from the building department to appear before us on paper 1 6 6 2 6 notice of all zoning board of appeal hearings to all residents within 300 feet of the applicant.

1146
02:01:37,442 --> 02:01:38,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We voted to keep this matter in committee.

1147
02:01:38,863 --> 02:01:41,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, we requested a legal opinion from the city solicitor.

1148
02:01:41,985 --> 02:01:43,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Does state law govern notice requirements?

1149
02:01:43,966 --> 02:01:46,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this proposal outside the scope?

1150
02:01:46,087 --> 02:01:52,351
[SPEAKER_11]: The scope pro paper one six dash six, six, six moratoriums on building smart development.

1151
02:01:52,432 --> 02:01:53,932
[SPEAKER_11]: We voted to keep this paper in committee.

1152
02:01:53,992 --> 02:02:03,438
[SPEAKER_11]: We requested a legal opinion from the solicitor as to whether or not this is when I scope within our scope and purview paper one, six, three, five, nine, an amendment to the zoning act to authorize front yard parking.

1153
02:02:03,979 --> 02:02:05,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the committee voted to keep that in committee as well.

1154
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:11,483
[SPEAKER_11]: In paper 16338, zoning consultant, we voted to keep that paper in committee as well.

1155
02:02:11,863 --> 02:02:15,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion was made by Councilor Dela Russo to report the paper out of committee favorably.

1156
02:02:15,124 --> 02:02:17,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It was seconded by Councilor Falco.

1157
02:02:17,786 --> 02:02:19,487
[SPEAKER_11]: The meeting adjourned at 6.58 PM.

1158
02:02:19,527 --> 02:02:24,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, in attendance were myself as the chairman, Councilor Dela Russo, and Councilor Falco as members.

1159
02:02:25,269 --> 02:02:31,373
[SPEAKER_11]: We were also very lucky to have two members of our council here, Councilor Scott Pelli and Councilor Caraviello.

1160
02:02:32,433 --> 02:02:34,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello and Councilor

1161
02:02:35,451 --> 02:02:45,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Scarpelli were in attendance as citizens and not as members of the subcommittee or city councilors because that would have posed some issues, Mr. President.

1162
02:02:46,015 --> 02:02:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Also in attendance was Mr. DeVita and Ms.

1163
02:02:47,816 --> 02:02:49,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Rodriguez, and I want to thank them both for coming.

1164
02:02:49,897 --> 02:02:56,620
[SPEAKER_11]: So as such, Mr. President, we'd ask that the subcommittee report be adopted and that a committee of the whole be set up to go over the two pieces of legislation that are included therein.

1165
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1166
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:01,322

[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1170
02:03:09,007 --> 02:03:10,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair seems to be a question.

1171
02:03:10,668 --> 02:03:11,368
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1172
02:03:11,849 --> 02:03:11,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1173
02:03:12,789 --> 02:03:13,609

02:04:54,670 --> 02:04:55,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1213
02:04:55,811 --> 02:04:57,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1214
02:04:57,531 --> 02:05:02,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that you, Councilor Scarpelli, and myself all had the same idea when Ms.

1215
02:05:02,633 --> 02:05:03,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Wentworth came up here this evening

1216
02:05:04,802 --> 02:05:08,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had discussions, but I know Councilor Scott Pelley has it as well.

1217
02:05:09,984 --> 02:05:11,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Pelley has as well.

1218
02:05:13,866 --> 02:05:14,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, Mr. President.

1219
02:05:14,847 --> 02:05:16,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1220
02:05:17,308 --> 02:05:21,750
[SPEAKER_06]: In the back, it's hard enough to hear as it is here.

1221
02:05:23,331 --> 02:05:24,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1222
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:25,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I can proceed.

1223
02:05:25,992 --> 02:05:27,313
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no cell phones in the room.

1224
02:05:28,213 --> 02:05:29,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

1225
02:05:29,053 --> 02:05:30,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

1226
02:05:32,733 --> 02:05:33,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Where was I?

1227
02:05:34,014 --> 02:05:35,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, so, Ms.

1228
02:05:35,895 --> 02:05:42,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Wentworth appeared before the council earlier this evening to discuss the situation that she's having getting in and out of her driveway on Winthrop Street.

1229
02:05:43,219 --> 02:05:45,441
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a problem that's not exclusive to Ms.

1230
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:50,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Wentworth with the number of buses that queue up on Winthrop Street and along Placehead Road.

1231
02:05:50,644 --> 02:05:52,204
[SPEAKER_11]: It does pose a visibility issue.

1232
02:05:52,825 --> 02:06:01,070
[SPEAKER_11]: With the recent amount of snowfall that we received, these buses are a little further out in the street, causing a significant issue for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists.

1233
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:11,644
[SPEAKER_11]: the administration reach out to the MBTA and discuss solutions to the long-term idling of buses in that location and the public safety concerns that it poses.

1234
02:06:11,704 --> 02:06:14,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by Councilor Knight, Scott Pell, and Caravaglio.

1235
02:06:15,086 --> 02:06:16,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1236
02:06:16,907 --> 02:06:17,707
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1237
02:06:18,687 --> 02:06:20,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes 7-0.

1238
02:06:22,029 --> 02:06:22,549
[SPEAKER_06]: The records.

1239
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:25,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to suspend the rules.

1240
02:06:29,792 --> 02:06:30,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1241
02:06:32,178 --> 02:06:34,119
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, I'm Ronald Paone.

1242
02:06:34,159 --> 02:06:36,459
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at 314 Winthrop Street in Medford.

1243
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,121
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to piggyback on what those two residents were talking about, about the speeding.

1244
02:06:41,721 --> 02:06:42,642
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm on the other side.

1245
02:06:42,682 --> 02:06:43,642
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm towards the rotary.

1246
02:06:43,682 --> 02:06:46,123
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm going to get a little animated here.

1247
02:06:46,203 --> 02:06:50,604
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you could just give me about seven minutes of your time, and I'm just going to read what happened.

1248
02:06:50,824 --> 02:06:52,765
[SPEAKER_20]: This incident occurred this morning at 2 AM.

1249
02:06:54,025 --> 02:06:55,566
[SPEAKER_20]: And it had something to do with the snow.

1250
02:06:56,197 --> 02:06:57,738
[SPEAKER_20]: It also had something to do with speeding.

1251
02:06:57,898 --> 02:07:05,361
[SPEAKER_20]: It also had something to do with the road that is destroyed because of a water break that happened two months ago, okay?

1252
02:07:05,781 --> 02:07:06,921
[SPEAKER_20]: So at 2 a.m.

1253
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:13,264
[SPEAKER_20]: this morning, I was awakened by a big bang, a pickup truck snowplow from the city of Medford.

1254
02:07:13,404 --> 02:07:14,804
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the city of Medford pickup truck.

1255
02:07:15,645 --> 02:07:19,246
[SPEAKER_20]: And he was moving up and down Winthrop Street with his blade lowered.

1256
02:07:19,826 --> 02:07:20,767
[SPEAKER_20]: His intention was to...

1257
02:07:23,608 --> 02:07:26,610
[SPEAKER_20]: I ran outside, and he flew by me with his blade dropped.

1258
02:07:27,211 --> 02:07:28,872
[SPEAKER_20]: He was going over excessive.

1259
02:07:29,893 --> 02:07:33,835
[SPEAKER_20]: He was doing 50 miles an hour with his 15.

1260
02:07:34,556 --> 02:07:38,019
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pretty accurate with this, because I can see how fast it was going.

1261
02:07:38,659 --> 02:07:47,085
[SPEAKER_20]: He hit my snow bank before he got away, shot snow, throwing it all over my entrance and my sidewalk.

1262
02:07:48,806 --> 02:07:50,788
[SPEAKER_20]: I got in my vehicle, and I went to look for him.

1263
02:07:51,789 --> 02:07:52,389
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't find him.

1264
02:07:53,086 --> 02:07:55,528
[SPEAKER_20]: I went down to the city yard, walked in.

1265
02:07:55,548 --> 02:07:57,469
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a gentleman behind the desk.

1266
02:07:57,889 --> 02:07:58,750
[SPEAKER_20]: He was sleeping.

1267
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:06,454
[SPEAKER_20]: And before I continue, I just want to say, I'm not disrespecting the municipality because I think they're one of the greatest municipalities in the state.

1268
02:08:06,514 --> 02:08:08,135
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to reiterate that at the end of this.

1269
02:08:08,756 --> 02:08:09,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1270
02:08:10,977 --> 02:08:13,699
[SPEAKER_20]: Behind the desk, told him what happened.

1271
02:08:13,719 --> 02:08:15,240
[SPEAKER_20]: He said, I will report it.

1272
02:08:17,201 --> 02:08:17,981
[SPEAKER_20]: Waited for about 10, 15 minutes.

1273
02:08:19,462 --> 02:08:31,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing happened, so I picked up four big chunks of ice that weighed about 50 pounds, brought them over to the snowbank, put them back, then I cleared my driveway with a shovel and my sidewalk.

1274
02:08:32,632 --> 02:08:47,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, after I was done with that, the same truck came speeding down the street, now I'm watching him as he's coming towards my house, and he's cascading and hitting every snowbank with a pickup truck, trying to widen the street, which is not gonna do it because it's iced.

1275
02:08:47,964 --> 02:08:48,685
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything is frozen.

1276
02:08:50,076 --> 02:08:52,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Same thing, and he's hitting it.

1277
02:08:53,079 --> 02:08:59,424
[SPEAKER_20]: I stepped out, he seen me, but his windshield was, on his passenger's side, was covered with snow.

1278
02:08:59,504 --> 02:09:00,806
[SPEAKER_20]: So he probably didn't really see me.

1279
02:09:01,306 --> 02:09:02,607
[SPEAKER_20]: Lifted his blade and he went around.

1280
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:04,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Went over the double yellow line.

1281
02:09:04,549 --> 02:09:07,271
[SPEAKER_20]: Hit the speed bump, put his blade back down.

1282
02:09:07,311 --> 02:09:08,032
[SPEAKER_20]: What speed bump?

1283
02:09:08,052 --> 02:09:12,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, whatever, the hump that's in the middle of the street, raised from the water damage.

1284
02:09:12,696 --> 02:09:13,517
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever you want to call it.

1285
02:09:15,018 --> 02:09:15,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now.

1286
02:09:16,999 --> 02:09:18,119
[SPEAKER_20]: He lifted his thing, all right?

1287
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:23,320
[SPEAKER_20]: He probably would have, if I didn't, if he didn't see me, he probably would have re-buried my driveway, all right?

1288
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:25,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not someone to complain.

1289
02:09:26,021 --> 02:09:30,262
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, this is not the first time this incident has happened in my house.

1290
02:09:31,082 --> 02:09:40,904
[SPEAKER_20]: A snowblower truck, City of Medford, the big one, came by in the snowstorms of 2015 and shot three feet of snow onto my sidewalk, okay?

1291
02:09:41,444 --> 02:09:45,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is about 25 feet long from neighbor to neighbor.

1292
02:09:46,814 --> 02:09:47,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1293
02:09:48,115 --> 02:09:49,016
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a bobcat.

1294
02:09:49,337 --> 02:09:50,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1295
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:52,860
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 52 years old, still runs.

1296
02:09:53,741 --> 02:09:55,163
[SPEAKER_20]: I had to move that snow.

1297
02:09:55,423 --> 02:09:55,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1298
02:09:55,723 --> 02:10:00,648
[SPEAKER_20]: So my question of these people who supervise them.

1299
02:10:00,848 --> 02:10:01,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1300
02:10:01,149 --> 02:10:02,410
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm not knocking them again.

1301
02:10:02,430 --> 02:10:04,112
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm going to get to this.

1302
02:10:05,813 --> 02:10:07,976
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm probably not the only resident that this has happened to.

1303
02:10:09,183 --> 02:10:14,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Since the water break pipe two months ago, we've had this hump in the middle of the street across from side to side.

1304
02:10:14,427 --> 02:10:20,992
[SPEAKER_20]: So the plow drivers do not come close to the curb as they're plowing because they want to avoid the hump.

1305
02:10:21,813 --> 02:10:27,938
[SPEAKER_20]: So now the snow banks are extended about two and a half to five feet out from the curb.

1306
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:29,859
[SPEAKER_20]: All right?

1307
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Before it, which extended to the snow bank.

1308
02:10:32,841 --> 02:10:34,563
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyway, before my house,

1309
02:10:36,143 --> 02:10:40,325
[SPEAKER_20]: The snow bank is about four feet away from the curb, right before my driveway.

1310
02:10:41,426 --> 02:10:45,008
[SPEAKER_20]: And they keep continuing to hit it, and it's not moving.

1311
02:10:48,129 --> 02:11:00,055
[SPEAKER_20]: I decided that I was going to move all the snow today, so I went 25 feet in front of my house, and I removed four feet of snow, 25 feet from my neighbors to my driveway, picked up the snow.

1312
02:11:00,316 --> 02:11:02,417
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a little snow farm in the backyard now.

1313
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:14,677
[SPEAKER_20]: listen I'm getting kind of like tired of this so you know again I don't know who's not accountable for this stuff and again I try to do my

1314
02:11:16,387 --> 02:11:16,647
[SPEAKER_20]: All right?

1315
02:11:17,087 --> 02:11:21,828
[SPEAKER_20]: But the patient thing, especially when, you know, you're not feeling well and you try to work a little bit.

1316
02:11:22,248 --> 02:11:27,029
[SPEAKER_20]: And I understand some of the guys that are in the municipality are not really experienced.

1317
02:11:27,169 --> 02:11:28,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of them might not be.

1318
02:11:28,469 --> 02:11:30,829
[SPEAKER_20]: They learn from being in the municipalities for years.

1319
02:11:30,869 --> 02:11:31,750
[SPEAKER_20]: I get that, OK?

1320
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,570
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of them, like, they're tired.

1321
02:11:34,610 --> 02:11:35,250
[SPEAKER_20]: They're overworked.

1322
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:36,170
[SPEAKER_20]: They just want to get home.

1323
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:36,850
[SPEAKER_20]: I get that, too.

1324
02:11:37,571 --> 02:11:39,211
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not disrespecting anybody, again.

1325
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:42,911
[SPEAKER_20]: DPW method, it's not my intention here.

1326
02:11:42,951 --> 02:11:46,152
[SPEAKER_20]: But at my age, my patients with incompetence gets a little mm-mm.

1327
02:11:46,798 --> 02:11:47,299
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?

1328
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:50,262
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can do my part to respect the city.

1329
02:11:50,723 --> 02:11:52,004
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like a little respect back.

1330
02:11:52,024 --> 02:11:53,106
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?

1331
02:11:53,126 --> 02:11:56,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you know, the method DW is one of the finest municipalities in the state.

1332
02:11:56,890 --> 02:12:01,296
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you guys know, but like I said, I just wanted to reiterate this.

1333
02:12:01,376 --> 02:12:01,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1334
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:04,631
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen and done some things, and I'm not perfect.

1335
02:12:05,091 --> 02:12:10,113
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been in this field of earth moving and snow removal for 35 years.

1336
02:12:10,733 --> 02:12:13,794
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've seen how it takes a storm, okay?

1337
02:12:14,574 --> 02:12:16,215
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is safety matter.

1338
02:12:16,635 --> 02:12:20,916
[SPEAKER_20]: And I mean, like, I like to do one job once and not have to do it again.

1339
02:12:20,956 --> 02:12:25,098
[SPEAKER_20]: And this kind of like peed me off a little bit, and I don't mean to use that phrase, but it kind of really did.

1340
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:31,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I did receive some other calls, and I did make Brian and Karen's aware of it.

1341
02:12:32,837 --> 02:12:36,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We will send a letter to him from the clerk.

1342
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't want to hurt anybody's jobs.

1343
02:12:38,381 --> 02:12:39,803
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no one's looking to hurt anybody.

1344
02:12:39,843 --> 02:12:41,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want anybody losing their jobs.

1345
02:12:41,864 --> 02:12:43,826
[SPEAKER_20]: I just know what I've seen and what I observed.

1346
02:12:44,186 --> 02:12:45,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be kind about that.

1347
02:12:46,047 --> 02:12:53,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the front of my house, 314 Winthrop Street, you go by there, anyone of you who's want to take a picture, I cleared four feet of snow from the curb.

1348
02:12:53,653 --> 02:12:54,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the curb is visible.

1349
02:12:55,515 --> 02:12:59,318
[SPEAKER_20]: So the next time around, if there's a snowstorm, you guys can come on in.

1350
02:12:59,758 --> 02:13:01,259
[SPEAKER_20]: But that bump has to be addressed.

1351
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:01,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1352
02:13:04,197 --> 02:13:11,939
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could, uh, send them to the commission occurrence.

1353
02:13:12,059 --> 02:13:12,619
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

1354
02:13:12,999 --> 02:13:24,341
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could just get an update from DPW with regards to the incident that happened on Winthrop street near three 14, but you said, I think it sounded like it went all the way down the street a couple of times.

1355
02:13:24,741 --> 02:13:29,482
[SPEAKER_15]: So we just can get a written update with regards to who, you know, if he can make sure he,

1356
02:13:30,049 --> 02:13:35,331
[SPEAKER_15]: knows who did it, if it was a contractor, if it was one of our personnel, and we make sure we do it right the next time.

1357
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:36,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1358
02:13:36,371 --> 02:13:37,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe the syncing.

1359
02:13:37,932 --> 02:13:38,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And the syncing.

1360
02:13:39,332 --> 02:13:44,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, the sync call there from the, probably won't get fixed till the spring.

1361
02:13:44,955 --> 02:13:45,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1362
02:13:46,515 --> 02:13:47,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

1363
02:13:48,056 --> 02:13:49,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Castaneri, Christian Street, Method.

1364
02:13:50,357 --> 02:13:54,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry sometimes that people are not satisfied with some of the work that's being done in the city.

1365
02:13:55,238 --> 02:13:59,440
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I'm not on either side of the party, so to speak.

1366
02:14:00,737 --> 02:14:08,921
[SPEAKER_16]: I must say, it seems to me that the DPW workers are understaffed, especially with these recent storms and stuff.

1367
02:14:11,142 --> 02:14:20,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe some of this free cash should be spent to hire some key positions in DPW, because they work really hard, and they're very tired.

1368
02:14:20,706 --> 02:14:21,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm gonna say.

1369
02:14:21,306 --> 02:14:28,009
[SPEAKER_06]: They spent a tough few days with the DPW, and they've done a lot of work keeping up with the snow.

1370
02:14:29,524 --> 02:14:30,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1371
02:14:31,285 --> 02:14:34,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1372
02:14:35,347 --> 02:14:41,389
[SPEAKER_19]: Last week at the state of the city, uh, Mrs. Burke finally let us know that she's going to have an access TV station.

1373
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:50,953
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm not the only one counselor to have to suffer that too, from these ignorant people that's supposed to get paid 30 grand a year to be here.

1374
02:14:51,634 --> 02:14:55,755
[SPEAKER_19]: That being said, she said there would be a TV station in late spring.

1375
02:14:55,775 --> 02:14:57,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Now I want you to hear the timeline.

1376
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:03,029
[SPEAKER_19]: March 26th, the last year at the school committee, Heidi Riccio said we'd have an access station in September.

1377
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:06,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Burke came up and disagreed with her and said, October.

1378
02:15:07,135 --> 02:15:10,521
[SPEAKER_19]: I visited Roy Belson and we're going to have it in January.

1379
02:15:11,153 --> 02:15:15,076
[SPEAKER_19]: February 8th, we hear it's going to be late spring, which I take as June.

1380
02:15:15,656 --> 02:15:18,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, this causes irreparable harm to the election 2017.

1381
02:15:19,179 --> 02:15:22,962
[SPEAKER_19]: For all you people running again, if you are running again, irreparable harm.

1382
02:15:22,982 --> 02:15:24,843
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't have the access that we have in Somerville.

1383
02:15:25,164 --> 02:15:30,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, our esteemed city solicitor, who made it clear that I'm the city solicitor tonight, he had to emphasize that.

1384
02:15:30,788 --> 02:15:31,909
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess people don't know that.

1385
02:15:32,509 --> 02:15:35,391
[SPEAKER_19]: He says this is obsolete in his office.

1386
02:15:35,411 --> 02:15:36,052
[SPEAKER_19]: And I said, Mark,

1387
02:15:39,035 --> 02:15:59,213
[SPEAKER_19]: computers teaching seniors computers as they do in Stoneham the ED brings the computers to the senior housing and the seniors that's obsolete and he goes oh I guess you're right well it's obsolete if you're Tom Brady and you're suspended by Roger Goodell for four weeks then Tom Brady's obsolete that's the standard our city solicitor uses it's self-serving

1388
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's censorship, it's pure censorship.

1389
02:16:02,185 --> 02:16:10,069
[SPEAKER_19]: Now what I propose, now that Mrs. Burke has said that the vocational school is getting the lion's share of the time for the access station.

1390
02:16:10,089 --> 02:16:13,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait a minute, they already get the educational monies.

1391
02:16:13,991 --> 02:16:15,612
[SPEAKER_19]: Why should they also get the access monies?

1392
02:16:15,932 --> 02:16:17,453
[SPEAKER_19]: And access TV we'll have at night.

1393
02:16:17,713 --> 02:16:22,616
[SPEAKER_19]: At night, Mrs. Burke, would you send your mother and your citizen up the ramp?

1394
02:16:24,058 --> 02:16:27,764
[SPEAKER_19]: at the vocational school at 7 o'clock at night, Mrs. Burke?

1395
02:16:28,084 --> 02:16:31,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you do that to my grandmother or anyone in my family?

1396
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:32,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Why would you do that, Mrs. Burke?

1397
02:16:33,053 --> 02:16:37,841
[SPEAKER_19]: We need what Mayor McGlynn's tribunal said, to have it in a central location.

1398
02:16:39,083 --> 02:16:40,064
[SPEAKER_19]: I proposed a van.

1399
02:16:40,424 --> 02:16:41,744
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 600 grand there.

1400
02:16:42,205 --> 02:16:45,286
[SPEAKER_19]: A van with two cameras that go over the cellular wires.

1401
02:16:45,546 --> 02:16:46,427
[SPEAKER_19]: This is very simple.

1402
02:16:46,467 --> 02:16:49,489
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't need cable anymore to do public access TV.

1403
02:16:49,789 --> 02:16:51,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You just need the cellular wires.

1404
02:16:51,109 --> 02:16:55,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I'm very proud of our council president, Mr. Caraviello, who said the library.

1405
02:16:55,912 --> 02:16:57,453
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with him wholeheartedly.

1406
02:16:57,533 --> 02:16:58,673
[SPEAKER_19]: And I talked to Barbara Kerr.

1407
02:16:58,934 --> 02:17:00,434
[SPEAKER_19]: We have some space for computers.

1408
02:17:01,095 --> 02:17:03,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Learn computers at the library, Mr. Rumley.

1409
02:17:03,736 --> 02:17:05,117
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what it was.

1410
02:17:05,657 --> 02:17:08,679
[SPEAKER_19]: bequeathed to the city for, for educational purposes.

1411
02:17:08,939 --> 02:17:15,284
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can put some computers up there, have a van, the van goes from the Chevalier to the library and roams around town.

1412
02:17:15,864 --> 02:17:19,146
[SPEAKER_19]: When Mr. Falco is speaking at a luncheon, we tape him.

1413
02:17:19,426 --> 02:17:22,348
[SPEAKER_19]: When Mr. Scarpelli is doing a sports event, we tape him.

1414
02:17:22,829 --> 02:17:28,493
[SPEAKER_19]: When Brianna Longo Curran has something, a function, we tape our elected officials.

1415
02:17:28,913 --> 02:17:29,813
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it's for.

1416
02:17:30,794 --> 02:17:31,875
[SPEAKER_19]: They have it in Somerville.

1417
02:17:32,135 --> 02:17:39,522
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I won an award on January 19th, Joe Kurtatone won an award and he said, you keep us politicians honest.

1418
02:17:39,842 --> 02:17:40,443
[SPEAKER_19]: That's from Joe.

1419
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:45,892
[SPEAKER_19]: And he was right and he got massive applause because he leaves us alone in Somerville.

1420
02:17:46,712 --> 02:17:47,312
[SPEAKER_19]: God bless him.

1421
02:17:47,373 --> 02:17:49,293
[SPEAKER_19]: He leaves us alone, love him or hate him.

1422
02:17:49,734 --> 02:17:50,994
[SPEAKER_19]: He did the right thing.

1423
02:17:51,434 --> 02:17:55,196
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he said to us, I guess you people are looking for more funding, giving me the award.

1424
02:17:55,516 --> 02:17:56,437
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm paraphrasing him.

1425
02:17:56,797 --> 02:17:58,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty funny, but he deserved it.

1426
02:17:58,617 --> 02:17:59,538
[SPEAKER_19]: He said the right thing.

1427
02:17:59,838 --> 02:18:02,159
[SPEAKER_19]: We're flourishing in Somerville, Mr. Rumley.

1428
02:18:02,439 --> 02:18:06,501
[SPEAKER_19]: We are flourishing in Malden where I'm a music director, Mr. Rumley.

1429
02:18:06,867 --> 02:18:09,008
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a music director in, in Malden.

1430
02:18:09,128 --> 02:18:10,808
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in Somerville.

1431
02:18:10,828 --> 02:18:19,051
[SPEAKER_19]: I have, I have these awards from Winchester and Somerville, Mr. Rumley, but our citizens, seniors, our children do not have these awards.

1432
02:18:19,371 --> 02:18:20,992
[SPEAKER_19]: They do not have our football games.

1433
02:18:21,532 --> 02:18:23,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Malden has our Thanksgiving game.

1434
02:18:25,313 --> 02:18:27,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been here talking for what?

1435
02:18:27,434 --> 02:18:28,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Since 2005, 2004 about public access issues.

1436
02:18:28,554 --> 02:18:28,954
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 13 years.

1437
02:18:32,331 --> 02:18:34,271
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you know that I'm serious.

1438
02:18:34,972 --> 02:18:39,353
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I have to file a class action suit with a lawyer and with some citizens, I intend to.

1439
02:18:39,653 --> 02:18:51,596
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna have access in the city, in the middle of town, if I have to build one, if I have to build a for-profit access center, and then we will fight for the agreement to put it over Channel 3 and whatever Channel Verizon gives us.

1440
02:18:52,016 --> 02:18:53,776
[SPEAKER_19]: We need this in this city.

1441
02:18:54,176 --> 02:19:01,738
[SPEAKER_19]: The children need it, the senior citizens need it, and you as elected officials need to talk to Mrs. Burke if she'll talk to you, if she's not evading you.

1442
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:07,783
[SPEAKER_19]: need to talk to her and say two hours for public access with a million dollars a year.

1443
02:19:08,463 --> 02:19:10,105
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not fair, Mrs. Burke.

1444
02:19:10,565 --> 02:19:12,186
[SPEAKER_19]: The vote has educational money.

1445
02:19:12,647 --> 02:19:14,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Let them use the educational money.

1446
02:19:14,308 --> 02:19:18,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Do not touch our access money because Mrs. Burke, I will see you in court.

1447
02:19:22,235 --> 02:19:22,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1448
02:19:23,276 --> 02:19:23,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1454
02:19:36,833 --> 02:19:46,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make it known that a long time part of this community, the Method Mercury, is closing their door officially.

1455
02:19:47,275 --> 02:19:53,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I think their paper has been in circulation in this city for some 40 or 50 years, or maybe even longer, Mr. President.

1456
02:19:54,297 --> 02:20:01,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were a good source of news for a number of years, and they are finally due to some financial hardships and so forth.

1457
02:20:01,796 --> 02:20:12,298
[SPEAKER_08]: closing their doors, and I want to wish the paper well and thank them for their many years of reporting on the city of Meffitt, and I wish them well, Mr. President.

1458
02:20:12,658 --> 02:20:13,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1459
02:20:14,118 --> 02:20:15,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1460
02:20:15,358 --> 02:20:16,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1461
02:20:16,499 --> 02:20:18,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Mox, for bringing that up.

1462
02:20:19,859 --> 02:20:29,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't, someone that I think that's kept so many highlights in our community, Meffitt rivalry, is Steve Frecker, someone, the editor, who

1463
02:20:29,488 --> 02:20:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: kept things going for so long when things were so tough, and he hung in there.

1464
02:20:33,069 --> 02:20:40,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate all his hard work and what he's done for Malden and the Mercury.

1465
02:20:40,752 --> 02:20:43,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wish him well.

1466
02:20:44,433 --> 02:20:44,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1467
02:20:44,933 --> 02:20:48,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Freckin was a good man, and I go back to the days of Al Fresa.

1468
02:20:48,874 --> 02:20:49,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Al Fresa.

1469
02:20:49,554 --> 02:20:50,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Al Fresa.

1470
02:20:50,875 --> 02:20:52,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Al was the power guy in town.

02:20:55,172 --> 02:20:55,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1473
02:20:56,072 --> 02:21:03,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just hoping that Coach Nestor's at home watching and maybe Coach Freck's available to come over to Memphis and help us out a little bit over here.

1474
02:21:03,376 --> 02:21:06,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we can, no, Steve's a great guy.

1475
