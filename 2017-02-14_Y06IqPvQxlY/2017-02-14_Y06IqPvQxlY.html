    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1711.949s">I</a>  want to wish everybody a happy holiday, and we'll do our best to get everybody home to be with their wives and husbands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1724.635s">17072,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that in light of the recent accidents, speeding and heavy trucking on Winthrop Street, that the City of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1734.304s">Increase</a>  enforcement in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1735.924s">Be</a>  it further resolved that a list be created with regard to the locations of our new speed monitor signs need to be placed in that Winthrop Street should be the first on the list once the monitors are received. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1750.428s">Councilor</a>  De Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1752.689s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1754.55s">It's</a>  nice we have the department here to maybe help us out on this one, but I've been getting complaints with regards to and concerns with regards to the speeding on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1764.318s">We</a>  always, you know, get a call or once a week or once a month with a different area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1769.82s">We</a>  have, you know, like every other town, city, we have people that speed, heavy trucking that shouldn't be going down certain streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1777.163s">And</a>  the last concerns that I've got were on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1780.124s">There</a>  was an accident, I think a week ago, two weeks ago, where a car went into a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1787.447s">I</a>  know there's an issue with regards to people trying to pass on that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1791.716s">And</a>  we did approve money last week for two speed limit monitoring signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1797.577s">I</a>  believe that was about 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1799.798s">Two</a>  of them hopefully will be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1801.418s">I</a>  believe they said in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1803.939s">So</a>  I would ask that, I would ask if maybe we can get, get our chief of police to maybe come up and just comment on this, let the citizens speak and voice their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1812.34s">They're</a>  the ones with children that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1814.501s">And</a>  you know, when a car goes into a home, it is a traumatic event for the whole, for the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1818.982s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1820.077s">If</a>  we could get those monitors out as soon as we get them and put one on Winthrop Street, hopefully to deter some speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1828.261s">I</a>  know we have our sergeant here of traffic and pick up the enforcement in the area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1833.383s">I</a>  think that would be greatly appreciated by the residents, especially in light of the recent accidents.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1838.085s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1838.405s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1840.086s">Leo</a>  A. Sacco, Jr., Police Chief, City of Medford, 227 Elm Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1846.168s">Winthrop</a>  Street's probably one of our more heavily enforced streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1849.895s">I</a>  get a lot of complaints from the Winchester residents who get stopped coming over the line into Medford, complaining about it, to the point that we've had to move the officers around a little bit more, and we'll put them right back on Wizard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1864.124s">Actually,</a>  a lot of it is self-directed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1866.225s">They</a>  go to where the crashes are, and then they perform the enforcement that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1871.568s">So</a>  that'll be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1872.669s">The</a>  speed monitors, as soon as they come in, we will put them out, and we will provide a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1880.124s">We</a>  had the first radar monitor people called and asked to be placed on the list for their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1885.927s">And</a>  we just check them off and move them a week or two and just move it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1890.469s">Now,</a>  if we have two, we'll be able to tell there's twice as much area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1895.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1896.492s">While</a>  I have you through the chair, the speed monitor signs that are stationary on Elm Street, for example, are those city of Medford property? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1904.896s">I</a>  think you said those DCR.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1907.977s">It's</a>  a DCR road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1909.962s">City</a>  of Medford bought those signs because of Rights Pawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1915.043s">And</a>  on any state road, we have concomitant jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1918.203s">We</a>  can perform enforcement as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1920.924s">If</a>  I could just amend my resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1923.044s">And</a>  for those stationary signs, if we could get the speed limit posted either above the move of traffic or below so that people know speed limit's 30 and I'm going 50, got to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1935.126s">I</a>  think that would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1936.307s">Because</a>  when you're coming down Elm, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1939.511s">30</a>  isn't posted for another several, several blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1942.493s">So</a>  just right on the pole, if we could get a small sign.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1944.654s">It'd</a>  be nice if we could get the state to, to lower that to 25, like the rest of the city streets.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1949.997s">Yes,</a>  that would be even better.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1952.599s">I</a>  think we have a few citizens that want to, uh, councilor, um, I, chief Sacco actually just took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1959.643s">I</a>  was just going to ask if the city had jurisdiction over, uh, Elm street relative to the recent ordinance that, uh, I mean the recent change that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1966.397s">Traffic</a>  Commission put in place with thickly settled areas and their speed limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1970.139s">I</a>  was wondering if that would apply there, but it's a state controlled roadway, so I don't think it will.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1973.22s">State</a>  controlled roadway, we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1974.701s">But</a>  we do have a jurisdiction for enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1977.742s">So</a>  whether it's 25 or 30, we can still cite for the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1982.344s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1982.944s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1983.585s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1984.165s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1990.908s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1992.189s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1992.529s">Daniel</a>  O'Reilly, 707 Winthrop Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=1996.471s">I</a>  ended up voicing my concern to the council last week or the week before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2000.994s">I</a>  forgot, I've been busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2003.355s">But</a>  Brianna and George both responded to me and it made me feel better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2009.778s">I</a>  know Chief Sacco and the rest of the police department are doing what they can with the amounts of police officers that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2019.823s">It</a>  is a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2021.702s">Other</a>  than this accident, we know the mailboxes at the corner of Winford Way and Winthrop Street have been hit several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2031.009s">Now</a>  there are bollards on the sidewalk, so you've got to walk around the bollards to get onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2038.434s">But</a>  particularly last week, as I was pulling into my driveway, taking a right, a vehicle was behind me, tailgating me, and tried to surpass me on the right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2048.541s">It's</a>  not a weekly occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2051.884s">or</a>  a monthly occurrence, it's a daily occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2055.085s">And</a>  the speeding is a lot, and to the point where I don't want to take my little girls outside and go for a walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2065.588s">So</a>  any other in Medford, yes, it is heavily used. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2071.589s">I</a>  would like to see a little care towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2075.731s">However,</a>  I can, if there's anything I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2080.112s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2081.225s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2082.185s">I</a>  know the chief has had on many different occasions to slow that down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2090.268s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Long-Term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2097.611s">Come</a>  forward, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2100.913s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2247.299s">Mr.</a>  President, is the petitioner present?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2254.841s">If</a>  you could come to the podium, please.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2260.607s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2262.409s">Andrew</a>  La Fuente, 429 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2264.832s">My</a>  address is 137 Sycamore in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2267.555s">As</a>  I was saying, I got diagnosed with a muscle disease, so I have to hold my neck. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2270.298s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2273.614s">If</a>  you could just give us a brief synopsis on what the request is, of course.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2277.835s">So,</a>  um, I, I'm asking for four banners and brackets projecting off of the building in addition to an awning on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2284.877s">Uh,</a>  I think it's important to understand the signage that he has now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2288.238s">Um,</a>  it's just a hard sign projecting off the building, but it's old. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2291.858s">He</a>  actually asked me to take it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2293.919s">Um,</a>  the problem is that folks are having trouble because he's on the second floor, the second level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2299.043s">Even</a>  finding his business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2300.844s">The</a>  reason I'm proposing a projecting sign is because it's so high up and cars move relatively quickly there There's not a light to stop Even if he did a flat sign folks would drive by it without even recognizing the sign And his business has actually dipped a little bit obviously with my businesses He's seen a little bit of a decline as well, which is why I'm proposing it this way <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2323.771s">So</a>  how far do they project off the building itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2326.353s">So</a>  the brackets themselves, it's 36 inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2329.135s">The</a>  banners will be 30 inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2330.656s">So</a>  three inches in on, on either side to allow for the, uh, the threaded bolts to tighten the banners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2335.82s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2336.421s">And</a>  you plan on moving, removing the awnings? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2338.462s">Is</a>  that, is that going to?</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2339.923s">So</a>  there's a blue awning on the right side that goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2342.465s">That's</a>  coming down and a new one is going up that just says entrance with his logo and 429 High Street, just to identify it for people to know to go in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2350.789s">Because</a>  the front of the building has two awnings that belong to the preschool.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2355.451s">Mr.</a>  President, based on the information we received tonight and this particular location, I find no problem with the approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2363.696s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2366.237s">On</a>  the second of Councilor Marks' approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2371.197s">Second</a>  on council.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2371.938s">Marks</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2380.784s">Thank</a>  you, president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2381.805s">Um,</a>  curvy yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2383.126s">What's</a>  the width of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2384.266s">It</a>  looks like you're looking for four, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2386.628s">For</a>  the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2387.869s">And</a>  so five total. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2389.33s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2390.091s">So</a>  what's the width of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2391.492s">You</a>  think you need all four?</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2393.193s">Uh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2394.714s">So,</a>  uh, initially when I spoke to the owner, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2397.986s">He</a>  actually asked for six, and I thought six was too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2401.527s">The</a>  reason I'm proposing four is because of the way the windows are set up, you can keep it so it comes in 12 feet on either side with nothing, and then it's one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2411.81s">Less,</a>  it would look foolish, because I believe the width of the building is like 58 or 59 feet wide, so it's pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2418.872s">And</a>  the spacing between each of the banners, I believe, is around 12 or 13 feet, so it gives proper visibility.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2425.594s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2427.856s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2429.677s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2430.718s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2432.68s">The</a>  design that's been presented to us, Mr. President, has a proportionality that seems seemly for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2441.066s">In</a>  the lack of anybody here in opposition to this from the most active and organized business district in the city, I second approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2450.093s">Second</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2451.554s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2452.334s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2453.355s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2453.935s">I</a>  mean all those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2455.076s">None.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2455.276s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2456.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2460.44s">17-0-7-4.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2460.6s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Method Mass, to address the council about two specialized police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2473.825s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2475.426s">Gene</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2479.427s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2482.008s">In</a>  light of the fact that we have the fire department here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2485.467s">And</a>  the police department, I'd just like to say that these are people that don't toot their own horns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2492.253s">And</a>  both of them are needed and necessary by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2498.679s">And</a>  the fire department does a whole lot of things that we don't really give notice to until we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2506.345s">In</a>  nursing homes and when a patient <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2508.61s">a</a>  lot of the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2509.79s">We</a>  called the fire department because the aides couldn't pick them up and put them in the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2513.331s">They</a>  rolled them on a stretcher and lifted them up, four people, into the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2517.773s">Somebody</a>  had a flood in their basement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2521.614s">A</a>  little old lady friend of mine called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2523.994s">I</a>  went over there and I called the fire department and instantly they knew how to cut off the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2528.676s">They</a>  do a whole lot of things that we need to appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2531.637s">So</a>  I just want to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2535.241s">Okay,</a>  so I first need to acknowledge the great victory of the council on behalf of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2542.086s">We</a>  were instrumental in locking up the built out of the new police station, this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2549.591s">This</a>  was no small accomplishment and the city will be much better off for it and with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2556.415s">I</a>  would also like to thank the mayor for acknowledging the importance of this new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2561.138s">I</a>  am sure that this was not an easy political sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2564.345s">and</a>  shows strength on her part. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2566.946s">I</a>  would also like to thank the newcomers in the more liberal establishment in this city who met the majority of the city halfway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2574.907s">I</a>  know that some of their expectations for city resources have been delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2582.509s">I</a>  thank you for your sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2584.749s">The</a>  police officers have just gotten a moral boost, morale boost, that will help them do their jobs better for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2592.931s">And</a>  to the police officers, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2594.656s">I</a>  now hold you more accountable to do the right thing, and when you are wrong, I expect better from you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2601.2s">For</a>  the last five years, I have fought on behalf of you from this podium and beyond, and I expect you to thank me by doing right by the people of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2614.007s">And</a>  finally, I thank the whole city for backing our police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2618.329s">Now</a>  for a more sensitive but necessary request of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2621.771s">Since</a>  September 11th, 2001, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2624.212s">We</a>  have been in a continuous war with a perverse version of Islam. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2628.575s">And</a>  even more importantly, we have been hit here at home by jihadist-inspired lone wolves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2635.439s">While</a>  we need to continue our fight, we must also be acutely aware of the innocent Muslims that have been and are caught up in the crossfire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2647.09s">As</a>  recently as January 29th, 2017, a mosque in Quebec, Canada was attacked by a hate-filled white man who equated Muslim with terrorist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2657.441s">Alex</a>  Bissonette murdered six innocent victims and injured another eight others while they were worshiping God. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2665.369s">Quebec</a>  is only five hours away from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2668.467s">An</a>  equivalency would be Boston to New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2671.41s">Quebec</a>  borders Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2675.193s">If</a>  you think this could not happen here, you are mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2678.756s">We</a>  as a city have an obligation to defend our Muslim population against directed violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2685.202s">The</a>  problem we need to solve as a city is the misinterpretation or the misperception that all Muslims are guilty by association, which by definition is both <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2700.574s">We</a>  have two objectives, to protect this religious minority from physical harm and to engage young Muslims in a way that prevents them from growing alienated, leaving them susceptible to radicalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2713.46s">While</a>  it is easier for most of us to place Muslims in a box, it is not only unfair to them, it is unsafe for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2722.384s">Many</a>  Muslim men and women have risked their lives in our war on terror and are living in the states because of that sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2730.311s">Quebec</a>  never saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2732.772s">I</a>  don't want Medford to miss the signs of religious hostility which can translate into violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2738.433s">Just</a>  because we do not hear about the resentment doesn't mean it isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2743.654s">I</a>  am therefore recommending the following, that we hire three new female police officers who will specialize in all racial harassment with an emphasis on Muslim sensitivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2755.217s">I</a>  would prefer four for this task force, but I will take what I can get. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2758.478s">Why</a>  women? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2759.468s">This</a>  role will require trust in order to be effective, and men are less likely to gain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2764.39s">Intuition</a>  is women's other long suit and irreplaceable skill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2768.813s">Women</a>  are also less likely to be called a racist, which male officers often fear being called this career-ending name. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2778.377s">Women</a>  can also reach women and children in the community in ways that male officers are unable to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2785.521s">I</a>  believe at least one female officer who is also a mother <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2788.881s">would</a>  be another asset to this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2791.242s">I</a>  am recommending at least two black women to work side by side with one white woman, because frankly, white women wouldn't be seen by a Muslim woman as having anywhere near the same experience as them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2803.089s">The</a>  department must also have access to a female contact who is considered an expert in their culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2810.433s">This</a>  expert would be hired as an independent contractor when needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2814.515s">These</a>  three women officers will be first and foremost sworn officers <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2818.125s">and</a>  will be counted in the total number of rank and file police personnel, but with a side specialty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2824.688s">I</a>  recommend them as new hires because as you know, we are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2830.17s">I</a>  don't want to take any more testosterone off the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2833.391s">If</a>  we were fully staffed, I might have suggested just switching them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2845.982s">For</a>  those who would like to see women veterans hired, I applaud that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2851.105s">And</a>  if the city finds it in their budget to complete a proper search, I agree that this is the best route to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2856.849s">Finding</a>  only two women on the Eastern Seaboard search is very achievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2864.213s">Before</a>  you argue that this does not conform to the civil service exam process, I don't want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2870.077s">This</a>  country is at war and local police departments are now faced with frontline combat responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2876.02s">that</a>  the military discriminates all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2878.783s">An</a>  applicant can be too short for the Marines, too tall for the Navy, too fat for the Army, and too dumb for the Air Force. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2885.028s">It</a>  is time for civilian police departments to catch up with that reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2890.633s">Ignore</a>  me and innocent people get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2893.876s">Without</a>  this new tool for a new era, our police department can't protect this religious minority, who, given the current climate, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2901.801s">is</a>  reasonably at risk of receiving threats of harm, if not harm itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2906.844s">It</a>  is our duty as a city to provide this protection with this new technique. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2912.367s">And</a>  also, I'd just like to say that the Marines have also reinstituted their female engagement teams, which was very successful in Iraq and Afghanistan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2926.035s">They</a>  reinstituted that program in 2015 because it was so successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=2931.835s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3094.622s">President</a>  members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3095.942s">My</a>  name is Mark Brumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3097.123s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor and I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3101.842s">What's</a>  before you tonight, similar to other papers in terms of form, is a loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3108.326s">And</a>  it's a loan order for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3111.427s">The</a>  purpose would be to provide architectural services for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3117.491s">And</a>  of course, it also says for any costs which are incidental or related thereto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3122.594s">The</a>  authorization is based on, under municipal finance, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3127.433s">Massachusetts</a>  General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 7, Subparagraph 7, which allows a municipality to bond for architectural services, for plans for a project, for a period of up to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3143.323s">Now,</a>  if the project ultimately was going forward to be constructed, then that would roll into another period of time, which deals with the construction of a project, which would be 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3155.021s">What's</a>  before you this evening is a request for the first reading, like so many different papers that come before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3162.146s">It</a>  requires three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3164.108s">The</a>  first would be your approval this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3168.03s">That</a>  would require at minimum four votes of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3172.053s">The</a>  next reading would be advertisements in a newspaper by the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3176.476s">And</a>  that usually happens about two, sometimes three weeks later, depending upon circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3181.822s">And</a>  then it comes back before the council no earlier than 10 days after the last publication vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3190.588s">And</a>  that would require five votes in order for it to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3196.051s">So</a>  what's occurring tonight is the first part of a step towards the architectural services to design a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3205.037s">As</a>  was stated last week by the mayor, both at a press conference and also during the state of the city address, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3212.49s">She</a>  has determined that the appropriate site for the construction of a new police station would be on the plot of land where the police station is right now, over in the area to the northern part of that lot, which would allow ultimately for the police station to be taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3235.347s">But</a>  this would be the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3236.607s">But</a>  I think the best way to describe this paper tonight is <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3240.695s">The</a>  only determination that has been made is this is, not that it's the best imagery to give by way of analysis, but this is a launching pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3252.344s">It's</a>  not a landing spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3254.025s">This</a>  is the beginning of many different steps which would be necessary in order to actually see the construction of a police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3261.971s">So</a>  that is the paper that's before you tonight, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3267.772s">And</a>  I have colleagues with me this evening, including the chief of police, to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3275.177s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Solis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3275.898s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3279.32s">Councilor</a>  Alongo-Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3280.581s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3281.722s">If</a>  we could maybe educate the public on our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3285.164s">We</a>  did meet on this from six to seven.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3287.346s">If</a>  we could go over maybe what's... We did have a meeting of the council of the whole earlier for about an hour and 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3294.19s">That</a>  was because that's why you had a delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3297.049s">and</a>  the council meeting starting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3298.991s">Uh,</a>  we've heard from both the police and the firemen in regards to their concerns, uh, in regards to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3306.296s">And,</a>  uh, I think they're all duly noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3308.798s">Um,</a>  and I say it was, and we, and the committee, uh, we'll report it out this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3315.784s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3319.346s">We</a>  will adopt the committee report, uh, sometime this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3323.109s">But</a>  I said, uh, I think everyone had a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3326.098s">to</a>  air their concerns, and again, this is a point, if anyone else has concerns, this is an opportunity to air them again.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3334.501s">About</a>  it last week, with regards to trying to get all boards and commissions and meetings publicized, because it would be nice if we could address the ten concerns and questions we had.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3347.125s">That</a>  can just be a starting point, because I know... We'd have to report it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3353.126s">We</a>  have not reported it out of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3355.938s">I'll</a>  yield.</p>

    <p>[2hZdDePQb_Y_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3357.979s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3359.2s">Bill</a>  O'Brien, president, local 10 32 officer three 40 Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3362.762s">I</a>  know we had a lot of discussion earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3364.863s">Uh,</a>  just want to inform the public at large, um, that, uh, we were here to support the, the, the, the building of a police station, but we're here to also address more importantly, our concerns about what's going to happen to our training facility, uh, storage area, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3380.731s">So</a>  I know we're not going to have much of a discussion, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3383.485s">I</a>  just want to reiterate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3385.466s">Thank</a>  you, councils, for looking into this, and hopefully we can go forward and come up with a better master plan that's currently being discussed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3392.632s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3393.593s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. O'Brien. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3397.355s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehnan.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3399.637s">I'd</a>  like to report the committee notes out so that we can further discuss any questions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3405.482s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehnan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3408.828s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3410.669s">And</a>  I think Councilor Lungo-Koehn took the words right out of my mouth in terms of attempting to report the committee report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3418.39s">However,</a>  procedurally, it's going to be very difficult because we have this paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3422.711s">Ultimately,</a>  the committee report included a number of items, one of which would be to include retrofitting the existing structure to expand for the allowance of fire service expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3436.695s">The</a>  next item would be a cost <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3438.558s">breakdown</a>  as to the whole entire cost of the total project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3442.94s">Um,</a>  a breakdown of our bonded indebtedness at this point in time going out, I believe 15 years Councilor, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3450.343s">Whatever</a>  the life of the box or 30 years, I believe, um, discuss and look at the feasibility of a combined police and fire department in the creation of a construction of a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3460.527s">Um,</a>  a listing of all the locations that were examined to establish, uh, the, the selected location for where this structure is going to be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3468.778s">Um,</a>  when the fire department and the fire chief knew and, um, that the administration established a working group requiring, uh, that members of the fire service and members of the administration work to address some of the concerns with the training academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3483.186s">Um,</a>  and also that, um, the training academy is an important and vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3488.025s">asset</a>  that we have here in the community and that that's something that we'd like to see continue as we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3492.646s">Um,</a>  I believe that is reflective of, um, issues that were brought up in the committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3497.067s">Mr.</a>  President, just, uh, for an informational purpose.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3500.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3501.229s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3501.649s">And</a>  if I'm leaving anything out, one of the information Councilor Dello Russo, uh, Councilor Knight had made a two point, uh, uh, intervention into our, uh, committee of the whole meetings, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3518.32s">proceedings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3518.96s">I</a>  believe one was to establish a working group, and the second was to recommend an examination, if I'm remembering this correctly, an examination into maintaining a portion of the existing building in the architectural drawings to maintain the training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3541.071s">Did</a>  I understand, through the Chair, the Councilor correctly?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3544.592s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3545.393s">Yes,</a>  you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3546.928s">former</a>  Mr. President, and also discussion of grant funding for the construction of a new training academy underneath the Urban Area Securities Initiative grant program that the federal government has put out.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3559.016s">The</a>  President Yes, hopefully the previous administration didn't, in their dispersal of tens of millions of dollars in the final days of their administration, hopefully some of that money wasn't sent to the Middle East.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3574.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3574.904s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3576.005s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3577.445s">I</a>  just wanted to take an opportunity to go over the salient point, the points that were brought up in the committee report, Mr. President, because procedurally we weren't able to adopt that report at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3586.71s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3587.03s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3590.512s">Any</a>  other discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3593.413s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3596.595s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3598.916s">And</a>  I can appreciate the fact that some members of this council <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3603.217s">uh,</a>  would be interested in retrofitting, uh, the fire station, uh, if we do move forward with the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3610.943s">And</a>  I just want to call to the council's attention the, uh, report that was commissioned by this city back in January, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3620.95s">It's</a>  entitled, uh, method, police and fire station feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3625.954s">It</a>  was prepared by Dunman Sweeney, uh, architects, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3630.69s">And</a>  I won't go through the hundreds of pages of this report, but I will go to the conclusion and recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3638.156s">And</a>  this was commissioned, I believe the study was $100,000 to see what we should do with our police and fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3647.783s">And</a>  the conclusion and recommendation, Mr. President, states, based on our analysis, evaluation of the existing facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3657.075s">amount</a>  space needed by the departments, and weighing the cost and code implications of renovation, it is our recommendation that all buildings should be replaced with new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3671.483s">Our</a>  recommendation is based on the information above, but the following factors are most prominent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3677.687s">And</a>  then it goes on to state, Mr. President, and this is to address the retrofit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3682.309s">It</a>  says building a separate police department where the academy building now stands <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3687.228s">may</a>  appear on face to be the best alternative to building entirely new facilities, given the cost savings between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3696.172s">However,</a>  the savings would not be sufficient to renovate the fire station to meet code in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3704.036s">Thus,</a>  the total cost to the city for the combined work at both stations over time would be far greater than any of the options presented in this study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3714.601s">Plus,</a>  this option would result <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3717.109s">utilize</a>  space for the fire department in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3720.971s">So</a>  the report that we commissioned, and maybe the mayor doesn't like to look at reports that the city spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on, but states quite clearly, Mr. President, that a retrofit of the fire department, which I'm hearing now, is not cost effective and in the long term would be cheaper to build <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3741.157s">brand</a>  new facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3743.078s">And</a>  that is the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3744.059s">Anyone</a>  can go look. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3745.26s">It's</a>  online. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3745.96s">There</a>  should be a copy, I assume, within the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3750.444s">But</a>  that's Donovan Sweeney that we contracted with in January 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3754.967s">So</a>  as was recommended by this council in the committee of the whole meeting, is that we also view, Mr. President, the fact that we want a combined center. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3768.813s">And</a>  I think that's extremely important to discuss it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3772.856s">For</a>  whatever reason, it's cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3776.339s">For</a>  whatever reason, it doesn't pan out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3778.4s">At</a>  least we have the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3780.542s">At</a>  least we offered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3782.223s">I</a>  remember in the past when we went through with different bonding issues, we'd get four or five different recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3789.228s">And</a>  the council would sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3790.869s">In</a>  particular, I'm talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3792.707s">the</a>  schools we went through, the science spending for the schools, the pool, some of the larger cost items in the community, we had three or four items that we'd have to pick from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3805.697s">Say</a>  this is option one, this is option two, this is option three. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3809.64s">Tonight</a>  we're being presented with option mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3814.403s">That's</a>  the mayor's option. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3816.145s">And</a>  we're hearing tonight that, you know what, let's get the ball rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3820.993s">This</a>  is $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3822.295s">And</a>  as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President, uh, if we waited a few more weeks to sit down Russian about a combined center that addresses both police and fire, that building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3837.24s">The</a>  conditions on both sides are no different, although I agree the fire probably because of their own upkeep has kept the building up a little different than the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3847.766s">But</a>  both buildings are used seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President, and we got a lot of use out of them for the past 50-something years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3857.432s">A</a>  lot of use with very little spending in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3860.974s">Now's</a>  the time to rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3864.713s">You</a>  have the support, and I'm not gonna speak for members of this council, you have support of this council, Mr. President, to move forward, I believe, with the combined facility that benefits both police and fire, as well as the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3879.523s">So</a>  I'm hoping tonight, Mr. President, that we're able to at least put this off for a few weeks so we can have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3887.867s">with</a>  the administration about some of the things we brought up tonight, whether it's the training academy, whether it's what's going to take place with the old station, if we build a new station at the training academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3899.555s">These</a>  are the things I think we need answered, Mr. President, before we hastily move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3904.315s">And</a>  I know people aren't going to like hastily, but guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3907.137s">We</a>  got this last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3908.758s">It's</a>  been six days and we got nothing last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3912.481s">We</a>  were presented with a fact sheet tonight that you read off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3916.084s">So</a>  we have not received anything until today, really, on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3920.087s">So</a>  I don't see anything hastily about waiting a few weeks, going over, seeing what our options are about including this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3929.113s">It</a>  makes fiscal sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3932.015s">It</a>  makes sense from a <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3935.152s">public</a>  safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3937.053s">And,</a>  um, that would be my recommendation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3939.794s">So,</a>  uh, I hope we can all get together and not divide us, but say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3944.855s">We</a>  want a meeting with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3947.036s">I'm</a>  very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3948.177s">The</a>  mayor's not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3949.877s">We</a>  invited her, as you know, you invited her to the community, the whole meeting and a very, and a, a, a, a potential bonding of over $22 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3960.988s">that</a>  the mayor didn't see fit to come to our meeting to discuss her proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3966.43s">This</a>  is not the city solicitors, chief of staff proposal, and it's not a treasurer's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3972.111s">It's</a>  the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3975.352s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3977.133s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to hear what, uh, you know, people in the audience have to say and then so, but my recommendation would be a full and thorough explanation why we can't move forward on a combined center, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3991.076s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3997.699s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=3999.02s">Good</a>  evening, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4000.141s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, former member of the Zargas body, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4006.044s">I'd</a>  like to go over some points that were brought up before the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4009.045s">The</a>  whole meeting wasn't televised, but it was probably a misreading on your part, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4014.548s">It's</a>  not a 3,500 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4016.769s">It's</a>  a 35,000 square foot building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4019.51s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4020.271s">Number</a>  two, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4021.379s">uh,</a>  in the report, it states it's going to be three story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4024.76s">And</a>  our good friend, the city solicitor has been quoted by saying that the mayor said she has decided where the building is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4031.782s">The</a>  sad part about this whole commentary is the mayor is proposing two and a half million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4038.743s">And</a>  we don't even know what the contingencies might be proposal here for the city of method. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4043.305s">This</a>  present city council, this will be the largest financial bonding that you folks are going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4048.994s">And</a>  because of that, and because of that, I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4051.955s">The</a>  mayor should be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4053.236s">This</a>  is her proposal because when she announced when she was campaigning, it would be seven to eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4059.158s">Howard</a>  got sped up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4060.698s">I</a>  don't know, but thankfully because of the police department going out there and, uh, and, and having their demonstrations and speaking up and folks coming forward saying it's about time, but there are some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4072.782s">Counsel</a>  Lungo-Koehn is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4074.583s">You</a>  don't have any report in front of you that talks about dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4077.628s">places,</a>  people that you met with, whoever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4080.33s">And</a>  if some of the landowners that were supposed to have met with the city did not want their names mentioned, you could go into an executive session and that would protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4089.175s">At</a>  least you would have an idea who they were, where the locations might've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4093.778s">There</a>  wasn't one police union representative committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4098.381s">So</a>  what does that tell you there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4099.822s">Where</a>  was their involvement on this particular location for whatever it might be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4105.08s">The</a>  other part about it is the city council, you folks had no involvement at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4108.463s">You're</a>  hearing about it for the first time last week and at 10 o'clock last week, you get a phone call or an email saying there's a press announcement the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4116.349s">That's</a>  great for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4118.35s">This</a>  administration was going to be so transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4121.353s">It's</a>  about as transparent as this rug on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4124.996s">More</a>  importantly, going forward, the fire chief not being involved, not even being consulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4130.82s">I</a>  can't answer for the chief of police because I did speak with him last Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4134.767s">at</a>  the council meeting and there was going to be an announcement the next day, whether he knew what the announcement was or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4140.949s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4141.789s">We</a>  didn't get to the finality of it, but if the fire department, like I have a particular purpose to this thing, then it should be brought into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4151.052s">Now</a>  let's talk about the bonding, because if you get into the Dun and Sweeney report, which is dated January, 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4157.767s">as</a>  Councilor Marks has alluded to, there is a funding mechanism here that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4162.369s">And</a>  the funding mechanism that needs to be addressed is that if you leave that fire department alone, the way it is right now, and just go with a police department, you have a bonding situation for which this city council is going to be paying for whatever the rate's going to be to bond the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4177.795s">But</a>  over the next 20 years in the life of the bond, that Medford Fire Department and its headquarters are not going to be up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4184.138s">mechanically,</a>  electrically, and whatever else is needed by the standards as we go further in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4189.9s">So</a>  to take into consideration the possibility of having a police and a fire department put together or mixing the two together, how these two buildings can merge themselves together, how you can add or subtract to it, that should be the discussion before you say the final, the police department, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4208.21s">Isn't</a>  it best to sit down and discuss these things rather than she made the decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4213.581s">Who</a>  is she to make the decision with the taxpayer's money and that she puts you guys in a corner and girls in a corner? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4220.421s">boxing</a>  you in, like a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4222.543s">If</a>  you don't vote for it, that means you're against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4224.384s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4225.845s">What's</a>  true is you should be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4228.027s">We're</a>  all part of this, whether we're a taxpaying citizen, an elected official, the mayor, whoever we're be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4235.133s">But</a>  more importantly, you have fire and police out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4238.276s">And</a>  to some degree, they are divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4240.037s">Because</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4241.178s">The</a>  fire department is starting to realize things that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4244.241s">Just</a>  because there's a $2,500,000 inclusion in the capital <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4248.524s">program,</a>  what does that say? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4250.247s">Where</a>  is that going? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4251.329s">How</a>  does that affect them on their side of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4254.615s">You</a>  just gave over $300,000 a few weeks ago for their turnout gear, but they've only got one set of washing machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4262.243s">6,</a>  3, and 2, if I understand those bond houses, 6, 3, and 2 would like to have washing machines that are very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4270.489s">Well,</a>  why wasn't that brought up as a subject matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4273.491s">Is</a>  that going to be something that's going to be a challenge? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4276.092s">Well,</a>  I would hope not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4277.553s">You</a>  pay for one thing, but you don't pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4280.575s">Another</a>  thing is there is absolutely no detailed analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4285.488s">The</a>  city treasurer is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4286.909s">She</a>  has not presented, neither has the mayor presented you a detailed analysis of bonds that are going to be terminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4293.772s">And</a>  by those bonds terminating, the city can just transfer themselves over to paying the same amount that those bonds were paying that would pay for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4303.077s">I</a>  want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4304.558s">As</a>  a taxpayer and as an elected official, you need to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4308.9s">Because</a>  is the city saying your taxes won't go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4313.462s">Your</a>  rates won't go up because of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4316.207s">And</a>  where is all the grants from the federal government and the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4320.831s">The</a>  city of Malden got $9 million in grants before they started their project to build an $18 million building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4327.016s">Where</a>  is the one grant from the federal government or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4330.959s">Has</a>  anyone received one? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4332.381s">Have</a>  you become aware of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4334.282s">You</a>  don't even know if they've even applied for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4336.723s">It</a>  would have nice to know that if you had a sense of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4340.285s">And</a>  if you, Mr. President, being the leader of this body, had the mayor invited you in at least at minimum to have a conversation about this, you could at least bring some information back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4350.072s">But</a>  she shut you out too, which is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4353.435s">You</a>  can't do it by yourself, your own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4357.497s">You</a>  know, you get elected to do a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4361.982s">transparent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4362.783s">You</a>  talk about being independent voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4365.424s">How</a>  can you be an independent voice if you shut out, if you're not part of the situation, you're not part of the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4372.49s">You</a>  know, we spent dollars for a Denham and Sweeney's report in January of 2013 that was presented to the council in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4382.056s">You</a>  had a committee of the whole meeting where there were a lot of issues that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4385.479s">And</a>  I don't think any one fireman or any one policewoman <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4389.539s">police</a>  man or lady, excuse me, or a fire lady and a fireman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4393.2s">I</a>  don't think they want to see any division between and amongst themselves, because I certainly don't want it, and I don't think the city needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4399.082s">But</a>  this is crunch time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4401.043s">You're</a>  talking about a subject matter that's now involving both fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4406.565s">And</a>  unless the city administration says that the fire department is not going to be involved in this, this is just a police issue, a police building issue, and a police department issue, then I think you have a problem, because the problem is now presenting itself before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4421.075s">The</a>  report talks about a merger of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4424.157s">It</a>  talks about the irregular space that you have over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4426.999s">It</a>  also talks about having a minimum of three and a half acres to have a modern, up-to-date fire and police department that can take you into the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4435.712s">You're</a>  only dealing with more than two and a half acres of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4438.633s">So</a>  your space requirements are already confirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4441.434s">And</a>  to build a three and a half story building, who made that determination? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4445.036s">Where's</a>  the parking facility going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4447.097s">And</a>  if you're going to have a schematic design, you talk about something that's going to take place over the next six to eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4452.659s">Six</a>  to eight months are going to prove to be what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4454.339s">You're</a>  going to go out there for a design. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4455.62s">But</a>  to get to the six to eight months, you guys have to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4458.641s">You're</a>  going to have to agree and disagree on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4460.582s">And</a>  you're going to have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4461.742s">And</a>  you're going to have to have people input, your input. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4466.296s">Taxpayers'</a>  input. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4467.677s">It's</a>  their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4469.478s">It's</a>  the taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4471.158s">And</a>  I can guarantee that every single police officer and every single fireperson can come up to this podium and say that they need what they need to do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4480.243s">They</a>  should not be denied, but they should have the option of knowing that every conceivable option was presented and discussed and voted upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4488.627s">It</a>  wasn't squirreled into a particular corner, a particular group, on a particular day, and then we'll talk about the next issue on another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4496.432s">The</a>  stupidest way to waste money is to spend it recklessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4500.614s">And</a>  right now, I think you would be doing that before you sit down and take into consideration all the needs that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4507.256s">Why</a>  would the capital improvement program have a $2.5 million inclusion in the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4513.05s">without</a>  you folks knowing about it, but you're dealing with a $2 million requirement to go out there and have a schematic design, and then a $20 million to build a building, and how do you know if that building, in effect, is gonna have any effect at all on the fire department, or vice versa? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4526.914s">You</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4528.495s">You</a>  know, we live in a great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4530.355s">We</a>  have a great group of people in here, and we all wanna do the right thing, the best thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4535.637s">But</a>  we need to be smart, and we need to be inclusive, and we need to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4540.197s">understanding</a>  that we all can't think the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4543.199s">But</a>  if you can't think the same way without having an opportunity to talk about it, you'll never be able to accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4550.062s">Today</a>  is Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4551.943s">And</a>  I wish you all a happy Valentine's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4554.524s">But</a>  with the white Christmas lights outside, I'm a little bit confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4558.026s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4561.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4562.248s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4574.405s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4578.589s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4580.03s">I</a>  don't want to repeat myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4583.553s">I</a>  know we had a lengthy 6 to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4585.795s">meeting,</a>  but just reiterate probably a couple things, so forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4592.701s">I</a>  think it's a really terrible situation that we've been put in tonight, that our two departments have been put in tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4599.94s">And</a>  I think that flows from the lack of transparency in the closed door meetings with regards to this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4606.524s">When</a>  we met with the mayor in the spring, we went over a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4613.029s">We</a>  were told that the preliminary studies weren't going to be done for new police station until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4619.874s">I</a>  think the fire department, um, 2 million were for later in that 2019, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4626.798s">I</a>  don't know if you have the plan in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4630.777s">We</a>  thought we were going to have ample opportunity to sit down and discuss it as a council, with the community, where every issue, every concern would be vetted properly before any decisions were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4647.49s">We</a>  did push for it to happen far sooner than 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4652.034s">So</a>  on one hand, I'm very happy that the administration wants to move to a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4658.755s">or</a>  anything at all with regards to spending of that sort, I am happy and that's something that our men and women do deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4667.722s">But</a>  to be told through text message last Tuesday night after a council meeting that there was a press conference, we weren't told what it was about, I couldn't make it, I think I was in court on Wednesday, I found out Wednesday afternoon that we have a new police station and I found out the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4685.737s">No</a>  idea of any details until tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4689.343s">questions</a>  that we have that need to be answered before we take this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4694.407s">And</a>  that's something that we could have asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4696.308s">These</a>  questions we could have asked back in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4701.772s">I</a>  went back and just read some of the relates from the state of the city address and some of the quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4709.938s">We</a>  are here as one city because we are strong and believe in writing this chapter together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4719.961s">working</a>  in collaboration with elected officials in a high level dialogue to renew and improve our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4725.765s">I</a>  felt sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4729.367s">I</a>  was going to go back and read some campaign, some campaign promises, but I really would have got sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4737.573s">You</a>  have a police station that needs to be redone, but we also have a building just as old from the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4744.617s">We</a>  haven't, I said it in the committee of the whole meeting, we haven't toured that facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4748.727s">We</a>  toured the DPW yard in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4750.448s">We</a>  toured the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4753.07s">I</a>  toured the police station in August, ran out of there, felt filthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4756.752s">So</a>  I know that needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4758.873s">But</a>  whether it's a couple weeks or a month, we need to do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4763.616s">The</a>  fire department and the chief of fire has to come back from Florida to be able to sit with the mayor and voice his concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4773.06s">The</a>  whole process is done wrong, and we're left in a position where we're going to look like big jerks for not voting for it, or heroes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4780.464s">I</a>  mean, either way, we're going to lose tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4784.986s">But</a>  the bottom line is, we haven't been given any information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4788.128s">And</a>  this is a $2 billion that is going to be spent on architecture for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4794.522s">If</a>  we have the commitment of the administration, and they really want to do a new police station, and we ask them to do a dual facility, or at least explore the option, then we need to take a week and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4807.791s">We</a>  can get some quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4811.013s">I've</a>  been in Malden's police facility, and it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4814.576s">We</a>  can get some quotes from surrounding towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4820.32s">Put</a>  this on the books and delay new fire updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4823.817s">fire</a>  department station one for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4827.098s">It</a>  just can't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4828.778s">We're</a>  going to have the fire department picketing in two, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4834.479s">I</a>  think it's really lousy way to, to run a business, let alone a city lack of transparency close. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4843.061s">I</a>  think it was stated closet telephone booth discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4847.642s">I</a>  loved that quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4848.742s">I</a>  used it in a different context, but I loved it because that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4855.103s">And</a>  it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4855.783s">And</a>  I think we need to explore all options and we need to take a week or two to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4860.105s">We've</a>  delayed this years, like it was said before, we can, we can sit and meet next week and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4865.807s">Have</a>  the mayor come, come tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4868.107s">And</a>  she, you know, she, she wasn't present and answers couldn't, we couldn't even get some answers because department heads weren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4877.251s">So</a>  I asked that, I asked too, that we just get the figures of doing a dual <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4881.953s">station.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4882.553s">I</a>  have the police and fire study from 2013 in front of me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4886.615s">Very</a>  clear that that site, if we're going to keep it on that site, it should be done together as a dual station, police and fire.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4906.9s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4907.861s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4908.901s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4909.882s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4912.704s">I</a>  was the one who used the expression, closet and telephone booth discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4917.188s">And</a>  I used that in the context of saying that that is not what occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4921.251s">Administrations</a>  of every city and township throughout the Commonwealth, throughout the country, when the chief executive of a city or town makes a decision on how to proceed, they have to do so by way of checking things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4934.571s">Check</a>  things out by going into the newspaper and saying, this afternoon I'm going here, next week I'm going there, next month I'm going here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4942.62s">He</a>  or she who operates as an executive goes out with their administration and they check out different sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4948.527s">It</a>  was represented to this council earlier that that's indeed what Mayor Burke did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4953.028s">And</a>  she went to many different sites and talked to many different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4956.709s">I</a>  was involved in many of those discussions also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4959.689s">Some</a>  of those owners said, we will talk with you, but only if this is kept on a confidential basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4965.651s">But</a>  not all of them did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4967.231s">Some</a>  of the locations that you've alluded to, yes, we talked about those places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4971.412s">But</a>  most of them had one particular deficiency, and that was acquisition cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4977.313s">At</a>  least <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4978.905s">deficiencies.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4979.965s">And</a>  it was millions of dollars for acquisition costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4983.146s">One</a>  of the great positives, which has been chosen by Mayor Burke is this, the acquisition cost is absolute zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4991.889s">And</a>  that puts the city so far ahead as far as finance, that it cannot be denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=4998.291s">It</a>  cannot be overlooked by anyone who's going to be prudent with taxpayer money and the city's budgetary needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5006.333s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5008.21s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5044.129s">The</a>  issue is that we've gotten to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5048.612s">I'm</a>  not saying that the blood is on your hands if something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5051.915s">I</a>  hear that all the time myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5053.256s">If</a>  we don't pass a crosswalk or something like that, I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5057.679s">The</a>  idea is we have an opportunity to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5061.558s">I</a>  think we're missing an opportunity as the police chief and as a citizen that lives in the city and pays taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5067.584s">I</a>  think it's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5068.545s">I</a>  think it's something that should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5070.267s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5072.049s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5072.65s">It's</a>  been something I've been fighting for for about 20 years to get a new police station, but so have everyone that's been seated behind me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5079.837s">They've</a>  been fighting for the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5082.388s">Why</a>  things have happened in the way that they happened, I can't give you that answer, but you'll have plenty of time to get those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5088.57s">Why</a>  some of these things can't happen on a parallel track, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5092.391s">I</a>  would think that they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5094.912s">But</a>  to delay this now at this point, I just think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5099.873s">I</a>  think the bashing has to go, and the leadership has to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5104.555s">And</a>  it needs to begin right now, right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5107.075s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5108.056s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5124.754s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5125.895s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5129.138s">I</a>  must say that I think the biggest concern that I have is that when I showed up at this meeting there were <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5135.022s">A</a>  lot of police and fire here who had questions that they wanted answers to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5139.366s">A</a>  lot of us had questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5140.587s">I</a>  was here at the meeting last week and nobody knew anything about this announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5145.13s">It's</a>  pretty upsetting to hear that when I voted in November of 2015, I selected a mayoral candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5151.283s">I</a>  selected city councilors and I expected that they would all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5155.387s">Both</a>  mayoral candidates said that they wanted to run the city open and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5160.731s">So</a>  either person who won should have been in a position to go to our city council and have these conversations about the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5169.218s">To</a>  hear that a text message was sent out that said, hey, show up at this place and I have a great announcement, it's pretty upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5176.662s">That's</a>  not how the city is supposed to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5178.823s">As</a>  a citizen, I don't expect to be apprised of everything happening in the city, but I do hope that my city council is involved in big decisions such as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5188.008s">And</a>  to find out that the fire station, the fire department still doesn't know exactly what's going to happen for them with their training. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5197.83s">to</a>  approve $2 million in funding for an architectural study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5201.853s">Air</a>  station also needs to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5204.294s">There's</a>  only so much money in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5205.875s">And</a>  if we're going to undertake a huge project on this site, then we need to make sure it's the best possible project for our city and for public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5216.782s">I</a>  just think that if you don't have questions, then this isn't the time to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5222.805s">You</a>  should definitely pursue a combination police and fire and get the best that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5227.513s">for</a>  all of these hardworking men and women who are keeping us safe.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5669.564s">This</a>  is a committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5675.449s">Earlier</a>  this evening, Tuesday, February 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5681.451s">in</a>  regards to funding proposals, funding mechanisms for the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5690.613s">The</a>  RFP includes a retrofitting of the current fire station to accommodate the needs of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5703.076s">What</a>  is the cost to put in a new training facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5706.797s">Feasibility</a>  of grant funding on the municipal training facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5711.384s">a</a>  breakdown of all city bonds and debtors, breakdown of all financial aspects of the loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5717.208s">Uh,</a>  I look at a combined police and police and fire facility, uh, listing of all locations that were viewed and proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5730.076s">When</a>  was the chief, when was the fire chief apprised of the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5737.483s">put</a>  together a working group with fire to deliberate on the existing fire stations, training facility, and with the, with the demolition of the existing facility, the city council support a new training, a training facility to be replaced.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5755.116s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5756.657s">Motion</a>  to accept that point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5760.039s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5762.461s">I</a>  believe we said executive session to go over those sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5766.14s">Because</a>  there was confidential issues?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5770.302s">That</a>  would be wise, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5773.264s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5774.165s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5775.025s">There's</a>  something you've got to take up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5776.246s">Yeah,</a>  coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5776.766s">Just</a>  if we could add.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5779.368s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5780.969s">Councilor</a>  Lundquist. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5781.489s">Just</a>  add possible grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5787.092s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5787.993s">He</a>  has it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5791.835s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5795.486s">Yeah,</a>  Jelena constantly occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5797.488s">You</a>  have your letter.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5826.401s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5826.681s">Return</a>  my motion to the floor for approval of 17-zero seven five loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5833.363s">City</a>  of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5836.923s">Thank</a>  you on move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5841.084s">Mr.</a>  President, vice president marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5844.945s">Mr.</a>  President, I think at this point, I don't think anyone behind the reel wants to walk away tonight with, you know, not a deal in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5853.668s">but</a>  it's difficult to negotiate when you have members of the council willing to discuss and we don't have the other potty at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5863.138s">It's</a>  very difficult, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5865.539s">And</a>  what I would ask is for maybe a two-week, three-week, whatever grace period we need, under your leadership, to sit down with the mayor and discuss these nine or 10 issues that we brought up on behalf of this council, behalf of both departments, and behalf of the citizens, and discuss them with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5883.906s">Now,</a>  if we come to an impasse or we're unable to move forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5887.788s">Then</a>  it'll be up to this council to come back again and decide what they want to do, if they want to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5894.576s">But</a>  that's do our due diligence now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5897.859s">That's</a>  wait the two weeks, whatever that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5900.062s">I'm</a>  willing to meet tomorrow, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5902.184s">It</a>  doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5903.325s">That's</a>  do our homework and our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5905.928s">get</a>  these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5907.589s">If</a>  the mayor is adamantly opposed to building one combined public safety facility, then we have our answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5913.491s">Then</a>  we have our answer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5915.271s">It'll</a>  be up to this council whether they want to move forward or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5918.852s">But</a>  right now, we don't have the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5920.933s">And</a>  I personally think that's the best answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5923.754s">I</a>  think it's the best answer for all parties, and I think it's one we can afford, Mr. President, in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5930.247s">We</a>  haven't spent anything on public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5932.489s">We</a>  have to beg, borrow, and steal to get new cars, new apparatus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5937.513s">We're</a>  not spending anything in public safety in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5941.276s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that within the next two weeks, that you call for a meeting with the mayor, and we sit down and go over these particular items. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5951.564s">And</a>  if we're unable to come to a resolve, then the paper's right before us again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5956.468s">The</a>  paper's not going anywhere with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5959.092s">It's</a>  right before us again, Mr. President, and we'll take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5963.014s">I'm</a>  prepared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5964.555s">I'm</a>  prepared to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5965.815s">Give</a>  the process a little time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5969.157s">We've</a>  had no time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5970.557s">We've</a>  had no process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5973.057s">Admittedly,</a>  even some of the representatives from the mayor's office, I think admittedly have said the process has been lax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5979.083s">There</a>  hasn't really been a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5981.365s">They</a>  may be working behind the scenes, Mr. President, but surely it hasn't involved us as a council or other city employees that have the largest impact on Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5993.717s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=5998.408s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo does have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6000.389s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6000.949s">He</a>  can have all the motions he wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6002.27s">He</a>  sat on the subcommittee that recommended something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6005.192s">Now</a>  he's saying he's going with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6007.413s">That's</a>  fine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6008.834s">I</a>  want to do the right thing on behalf of the employees in this city and in the taxpayers of this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6014.937s">And</a>  there's no rush to judgment over the next two weeks to sit down with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6019.2s">We</a>  haven't sat down with her once since she offered this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6022.402s">Not</a>  once. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6024.643s">We're</a>  not spending $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6025.323s">It's</a>  $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6028.074s">for</a>  a study.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6291.908s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6293.729s">I</a>  don't support a government shutdown, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6299.634s">We</a>  have a motion by Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6302.996s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6304.777s">I</a>  would respectfully ask my colleague to withdraw his motion so we can compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6310.401s">All</a>  we're asking is for two weeks and then we'll take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6313.623s">Either</a>  way, it's going to be a guaranteed vote so we can iron out some of the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6319.768s">That</a>  could be a commitment by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6321.845s">There's</a>  seven of us here, and I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6325.108s">As</a>  Councilor Knight just said, let's get some answers, we'll come back to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6328.31s">That's</a>  a guarantee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6330.192s">This</a>  is not gonna go, this issue is not going away by any stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6333.495s">So</a>  no one's gonna leave here tonight saying we're not gonna get a station or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6337.558s">There's</a>  gonna be a guaranteed cement answer within two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6341.061s">I</a>  would respectfully ask my colleague in the suggestion to compromise.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6346.606s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6347.727s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6350.454s">In</a>  the spirit of compromise, Councilor Marks raises a very good point, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6354.175s">Number</a>  two, I think that it's very important that if, in fact, we are going to sit down and discuss this, that there is a date certain that we come back to further discuss this debate in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6363.877s">So</a>  if we can't get our questions answered, then we should have a date certain that we're gonna come back and actually vote on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6368.978s">So</a>  I certainly appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6371.138s">I</a>  think that that's an excellent suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6373.419s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6380.286s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6381.406s">I</a>  was just going to say, we just want questions answered too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6383.867s">It's</a>  just sitting in meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6385.008s">It</a>  goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6387.089s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6388.169s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6390.13s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo, your colleague has asked that you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6394.992s">I</a>  acknowledge that my colleague has asked the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6398.233s">My</a>  motion stands, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6399.954s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6400.694s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo's motion has made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6404.516s">Do</a>  we have a second on Councilor Dello Russo's motion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6407.737s">So,</a>  Mr. President, just so I understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6410.772s">If</a>  we vote against Councilor Dello Russo's motion, is it true the paper cannot come back to us, the police station paper, for six months, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6419.594s">I</a>  think it's 90 days.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6420.534s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, could you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6422.734s">Mr.</a>  Solicitor, would that be correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6424.515s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6424.595s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6425.095s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6439.898s">There's</a>  ample opportunity within the intervening weeks after the first reading to have conversation about the matters that are presented tonight, in my estimation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6465.304s">Mr.</a>  President, I have a motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6472.107s">If</a>  somebody feels that they can't get their questions answered in that time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6478.929s">Mr.</a>  President, I just think people at home and people in the audience should know that if Councilor Dello Russo's motion does not prevail, we cannot discuss that for another 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6490.236s">So</a>  just want you to know that, that people will be disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6494.639s">So</a>  what I'm asking is a two-week compromise to be back at this table in two weeks for a vote.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6501.603s">I</a>  think that's a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6502.924s">Mr.</a>  President, the two weeks intervening is ample opportunity, and this is not a final vote on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6513.691s">The</a>  logic doesn't follow, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6515.532s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6517.762s">The</a>  vote is to move forward on a paper that solely looks at the architectural design for a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6525.625s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6526.385s">Now,</a>  if we include a fire station, I'm sure whoever is going to do this design is going to say, you're not getting it for $2 million, it's going to cost you, City of Medford, $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6536.625s">So</a>  what I'm saying is... The paper does not ask for a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6540.167s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6540.927s">So</a>  what I'm saying is, by moving forward on a paper that doesn't address the issues, doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6546.409s">You're</a>  putting the cart before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6548.67s">Let's</a>  get this ironed out, and then we'll know the exact dollar amount we need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6553.552s">It</a>  might be a combined center, or it might just be the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6556.574s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6557.374s">But</a>  that vote will come in two weeks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6559.355s">So</a>  I respectfully ask my colleague again to withdraw his motion, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6563.917s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6567.865s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, do we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6572.387s">I'm</a>  not seconding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6579.469s">We</a>  do not have a second, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6583.39s">I</a>  ask that my motion be taken, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=6632.994s">Okay.</a> </p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7303.966s">Is</a>  this proposal outside the scope? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7306.087s">The</a>  scope pro paper one six dash six, six, six moratoriums on building smart development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7312.432s">We</a>  voted to keep this paper in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7313.992s">We</a>  requested a legal opinion from the solicitor as to whether or not this is when I scope within our scope and purview paper one, six, three, five, nine, an amendment to the zoning act to authorize front yard parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7323.979s">Uh,</a>  the committee voted to keep that in committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7326.44s">In</a>  paper 16338, zoning consultant, we voted to keep that paper in committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7331.863s">Motion</a>  was made by Councilor Dello Russo to report the paper out of committee favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7335.124s">It</a>  was seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7337.786s">The</a>  meeting adjourned at 6.58 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7339.527s">Mr.</a>  President, in attendance were myself as the chairman, Councilor Dello Russo, and Councilor Falco as members. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7345.269s">We</a>  were also very lucky to have two members of our council here, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7352.433s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello and Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7355.451s">Scarpelli</a>  were in attendance as citizens and not as members of the subcommittee or city councilors because that would have posed some issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7366.015s">Also</a>  in attendance was Mr. DeVita and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7367.816s">Rodriguez,</a>  and I want to thank them both for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7369.897s">So</a>  as such, Mr. President, we'd ask that the subcommittee report be adopted and that a committee of the whole be set up to go over the two pieces of legislation that are included therein.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7625.781s">So</a>  at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7626.961s">this</a>  morning, I was awakened by a big bang, a pickup truck snowplow from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7633.404s">It</a>  was the city of Medford pickup truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7635.645s">And</a>  he was moving up and down Winthrop Street with his blade lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7639.826s">His</a>  intention was to... <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7643.608s">I</a>  ran outside, and he flew by me with his blade dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7647.211s">He</a>  was going over excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7649.893s">He</a>  was doing 50 miles an hour with his 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7654.556s">I'm</a>  pretty accurate with this, because I can see how fast it was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7658.659s">He</a>  hit my snow bank before he got away, shot snow, throwing it all over my entrance and my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7668.806s">I</a>  got in my vehicle, and I went to look for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7671.789s">I</a>  didn't find him. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7673.086s">I</a>  went down to the city yard, walked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7675.548s">There</a>  was a gentleman behind the desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7677.889s">He</a>  was sleeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7679.81s">And</a>  before I continue, I just want to say, I'm not disrespecting the municipality because I think they're one of the greatest municipalities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7686.514s">I'm</a>  going to reiterate that at the end of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7688.756s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7690.977s">Behind</a>  the desk, told him what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7693.719s">He</a>  said, I will report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7697.201s">Waited</a>  for about 10, 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7699.462s">Nothing</a>  happened, so I picked up four big chunks of ice that weighed about 50 pounds, brought them over to the snowbank, put them back, then I cleared my driveway with a shovel and my sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7712.632s">Okay,</a>  so, after I was done with that, the same truck came speeding down the street, now I'm watching him as he's coming towards my house, and he's cascading and hitting every snowbank with a pickup truck, trying to widen the street, which is not gonna do it because it's iced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7727.964s">Everything</a>  is frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7730.076s">Same</a>  thing, and he's hitting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7733.079s">I</a>  stepped out, he seen me, but his windshield was, on his passenger's side, was covered with snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7739.504s">So</a>  he probably didn't really see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7741.306s">Lifted</a>  his blade and he went around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7743.168s">Went</a>  over the double yellow line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7744.549s">Hit</a>  the speed bump, put his blade back down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7747.311s">What</a>  speed bump? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7748.052s">Well,</a>  whatever, the hump that's in the middle of the street, raised from the water damage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7752.696s">Whatever</a>  you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7755.018s">Okay,</a>  now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7756.999s">He</a>  lifted his thing, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7758.679s">He</a>  probably would have, if I didn't, if he didn't see me, he probably would have re-buried my driveway, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7764.1s">I'm</a>  not someone to complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7766.021s">In</a>  fact, this is not the first time this incident has happened in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7771.082s">A</a>  snowblower truck, City of Medford, the big one, came by in the snowstorms of 2015 and shot three feet of snow onto my sidewalk, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7781.444s">Which</a>  is about 25 feet long from neighbor to neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7786.814s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7788.115s">I</a>  have a bobcat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7789.337s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7791.279s">It's</a>  52 years old, still runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7793.741s">I</a>  had to move that snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7795.423s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7795.723s">So</a>  my question of these people who supervise them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7800.848s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7801.149s">And</a>  I'm not knocking them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7802.43s">And</a>  I'm going to get to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7805.813s">I'm</a>  probably not the only resident that this has happened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7809.183s">Since</a>  the water break pipe two months ago, we've had this hump in the middle of the street across from side to side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7814.427s">So</a>  the plow drivers do not come close to the curb as they're plowing because they want to avoid the hump. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7821.813s">So</a>  now the snow banks are extended about two and a half to five feet out from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7829.198s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7830.64s">Before</a>  it, which extended to the snow bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7832.841s">So</a>  anyway, before my house, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7836.143s">The</a>  snow bank is about four feet away from the curb, right before my driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7841.426s">And</a>  they keep continuing to hit it, and it's not moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7848.129s">I</a>  decided that I was going to move all the snow today, so I went 25 feet in front of my house, and I removed four feet of snow, 25 feet from my neighbors to my driveway, picked up the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7860.316s">I</a>  got a little snow farm in the backyard now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7866.78s">listen</a>  I'm getting kind of like tired of this so you know again I don't know who's not accountable for this stuff and again I try to do my <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7876.387s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7877.087s">But</a>  the patient thing, especially when, you know, you're not feeling well and you try to work a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7882.248s">And</a>  I understand some of the guys that are in the municipality are not really experienced. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7887.169s">Some</a>  of them might not be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7888.469s">They</a>  learn from being in the municipalities for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7890.869s">I</a>  get that, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7892.17s">And</a>  a lot of them, like, they're tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7894.61s">They're</a>  overworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7895.27s">They</a>  just want to get home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7896.41s">I</a>  get that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7897.571s">I'm</a>  not disrespecting anybody, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7899.231s">DPW</a>  method, it's not my intention here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7902.951s">But</a>  at my age, my patients with incompetence gets a little mm-mm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7906.798s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7907.699s">So</a>  I can do my part to respect the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7910.723s">I</a>  would like a little respect back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7912.024s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7913.126s">Um,</a>  you know, the method DW is one of the finest municipalities in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7916.89s">I</a>  know you guys know, but like I said, I just wanted to reiterate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7921.376s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7922.09s">I've</a>  seen and done some things, and I'm not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7925.091s">I've</a>  been in this field of earth moving and snow removal for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7930.733s">So</a>  I've seen how it takes a storm, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7934.574s">But</a>  this is safety matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7936.635s">And</a>  I mean, like, I like to do one job once and not have to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7940.956s">And</a>  this kind of like peed me off a little bit, and I don't mean to use that phrase, but it kind of really did.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7945.118s">I</a>  did receive some other calls, and I did make Brian and Karen's aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7952.837s">We</a>  will send a letter to him from the clerk.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7956.52s">I</a>  mean, I don't want to hurt anybody's jobs.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7958.381s">No,</a>  no, no one's looking to hurt anybody.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7964.186s">You</a>  have to be kind about that.</p>

    <p>[uOl8IpBqQPs_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7966.047s">Now,</a>  the front of my house, 314 Winthrop Street, you go by there, anyone of you who's want to take a picture, I cleared four feet of snow from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7973.653s">Now,</a>  the curb is visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7975.515s">So</a>  the next time around, if there's a snowstorm, you guys can come on in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7979.758s">But</a>  that bump has to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7981.5s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7984.197s">If</a>  you could, uh, send them to the commission occurrence.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7992.059s">What</a>  happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=7992.999s">If</a>  we could just get an update from DPW with regards to the incident that happened on Winthrop street near three 14, but you said, I think it sounded like it went all the way down the street a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=8004.741s">So</a>  we just can get a written update with regards to who, you know, if he can make sure he, <a href="https://youtu.be/Y06IqPvQxlY&t=8010.049s">knows</a>  who did it, if it was a contractor, if it was one of our personnel, and we make sure we do it right the next time.</p>
