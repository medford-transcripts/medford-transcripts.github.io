[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm going to go back to roll call.

32
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:17,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give an extra minute, just in case there was one other board member that was joining us.

33
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:19,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Kautz.

34
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:24,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

35
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:28,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to double check for Ari Fishman.

36
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:31,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Pam Marianski.

37
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

38
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:33,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Sally Akiki.

39
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:34,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

40
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

41
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I am present.

42
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,424
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first item for this evening is approval not required.

43
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:47,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an A&R plan for review for 970 Felsway.

44
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:57,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to, before I invite the proponent to present their plans for 970 Felsway, I would ask if the city can give us a synopsis on this.

45
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Madam Chair.

46
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:11,762
[SPEAKER_04]: 970 Felsway is the site of a recently approved comprehensive permit location.

47
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And despite a comprehensive permit where the ZBA does everything, the Community Development Board still needs to approve the ANR, which is approval not required to

48
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:39,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let Patrick noon from Davis companies explain, but there's some division of a lot from the existing use but he'll, he'll explain all that.

49
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:46,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what the project is here it's all approved, it's just a formality to create the new lot.

50
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:49,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

51
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:55,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I will invite to present the plans for 970 Fellsway.

52
00:03:55,582 --> 00:04:04,388
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can please give them screen sharing abilities, make them co-host whoever's presenting.

53
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that would be me.

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:07,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

55
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:13,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start sharing now.

56
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:21,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Can everyone see my screen?

57
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:24,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

58
00:04:25,154 --> 00:04:28,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be brief.

59
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:31,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for hearing us this evening.

60
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:45,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So just following up on what Danielle was saying, we have been through the comprehensive permit hearing process with the ZBA, recently concluded that process.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,802
[SPEAKER_00]: We are following up now here with this A&R plan submission for endorsement.

62
00:04:52,202 --> 00:05:02,966
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see on the screen here is an aerial view of the building and the site as it exists today.

63
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:11,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Just giving a picture of what the existing conditions are as the site exists today, it is currently one lot.

64
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:31,960
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have gone through this comprehensive permit process, the stated intention has been from the start to separate the existing parcel into two parcels, whereby there will be a residential development on one parcel and then the existing extra storage space

65
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,427
[SPEAKER_00]: building will remain on the other parcel.

66
00:05:45,467 --> 00:06:05,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Just following up to the formal A&R plans, so these are the plans that have been submitted and filed with the Community Development Board for endorsement that identify the separation between the two parcels identified on the screen here as lot two and lot three.

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,422
[SPEAKER_00]: These have been certified by our surveyor Feldman

68
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:12,624
[SPEAKER_00]: and are here for formal endorsement.

69
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:25,356
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the end of the formal presentation that I have to give this evening.

70
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:28,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

71
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me what the frontage actually, what were the dimensions again?

72
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are the dimension?

73
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:42,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project of fronts, myrtle street and fells way.

74
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:55,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the formal application up in front of me, just referring to the plans here.

75
00:06:55,585 --> 00:07:09,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 336 feet, roughly, along Myrtle Street here, and then another 25 feet, roughly, along Myrtle Street at the corner between Myrtle and Felsway, and then there is

76
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:26,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to quote the wrong information for you, just doing this live and on the fly.

77
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:41,282
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we have it on the application that was submitted, which I, again, do not have in front of me for what that formal dimension is, but I can follow up if that's a question that needs answered at this current time.

78
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:42,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

79
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of, I just have to make sure they satisfy the minimum funds requirements and that there's vital access to the lots.

80
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:53,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Planner Evans, are you able to provide that information?

81
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:58,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a second.

82
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:05,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to troubleshoot a document issue.

83
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:10,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Jackie, could you ask a question again?

84
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,866
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it that you were looking for?

85
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:14,506
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the minimum frontage?

86
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:15,967
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 feet.

87
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 50.

88
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:17,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

89
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: My document has 35.

90
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm a little- I think that's from the wrong planning, the wrong district.

91
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:27,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

92
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:28,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

93
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:32,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that all, yes, it's a commercial.

94
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,156
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be 50 feet.

95
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,376
[SPEAKER_01]: This has 50 feet.

96
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:35,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

97
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,858
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

98
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:39,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say thank you.

99
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:54,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open it up to the board for questions while I continue to look forward to something.

100
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:56,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone have questions?

101
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:01,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Kautz?

102
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:11,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I don't know if, I'm not sure who to direct this question at specifically.

103
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I just want to kind of, I guess, understand the process and what it is, what it is, and is not the.

104
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:24,880
[SPEAKER_03]: The proponent and the city are asking the board to do.

105
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a specific generally?

106
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:42,675
[SPEAKER_01]: So an approval not required is where you have one lot that you're dividing into more than one lot or two lots that you're joining together.

107
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:51,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as there is appropriate frontage on a legal way, then the board has to say yes.

108
00:09:51,620 --> 00:10:04,690
[SPEAKER_01]: there there isn't any discretion and it doesn't matter what the buildings are on the lots it doesn't matter what the zoning is of the lots like none of that is required that is why the the procedure is called an approval not required.

109
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:09,995
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I saw this board deny one because the

110
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:35,537
[SPEAKER_01]: place where the the property met a road was the very end of a dead end there was only about 10 feet and then they were like we'll make space for a fire truck to turn around and basically that was there wasn't appropriate frontage for the second lot on a legal way but as long as there's appropriate frontage the zoning board is just confirming that yes there is

111
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:36,819
[SPEAKER_01]: access.

112
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:45,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this very clearly has frontage on the new parcel on two streets and on the remaining parcel on Felsway.

113
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:47,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's fine.

114
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was unfamiliar with the process and was trying to figure out what the criteria we should be looking for were.

115
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,293
[SPEAKER_04]: The questions are, yeah, do the lots front on a right of way?

116
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the lots satisfy minimum frontage?

117
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then is vital access provided?

118
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:19,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the neighboring cities actually don't go through this process because they've opted out of subdivision control law, where, for example, in Somerville, the planning director just signs this.

119
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't go to their planning board.

120
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:35,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and based on the fact that there is at least 50 feet, I'm going to actually just move it along and ask for a motion to endorse the plan as proven not required.

121
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:37,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion?

122
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I second the motion.

123
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:44,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I second.

124
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I, Peter, second.

125
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do a roll call.

126
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:49,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Kautz?

127
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:51,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

132
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for being here with us tonight.

134
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

135
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:05,292
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

136
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: The 2nd item on our agenda tonight is 400 minutes to GAV, special permits, site plan review.

137
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So the applicant is requesting a continuance to a date, July 17, 2024, which is the date certain.

138
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when they want to finalize the requested revisions.

139
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am going to ask the board for a motion to continue the public hearing for 400 Mystic Ave to July 17, 2024.

140
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:31,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

141
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And a second.

[SPEAKER_05]: Pam Mariansky.

146
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

154
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:20,460
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant has submitted a letter to withdraw their special permit application from the CBA.

155
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:31,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Since there is no longer an active application for city board to review in its advisory role, the matter is also withdrawn from CDB and there will be no discussion of public comment.

156
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Item four, approval of minutes.

157
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to ask for a motion to approve the minutes for May 15th, 2024.

158
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:49,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I said emotion.

00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:52,818

[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call Peter cows.

162
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Pam Marianski.

[SPEAKER_05]: I'm selling a kiki.

164
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, myself, Jack McPherson.

165
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:10,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an eye.

166
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:17,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Before adjournment, I want to ask if the board or the city has any other items for discussion.

167
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:31,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam chair, we have someone in the audience is having difficulty hearing.

168
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:37,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they logged out and back in because they're

169
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:45,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that after they sent the message they logged out and now that phone number is back in.

170
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:52,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, I'm having a hard time running the zoom and also following.

171
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:53,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So I missed that.

172
00:14:54,333 --> 00:15:01,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So if everyone is all set and if the individual missed the announcement that 360 Salem Street

173
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: it's being withdrawn from the zoning board, and so there's not an application for this board to review and make recommendations on, and therefore there's not an item that they can discuss.

174
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:24,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And any general discussion, it's not on the agenda, so that would be a violation of open meeting law.

175
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:32,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may be an agenda item in the future, but it is,

176
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,740
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to be heard.

177
00:15:54,869 --> 00:16:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, if there's no other items from the board or the city,

178
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we feel confident that all members have heard the announcement in regards to item three, 360 Salem Street, not being heard, since it was withdrawn, I will ask for a motion to adjourn.

179
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Having no other items.

180
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,652
[SPEAKER_05]: A motion.

181
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:28,334
[SPEAKER_05]: A second.

00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:31,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.
