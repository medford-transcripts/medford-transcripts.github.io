00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:08,124
Hey Medford Bites listeners, I'm so excited to share this bonus episode with you today.

2
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:08,824
Ms.

3
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:17,208
Whalen's class from Andrews Middle School submitted their podcast, No Cap, and were finalists in the NPR 2022 Student Podcast Challenge.

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,151
We're planning to record an update to include all the work that went into this podcast, as well as some updates about its impact.

5
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:24,492
I know you will enjoy.

6
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:38,675
Hats, hoods, bandanas, and other non-religious head cover are not allowed to be worn, carried, or visible by both girls and boys during the school day from 8 a.m.

7
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:39,796
to 2.15 p.m.

8
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:43,899
This is the rule put in place by Medford Public Schools found in our middle school handbook.

9
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:49,352
Many staff members of our middle school constantly tell students with hats or hoods to take them off.

10
00:00:49,952 --> 00:01:01,738
If students get reminded too often or too many times in a certain time period, they may be issued to an after-school detention, told to surrender their hat or hoodie until the end of the day, or receive a phone call home.

11
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:04,600
What are your opinions on wearing hats and hoods in school?

12
00:01:05,178 --> 00:01:07,039
I just don't get why it's a rule that you can't.

13
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:08,660
It doesn't make sense.

14
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,621
I think we should wear hats.

15
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,102
They're like so obsessed with what we wear now.

16
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:16,704
I think that you could have them in school.

17
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,645
It doesn't really hurt anyone.

18
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,386
Do you think we should be allowed to wear hats in school?

19
00:01:21,987 --> 00:01:27,590
Yes, I think we should be allowed to wear hats in school because I feel like it would express more of the students to be wearing hats.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,250
How do you feel about the dress code in general?

21
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,112
I feel like the dress code is really bad.

22
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:34,033
You know, they dress code people

23
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:38,967
like that show more stuff like they have more bodies than the other people but I wish it was just fair.

24
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:44,930
We believe that our school district's rule that we are not allowed to wear hats or hoods in school should be abolished.

25
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,273
Over the course of this podcast we will explore how this rule came to be and how we plan to challenge our school committee's rule on hats and hoods.

26
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,235
We interviewed some of our teachers about that hats and hoods rule.

27
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:10,220
So 20 years ago, when my son was up at Medford High, it was not a rule for the hoods, but they picked and chose certain students to maintain that rule, I guess.

28
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:19,802
So I may be wearing a hoodie, and he might be wearing a hoodie, but if I didn't, I don't know how to say that.

29
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,222
Cause like a ruckus?

30
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:25,283
Yeah, if I wasn't a troublemaker, put it that way, they'd just let me go.

31
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:29,496
say the other person was a troublemaker, they stopped and asked.

32
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:38,978
What I did notice is that a lot of the veteran teachers that had been around for over 20 years, they were still heart set against it.

33
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:41,078
They thought it was a disrespectful sort of thing.

34
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:52,521
And that all young kids, pre-teenagers and teenagers, should show a certain amount of respect by removing your hat or your hood on a daily basis.

35
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,681
So you had a little bit of a split.

36
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,122
New young teachers in

37
00:02:56,998 --> 00:03:03,421
in all the Corps of veteran teachers that expected you to take your hat or hood off as a sign of respect.

38
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,683
I think it was just to recognize people.

39
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:15,808
I know back with my son at Medford High, it was because there's 20 kids walking down the hall, they all had on black hoodies.

40
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:19,670
Everybody's was up and if they needed to talk to someone,

41
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,407
literally you would have to have all of them turn around and look at you.

42
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,850
So I think that was the beginning.

43
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,650
I'm not sure.

44
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,471
Yeah.

45
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,253
And do you think times have changed since then?

46
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:31,934
Yes.

47
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:33,435
Yes.

48
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:36,757
Times have changed and I think we should all adapt to the changes.

49
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,701
And I think there might be a happy medium for everybody if we work together.

50
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:46,465
In addition to interviewing our teachers, we conducted our own research about this topic.

51
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:59,420
According to an article from the Washington Post titled, Wearing Hats in School, A Second Look, this rule may have originated because of the idea of respect and what that looked like in a traditional society.

52
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,980
It should be noted that we put traditional in quotation marks.

53
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:09,462
It's been speculated that knights used to take off their helmets, their form of hat or hood, in court to show respect.

54
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:14,123
Taping your hat is known as a way of flattering and paying respect to a woman.

55
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:21,307
Emily Post, the authority on courtesies and manners, says it's impolite to have a hat or hood on in school.

56
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:27,717
Most notably, and possibly most controversially, hats and hoods have been used to identify gang members.

57
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:33,675
There are some sexist and racist connotations behind this rule, and it's discriminatory.

58
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:37,518
This rule should be eliminated or at the very least altered.

59
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:38,699
This article was written in 1999.

60
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,962
The reasoning was different back then, but the rule was still the same.

61
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:47,226
It's been over 20 years since this article was written, and there's been no change.

62
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:51,489
There have been major progressive changes in the past 20 years, but this rule has stayed the same.

63
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,891
We want to abolish this rule because it's unfair.

64
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,754
Sometimes there's profiling with us wearing hats and hoods.

65
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:03,261
As our teacher, Mrs. Miller, says, sometimes they identify the troublemakers as opposed to the good kids.

66
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:10,890
It's not fair to think of us as bad, and it's upsetting and shocking to be told that they're intimidated by us because we're wearing a hat or hood.

67
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,496
We want to wear our hats and hoods because we feel more comfortable.

68
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:18,578
Physical and emotional comfort are important to us.

69
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:26,124
When we are physically comfortable, it helps us focus because instead of being uncomfortable or cold, we can focus on class.

70
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:29,446
When we are emotionally comfortable, we feel confident.

71
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:33,990
Wearing your hood or hat is also a fashion statement.

72
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,293
This rule needs to change with time to reflect how society is changing.

73
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,115
It makes me feel like secure in class.

74
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,458
and it makes me feel more comfortable.

75
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,819
I like to wear them in school because I feel comfortable with my hats and hood on.

76
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,120
I like wearing my hat.

77
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,941
It's like a way to express myself.

78
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:59,824
We believe that while this rule needs to change, there are some valid concerns that teachers have regarding hats and hoods rule in school.

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,443
hats and hoods can make it difficult to identify a student in the hallway in case of a lockdown, emergency, or even a fight between students.

80
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:13,407
We propose wearing our student IDs in order to help teachers and students more easily identify people in the hallway and classroom.

81
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:22,492
If not IDs, students have to wear their hats and hoods so people can see their faces, or they wouldn't wear hats and hoods in the hallway during transition times.

82
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:26,114
Another concern teachers may have is students wearing headphones.

83
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:30,317
Students can demonstrate that they are not wearing headphones by showing their ears before class.

84
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,977
Students would need to show their teachers that they are actively listening and paying attention.

85
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:40,959
We also recognize that there are some times it might not be appropriate to wear hats or hoods in school.

86
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:47,942
During presentations, the Pledge of Allegiance, and one-on-one conversations with teachers are times to students would remove their hats and hoods.

87
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:55,085
Students would pay a courtesy to their teachers and peers with this action while also maintaining their ability to wear hats and hoods.

88
00:06:56,565 --> 00:07:00,827
We understand that there may be some concerns about whether or not students would follow these rules.

89
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:05,526
acknowledge that there should be consequences for students who fail to do so.

90
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:17,270
In accordance with our student handbook, if a student refuses to wear their ID or refuse to take off their hat or hood during the pledge and other times we mentioned, they would lose their privilege to wear their hats and hoods during the school day.

91
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:24,233
If a student refuses to show that they are not wearing headphones or sticks them on after the check at the start of the class,

92
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:28,056
We would expect students to follow the rules we have for cell phones.

93
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:34,863
Cell phones are left in lockers throughout the day, and if a student is seen using it, they are expected to turn it into their teacher or their office.

94
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:42,131
If a student refuses to do that, typically a plan is made where they have to check their cell phone into the office at the start of each day.

95
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:47,957
We feel like these are fair compromises for teachers and students, as well as fair consequences.

96
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:54,412
We're currently in the beginning stages of taking this proposal to our school committee in the hope that at the very least we'll get this rule altered.

97
00:07:54,772 --> 00:08:01,777
We're not sure when exactly we're going to get to meet with them, but we're hopeful it will be before the end of the school year so that the rule will be changed in the handbook for next year.

98
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:12,265
Funnily enough, this whole project initially started as a joke in our civics class because we were trying to come up with amendments to the constitution of our teacher's classroom rules.

99
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,231
We were practicing debating, but it became a serious project.

100
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:19,998
Our teacher thought we were being serious, and he pushed us to pursue it.

101
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,282
And now we realize we can make a change.

102
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,425
And we hope to make a change for the better.

103
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,127
No cap.

104
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:35,293
Thanks so much to Ms.

105
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,174
