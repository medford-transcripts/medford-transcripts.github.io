1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, friends and neighbors.

2
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:08,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what you're thinking.

3
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:11,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, another person with a microphone and a dream.

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,181
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't worry.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:18,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't come here to sell you a timeshare and convince you to join a pyramid scheme.

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I came here to talk about something even more exciting, local government.

7
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:28,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand before you today, not as a politician, but as a resident of Medford.

8
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:30,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who believes in building bridges, not walls.

9
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:35,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who believes that when we see something wrong, we speak up.

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And when speaking up isn't enough, we roll up our sleeves and do something.

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:45,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered this race because I saw firsthand how the Charter Committee was treated in its early stages.

12
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:50,046
[SPEAKER_00]: How the City Council dismissed its purpose and its people.

13
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:55,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear, the Charter was created to protect our budget, not inflate it.

14
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It was meant to serve the people, not politics.

15
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not my father's Oldsmobile.

16
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to run Cruise On Legacy or Nostalgia.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for change.

18
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:11,063
[SPEAKER_00]: The residents of Medford are not asking for miracles.

19
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:14,584
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking for solutions and I'm here to deliver them.

20
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I propose.

21
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,426
[SPEAKER_00]: A world-class fire department.

22
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:26,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's purchase land on Mystic Ave and build a fire department that reflects the excellence and courage of our firefighters.

23
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just functional, world-class.

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Affordable housing for veterans, seniors, and disabled.

25
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:39,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's knock down the old police and fire station and transform that space into affordable housing.

26
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:40,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a win-win.

27
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:48,119
[SPEAKER_00]: We address the crisis and we do it at that location with direct bus access and nearby medical offices.

28
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,440
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smart, compassionate, and long overdue.

29
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Revitalize the Mystic River.

30
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:59,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean up the Mystic River, not just for the environment, but for opportunity.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I propose we work with the MBTA to launch a commuter boat service to Boston, which stops at Rose Wharf and the seaport.

32
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:11,767
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time we rethink transportation and embrace innovation.

33
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:19,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be part of preparing for a future comprehensive infrastructure program that our city so desperately needs.

34
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:21,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoning.

35
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:27,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly and most importantly, we have enough work to do revitalizing all the squares in Mystic Ave.

36
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:31,958
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to put energy at this time into residential rezoning.

37
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ensure that all residential zoning is not infringed upon.

38
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,843
[SPEAKER_00]: This campaign isn't about me.

39
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about us.

40
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about Medford.

41
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:44,666
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about compromise, even when we don't agree on things.

42
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build a city that works for everyone.

43
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:48,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build bridges.

44
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come together and get to work.

45
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:56,155
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, you can reach me at DonatoForMedFed.com.

46
00:02:56,755 --> 00:03:01,299
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my family, my friends, and my supporters for all you have done for me.

47
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:02,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul for all.

48
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
