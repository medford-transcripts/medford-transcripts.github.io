[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll Pippa Sally.

46
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw.

47
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here, uh, Chad Fallon here.

48
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Lori Hodgkin, John McLaughlin.

49
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:13,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see Luke.

51
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,430
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

52
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Rousseau?

53
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:21,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.

54
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Philip Santos?

55
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:29,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see Philip.

56
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lisa Miller?

57
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:32,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

58
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:33,714
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

59
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:41,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 13 present, two absent.

60
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:42,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a quorum.

61
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,441
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, I think this will be a relatively quick meeting.

62
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple of updates.

63
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:56,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We did go to the OPM panel review with MSBA earlier today.

64
00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:00,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the only community that they had this time, so I think they

65
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,959
[SPEAKER_02]: actually had, like, more time to ask us questions.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:18,731
[SPEAKER_02]: The review went really well, thanks to the left-field team for providing the information that MSBA requested, and I already saw a follow-up to one of the questions that they had go over, so that should be all taken care of.

67
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:34,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they had questions about, um, and noted that, um, some of the things that we saw, the OPM selection committee saw and left field and recommended around student involvement, um, definitely stood out to them as well.

68
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:39,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the other big point of discussion was the timeline and,

69
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:47,882
[SPEAKER_02]: We did lay out in our package that we are looking to move as quickly as we possibly can.

70
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:52,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had some good, healthy discussion about that with the MSBA team.

71
00:03:53,925 --> 00:04:01,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have provided them all of our deliverables for this next gate, which will be to bring on a designer or an architect.

72
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:06,071
[SPEAKER_02]: who will actually be able to do that feasibility study that we're all like waiting for.

73
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:18,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have provided them what we believe that they need from us, and they will go back and look at the calendar on their end and advise about what our timetable can be going forward.

74
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:24,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they thanked us for being prompt and on the ball and

75
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:34,127
[SPEAKER_02]: did mention that there's a lot of communities when we were admitted, 19 communities were admitted, which is sort of on the higher end of what they normally do.

76
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:38,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're working their way through that to get us a slot as soon as possible.

77
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:44,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm expecting that we will hear something from them in the next week or so about what our possible timeline can be.

78
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:53,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll make adjustments to the timeline that we discussed when we were last together to line up with whatever the MSBA has to say.

79
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,025
[SPEAKER_02]: the notice about the OPM.

80
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm expecting that.

81
00:04:58,307 --> 00:04:58,447
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

82
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

83
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:23,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other reason that we are convening tonight, just, um, by way of, like, sort of the process, um, what we are waiting for is a letter from the MSBA confirming the conversation that we had today and their approval of our selection of that field.

84
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:28,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we get that, um, we will be asked to sign that letter.

85
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mayor is on top to do that.

86
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But before she can do that, we all have to take a vote to approve

87
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,289
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the signing of that contract.

88
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:41,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really the entire agenda for today.

89
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just have one quick scheduling note at the end.

90
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's our entire agenda for today.

91
00:05:47,651 --> 00:06:01,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to find out, um, if anybody had any questions about that or if there is a motion to approve that, that we can consider, uh, Brian.

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a quick question.

93
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:08,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was reading through the proposal earlier and just to clarify the cost estimates.

94
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:22,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, I know they slated at the very end, you know, a couple possibilities of two smaller ones or one larger one, and they've got PMNC on board, or it looks like they would bring PMNC on board to do that.

95
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:30,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that coming out of the flat fee for these guys, or is that something that's additional tacked on if and when?

96
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So just curious about the independent cost estimates.

97
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:34,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

98
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:37,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Jen Carlson, do you want to answer that question?

99
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might have to make her a co-host.

100
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:50,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

101
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:50,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone hear me now?

102
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:51,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

103
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:53,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

104
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:53,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

105
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to answer that question.

106
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those are slated.

107
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are on top of the fee of $525,000.

108
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, what happens, we will run

109
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:20,973
[SPEAKER_01]: The architect will have their own estimator, and then we will have an independent estimator on top of that so that the two can reconcile their estimates.

110
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,857
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens usually at the PDP phase.

111
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:31,382
[SPEAKER_01]: The first phase, we can talk about whether we want to have one at the PSR phase.

112
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:36,287
[SPEAKER_01]: The designer is required to do an estimate at the PSR, that first checkpoint,

113
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,589
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at PDP, we'll have two estimators.

114
00:07:40,789 --> 00:08:04,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it sounds like if the project is interested in bringing a CM at risk on board, instead of having the OPM provide an estimate, we typically have the construction manager provide one plus the designer, but it's not unheard of if you wanted to have a third one at that schematic design phase.

115
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,905
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we'll definitely get into more in detail on and figure out what the committee wants to do with that.

116
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:15,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is on top of outside of that fee.

117
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thanks.

118
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that there could be an additional charge.

119
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:25,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

120
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:25,976
[SPEAKER_00]: You bet.

121
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

122
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to approve?

123
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion to approve the contract for left field.

124
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:53,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, motion to approve the contract by Dr. Galussi.

125
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:55,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll second.

126
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Dr. Cushing.

127
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions or comments before we take a vote?

128
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I will call the roll.

129
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:19,153

[SPEAKER_00]: I think he mentioned his mic's not working.

155
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:04,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, do we have...

156

[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick scheduling note.

162
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on setting up a standing monthly meeting going forward and I have been working with Matt and Lisa Malone from the superintendent's office on a proposed schedule there so that we can all put these things on our calendar for many months to come.

163
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we'll work on that and try to get that buttoned up this week.

164
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:54,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a meeting in person next week and we'll actually dive into the designer selection phase and a bit more detail in terms of what to expect and what the plans are and how we're going to proceed.

165
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:00,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully we'll have some more information from MSBA about what our timeline looks like at that time as well.

166
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it will be a good time for us to meet.

167
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll work on that.

168
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So look forward to meeting invitations from Lisa Malone.

169
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should be good to go there.

170
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be able to get that on the calendar so people can plan accordingly.

171
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the whole meeting.

172
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there is a motion to adjourn, I'd be happy to entertain it.
