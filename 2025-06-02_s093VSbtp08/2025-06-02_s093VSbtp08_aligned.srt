She's here.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,161
I just made her a co-host.

24
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:09,841
My apologies.

25
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:12,743

Here.

Here.

32
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:20,650
Tracy Keene.

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:21,891
Here.

34
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,572
Emily Lazaro.

35
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:26,634
I don't see Emily yet.

36
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:28,396
Nicole Morrell.

37
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,518
I don't see her yet.

38
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:32,639
Aaron Olopade.

39
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,340
Here.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,621

Bob Dickinson here.

43
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:55,595
Fiona Maxwell.

44
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,156
I don't see Fiona.

45
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:01,678
Uh, we'll Pippa Sally.

46
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:02,378
I saw.

47
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:07,760
Well, here, uh, Chad Fallon here.

48
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,783
Lori Hodgkin, John McLaughlin.

49
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:13,763
I'm here.

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,090
Oh, I see Luke.

51
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,430
OK.

52
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,491
Paul Rousseau?

53
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:21,611
Here.

54
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,672
Philip Santos?

55
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:29,373
I don't see Philip.

56
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:31,193
And Lisa Miller?

57
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:32,393
Here.

58
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:33,714
OK.

59
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:41,055
So we have 13 present, two absent.

60
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:42,776
So we do have a quorum.

61
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,441
As I mentioned, I think this will be a relatively quick meeting.

62
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,664
Just a couple of updates.

63
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:56,672
We did go to the OPM panel review with MSBA earlier today.

64
00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:00,456
We were the only community that they had this time, so I think they

65
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,959
actually had, like, more time to ask us questions.

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:18,731
The review went really well, thanks to the left-field team for providing the information that MSBA requested, and I already saw a follow-up to one of the questions that they had go over, so that should be all taken care of.

67
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:34,376
Um, they had questions about, um, and noted that, um, some of the things that we saw, the OPM selection committee saw and left field and recommended around student involvement, um, definitely stood out to them as well.

68
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:39,838
Um, and the other big point of discussion was the timeline and,

69
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:47,882
We did lay out in our package that we are looking to move as quickly as we possibly can.

70
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:52,844
And so we had some good, healthy discussion about that with the MSBA team.

71
00:03:53,925 --> 00:04:01,809
And we have provided them all of our deliverables for this next gate, which will be to bring on a designer or an architect.

72
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:06,071
who will actually be able to do that feasibility study that we're all like waiting for.

73
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:18,777
So we have provided them what we believe that they need from us, and they will go back and look at the calendar on their end and advise about what our timetable can be going forward.

74
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:24,860
So, you know, they thanked us for being prompt and on the ball and

75
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:34,127
did mention that there's a lot of communities when we were admitted, 19 communities were admitted, which is sort of on the higher end of what they normally do.

76
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:38,109
So they're working their way through that to get us a slot as soon as possible.

77
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:44,432
So I'm expecting that we will hear something from them in the next week or so about what our possible timeline can be.

78
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:53,356
And then we'll make adjustments to the timeline that we discussed when we were last together to line up with whatever the MSBA has to say.

79
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,025
the notice about the OPM.

80
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,247
So I'm expecting that.

81
00:04:58,307 --> 00:04:58,447
No.

82
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:58,567
Okay.

83
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:23,962
Um, the other reason that we are convening tonight, just, um, by way of, like, sort of the process, um, what we are waiting for is a letter from the MSBA confirming the conversation that we had today and their approval of our selection of that field.

84
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:28,603
And once we get that, um, we will be asked to sign that letter.

85
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,924
So the mayor is on top to do that.

86
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:35,005
But before she can do that, we all have to take a vote to approve

87
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,289
um, the signing of that contract.

88
00:05:38,429 --> 00:05:41,630
So that's really the entire agenda for today.

89
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,730
And then I just have one quick scheduling note at the end.

90
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,611
Um, but that's our entire agenda for today.

91
00:05:47,651 --> 00:06:01,135
So I just wanted to find out, um, if anybody had any questions about that or if there is a motion to approve that, that we can consider, uh, Brian.

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,702
I do have a quick question.

93
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:08,978
I just was reading through the proposal earlier and just to clarify the cost estimates.

94
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:22,142
I'm curious, I know they slated at the very end, you know, a couple possibilities of two smaller ones or one larger one, and they've got PMNC on board, or it looks like they would bring PMNC on board to do that.

95
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:30,469
Is that coming out of the flat fee for these guys, or is that something that's additional tacked on if and when?

96
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,951
So just curious about the independent cost estimates.

97
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:34,312
Sure.

98
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:37,015
Jen Carlson, do you want to answer that question?

99
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,349
I think we might have to make her a co-host.

100
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:50,092
Hello.

101
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:50,792
Can everyone hear me now?

102
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:51,752
Yes.

103
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:53,153
Fantastic.

104
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:53,513
Thank you.

105
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,394
I would love to answer that question.

106
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,034
Yes, those are slated.

107
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,695
Those are on top of the fee of $525,000.

108
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,716
Typically, what happens, we will run

109
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:20,973
The architect will have their own estimator, and then we will have an independent estimator on top of that so that the two can reconcile their estimates.

110
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,857
That happens usually at the PDP phase.

111
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:31,382
The first phase, we can talk about whether we want to have one at the PSR phase.

112
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:36,287
The designer is required to do an estimate at the PSR, that first checkpoint,

113
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,589
and then at PDP, we'll have two estimators.

114
00:07:40,789 --> 00:08:04,139
And then it sounds like if the project is interested in bringing a CM at risk on board, instead of having the OPM provide an estimate, we typically have the construction manager provide one plus the designer, but it's not unheard of if you wanted to have a third one at that schematic design phase.

115
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,905
something that we'll definitely get into more in detail on and figure out what the committee wants to do with that.

116
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:15,047
But it is on top of outside of that fee.

117
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,311
Great, thanks.

118
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,815
I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that there could be an additional charge.

119
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:25,276
Yes, thank you.

120
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:25,976
You bet.

121
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,421
Any other questions?

122
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,087
Is there a motion to approve?

123
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,132
I'll make a motion to approve the contract for left field.

124
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:53,295
Okay, motion to approve the contract by Dr. Galussi.

125
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:55,597
I'll second.

126
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,358
Seconded by Dr. Cushing.

127
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,122
Any other questions or comments before we take a vote?

128
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,413
Okay, so I will call the roll.

129
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:19,153
Jenny Graham?

130
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:19,513
Yes.

131
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:20,594
Mayor Lungo Kern?

132
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:22,876
Yes.

133
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:24,737
Dr. Galluzzi?

134
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,398
Yes.

135
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:27,278
Dr. Cushing?

136
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:27,999
Yes.

137
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,640
Marta Cabral?

138
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,220
Yes.

139
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:31,441
Libby Brown?

140
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:32,141
Yes.

141
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:33,742
Marissa Desmond?

142
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:37,665
Yes.

143
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:39,907
Maria Dorsey?

144
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,107
Yes.

145
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:42,969
Brian Hilliard?

146
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,089
Yes.

147
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,310
Tracy Keene?

148
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:46,231
Yes.

149
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,013
Malia Lazzaro is absent.

150
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,494
Nicole Morrell is absent.

151
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,255
Aaron Olopade?

152
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:53,936
Yes.

153
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:55,056
Luke Prisner?

154
00:09:55,077 --> 00:10:01,020
I think he mentioned his mic's not working.

155
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:04,783
Let's see, do we have...

156
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,539
Yes, OK, we've got a yes.

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,781
And Joan Bowen?

158
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:09,441
Yes.

159
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:14,505
So 13 in the affirmative, 2 absent, 0 in the negative.

160
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,207
Motion passes.

161
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,789
Just a quick scheduling note.

162
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:37,005
We are working on setting up a standing monthly meeting going forward and I have been working with Matt and Lisa Malone from the superintendent's office on a proposed schedule there so that we can all put these things on our calendar for many months to come.

163
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:41,816
Um, so we'll work on that and try to get that buttoned up this week.

164
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:54,227
We do have a meeting in person next week and we'll actually dive into the designer selection phase and a bit more detail in terms of what to expect and what the plans are and how we're going to proceed.

165
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:00,030
And hopefully we'll have some more information from MSBA about what our timeline looks like at that time as well.

166
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,711
So I think it will be a good time for us to meet.

167
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,092
And so we'll work on that.

168
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,234
So look forward to meeting invitations from Lisa Malone.

169
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:15,258
And we should be good to go there.

170
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,919
And we'll be able to get that on the calendar so people can plan accordingly.

171
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,841
And that is the whole meeting.

172
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,173
So if there is a motion to adjourn, I'd be happy to entertain it.

173
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,397
Motion to adjourn.

174
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,779
