[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Administration and Finance Committee on February 27, 2024 at 6 p.m.

16
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,902
[SPEAKER_01]: in the City Council Chamber at Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom.

17
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:44,008
[SPEAKER_01]: The action and discussion items for tonight's meeting are, there's just one, paper 22-494, Resolution to Draft a Budget Ordinance for the City of Medford, initially proposed September 2022.

18
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:49,931
[SPEAKER_01]: There were five committee meetings in 2023, in February, March, October, November, and December.

19
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:54,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are now meeting on it once more.

20
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:59,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've ironed out pretty much all of the details.

21
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to quickly just share my screen.

22
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:08,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one moment.

23
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:27,730
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have not, I'm going to share my screen.

24
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:48,089
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this is our agenda item, and you can see if folks go to MedfordMA.CivicClerk.com, you can find all of our meeting information here, our action and discussion item for tonight, all of the committee reports, a variety of documents attached.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,131
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be looking at the latest version, which I'll just go through.

26
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,753
[SPEAKER_01]: which we sent to the administration.

27
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,875
[SPEAKER_01]: The administration did send back a response.

28
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:03,480
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, this is adding to our Chapter 3 finance.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,042
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not changing anything.

30
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:10,026
[SPEAKER_01]: We're adding a purpose and intent of the article, but then not changing any of the existing provisions.

31
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:17,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds a new Article 5, annual budget process, and a new Article 6, budget needs assessments.

32
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:32,221
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see all the tracked language change here, but essentially this would create quarterly financial reports and meetings where the city council will meet with the finance director 60 days after the end of each quarter.

33
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:46,746
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be discussed would be previous quarter accounts payable warrant by month for each month, the year to date budget to actuals report on audited, where available, any updates on state certifications and revenue forecasts.

34
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:59,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would hold a committee or subcommittee to review the 2nd and 3rd quarter financial reports no later than 60 days after the end of the quarter coordinating the date and time of the meeting with the finance director to attend.

35
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:04,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get into the budget process.

36
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:21,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, we outlined this in a resolution last week for this process, but we would start with city council budget recommendations, members of the city council submitting individual recommendations for consideration by the full council by March 1st.

37
00:03:21,864 --> 00:03:24,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks get your recommendations in by Friday.

38
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:32,996
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we discuss in a resolution, then we would consider those recommendations as a council and submit them to the mayor by March 22.

39
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump back up here.

40
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:49,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We would start having, after that, some preliminary budget meetings between April 15th and May 15th with the mayor-designee, finance director-designee, relevant department heads.

41
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,963
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor is providing an estimated budget allocation to the Medford Public Schools by March 1st as well.

42
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:02,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working with the administration to schedule these meetings.

43
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:10,507
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor finance director shall provide a schedule that contains the order in which they're discussed based on staff availability and administration priorities.

44
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:26,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Those meetings would also have information for those meetings, including the annual operating budget for the previous year, the department heads budget requests for the upcoming year, and then a list of any new staff programs or services requested for the upcoming year.

45
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:43,489
[SPEAKER_01]: following that, those meetings, so we'd have the recommendations of the council, preliminary budget meetings with department heads and the mayor and the finance director, and then the mayor would submit a comprehensive budget proposal by May 31st of each year.

46
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:51,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, we could request, the council can request additional budget meetings to review specific proposed department budgets.

47
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:57,334
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor, budget, finance director, designees may also request additional meetings.

48
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:12,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And the comprehensive proposal would contain total expected amount of general fund revenue, including the expected property tax revenue, expected state aid, expected local receipts, as well as the proposed annual operating budget for each department.

49
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:19,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we discussed previously, including just simple top lines of

50
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:24,909
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how much of the budget is paying for things we already did in the previous year.

51
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:34,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, for example, how much of an increase is coming is just paying for fixed cost growth, like union contracts, or the increase of the trash contract, etc.

52
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:39,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how much of any change is paying for new programs or new expenses, and that can let people see.

53
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:50,911
[SPEAKER_01]: very simply that most of the time, even when budgets go up in a nominal dollar term, it's really just paying for something that we were already paying for in the past because the cost of that has gone up year to year.

54
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:57,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were 2 other items, which I know that the previous committee that ordinances and rules committee.

55
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:09,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Has been pretty insistent on, and the administration has been insistent that it's not really it's a capacity question to be able to do these, but there's 2 items 1st is section 3105.

56
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is reviewing the progress to include additional funds and the comprehensive budget proposal.

57
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:24,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we would like to see if possible, and we've had folks can read the committee reports.

58
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have to belabor everybody with the.

59
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:50,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the discussion for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th time necessarily tonight, since it's already been had, and it is already written for the record, but the subcommittee previously, and we'll see if that is still where the committee is really would like to see more of the city's total spending and revenue included in the budget process, including our enterprise fund.

60
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,501
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, capital improvement plan, revolving funds, grant funds.

61
00:06:55,121 --> 00:07:09,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so in lieu of including that understanding that the capacity is not there in the finance office, there's a section here that would say that the request that have the annually no later than October 15th, the mayor finance director or designee submit a report to the council.

62
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:30,804
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding the progress towards including those items in future comprehensive budget proposals and then that'd be followed up by a meeting between a council meeting with the mayor finance director or designee to present that report and answer questions and also consider updates to this ordinance if there are new procedures to be included.

63
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:47,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a similar item, you know, initially this proposal had started with not just a scope of having a budget schedule established by ordinance, but also this idea of budget needs assessments.

64
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:56,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So really trying to determine what our medium and long-term operating and capital expense needs are so that we can understand

65
00:07:57,265 --> 00:08:08,209
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're spending money on a capital plan or when we're saying, you know, trying to understand what it would take to provide an additional level of service or a higher level of service for a department.

66
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:09,989
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that going to cost?

67
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:19,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, through our discussions, it's clear that the resources and staffing levels in the finance department would need to be increased in order to accomplish that goal.

68
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:23,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that in some aspects, we would be breaking new ground

69
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:32,945
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, some communities, most communities don't necessarily have the resources to put together reports of this nature as well.

70
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:37,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a similar fashion, the latest draft from our

71
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:51,222
[SPEAKER_01]: December 2023 meeting just also includes that annually, same dates and times the mayor finance director designee can submit a report regarding progress towards creating these documents.

72
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:55,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would have a meeting to discuss those reports if needed.

73
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:59,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And the administration also shared a response.

74
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:06,672
[SPEAKER_01]: and generally believe we're very close to being in agreement with the current draft.

75
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:09,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Main concern are those two sections regarding the annual reports.

76
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:21,445
[SPEAKER_01]: As stated in past meetings, we're not equipped to take this responsibility on presently and recommend that the committee defer discussion on these items until after at least a year so we can assess how things are going.

77
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:27,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Resource constraints are going to be tested and not having capability for those sections.

78
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,453
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, it's not there.

79
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:37,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And driving this point home, the capital improvement planning process takes over a year to complete.

80
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just another item to add in there.

81
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,977
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope the committee will be amenable to these exclusions.

82
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:46,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all trying to work together to better our process has been attainable.

83
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:50,941
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor and I do not want to set up our departments for failure given our role in the organization.

84
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,604
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe we have the best understanding of their resource constraints.

85
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:57,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where things were left.

86
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:09,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I did send another message saying, at least my understanding of the prior committee, is that if the report simply says we still can't do it, then that would be something that

87
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,501
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've had a lot of discussions on this.

88
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:19,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we understand the position of the administration that the resources, that this is a resource, this is a resource intensive act and the resources are not there.

89
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:23,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just, but that was just my personal opinion as one counselor.

90
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,769
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I just didn't want to put that out there.

91
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:38,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a summary, I think in a few minutes of everything that's happened up until this point, I will go to members of the council, but since I did read some responses from the administration, I do want to,

92
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:46,278
[SPEAKER_01]: let you chime in if I've mischaracterized anything before we move to discussion by the council.

93
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:49,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So recognize the Chief of Staff or the Finance Director at this time.

94
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to defer to the Finance Director if you'd like to start.

95
00:10:56,861 --> 00:11:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything specific on my end at this time.

96
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:05,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

97
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Push.

98
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:07,448
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

99
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:19,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nor do I. I think you've adequately summarized what's been going on in our general position on this.

100
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:29,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that we'd like to get the ball rolling, but we don't know how the ball rolling is going to actually pan out.

101
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:31,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we're like,

102
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: looking way forward to say, you know, these are obvious things that we want to get in there.

103
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question really is when we go to an October 15th report to the council, it may simply be, okay, we managed to do X, Y, and Z, but we're still not there to do, you know, move on to the next stage of that.

104
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:04,011
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be our concern is how rigid the council wants that documentation to be.

105
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:13,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously, once something is set in stone, it's set in stone in an ordinance.

106
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:15,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to comply.

107
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:27,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the council is thinking that this is simply an update on progress towards these goals, then yeah, that's

108
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,961
[SPEAKER_02]: That's understandable and doable.

109
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:42,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to keep everything we vote on, that you vote the council votes on, going forward to be something that everybody feels is achievable.

110
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my main concern, given the people I've got to do it all.

111
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:50,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I am.

112
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:52,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Director Dickinson.

113
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:54,516
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

114
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:55,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Discussion by the council.

115
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:57,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Councilor Zaro.

116
00:12:58,909 --> 00:12:59,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

117
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:00,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that summary.

118
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really helpful to hear everything laid out in that way.

119
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just a question for the chair.

120
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:27,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the communication from the chief of staff, it sounds like because of the capital improvement planning process for this year, it sounds like maybe

121
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:39,714
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a one-year delay in that one portion, would that be something that we could have an understanding that that would maybe be something that we could just set aside for the first year, and then we could approve everything going forward?

122
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:50,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Or on a yearly basis, we could sort of say, oh, there's one portion that we need to delay, and just an understanding that there may be various things that come up, but everything doesn't have to be

123
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:58,744
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no penalty if something happens and we can't necessarily see everything as clear as day.

124
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:04,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we're doing taxes and you get audited and you have to pay a fee.

125
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:20,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that understanding that we're all working together on trying to get the most transparent process possible and share all this information with the people of Medford so that there are no, it's not a surprise when we have the budget

126
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:34,710
[SPEAKER_03]: season upon us, that being the goal of everybody, then I wouldn't see any problem to understanding that something, especially in the first few years, may take a little bit longer or may have a couple of bumps in the road.

127
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't anticipate that being an issue on my end.

128
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:54,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Councilor Zaria and to Director Dickinson's point at this point we've stripped out anything beyond just saying we'd like to see this let us know every fall how how well we're doing or how not how far we've gotten how not far we've gotten depending on where we are.

129
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Vice President Collins.

130
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Behrs.

131
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:03,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks as always for being here and collaborating on this with us.

132
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Same to the Chief of Staff.

133
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:10,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to echo what my colleagues just shared, I think the

134
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:17,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I certainly share the concern.

135
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:22,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important to not be legislating something that we don't know is within our capacity or beyond our capacity.

136
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:28,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely appreciate the focus on that as we're still crafting this in draft form.

137
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:39,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely agree to me the intent of the language that's currently in that section of the ordinance is just to create kind of some sort of timestamp for a check-in.

138
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:51,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the term report usually connotated as like a very structured, very detailed, like it must have X, Y, and Z type of document.

139
00:15:51,735 --> 00:16:02,498
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, the intent is just to make sure that once a year we have some kind of record of here's where we were last year, here's where we are this year in terms of

140
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:05,755
[SPEAKER_04]: are we approaching it?

141
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:07,756
[SPEAKER_04]: What new tools have we developed?

142
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:12,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What is our sense right now of what we might need to get closer to that goal?

143
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:19,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And not some sort of mandate, not some sort of, you know, if it doesn't have this section, then it's invalid or something like that.

144
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:29,302
[SPEAKER_04]: A fairly, you know, the phrase I would use, I wouldn't put this in the ordinances, I would be pretty comfortable with this being as formal or as informal as possible.

145
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,707
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity allows it to be while we're trying to get this annual process off the ground.

146
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:49,357
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important to me is just knowing that we're going to have some kind of document and some kind of check-in in the fall every year that allows us to chart our progress towards the better information and the sophistication that I know the administration is already working towards and that we're eager to support.

147
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

148
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Councillor Zang.

149
00:16:55,359 --> 00:17:04,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think to my fellow counselors points, um, I think this is meant to be a lot more, I guess, more informative and less scary than it sounds.

150
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the.

151
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:09,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I believe that the council is already.

152
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:17,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a step back when it comes to what exactly this report entails and the details that has to entail.

153
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:26,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I think where we've become over the last few months, much more open minded as to what the broad definition of a report and what types of information we're seeing.

154
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:30,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And as President bears said, the.

155
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:33,150
[SPEAKER_00]: the committee at the very least.

156
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:43,457
[SPEAKER_00]: As a councilor on this committee, I would be also amenable to the report just saying, the city does not have the resources to do this at this moment.

157
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,899
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a feasible option.

158
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:58,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there is a way to reduce maybe any hesitation or fear that the administration might have and yet need a compromise on this topic.

159
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:14,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the lines of what Councillor Ilazaro said about finding dates of effectiveness that work for the section that work for the administration for the section, maybe delaying it a year or putting in the words.

160
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:31,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of saying just a report to council regarding progress towards and resources necessary to do X, Y, and Z, to say a report to council regarding progress towards, resources necessary for, and the feasibility of including.

161
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:38,768
[SPEAKER_00]: x, y, z. And I think that would be maybe slightly broader and yet still get at the same spirit of what the council is looking for.

162
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:48,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know as Director Dickinson, you said, you don't know what council we're going to be working with in five years or 10 years.

163
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:59,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that adjustment in wording will give you guys more leeway in terms of what you can do legally with an ordinance like this in the future.

164
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:06,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Any further comment from members of the Council?

165
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:15,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Any discussion from the Chief of Staff or the Finance Director?

166
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:19,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Chief of Staff?

167
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:22,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, and good evening.

168
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:27,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I said good evening when I first greeted the council, so, or the committee.

169
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think most of the things have been stated.

170
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:42,386
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I appreciate the collaboration by this committee, the prior subcommittee, the council in general on this subject.

171
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:45,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I feel I'm,

172
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:50,419
[SPEAKER_05]: probably should reiterate some of the concerns I've expressed.

173
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:53,662
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already been stated, so I won't spend a lot of time.

174
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:58,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I continue to be concerned, and it was stated by Bob, and then...

175
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Acknowledged by councilor saying and I appreciate that.

176
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that this committee understands that.

177
00:20:09,836 --> 00:20:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the concerns that I've expressed that we've expressed collectively at these meetings come from a place of wanting to make sure that we're not.

178
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,562
[SPEAKER_05]: putting future councils and future administrations in conflict with one another.

179
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:38,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we recognize that this council or this committee may be agreeable, and presumably the council, hopefully, we would hope would be agreeable to a very simple report.

180
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:48,429
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's been acknowledgment by this committee that, you know, we have resource constraints that are perhaps even more challenging than other communities.

181
00:20:51,949 --> 00:21:07,172
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially discussing the codification of an ordinance that would create, you know, I realize that there's nothing like that would occur if something didn't happen.

182
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that sentiment very much.

183
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I do point out, though, that it becomes law.

184
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And once something becomes law, we are legally obligated to follow it.

185
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to do everything in our power to follow it.

186
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:26,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we would never willingly or knowingly attempt to break the law.

187
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what this becomes.

188
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:28,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It becomes law.

189
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:31,163
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about something that's optional.

190
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,645
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about something we must abide by.

191
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall abide by.

192
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:43,810
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be no necessarily penalties, but that doesn't change how our administration operates when it pertains to those kinds of things.

193
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:49,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that comes some uncertainty, right?

194
00:21:49,417 --> 00:22:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to present, hopefully, a good opportunity to collectively establish an understanding on how the budget needs to be laid out by what timelines.

195
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:11,326
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and as we establish other criteria, for instance, you know, one aspect of this budget

196
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:16,460
[SPEAKER_05]: ordinance, this law, will be that the city shall

197
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: ensure that the city council receives the accounts payable warrant on a, I don't recall if it's, I think it's quarterly basis.

198
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:34,374
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been trying to keep up with doing it monthly recently, but I am behind a few months right now, and that is on me.

199
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So once this ordinance goes into place, I can't be behind.

200
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:42,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to drop something else.

201
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:45,637
[SPEAKER_05]: and I must follow that.

202
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:51,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that's not required by law has to be put aside, and I have to follow this.

203
00:22:51,419 --> 00:23:01,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, at present, many of you, all of you, I'm sure, know that I'm presently supporting the elections office, so there's a lot of laws that need to be followed there, too.

204
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:09,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know what happens in a scenario where we have, you know, a lot of different laws we have to follow all at the same time.

205
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:13,063
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have to figure out how to support

206
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:25,219
[SPEAKER_05]: the process to ensure that, you know, some other department or some other staff in the mayor's office, for instance, is dropping something that they're working on to support this.

207
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, just.

208
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:51,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Not here to necessarily present a very large argument, but just to put everyone on notice, make sure everyone understands that, you know, what we're talking about is wanting very much to ensure that not only promises that we keep are kept, because that is obviously something we strive to do, and by agreeing to an ordinance like this,

209
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're essentially making a commitment, but it's also law.

210
00:23:56,281 --> 00:24:01,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my comments, and I appreciate everyone's time and energy that's gone into this.

211
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:01,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

212
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

213
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Any further comments or discussion?

214
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:19,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing none, is there any member of the public who'd like to speak?

215
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,802
[SPEAKER_01]: on Zoom as we don't see anyone here in the chamber with us.

216
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: You can raise your hand on Zoom.

217
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing none, Vice President Collins.

218
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:38,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Barras.

219
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:43,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just collecting my thoughts.

220
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly appreciate

221
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:51,358
[SPEAKER_04]: You know everything that the chief of staff has shared in this meeting and other and others.

222
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The, I think the point is really well taken and I definitely appreciate the spirit of, you know, just being transparent

223
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:14,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know that these are things that we all want to do, and I really appreciate the clarity around, you know, I know experientially what you want to do and commit to do and what you can do are not always a perfectly overlapping Venn diagram.

224
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, as a city, we see how that plays out with our various challenges and episodes and things that we go through in trying to manage our capacity as a city overall.

225
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:26,564
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to note that that point is really well taken.

226
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:31,602
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this ordinance has changed a lot.

227
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:44,185
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that, again, and I respect the diversity of opinion about the exact language that this section is put into, one thing that makes me personally feel comfortable is just how flexible the language of this section is.

228
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:57,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I've made it clear before, you know, that in my mind, this says, you know, shall submit a report and doesn't really get prescriptive about what that has to look like beyond touching on certain topics.

229
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:09,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It does bring to mind to me because the Chief of Staff mentioned the Elections Department in terms of, you know, I think this conversation is a lot about thinking through contingencies.

230
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,819
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the years when this report isn't like all that we would dream it to be?

231
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite recently, the City Council asked for an elections after action report from the Elections Department and that report was not all that we dreamed it to be.

232
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:26,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked about it and

233
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:35,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was how we took that document and got some meaning out of it by, you know, that spring conversation about, you know, this is what we would like to see in it.

234
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time, these are the questions that we still have.

235
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:45,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The conversation that we had about the report, I think, answered a little bit more some of those questions that weren't answered in the text of it.

236
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just bring that up as an example of

237
00:26:50,001 --> 00:27:04,815
[SPEAKER_04]: um, why I feel comfortable with this language, knowing that, you know, I don't know, like, maybe we'll never have a season of going through this process laid out in the, uh, laid out in the ordinance where it will feel very challenging to do that.

238
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:09,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll feel, feel seamless, you know, starting this fall, maybe it won't.

239
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but

240
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:26,807
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's not seamless, if there's friction there, if it's challenging to get a report together, if the report, like, has to be very concise, if the report has to be really bare bones the first year, if, you know, we read the report and we still have questions, well, I feel like we already have a model for how that can go.

241
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:38,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that even just having a simple document to start out with, that's a jumping off point for a discussion in committee or written follow-up, to me, that's still productive to have, even if

242
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:42,360
[SPEAKER_04]: that conversation is about what's not included.

243
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just offer that.

244
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:51,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, and I just do want to note that the first main article regarding the budget would go into effect.

245
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:57,468
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make an amendment because it says becomes effective January 1, 2024, and it is obviously

246
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,537
[SPEAKER_01]: March or February 27, 2024.

247
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:09,084
[SPEAKER_01]: The second section regarding the, and still this just is just about a report at this point.

248
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:10,325
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't actually outline.

249
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:14,529
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a progress report rather than a comprehensive.

250
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis of budgetary needs that would not go into effect until next January 2025.

251
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:23,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Councillor Seng.

252
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:26,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Barras.

253
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,254
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spirit of the work that we've been doing on this committee,

254
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:37,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are two new members here too, so I wanted to recap a little bit.

255
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:50,407
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we first had a meeting on this, we had a draft that I think everyone in the room agreed was the model of what a budget assessment ordinance should look like.

256
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:54,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was contention over what was realistic and what was possible.

257
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe this draft that we see in front of us today,

258
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:06,179
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the result of good faith negotiations from all parties on all of those points.

259
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,843
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really thrown anything out of the window.

260
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:15,449
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just come to work point by point and come to places of consensus and agreement on this.

261
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:21,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've also operated with the assumption that the committee wants to see all these things in it.

262
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,478
[SPEAKER_00]: and is not ready to move forward with an ordinance without a lot of the components.

263
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:35,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with that assumption, with that understanding of this draft ordinance, that's where a lot of that good faith negotiation came from.

264
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:49,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that, you know, it seems from my read of what we're talking about, what we've been talking about over the last 20 minutes, it doesn't sound like the committee is ready to just toss out this section.

265
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,868
[SPEAKER_00]: of the of the ordinance.

266
00:29:52,168 --> 00:30:13,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would, I know Councilor Lazar, Councilor Collins, myself, we've all presented ways for us to, on this point, reach that point of consensus, that shared understanding of how do we balance, you know, the administration's concerns and understandings of our

267
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:28,406
[SPEAKER_00]: are the feasibility of doing a lot of this stuff with the ideals and the moral, I guess, the needs of our community to get this information transparently and for our council to get the information so we can make better financial decisions as a city.

268
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:41,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I'm saying is, I would love if we can engage in that discourse with the administration as to how can we make the section work better.

269
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not assume that we're throwing this out of the window.

270
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:51,297
[SPEAKER_00]: What language changes can we make to get everyone on the same page here?

271
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just posit that we won't.

272
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we're that far apart, but I think

273
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:06,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the administration has made it clear they would prefer it not to be there.

274
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:16,166
[SPEAKER_01]: My assertion, and I mean this in the kindest of ways, is that we've already thrown out the two sections, and now we're just saying, what would it take to get them back in?

275
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:21,468
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just putting my cards on the table.

276
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We've said, we hear you.

277
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not feasible.

278
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,212
[SPEAKER_01]: All we want to do is every year check in on future feasibility.

279
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:32,554
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just my two cents.

280
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:36,035
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's word changes that make people feel better, I have no problem with it.

281
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's where I'm at.

282
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:43,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have 2 things I wanted to add to the to the conversation.

283
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:46,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is 1.

284
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think.

285
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:56,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was putting together the resolution to talk about the fiscal 25 budget, and I realized that I think sections.

286
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:06,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I think section what is currently city council budget recommendations to the mayor should come before preliminary budget meetings because it's chronologically an earlier step in the process.

287
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it might read easier if those 2 sections were swapped.

288
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sorry, I was just reading through this 1 last time to catch any specific.

289
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:19,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Just technical things.

290
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:27,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only other one was just that we should change the effective date of Article 5.

291
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it, but putting those on the table as well.

292
00:32:32,636 --> 00:32:38,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Further discussion on Councilor Sang's point or any other technical amendments?

293
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:44,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Collins.

294
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:50,039
[SPEAKER_04]: The version of the document that I'm looking at is the track changes one.

295
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:59,902
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate to make a motion to accept the track changes along with those other technical amendments around the effective date and swapping the order of those sections?

296
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:01,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

297
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:03,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me... I can go back to screen share.

298
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:12,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a... This looks like the document 12-20-2023.

299
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that seem right?

300
00:33:14,672 --> 00:33:16,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the one in the packet.

301
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:16,873
[SPEAKER_01]: In the packet.

302
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:17,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what I attached.

303
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:24,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd be motion to accept all of the track changes in here.

304
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also to swap sections 103, 102, and 3103.

305
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:29,252
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

306
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to swap the order of sections 3102 and 3103.

307
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have the effective date.

308
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want to say?

309
00:33:50,464 --> 00:34:00,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Section 3154, I think that effective date is corrected by adopting the track changes, but section 3108, motion to switch the effective date to January 1, 2025.

310
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:04,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Or should we just do it for when the ordinance is passed?

311
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:05,407
Sure.

312
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:06,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

313
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:09,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall become effective upon passage.

314
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're trying, yeah, that's right.

315
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds right.

316
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:19,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Changing the motion to let the article become effective on passage.

317
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:24,609
[SPEAKER_01]: and 3108.

318
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's see what happens here.

319
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:35,692
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a momentous occasion, everyone.

320
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We're accepting all of the track changes.

321
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:43,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Second from Councilor Sang.

322
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:46,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I shouldn't press the button until we've voted, right?

323
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:51,608
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

324
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:52,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Opposed?

325
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:54,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion passes.

326
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if my computer crashes.

327
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:02,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't crash, and it cut a whole page off of this thing.

328
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:08,295
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to move these two around.

329
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:28,833
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

330
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,455
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that should be in here now.

331
00:35:32,657 --> 00:35:41,124
[SPEAKER_01]: The article 5 effect on passage the next article not until 2025 swapped and it looks good.

332
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:49,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last thing is just I know there were several proposals to add additional language regarding the annual progress reports.

333
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:51,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Any motions on that.

334
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:54,236
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

335
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:55,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Any further discussion.

336
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief of staff, Madam Chief of staff.

337
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:06,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to complicate this, but under budget and procurement, we might want to do a quick cleanup.

338
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:10,418
[SPEAKER_05]: We presently have a chief procurement officer and a budget manager.

339
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:12,780
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just since we're already here.

340
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know exactly what language, but we can certainly look at it.

341
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:27,858
[SPEAKER_05]: If this committee is agreeable and that's just simply clean up, we can certainly relay it to the council, the proposed language.

342
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:31,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you'd like to do it here today, it's up to you all.

343
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:36,204
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to try it now?

344
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:38,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing some nods on taking a look at it now.

345
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:39,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

346
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:39,967
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

347
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:41,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

348
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:48,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what Muni Code says.

349
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,243
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

350
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,612
[SPEAKER_01]: One second here.

351
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:34,453
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

352
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:51,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how easy this is going to be and just looking at it right now, because it would seem to me that the chief procurement officer should, you know, have certain responsibilities and then the other responsibilities should fall into the finance director and not necessarily into the budget manager.

353
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:58,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we wouldn't necessarily expect that the budget manager would attend all city council budget subcommittee meetings.

354
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:05,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be something that might be, you know, would be something that we would, you know,

355
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:13,925
[SPEAKER_05]: The various sections that were just discussed have potentially alternative expectations versus this.

356
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:18,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how easy this is right now.

357
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:19,869
[SPEAKER_05]: We can certainly take a stab at it.

358
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe stab's not the right word.

359
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a bite at it.

360
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:32,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But I recognize it might not be that.

361
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So just reading this.

362
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:37,729
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I appreciate that, Madam Chief, so I just want to read.

363
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:42,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the Chief Budget and Procurement Officer, appointment term or authority.

364
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:51,659
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty, you know, some of this looks like it's from the pre-1987 charter era.

365
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know how much of this is, you know, holds water under the current charter.

366
00:39:03,004 --> 00:39:04,485
[SPEAKER_01]: or exactly what the updates were.

367
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:05,746
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I definitely agree with you.

368
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:10,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these seem to be obviously procurement, and some of them are budget related.

369
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:11,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are affected by the other sections.

370
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,092
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like these, section 2932 and 2933,

371
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:34,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, I don't know, yeah, this is pretty technical and it looks like it gets pretty deep into procurement law.

372
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:42,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it, you know, are we currently producing an annual report of the cost of all supplies furnished to each department or officer?

373
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:45,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that's happening?

374
00:39:45,727 --> 00:39:46,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, Bob?

375
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Question.

376
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:49,428
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

377
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:50,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts?

378
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,749
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like maybe we can't do this right now.

379
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:55,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Council Vice President.

380
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:58,710
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is just a simple finding the right

381
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,131
[SPEAKER_04]: term for the position and swapping it in.

382
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:07,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally would feel comfortable doing that from the floor, even if we refer this out to regular session tonight.

383
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:07,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

384
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:11,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you guys take a look through this and you have suggestions.

385
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:19,455
[SPEAKER_01]: we can just add the modernization pieces on the floor.

386
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:24,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Realistically, if I may, I didn't mean to interrupt anyone.

387
00:40:24,557 --> 00:40:29,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Realistically, depending upon the timeline of the council, it may be something we have to circle back to.

388
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: If the council wants to move quickly on the ordinance, it may be that we just aren't able to modify these sections right now.

389
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:38,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.

390
00:40:38,905 --> 00:40:39,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to put it out.

391
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:57,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and one of the things that we've been, you know, put out in the council governing agenda document is having just generally each committee review the ordinances that fall under their committee's authority for just general upgrades and updating.

392
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:05,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we found a lot of times, you know, going through, I know I did, I let snow and ice removal, Councillor Collins let on solid waste.

393
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:09,998
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a lot of anachronistic language in the city ordinances that really needs to be updated.

394
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:13,881
[SPEAKER_01]: We can wrap it up in that process at some point too.

395
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:30,095
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the administration has proposals on this outside of us, finding the time to just generally review ordinances, I don't think I for one would not object to taking a look at them and trying to incorporate them.

396
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:32,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

397
00:41:32,276 --> 00:41:36,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that and appreciate just the opportunity to open this up today and take a quick look.

398
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:38,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

399
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:46,739
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we have our amended document.

400
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any further motions?

402
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:53,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I would motion to report out of committee as amended.

403
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:58,143

00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:13,363
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

407
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:14,704

[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else anyone wants to do?

410
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:19,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Collins?

411
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:33,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like to thank Director Dickinson and the Chief of Staff for meeting with us about this so many times, this term, previous term, and for working through it and coming out with something that we can get a start on and I would motion to adjourn.

412
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:37,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, yeah, and I would echo those comments as well.

413
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:45,045
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done a lot of good work, many meetings, lots of edits, and I will go to Councilor Sang.

414
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,087
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also like to echo those sentiments.

415
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:53,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Councilor Collins, President Behrs, and I have sat through many of these meetings on this ordinance.

416
00:42:53,970 --> 00:43:03,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't overstate how important this is for Medford, how much time we spent on this.

417
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:06,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've created a product that our city can be really proud of.

418
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,520
[SPEAKER_00]: our residents can be very proud of as well.

419
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:20,186
[SPEAKER_00]: That really moves us forward as a team, all of us, in our goals of reaching more transparency, making better decisions for our city, creating more reform.

420
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:35,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the kind of positive spirit that so many residents have invested their faith in our government for, and I really want to thank you, Director Dickinson, our Chief of Staff, for working so hard with our committee on this.

421
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, any further comment on the motion to adjourn?

422
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:46,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Councillor Collins, seconded by Councillor Seng?

423
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, seconded by Councillor, I can't, sorry.

424
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have spoken up.

425
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,469
