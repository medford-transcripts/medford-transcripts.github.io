00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:04,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for waiting for us a little bit.

3
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,302
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to get our ducks in a row before opening up the meeting.

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just letting people file in.

5
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:12,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe everyone is in.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'll pass the baton to Chair Blumberg.

7
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:17,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Amanda.

8

00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:32,490
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also joined by Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, and Danielle Evans, our senior planner, will be joining us shortly.

34
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to take a moment to introduce a new graduate intern in our office, Clem Doucette.

35
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,493
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited to have them.

36
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:44,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that's everyone from Cityside who's attending tonight.

37
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:46,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to our first item on the agenda then.

39
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:55,239
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a review of a proposal from Tufts University.

40
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me read the public notice on this.

41
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:16,724
[SPEAKER_15]: This is regarding a meeting tonight relative to an application for site plan review submitted by the trustees of Tufts College to construct a two-story, 3,595 square foot infill addition to an existing building, Eaton Hall at 0 College Ave here in Medford,

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,865
[SPEAKER_15]: with landscaping and interior alterations.

43
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:26,867
[SPEAKER_15]: The project is subject to site plan review for Dover amendment uses per our zoning ordinance.

44
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:34,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is a bit of a new twist on our updated ordinance that a matter like this would be before us.

45
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,750
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, let me turn things over to the Tufts team.

46
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mr. Chair, can you hear me?

47
00:03:43,198 --> 00:04:00,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I can absolutely How are you doing attorney dash doing very well sir attorney Adam dash 48 Grove Street in Summerville and Davis Square representing the trustees of Tufts College with me tonight as you can see is Rocco Dorico the executive director of government and community relations for Tufts he and I will be doing presentation.

48
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:05,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Jennifer also with us just in case there are questions or we brought everybody just you never know.

49
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:10,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Jennifer Whitney, the Senior Project Manager for Capital Projects Department for Tufts is here.

50
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:15,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Nicholas Botts and Joy Wang from Niche Engineering.

51
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter Vieira from Payette Architects.

52
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Regan Shields-Ives from Feingold Alexander Architects.

53
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:25,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Nathan Scott, Associate Director of Capital Projects for Tufts as well.

54
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:31,695
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a fairly straightforward application, one would hope.

55
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to all of your colleagues.

56
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here tonight.

57
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:46,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for the benefit of those maybe in the public who are watching and interested, we did ask, given the nature of this work and its location,

58
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,106
[SPEAKER_15]: for you to maybe scale back in your presentation a little bit.

59
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:55,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Tufts usually does a very robust presentation for us when matters come before the board.

60
00:04:55,388 --> 00:05:01,749
[SPEAKER_15]: So just as a note for those who may follow matters with Tufts, I wanted to let you know.

61
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood, and I can explain why that is.

62
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:04,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

63
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:09,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have some slides not as robust as one would usually see from us for that.

64
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,172
[SPEAKER_14]: I can take a hint.

65
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you see that on the slide?

66
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,283
[SPEAKER_15]: It says sharing, but I don't see the material yet.

67
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,344
[SPEAKER_15]: It says you are screen sharing.

68
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: There you are.

69
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:22,584
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, cool.

70
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,444
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

71
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:38,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So as you stated, this is an application or site plan review of a Dover amendment used for to construct a two-story infill addition with rooftop mechanicals to the building in the Tufts campus known as Eaton Hall, and to make some landscaping and interior alterations.

72
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,628
[SPEAKER_14]: The slide would be on the left.

73
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,399
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,344
[SPEAKER_14]: The location of it, as you can see here outlined in red, the building is completely surrounded by the Tufts University campus.

75
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,986
[SPEAKER_14]: It is located in the apartment two zoning district.

76
00:05:55,046 --> 00:06:00,550
[SPEAKER_14]: The only non-Tufts abutter is within 400 feet of the MBTA railroad tracks, and there's one rental property in Somerville.

77
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,412
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all really surrounded by Tufts.

78
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:08,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Going down here, you can see the existing conditions.

79
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,118
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Eaton Hall, which is an academic building on campus.

80
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:20,070
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposal is to build this infill addition in the center, which is a 3,595-square-foot, two-story infill addition.

81
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:34,614
[SPEAKER_14]: This will increase the size of Eaton Hall such that the ground floor will increase from 12,755 square feet to 14,410 square feet.

82
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:40,115
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can see it here on the front of the square where we're doing this infill addition where the building currently jogs in.

83
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,981
[SPEAKER_14]: The use of the building is going to remain academic.

84
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:47,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Rocco, can you explain just briefly what's going on and why we're doing this?

85
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:53,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Adam, and thank you members of the board for letting us present to you tonight.

86
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,205
[SPEAKER_13]: As Adam mentioned, this is an academic building.

87
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,086
[SPEAKER_13]: The use will remain academic.

88
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:07,269
[SPEAKER_13]: This building houses our number of arts and sciences departments, including theology, sociology, and the classics.

89
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:13,172
[SPEAKER_13]: As we're looking at many of the older buildings on our campus, we're looking to renovate them.

90
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:19,316
[SPEAKER_13]: And our three main goals are sustainability, accessibility, and community.

91
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:28,982
[SPEAKER_13]: From a sustainability standpoint, all the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems will be replaced and improved.

92
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:35,907
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is part of our effort to make the building more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels.

93
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:51,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, from an accessibility standpoint, this renovation includes essentially located wheelchair, accessible entry that opens into a gathering space and has elevators and direct access to the academic green.

94
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:56,019
[SPEAKER_13]: It also makes our classrooms offices, breakout areas and gathering spaces.

95
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:17,397
[SPEAKER_13]: More accessible and then finally on a note on community, you know, we're really trying in these renovations to create breakout spaces and collaboration spaces that encourage community so that our students can gather together with faculty and staff.

96
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,461
[SPEAKER_13]: and create and be innovative and discuss.

97
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:31,866
[SPEAKER_13]: So this all fits in line with our larger mission and our larger philosophy on making improvements throughout the campus.

98
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:33,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Rocco.

99
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:39,651
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see here, this is sort of a detail of the front end with the landscaping.

100
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:44,413
[SPEAKER_14]: I would note that the building, the accessibility and the energy efficiency will be improved from the project.

101
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:46,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Energy usage will be reduced.

102
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,370
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all to the good.

103
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,813
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the dimensional table, which is in our application.

104
00:08:54,853 --> 00:09:02,697
[SPEAKER_14]: The existing dimensional requirements will comply with the zoning ordinance, except the existing nonconforming maximum lot cover will be increased by 2%.

105
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:12,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, what is the lot, quote unquote, is a little bit less important because Eaton Hall faces on the entire green of all the buildings and it's sort of one interconnected whole.

106
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:18,259
[SPEAKER_14]: So however, just to be technical about it, that is the, I do want to point that out.

107
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:22,421
[SPEAKER_14]: As the board knows, this Dover amendment projects are limited to two inquiries.

108
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:30,604
[SPEAKER_14]: One is a Dover protected use, which clearly an academic building is, and two, reasonable regulations to certain things can be imposed.

109
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:35,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I would note again that the change in the existing non-conforming lot cover is only 2%.

110
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:42,629
[SPEAKER_14]: The project's going to allow ADA and compliance and energy efficiency and adapt an old building to modern needs.

111
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:48,361
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's no new nonconformity created, no other existing nonconformities are going to be exacerbated.

112
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:53,804
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the project schedule because people often ask us what we're going to be doing and when.

113
00:09:53,824 --> 00:10:01,368
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw that we did note, I just want to point out, and I have raised this with staff, that there are some condition proposals from various departments.

114
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that they're all fine.

115
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: There are maybe, there are three I wanted to point out that I think are boilerplate that probably don't really apply.

116
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:17,118
[SPEAKER_14]: One is regarding filing 21E environmental reports, which really we don't have to do for something like this.

117
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:21,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Second is about not making noise to bother the neighbors, and that's really only us.

118
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy not to do that, but I don't really think it really matters much.

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:36,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last we've got to do is sanitary conditions, and I believe that's got to do with making sure we pull the proper permits to do the construction, which clearly Buff always does.

120
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's, we're gonna do those things.

121
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:48,920
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to clarify that those, just to clarify that those are what those three statements from the health department are about.

122
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,023
[SPEAKER_14]: But other than that, the applicant asked that the board approve the site plan review for the project.

123
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, can I just point out one typo before you conclude?

124
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Construction is actually proposed to start in fall of 2023.

125
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So I apologize for the typo on the presentation.

126
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,303
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, thank you for taking the hit on that one.

127
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,464
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm done sharing.

128
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much all it is.

129
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,265
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a relatively small info to an existing building.

130
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:17,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

131
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:18,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

132
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Amanda, anyone on the city side?

133
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:25,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that anyone has to comment, but we always invite the city to comment.

134
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:30,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have any additional comments at the moment.

135
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:37,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and we should solicit input from the public if there are members of the public here who'd like to participate.

136
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:52,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so if I may, if anyone from the public would be interested in participating, you can use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the screen, or you can put your name in the chat.

137
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:58,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I can also receive emails to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

138
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I refresh that page now,

139
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we haven't received any emails up until this point.

140
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:12,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And just going to give folks maybe a minute to see if anyone wants to speak.

141
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:22,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And then nothing received in advance of tonight's meeting from public.

142
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

143
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:25,582
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.

144
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:30,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not seeing any hands or notes in the chat either.

145
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great, thank you.

146
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:37,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll close the public comment period then and turn to the board deliberation.

147
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:47,281
[SPEAKER_15]: We are limited in our second interview of this type of a use, of course, first to determine that it is a Dover amendment use.

148
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:58,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, unless there's objection from another board member, we can take notice of the fact that an academic building in the center of the Tufts campus would satisfy that.

149
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we could consider reasonable regulations.

150
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,692
[SPEAKER_15]: If anyone feels like they want to speak on these matters.

151
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:22,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I'll go through the list but speak up if you, if you have some comment or question regarding bulk and height of structures yard sizes lot area setbacks, open space parking building coverage requirements.

152
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:25,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Any comments from the board.

153
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,754
[SPEAKER_18]: This is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

154
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:37,020
[SPEAKER_18]: As Attorney Dash has mentioned, the nonconformity increased by 2% of the lot coverage.

155
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,541
[SPEAKER_18]: That really isn't a thing, right?

156
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's an academic quad.

157
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just, I want to make sure that we're clear here.

158
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:55,535
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't I don't see any issues and as far as parking, because again it's academic why it does, I don't think that will increase parking is right.

159
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

160
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:03,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I can respond to that if you'd like Mr. Again, this is according to the assessors.

161
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:06,004
[SPEAKER_14]: This Eaton Hall is parcel T-00-21.

162
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:10,165
[SPEAKER_14]: They divvied up the quad into little parcels.

163
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:15,106
[SPEAKER_14]: There's really no reason for it because obviously it's not taxed.

164
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,867
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just being technical by the code terms.

165
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:26,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm using the lot that the successors have put this building on, but it's really not lots, it's like a whole.

166
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it's important, but I did want to call it out to be honest and open about it.

167
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.

168
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very common with campuses.

169
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to define lots.

170
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:39,980
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we have three addresses for it, because it doesn't really have an address.

171
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,043
[SPEAKER_14]: It's zero College Ave, or 5 the Green, or 8 Upper Campus Road, depending on where you are.

172
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:47,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

173
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:48,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to be clear.

174
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:48,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

175
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:52,686
[SPEAKER_18]: And one other question that's kind of related, but not really.

176
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,486
[SPEAKER_18]: When is sociology moving to Eaton Hall?

177
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:55,607
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a Tufts alum.

178
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,648
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only other question.

179
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,164
[SPEAKER_13]: as they are very eager to get into this new building.

180
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:06,106
[SPEAKER_13]: So they, I think, will be the first group to move in, Jackie.

181
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:10,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're very eager to move in.

182
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

183
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:12,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

184
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,191
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

185
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:15,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Christy.

186
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:18,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have more of a question out of curiosity.

187
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,554
[SPEAKER_09]: First, the rendering looks very nice.

188
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:27,197
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of the glazing with the stretch code, what is proposed?

189
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,278
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you addressing that?

190
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone from the architecture team?

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm just curious because I'm doing a study for Harvard, and there's been a lot of discussion.

192
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, I can address that.

193
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:40,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Peter Vieira from Payette.

194
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:50,096
[SPEAKER_12]: So the project incorporates, obviously, there's some glass overlooking the quad very much in keeping with the idea of making this space more inviting.

195
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:56,638
[SPEAKER_12]: But there are actually areas of solid and opaque glazing on the edges and up on the second floor behind.

196
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:59,419
[SPEAKER_12]: a sort of glass screen that's in front.

197
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,539
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do actually, of course, we need to meet that code.

198
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:10,701
[SPEAKER_12]: We do actually meet the code, but it's through a creative use of how we've used the opaque portions of the cladding in conjunction with the glass.

199
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:14,942
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's triple glazed, I should add to it.

200
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,043
[SPEAKER_12]: It is all triple glazed.

201
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:17,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

202
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:18,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

203
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, excellent.

204
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:26,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless there's other discussion from the board, we could entertain a motion to

205
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,580
[SPEAKER_15]: approve the application for site plan approval.

206
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a motion to approve.

207
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second the motion.

208
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:41,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and let's hit a roll call vote then we'll start, as always, with Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

209
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Christie.

210
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Emily.

211
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Ari Guffman Fishman.

212
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm an eye as well.

213
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, attorney dash and Rocco and everyone here on behalf of toughs.

214
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much on behalf of TUS for your time and attention to this.

215
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

216
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Good night.

217
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:19,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, now we'll move on to our next item, site plan review for 285, 295 Middlesex Ave.

218
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:22,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me pull up the notice on that.

219
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:25,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me a moment.

220
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:49,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this board will conduct a meeting tonight via zoom relative to an application for site plan reviews submitted by maldex limited partnership, regarding the tenant fit out of an existing 27,160 square foot building previously a fitness center to a supermarket at 285 to 95 mil sex have in Medford.

221
00:17:52,263 --> 00:18:02,291
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a project that involves a change in principle use of an existing building containing 10,000 square feet or more, meaning that it meets the definition of a major project.

222
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,794
[SPEAKER_15]: And under our zoning ordinance, it therefore requires site plan review by this board.

223
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:15,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So let me invite the applicant team to introduce themselves and present.

224
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

225
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,682
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Katie Weatherby.

226
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here on behalf of WS Development.

227
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:30,446
[SPEAKER_07]: We're the owners of Townline Plaza, which is the overall shopping center there.

228
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:35,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm joined tonight by H-Mart and our consultants.

229
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:42,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Keith on the architecture team, Kristen on the traffic and engineering side, and then Joe on the civil engineering side.

230
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:51,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I would do something similar to Tess, do a brief overview, and then if there's questions, invite the experts to help chime in.

231
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:53,323
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, great.

232
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:53,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

233
00:18:54,304 --> 00:19:02,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to attempt to share my screen.

234
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to see HMART at Townline Plaza?

235
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:12,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we can see it.

236
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:13,338
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

237
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:20,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought first I would kind of orient people to the site.

238
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,925
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called Townline Plaza.

239
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:30,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say very appropriately as it is on the town line, but it's actually the city line, so it should probably be renamed City Line Plaza.

240
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:37,137
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is the city line that goes through Medford to the south and Malton to the north.

241
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:41,461
[SPEAKER_07]: The green line here, if you can see my hand, I'm following it.

242
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,503
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, it is the green line around the property.

243
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:46,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That shows the extent of our property.

244
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:56,219
[SPEAKER_07]: We did want to call out that we have a parking easement to the south that feels very much like it's part of the property, but it is owned by the National Grid at this point.

245
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:02,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just site where H-Mart is going to be going within that plaza.

246
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Zooming in a little bit more, you can see where the proposed H-Mart is going.

247
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:12,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This location was previously occupied by Crunch Fitness, if you're familiar with the area.

248
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:22,107
[SPEAKER_07]: They relocated to our sister property, Broadway Plaza, just about a year ago in March of 2022 to make way for H Mart to come in.

249
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:26,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, before it was Crunch Fitness, it was a store market for about 20 years.

250
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:34,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So this same location has actually been a grocery store before, which is one of the reasons why, as a landowner, we knew a grocery store would be a great idea.

251
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:43,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Continuing on, I pulled some aerial street views from Google just to kind of orient people.

252
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:49,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way, if you want to do later, you could go and kind of replicate the same views.

253
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,881
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're coming up from Middlesex Ave.

254
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:56,684
[SPEAKER_07]: from Medford, there's a car wash to the right.

255
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is kind of your first view of the property.

256
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:02,367
[SPEAKER_07]: This right here is the former Crunch Fitness, where H-Mart will be going.

257
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:10,094
[SPEAKER_07]: If you continue a little bit ways up, you see that there's a right turn in only, which will actually bring customers right to H Mart.

258
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:13,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a really great feature of the property as it exists today.

259
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:18,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is showing the lower right-hand view shows the right turn in only.

260
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:28,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Continuing up Middlesex Ave and about to change to Highland Ave as we cross the town line is the main entrance to the property.

261
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Dunkin Donuts is to the right.

262
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a full,

263
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Cars can go in and out at this intersection.

264
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the northernmost property entrance is next to John Brewer's Tavern.

265
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:45,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of the full extent along Middlesex slash Highland Avenue.

266
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,549
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some views from within the property.

267
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,493
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two major buildings today, as well as a Dunkin' Donuts out parcel.

268
00:21:55,413 --> 00:22:00,817
[SPEAKER_07]: H-Mart is going into the easternmost building, and they're kind of anchoring the building.

269
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:11,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Along the strip today, there's a lot of existing stores, really a traditional shopping center in that it has a little bit of everything.

270
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It does have restaurants, retail, some service uses as well.

271
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:23,136
[SPEAKER_07]: In the top left view, Crunch is all the way at the end, sorry, former Crunch, future H Mart.

272
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:27,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the bottom right view is just looking at that area a little bit closer.

273
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:41,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as you continue through the site, this is looking back towards the side of future H-Mart and kind of along H-Mart on the top left.

274
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:47,672
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the bottom right view shows the large parking field that is behind H-Mart, where also they'll be doing a lot of their loading and service.

275
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit about H-Mart.

276
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,617
[SPEAKER_07]: They are an Asian American market.

277
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,118
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been in business for nearly 40 years.

278
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:02,260
[SPEAKER_07]: They have over 78 stores in 14 states.

279
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have other locations in Massachusetts already.

280
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Cambridge is 1 of them.

281
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:14,228
[SPEAKER_07]: They pick locations where they can really serve the community that they're in, and they're very attracted to Medford, particularly because of the college.

282
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:16,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So great that tops was here earlier.

283
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are some pictures from other locations.

284
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:32,795
[SPEAKER_07]: The plans that were submitted, I'll go through them briefly as part of the site plan review application, showing the existing conditions.

285
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,797
[SPEAKER_07]: The property was built in the 1960s.

286
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:40,863
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had tenants go in and out of the various stores along the strip since then.

287
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Duncan was added at some point after that.

288
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:49,271
[SPEAKER_07]: But this main building was built in 1960 and it's had a lot of different uses, but mostly remained the same.

289
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:57,954
[SPEAKER_07]: This page now shows some changes to the site that we're proposing to accommodate the use.

290
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:02,356
[SPEAKER_07]: H-Mart is taking the building almost entirely as is.

291
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it was a grocery store before it was a fitness use, so the building actually was set up to pretty well already handle the use.

292
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:17,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of that and because it previously had a grocery store in the shopping center, there's really not that many changes to the site that needed to be made to accommodate it.

293
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,982
[SPEAKER_07]: The minimal changes include shifting one island

294
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,732
[SPEAKER_07]: to accommodate a truck turn, which we will show later.

295
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:33,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the elimination of some parking in the rear to allow loading and service in this back corner.

296
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:42,522
[SPEAKER_07]: They're adding cart corrals, doing a lot of improvements inside the building, but the site mostly was set up already today to accommodate this use.

297
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,205
[SPEAKER_03]: More technical drawings on the side improvements.

298
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Then to understand the existing composition of the property,

299
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:58,077
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's Duncan, like I talked about proposed grocery store that we're talking about tonight.

300
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,940
[SPEAKER_07]: There's retail, there's a doctor's office, there's some restaurants.

301
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,262
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a smaller grocery store on the left.

302
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:07,224
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually like manufacturing and Armatron International.

303
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:12,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is also another great view to kind of show where the city town line goes through the property.

304
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:22,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just an overall existing conditions view of the property that shows both

305
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: the Medford side, as well as the Malton side.

306
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:35,115
[SPEAKER_07]: We received a lot of questions and comments through city review.

307
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we pulled together a couple documents that address some of those.

308
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'd be looking forward to talking through any additional comments and some of those comments with the board this evening.

309
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,822
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing we did want to note is the

310
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,145
[SPEAKER_07]: The size of the project we understand warrants a major project.

311
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:56,027
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it is reoccupying an existing building and a mostly existing site as it exists today.

312
00:25:56,047 --> 00:26:00,150
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the conditions we read almost like it was a brand new construction.

313
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,310
[SPEAKER_07]: We were building 25,000 square feet.

314
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:08,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to emphasize that we really tried to keep the site work as minimal as possible because it worked.

315
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:12,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we weren't planning on doing a lot of site work because it existed and functioned well today.

316
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were some questions about truck turning.

317
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:26,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually, this is one of the items we worked really closely with H Mart on, was understanding how the site can accommodate the truck turns.

318
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:27,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a shopping center.

319
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:34,768
[SPEAKER_07]: We really want to make sure that customers are not impacted as the grocery tenant has a lot of trucks coming to and from the property.

320
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to understand how those trucks would service.

321
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this shows the truck entering the property.

322
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,493
[SPEAKER_07]: This helped us determine

323
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:57,331
[SPEAKER_07]: the one area that we did need to modify the site, which is just, we had one loss of a parking space to accommodate an area that was previously a little tight on the truck turn.

324
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:01,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But this shows the truck driving through the property and then backing into the loading dock.

325
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:10,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in order to exit the same way, the truck just needed a little bit more maneuverability to take a couple of turns.

326
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,918
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I will note is that

327
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,109
[SPEAKER_07]: These programs are often a little conservative.

328
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:23,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I have seen truck drivers do some very, very tight turns, but this is a conservative, safe truck movement.

329
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:34,181
[SPEAKER_07]: There are also questions about existing bike racks and stop lines and adding some stop lines and stop signs.

330
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:38,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have some existing bike racks on property today on both sides.

331
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:42,166
[SPEAKER_07]: This plan shows a couple here and then a couple over here as well.

332
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are bike racks in both Malden and Medford.

333
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,871
[SPEAKER_07]: And they look like little circles on the sidewalk today.

334
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I can go back to different aerials if helpful to see them.

335
00:27:51,974 --> 00:28:01,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we do have stop lines in some locations, but we do recognize that we probably need to add a few more stop lines throughout the property.

336
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:05,005
[SPEAKER_07]: So this just shows that yes, we are accommodating those.

337
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pause there.

338
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:18,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I included all the submission materials in case there were questions that were more helpful and answered by other materials that were not planned in nature.

339
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:25,117
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want to comment that the existing site does really accommodate the use well.

340
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:34,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the conditions imposed were for offsite work that we were a little surprised by because this is such a minimal change to the existing site.

341
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,851
[SPEAKER_15]: to is at the end of your presentation.

342
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,613
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll hear from some of your colleagues.

343
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,775
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the end of the presentation.

344
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they're here more if there's specific questions.

345
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:56,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

346
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:03,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Any city staff in the queue to speak on this one, Amanda?

347
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:10,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia, Danielle, any comments you guys wanted to provide?

348
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:15,934
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to, we always just invite.

349
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,922
Okay.

350
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,025
[SPEAKER_15]: How about members of the public at this time?

351
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:30,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Amanda, any folks who'd like to participate or speak on this matter?

352
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:42,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so once more, just want to invite folks who would like to provide comment that you can do so if you use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the screen.

353
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:52,336
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use the chat box if you're not sure how to use that feature and put your name in there and I'll call you in the queue.

354
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:55,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do see a hand raised.

355
00:29:56,118 --> 00:30:00,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So Judy Kim, if you could just provide your name and address for the record.

356
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Judy Kim.

357
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in 48 McCormick Ave in Medford.

358
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:07,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

359
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:08,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for being here today.

360
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:09,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

361
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:17,616
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first time and I'm so excited for H Mart coming that this is my first time joining a meeting because I wanted to express my excitement for this development.

362
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:26,700
[SPEAKER_00]: As Catherine had mentioned, there are several other locations within Massachusetts, but they are a pain to get to.

363
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,921
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in Cambridge, the parking is abysmal.

364
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,742
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in Burlington, you cannot get there during rush hour because of the 93-95 junction parking lot.

365
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,524
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, having one in Medford is so significant for me.

366
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:46,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited for the diversity of produce and food products that aren't really available in existing grocery stores in Medford, but would be available.

367
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think I see the potential for a very large customer base, you know, not just in Medford, but also with our neighbors in Malden, which has a significant Asian population.

368
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I was born and raised in Korea, I am now a US citizen, but

369
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:09,093
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's always good to introduce, you know, neighbors and family to cuisine that's, you know, near, dear to my heart.

370
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:14,936
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am very excited for this development and I hope you really consider this, you know, seriously.

371
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:15,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

372
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:17,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

373
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:18,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for your comments.

374
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Amanda, you're looking out into the universe there to see if we have

375
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:37,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm seeing no other hands raised or chats and I'm just refreshing our inbox to make sure nothing else has come in via email.

376
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,149
[SPEAKER_01]: And yep, it looks like nothing has.

377
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:45,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we'll close that public comment portion then.

378
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:50,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions from the board for the applicant this evening?

379
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,431
[SPEAKER_19]: I have one that's- Ari, go ahead.

380
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:01,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

381
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:04,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't see you because I only have so many windows there.

382
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:05,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, sorry.

383
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:15,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Love HMARC, super excited about this and agreed that it would be a great addition to the community.

384
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:20,016
[SPEAKER_19]: My question is the Cambridge one I know has a food court as well.

385
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:24,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that something that's being considered or planned for this one?

386
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something you're able to answer?

387
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say yes, but not with any certainty.

388
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:32,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I can answer that.

389
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:37,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Keith Bettencourt from BK Architects, I'm the architect of record for the project.

390
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:43,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It will have food court functions as well, very similar to the Burlington and the other locations.

391
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:59,739
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, I look forward to many delicious pastries and the kind of official route would love to kind of make sure that there's the appropriate trash and litter mitigation for outdoors, especially in the parking lot.

392
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:13,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Any comments on the policing of the lot, maybe, issue that Ari's raising?

393
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so as the property owner, we do have border service that goes around and empties the existing trash cans.

394
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,496
[SPEAKER_07]: We've actually something we monitored closely.

395
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:31,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Really during COVID, we did notice an increase and we're very thankful it's returning to post COVID or pre COVID levels in terms of the trash on property.

396
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,582
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have existing landscapers that maintain the property itself.

397
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:42,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with regards to H Mart, I've switched to this plan because they do have a lot of dumpsters.

398
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:49,743
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll of course work with the health department on anything that's required permit wise, making sure it's adequate road and control and things like that.

399
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:52,825
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's something we do take very seriously and we closely monitor.

400
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,403
[SPEAKER_18]: David, this is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

401
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:05,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a couple of questions.

402
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:12,234
[SPEAKER_18]: One, it is exciting to have this new means coming in, and I can definitely see a large customer base and maybe market demand.

403
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:16,019
[SPEAKER_18]: And speaking of that, one of the things that I noticed

404
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:25,931
[SPEAKER_18]: And just for the area over there in Middlesex Ave, is there, one of my first questions is, I wasn't aware that this was a grocery store previously.

405
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:28,553
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was always a fitness center even before crunch.

406
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:32,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So I didn't realize that it was already set up to be a grocery center.

407
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:38,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm trying to figure out how emergency vehicles and if trucks are tight and they're loading.

408
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,202
[SPEAKER_18]: How would emergency vehicles go in there?

409
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:46,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Then my second piece to that is traffic generation trips are going to be higher.

410
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:51,671
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to know if it was standard uses or if it was actually determined at certain peak hours.

411
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:58,878
[SPEAKER_18]: And then secondly, the pedestrian set up over there is lacking on Middlesex Ave.

412
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:01,460
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have a couple of questions surrounding safety.

413
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:11,875
[SPEAKER_18]: And if it wants to just speak a little bit more on so basically my overall questions are safety.

414
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:16,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Access for proper access for emergency vehicles and then.

415
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:33,260
[SPEAKER_18]: traffic generation, which you say, for instance, this is as we just heard from one of our residents, Miss Kim stated that it would be a demand, even I was shocked, you know, it sounds like it's a great place going to bring all kinds of people.

416
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:38,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we prepared for this and with the proper traffic generation resource?

417
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:49,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so I will give high level overview answers, and then I'm going to turn over some of the experts, particularly on traffic, because we do have our traffic engineer here this evening.

418
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:55,309
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of emergency access, the building today exists in the same condition.

419
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,792
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not making any exterior changes that would impede access.

420
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:03,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually, we've had a lot of interaction, unfortunately, with the fire department in recent years.

421
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:07,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've been able to service the building to our knowledge,

422
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:12,296
[SPEAKER_07]: This was in terms of a truck accommodating a turn was the one thing we had to make.

423
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire truck access is a little bit different maneuverability.

424
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:20,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never heard from the fire department of any issues accessing the space.

425
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:27,959
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be more than happy to submit a plan that shows the fire trucks circulating the property and work with the fire department if they do have concerns.

426
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: But the property as it exists today is being serviced by Medford Fire and I haven't heard of any challenges.

427
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,301
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of

428
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:37,727
[SPEAKER_07]: level traffic.

429
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:43,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I'm going to turn it over to Kristen afterwards to talk in more detail because she's the expert.

430
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,232
[SPEAKER_07]: This property was originally set up as a shopping center.

431
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:53,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was a grocery store back in, I think, stop star market closed in the late 90s.

432
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,738
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can get that exact date for you if you'd like.

433
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:02,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the great things about a shopping center is that there's complimentary uses and different ebbs and flows throughout the day.

434
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:07,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And the grocery use actually really works well with some of the existing uses on site.

435
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:14,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Dunkin Donuts, we know, will be really busy first thing in the morning, not as busy in the afternoon when grocery store picks up.

436
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:18,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Retail really is a weekend peak.

437
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:22,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Grocery store does have a weekend peak, but it's a lot in the evenings.

438
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:25,860
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the restaurants on property, which are another weekend peak,

439
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: they're scattered throughout.

440
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:37,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do think while this will bring traffic to the property, we actually think the property is set up in terms of its existing parking and circulation to accommodate that.

441
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:42,205
[SPEAKER_07]: As if you go by the property today, there's a lot of parking that isn't being used.

442
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:44,106
[SPEAKER_07]: We're kind of waiting for this to come in.

443
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:49,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that was commented on previously, I did want to address in that same vein as employee parking.

444
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:55,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently today with this large vacancy at the end, employees are allowed to park throughout the property.

445
00:37:56,087 --> 00:38:02,672
[SPEAKER_07]: we will encourage employees to park back in this large parking field once H Mart is open.

446
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will really keep the open, the front parking area open for customers.

447
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:20,404
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of pedestrian access, there is sidewalk access off of this entrance going through the property along John Burroughs Tavern.

448
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:23,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it is a parking lot.

449
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that cars are driving very carefully.

450
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:32,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have crossings from within the parking lots.

451
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:34,937
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see these existing cross points.

452
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:40,638
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mostly set up with the existing ADA parking to make sure that they have a compliant route across the property.

453
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:53,540
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've been there during COVID, we previously had this drive lane shut down with some seating for the Donut Villa that actually will not be in place this summer now that we're post COVID, fingers crossed.

454
00:38:54,472 --> 00:39:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: but so this will have full access and having pedestrian crossings in this way helps to slow traffic down and making it more regular circulation throughout.

455
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:14,062
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that H-Mart did comment to us and one of the reasons they're excited for this location is with college students, they've noticed a lot of those students using Ubers.

456
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:21,866
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have cars and so college students will grab an Uber, which will actually then have a great place to drop them off near the front door.

457
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a different type of trip.

458
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: not really resulting in parking, and then brings them in close proximity, and then they can load the groceries up and get away.

459
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:34,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I will allow, oh, sorry.

460
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:38,320
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, one of my biggest concerns is that the walkability issue over there.

461
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,283
[SPEAKER_18]: My dentist is actually located right next door to Crunch Fitness.

462
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:51,328
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I walk over there, and so what you bring it in the college, tuck, tuck, and just having other options, not all will use Ubers a lot.

463
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:56,610
[SPEAKER_18]: will implement the blue bikes that the city is installing around Medford now.

464
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,171
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, and I've seen that a lot, even increasing with going to BJ's across the street from that.

465
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:10,034
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm just a little concerned about, I literally, if I'm walking over, if I decide to leave my car at home and I'm walking over there, I'm making a run for my life.

466
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,495
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's like, it's a little bit more than hoping that the cars will drive, you know, safely.

467
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,475
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not putting it on you.

468
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,616
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just that it is bringing in more traffic.

469
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where my concern comes.

470
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,844
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be more than happy to look to it, accommodating more bike parking.

471
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:28,187
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great to hear that the existing parking might not be enough.

472
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can definitely accommodate that.

473
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:37,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you willing to accommodate the 13 that director Blake has asked for?

474
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:44,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have 10 existing, so we can definitely add, you know, they're usually in pairs.

475
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would add four more spaces, two more racks.

476
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Jackie, I don't want to cut you off and I don't think we heard from the traffic engineer.

477
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:55,723
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

478
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:56,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

479
00:40:57,744 --> 00:41:03,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Kristen, if you'd like to talk a little bit more about the technical traffic and how shopping center and grocery store work, that'd be great.

480
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

481
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you to the board for having us tonight.

482
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:09,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirsten Braun, I'm the traffic engineer for the project.

483
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And I work for Chapel engineering and associates.

484
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did perform a traffic analysis as well as parking analysis for this site.

485
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:37,038
[SPEAKER_08]: One important thing to note that I think Katie brought up a lot is there was previously a supermarket on the site, and generally shopping centers of this size will include a supermarket so it doesn't necessarily mean that re adding a supermarket is going to result in a significant amount of trips.

486
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:47,417
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate though, we did look at the increase in traffic associated with adding in the supermarket and the increases are not significant.

487
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's for two reasons.

488
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:57,064
[SPEAKER_08]: One of which is a lot of people when they go to a supermarket, they're on their way home, on their way to work, on their way to run some sort of other errand.

489
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:01,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they'll do is they'll swing through and go to the supermarket on their way to somewhere else.

490
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:05,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So technically that traffic already exists on Middlesex Avenue.

491
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:15,804
[SPEAKER_08]: The second reason is a lot of people too when they go to shopping centers, they won't necessarily only stop at H Mart, they might also go to another store within the shopping center.

492
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:22,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So while that is two trips within the shopping center, it's really only one trip on the adjacent roadway.

493
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:28,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the real two main reasons why, you know, traffic isn't going to increase that much.

494
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:40,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing to note that we didn't take a credit for in our study also is the fact that this is such a great area for walkability, bikeability, transit.

495
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:44,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't take any sort of credits for that kind of activity on site.

496
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:49,558
[SPEAKER_08]: But we probably do expect, given this location, that there will be

497
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:54,961
[SPEAKER_08]: a decent amount of those types of trips, but we didn't take any sort of credit for those mode splits.

498
00:42:55,782 --> 00:43:07,170
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, essentially, supermarkets within shopping centers don't result in a significant increase in trips because of all the various reasons that I had mentioned.

499
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:16,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can answer any other specific questions related to that.

500
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:23,777
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just sort of a gist of the traffic study and what kind of traffic increases we can expect.

501
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:28,682
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess.

502
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:48,194
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just having a hard time envisioning it only because I know just from being in Medford itself and living across from Wegmans with that, that's a larger and it brings a lot of traffic to the region.

503
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:56,077
[SPEAKER_18]: And with H Mart being specialized, we just don't know the market base and what that traffic would bring.

504
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:01,379
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just not convinced that it won't be a huge significant increase.

505
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,980
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'll leave that to the traffic engineer.

506
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:15,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think any of us who have been to the Burlington, I mean, I've never been in the Burlington market because I've never been able to park there.

507
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:15,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

508
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,480
[SPEAKER_15]: That's anecdotal.

509
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,681
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not running the numbers.

510
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:22,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

511
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:32,004
[SPEAKER_18]: And my thoughts are anecdotal from being a neighbor, and from pretty much using all these spaces that we're referencing, and just me being over there.

512
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:35,745
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess I'll just, I'll defer to the experts on that.

513
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:40,267
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just as a neighbor myself, or as a resident of Medford, it's just a concern.

514
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:44,568
[SPEAKER_08]: We also separately took a look at parking.

515
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:49,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we did is we counted the parking demand on site during peak periods.

516
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's for shopping centers, it's typically midday.

517
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:59,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did find that the existing parking lots are currently very underutilized as is.

518
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:05,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't expect a parking issue associated with the supermarket, even when we layer that traffic on.

519
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:13,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And also Katie had mentioned something earlier as well that a lot of the uses within the shopping center have different types of peaks.

520
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:17,949
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, coffee shops are morning, grocery stores might be midday.

521
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:23,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the restaurants are probably, you know, between the 7 to 8 p.m.

522
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:24,472
[SPEAKER_08]: hours.

523
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:35,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really actually a good situation and that there's such a mix of uses on site that all their peak parking demand hours are all very different.

524
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:41,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I see, oh, thank you.

525
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:45,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Jackie, unless you have more, I see Amanda's hand.

526
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:45,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

527
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chair.

528
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,813
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had, I think, a clarifying question.

529
00:45:54,175 --> 00:46:08,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say in Director Blake's memo that there was that acknowledgment of, you know, some underutilization of the parking, but that a lot of that may be parking in the rear of the site, and I was wondering if you could speak to

530
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:15,850
[SPEAKER_01]: How, you know, the typical person, not necessarily an employee would access.

531
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,451
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, and the rest of the property from the rear.

532
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,732
[SPEAKER_01]: If there were to be parking back there, if there is there, like.

533
00:46:26,432 --> 00:46:29,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, are there sidewalks that kind of connect to the front of the property?

534
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:35,609
[SPEAKER_07]: There are not currently today, but we do mostly anticipate that to be employee parking.

535
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:42,250
[SPEAKER_07]: If you visit the property today, almost anybody you see parking out front is actually an employee.

536
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:46,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be shifting those employees back behind the property.

537
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:50,652
[SPEAKER_07]: There is passage along the side of the building.

538
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:55,033
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some parking that's striped along here that we could

539
00:46:55,682 --> 00:47:02,764
[SPEAKER_07]: in the future look at removing a couple of spaces to create a striped walkway if we do find that customers are parking back here.

540
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:08,945
[SPEAKER_07]: For employees, a lot of these doors, every single one you see here, including H Mart, does have a rear door.

541
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:15,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a really great place for employees to park because they can get in very quickly, particularly in the winter and not have to walk around.

542
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:20,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do envision that the front parking will mainly be utilized by customers.

543
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:21,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

544
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I did want to have just an overarching comment.

545
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:31,200
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely appreciate the board's interest and concern in parking and traffic.

546
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to say that as the property owner, and I'm also the property manager, we're very interested in as well.

547
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:42,567
[SPEAKER_07]: If customers can't park on property, if they can't maneuver, they're not going to continue shopping there.

548
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:47,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it is really, really in our interest to make sure that everything works really, really well.

549
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We work closely with our leasing team to make sure we have the right mix of tenants on site.

550
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:56,404
[SPEAKER_07]: When I go on, sometimes I call them different flavors.

551
00:47:56,924 --> 00:48:01,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But so we think about the different uses that are on the property and make sure that they're all complimentary to each other.

552
00:48:01,627 --> 00:48:05,630
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of thought went into adding HR in the grocery store and we think it will be really great.

553
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:20,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess the potential rub on that is that this board is charged with evaluating, among other items, the safety from a pedestrian and vehicular point of view on the site.

554
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:32,676
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I don't doubt the sincerity of your comments that you'll continue to evaluate the property, it is incumbent on us to evaluate it in its condition as it's presented.

555
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:45,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we determine that more needs to be done to condition approval potentially on that, and I'm getting the sense from you that you're not open to making modifications to the site.

556
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:49,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'll let you speak to that or correct me if I'm wrong.

557
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we go too much further.

558
00:48:53,651 --> 00:49:01,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm sorry that came off that way we really had evaluated the site as it exists, and saw this use coming in.

559
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:09,786
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we know it's an existing use that's allowed and the size of it is discussing the major project and the site plan review.

560
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:16,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really hadn't contemplated a lot of changes to the site, like if we were putting a brand new grocery store, that's kind of more what I meant.

561
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:26,052
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely if we feel like we need to stripe certain areas, reevaluate parking or traffic circulation on site, we could definitely do that.

562
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:29,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had only received the comments on Monday.

563
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:32,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would need to take a little time and go back and

564
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,912
[SPEAKER_07]: do some layouts and see what we could accommodate, and then come back to the board if that's their wish.

565
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:38,773
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, I appreciate that.

566
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:39,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for clarifying.

567
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:41,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Much appreciated.

568
00:49:42,556 --> 00:49:45,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Other board members, before I ask any questions.

569
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:50,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would just like to second what you are stating, David.

570
00:49:50,900 --> 00:50:00,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I would be more comfortable if the proponent could digest the comments, consider them,

571
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:05,652
[SPEAKER_09]: and then come back and see how much they can respond to.

572
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great project.

573
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:13,499
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a wonderful opportunity to bring a grocer like this to our area.

574
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:26,852
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it also presents other opportunities to improve what is a pretty rough looking area and the pedestrian safety is definitely of a concern.

575
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:37,664
[SPEAKER_09]: But also as you know a good community member I would like to also see the opportunity to clean up the edges and improve.

576
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:47,559
[SPEAKER_09]: landscaping, but primarily the pedestrian safety and really be clear about what's going on with traffic and how best to respond.

577
00:50:48,399 --> 00:51:00,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Understanding that this site was originally a supermarket, you know, if that was in the 90s, I think, you know, fast forward, here we are 30 years later, let's just be clear about what has changed in the city.

578
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:09,838
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to speak to that.

579
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:12,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to give you the opportunity, of course.

580
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

581
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're happy to go back and review pedestrian circulation throughout the site and see if there's things we can do to accommodate the board as well as city staff comments on site.

582
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:30,776
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to clarify a lot of the questions and comments have been about circulation on site traffic obviously is off site.

583
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:36,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the comments we received from city staff previously were about offsite improvements.

584
00:51:37,142 --> 00:51:45,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is really something that we'd have to take like a budgeting exercise and look into because this was an existing site.

585
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:51,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't wanna go off and look at onsite circulation and then have the board expecting other items.

586
00:51:52,309 --> 00:52:00,433
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd be happy to look at pedestrian routes, provide a little bit more information, see if there's other things we can do to address the concerns on the property.

587
00:52:01,423 --> 00:52:03,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just like to add to that though.

588
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:11,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see as a board member what your best faith effort in responding to department comments about offsite mitigation.

589
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:14,261
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we need to evaluate.

590
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:17,185
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you respond so we can make a recommendation?

591
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,716
[SPEAKER_18]: especially accessing the site from Middlesex Avenue.

592
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:40,184
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one of my biggest, because again, as Christy has already mentioned, as a board, we're looking to make sure that as you're building, we're making sure that we're getting, we're making sure that there's a community benefit and you being a community neighbor, this is our opportunity to make sure that it's done well.

593
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:45,607
[SPEAKER_18]: And not to put the stress or burden or economic burden on you, but at the same time,

594
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,068
[SPEAKER_18]: pedestrian safety should be at the top.

595
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely understood.

596
00:52:53,748 --> 00:53:01,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I do just want to clarify that the sidewalks that exist out front of the property, including the crossing, are state lands.

597
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that wasn't something we had contemplated.

598
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,771
[SPEAKER_07]: We can definitely look at the landscaping.

599
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:12,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We can have discussions with the state about any future plans they have to update the sidewalks in that area.

600
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Striping in terms of things is relatively low cost.

601
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:21,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the state would like us to strike the crosswalks at the entrance, that's a very easy thing for us to do.

602
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:26,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Gets a little tricky sometimes just with jurisdiction, but we'd be happy to coordinate with them on that.

603
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:33,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Other, I don't know if that was a good dialogue.

604
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:37,897
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't wanna cut it short, but I don't wanna dwell on it too long as well.

605
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:44,621
[SPEAKER_15]: If there are other comments, questions from board members or Christy, if you wanna keep the podium for any more comments you might have.

606
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:47,382
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that was a fair response and I appreciate that.

607
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:47,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

608
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:51,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

609
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't see Emily on my screen.

610
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you?

611
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:13,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I echo other board members comments, and I think a nice response to this, I'm not saying your other responses aren't nice, but maybe a nice way to frame it would be to kind of tell, similar to how you did with the college students, telling the story about they arrive by Uber, they get dropped off here.

612
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:18,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us that same story for pedestrians coming from the north, coming from the south.

613
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:19,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean,

614
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:28,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to the advanced auto parts store at this plaza, you know, probably more than I should, and I drive there.

615
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:38,717
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I was walking there, I can't see myself, you know, taking the long route all the way around, you know, the northern plaza to get to the southern plaza.

616
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:47,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I see myself, you know, either walking all the way down to the southern entrance and then cutting straight up or, you know,

617
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,575
[SPEAKER_06]: like Jackie was saying, putting my life in my hands and going all the way across.

618
00:54:52,356 --> 00:55:05,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's some way, whether it's through crosswalks or directionals or landscaping that you can kind of tell the pedestrian what their transit story should be, I think that would be really helpful for us.

619
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, we'd be happy to come back and present that, thank you.

620
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:11,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but thank you for this.

621
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:15,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love H-Mart, so I'm really excited that this is gonna be in my neighborhood.

622
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

623
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:20,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some sad news for you, though, that Advanced Auto Parts just closed.

624
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:24,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's good for both of us.

625
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:27,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the update.

626
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:45,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well I had a number of things that I'll just, instead of sort of direct questions, maybe I'll just share them as feedback for tonight because it sounds like we'll be reconvening to talk about things in more detail.

627
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:57,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly, you know, WS is, I live amongst many of your buildings here in the seaport and you're certainly filled with very capable and creative people on your staff, I'm sure to be able to

628
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:08,437
[SPEAKER_15]: to do a bang up job between now and our next get together but vehicle charging was one question I had again you don't have to respond to these I'm just sort of giving you my list.

629
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:16,427
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea of requiring as opposed to just recommending the employees to park in the back I think would be a good thing.

630
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:29,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask you about some directional signage to inform members of the public that additional parking is in the rear maybe there are two or three of those that could be strategically placed.

631
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,149
[SPEAKER_15]: We talked about the bike racks.

632
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:40,631
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a comment from Director Blake as well about sort of scheduling the deliveries and maybe just as a practical matter, it's not that big of a deal.

633
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:44,292
[SPEAKER_15]: H-Mart probably doesn't want deliveries coming in when all their customers are there.

634
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:49,654
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe you can just share some info there to satisfy that concern that was raised.

635
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:54,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop lines, stop signs, it looked like you were indicating those on there.

636
00:56:55,136 --> 00:57:00,218
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll ask Director Blake to take a look between now and our next get together to see if he has any thoughts on that.

637
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:25,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything you can do to increase the number of crosswalks internal ones I think would be nice, just to sort of freshen things up and make sure that folks are feeling comfortable, getting from the public sidewalk from the south I know you pointed out pretty clearly where it is coming from north, and also just making sure that they can walk through the drive lanes and feel comfortable.

638
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:26,723
[SPEAKER_15]: that we're doing so.

639
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:40,749
[SPEAKER_15]: You had the traffic mitigation steps and Director Blake's memo, of course, and as you've already alluded to, a couple of those require some mass DOT participation, which I think we'd want your best efforts on.

640
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:51,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that doesn't work out, maybe you can work with Director Blake slash the planning and development staff to come up with alternatives if DOT doesn't cooperate.

641
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:53,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Down the road.

642
00:57:54,655 --> 00:58:13,983
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are some of my things in the week was we have the letters with conditions from the various departments fire department diversity equity Board of Health traffic I've already mentioned but engineering as well so to the extent that you're able to look at those and

643
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:21,526
[SPEAKER_15]: either say, yeah, it's a thumbs up all around, or here are a couple of things that we don't quite agree with the city on, and this is what we're doing instead.

644
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:27,649
[SPEAKER_15]: That also is super helpful for us, so we can understand where we're going with our decision.

645
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:30,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

646
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I was taking a lot of notes.

647
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: On a lot of the conditions, I did want to clarify one thing.

648
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:43,796
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them, particularly Fire Department, Board of Health a little bit, DEI, are items that would be on a building permit set.

649
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:50,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some work that the tenant has to do to figure out like location of sewer and a couple other things to clarify.

650
00:58:50,108 --> 00:59:00,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I frankly didn't want to seem rude and say this will be on a subsequent set of drawings, but we can definitely go through and kind of call out which ones will be on future sets of drawings if that's helpful.

651
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:06,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you don't even have to for our purposes, just to fill you in kind of on our practice.

652
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:24,643
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's something that is going to be addressed in the construction documents or in that building permit application phase, say we're in agreement with those conditions or we're happy satisfying the fire department's conditions 2, 3, and 4, whatever it is.

653
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:26,524
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of all.

654
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,264
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to know if there's something

655
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,824
[SPEAKER_15]: where there's a stumbling block, where there might be kind of an issue.

656
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:43,046
[SPEAKER_15]: But if your feeling is, yes, in principle, I'm good with those, and we will address them in detail with the building permit, that works for the board.

657
00:59:43,106 --> 00:59:45,987
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get past us with that sort of an explanation.

658
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:47,167
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

659
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:51,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

660
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:51,868
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

661
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:55,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I took all the notes on the comments.

662
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:56,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for the feedback.

663
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Employee parking, I'm going to go a little out of order.

664
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:05,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Employee parking is something that we actually in our leases require that they do have to park where we tell them to.

665
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a little bit stronger.

666
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,993
[SPEAKER_07]: We frankly are a little lax right now.

667
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:13,436
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was trying to indicate, but we will definitely police that in the future.

668
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Directional signs are a great idea.

669
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I took notes throughout people's comments.

670
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:25,700
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of comments and great feedback on pedestrian access the roots Emily storytelling was a great idea.

671
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:34,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to tell stories so we'll definitely come back to a future meeting and kind of tell more of the pedestrian story and the access way through the property before.

672
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:40,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think, internal crosswalk stoplight stop sign walk through all all.

673
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:41,422
[SPEAKER_07]: go to that.

674
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:46,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Vehicle charging is a little, it's something we're definitely looking at across the company.

675
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:48,185
[SPEAKER_07]: We've implemented them in a couple places.

676
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires a partnership with a third party to do that.

677
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:58,689
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the challenges we actually run into is that it's a little bit of a long process working with utility providers on the easements.

678
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a company, you know, occupying an existing building we see is something that's very green.

679
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We've recently switched a lot of our power supply to be green.

680
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:10,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely trying to do more that's green and we're

681
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:18,669
[SPEAKER_07]: open to it, it's just a little bit challenging for us to work through some of the technical things on the EV charging, but we're not closed to it.

682
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll definitely keep an open mind on that.

683
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:26,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will definitely come back to a future meeting and address a lot of these comments.

684
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:28,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's that sounds really good.

685
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:32,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I can't stop myself I'm sorry.

686
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:46,202
[SPEAKER_15]: But just my in my, to my own eye, we needed to see a little pedestrian crosswalk that would be along the building just some ability for someone to safely get from the back lot to the, to the entrance.

687
01:01:47,782 --> 01:01:52,246
[SPEAKER_15]: unless there was an accessible entrance in the back and people could go in and out over there.

688
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:54,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes the retail operator has that too.

689
01:01:55,649 --> 01:02:01,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I just wanted to point out the drive lane requirements of the fire department.

690
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:09,360
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know anywhere where your numbers are, but just as another thing to keep in mind as you do some planning on the site plan.

691
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,503
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean the width of the drive lanes, correct?

692
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:13,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

693
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:34,214
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess to my, again, to my eye in particular, it's alongside the building, um, in either over or next to you, the easement for parking, you know, and is that, does that meet the city's fire department standards for width of a traveling?

694
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:38,358
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll come back and do all of those things.

695
01:02:38,598 --> 01:02:38,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

696
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,080
[SPEAKER_15]: So

697
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:50,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it fair enough that we should talk about scheduling to have you come back and see us?

698
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:51,895
[SPEAKER_15]: I see Amanda's hand is raised.

699
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe she was thinking like I was.

700
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chair.

701
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:05,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So two quick notes just for Katie and Janessa, who I believe is also on.

702
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:19,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So PDS staff is more than happy to connect you with any of the appropriate staff as you guys are kind of digesting feedback and if you're wanting to discuss any of the above.

703
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, you've got my number.

704
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:23,982
[SPEAKER_01]: We can figure that out after this meeting.

705
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:27,304
[SPEAKER_01]: just wanted to make sure that that was really apparent.

706
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:41,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and as the chair mentioned, so if the board is interested in continuing the hearing, we'll need to continue to a date certain, which just means, you know,

707
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:48,637
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever meeting seems appropriate for both the applicant and the board that's on the calendar in the future.

708
01:03:49,618 --> 01:04:01,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll throw out a couple of dates that we have, which is, so I don't know if it's too quick, but we do have a meeting in two weeks from now on the 21st of June.

709
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:11,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have a July 5th meeting, as well as a July 19th meeting, and I'll pause there.

710
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And just for my 2 cents, I'd encourage you to take the time you need.

711
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:22,824
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know, again, you're a really strong organization that has a lot of resources.

712
01:04:22,864 --> 01:04:33,050
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe a quick turnaround is not a challenge, but take the time you need, and then things will go that much more quickly for you, is my forecast when you return to the board.

713
01:04:35,091 --> 01:04:37,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

714
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:40,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We would love to come back on June.

715
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:42,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Danielle is signing on to us too.

716
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

717
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:52,387
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also request to be heard at the next meeting.

718
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:58,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you're not ready in time, then we'll, you know, before we post the agenda, it'd be great to know if you're ready or not.

719
01:04:58,954 --> 01:05:04,660
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can indicate on the agenda that you'd be requesting a continuance and you could do so.

720
01:05:07,623 --> 01:05:08,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

721
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:09,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Without comment or

722
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,042
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, any discussion if you're not ready.

723
01:05:13,102 --> 01:05:16,805
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you wanted to shoot for that, but if you're not ready, that is an option.

724
01:05:19,287 --> 01:05:19,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

725
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:21,089
[SPEAKER_07]: We would love to shoot for that.

726
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:26,374
[SPEAKER_07]: We had talked earlier in the week that we had a lot of information to digest and we'd probably be continuing.

727
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:29,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were expecting June 21st, if that is still available.

728
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:34,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Amanda and Danielle, I know we'll be talking a lot in the next two weeks leading up to it.

729
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:35,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for that.

730
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We will definitely

731
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:41,900
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to do our best and hope to get through all the comments and then be able to respond appropriately.

732
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:43,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks everyone for the input.

733
01:05:45,063 --> 01:05:45,503
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

734
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:49,767
[SPEAKER_15]: As a formality, do we want to vote on the on the continuance or okay?

735
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:50,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, let's do.

736
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:51,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do that.

737
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:57,553
[SPEAKER_15]: If there is there a motion to continue this matter until our next meeting on June 21st.

738
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:07,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Christie Dowd.

739
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

740
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:09,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily Hedman.

741
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

742
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:11,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

743
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

744
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,291
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm an aye as well.

745
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:16,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Katie.

746
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:17,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for being here.

747
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks to all you and the rest of your team.

748
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,174
[SPEAKER_15]: We look forward to seeing you again.

749
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:23,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

750
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:23,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

751
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:24,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

752
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:33,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay friends.

753
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:38,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Next item on the agenda, and I think it was on the public agenda so we'll have to make mention of it.

754
01:06:38,948 --> 01:06:45,333
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a request to submit a petition to propose changes to the zoning ordinance so I'll turn this over to city staff.

755
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:50,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to jump in unless Alicia or Danielle wants to.

756
01:06:51,653 --> 01:06:55,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want why don't I just sort of go so I asked Amanda to put this on.

757
01:06:56,197 --> 01:07:13,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how closely any of you guys follow the city council agendas, but you would see that the city council last night had on there, a bunch of zoning amendments, and a lot of them have been like how did those city Councilors come up with those, those very technical like changes that feel administrative.

758
01:07:16,715 --> 01:07:26,277
[SPEAKER_17]: So some of those, we met with the city council in a subcommittee about a change that one of the Councilors wanted to propose about the use table.

759
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:34,018
[SPEAKER_17]: And at that meeting, they said to us, they wanted to get those use table changes.

760
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:41,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically they're changing automobile uses from a yes to a special permit is what they would like to do.

761
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:46,358
[SPEAKER_17]: And they said they wanted to get that through as quickly as possible.

762
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:56,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And they said to us, we know that you have administrative things and clerical type stuff that you've been talking about that you want changed right away.

763
01:07:56,885 --> 01:08:04,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want us to add any of those into the thing we're going to put on the agenda right now?

764
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:05,590
[SPEAKER_17]: And we said yes.

765
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:16,456
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, yes, earlier today we were discussing putting them on the CD board agenda because they could come first from the CD board to the city council.

766
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,798
[SPEAKER_17]: So they invited us to draft some of those up.

767
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So we did, and we gave them to them.

768
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:28,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think any of them would be in any way stunning or shocking.

769
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:32,866
[SPEAKER_17]: There are things that we've discussed here and there with some of you, or you'll look at them and go like,

770
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's really super technical.

771
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:42,052
[SPEAKER_17]: So there will be a public hearing that we will be posting to discuss those.

772
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:44,714
[SPEAKER_17]: So last night, today's Wednesday, right?

773
01:08:45,274 --> 01:08:54,841
[SPEAKER_17]: They voted automatically to refer them to the CD board for your public hearing, where you will then discuss one of the Councilors.

774
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:58,304
[SPEAKER_17]: I've actually talked with Councilor Bears, who'd be happy to come talk

775
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:11,872
[SPEAKER_17]: particularly about the one that is coming from the Councilors, so that you would understand what they were thinking and why to help sort of move that along and make your recommendations on it.

776
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:16,395
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Danielle and Amanda and I can explain the rest of them.

777
01:09:17,272 --> 01:09:19,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, we can send them to you now.

778
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:23,217
[SPEAKER_17]: They were on last night's city council agenda, but they need to be publicly noticed.

779
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:28,581
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will tell you that in, uh, we did move that through fairly quickly.

780
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:39,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so it was actually today that I sent them to city's legal legal council, just to say like, Hey, any comment, are these all appropriately drafted?

781
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Do they need any edits, et cetera?

782
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:48,143
[SPEAKER_17]: with the intention of, for your public hearing, having legal feedback, if there's any.

783
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:55,691
[SPEAKER_17]: And most of it is extraordinarily straightforward, but people will ask, has a lawyer looked at this?

784
01:09:55,771 --> 01:10:02,238
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's why it was on the agenda and why we all then never had any materials to give you.

785
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:09,338
[SPEAKER_18]: So to clarify, this is for one change or a few changes?

786
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,900
[SPEAKER_17]: There is, I think, six on there.

787
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:26,189
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm happy to sort of go through them, but like some were errors, some were like misunderstandings of how some were unintended consequences once we started applying things.

788
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:35,215
[SPEAKER_17]: One of them's a clarification about who the SPGA is in certain situations that there's conflicting stuff.

789
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:45,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Like the ZBA had been voted to have five members and two associates in when we did that change back

790
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,061
[SPEAKER_17]: three years ago.

791
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:54,284
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when they did the recodification, somehow what got written in there was five members and one associate.

792
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,285
[SPEAKER_17]: And we actually went and pulled it.

793
01:10:56,325 --> 01:10:58,766
[SPEAKER_17]: And we said, hmm.

794
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:06,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So some of these things like that, you could say, is that stenographer's error?

795
01:11:06,869 --> 01:11:09,790
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we're doing changes, let's just do it as a change.

796
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:11,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Then it's better.

797
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:16,275
[SPEAKER_17]: and happy to discuss them all in detail.

798
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:26,380
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not in detail on your agenda tonight because what we wrote, the original plan was that I was gonna explain a bunch of these and then have you review them.

799
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:33,523
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also, if anybody wants to discuss them offline, obviously they're publicly posted.

800
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:36,124
[SPEAKER_17]: You're welcome to talk to any of us.

801
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:39,505
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say that Danielle and I are the real experts in them.

802
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:42,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Some came from each of us.

803
01:11:46,352 --> 01:11:50,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I throw one more into your mix just to think about?

804
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:58,394
[SPEAKER_15]: And that occurs to me today as I was preparing for the meeting, and it's occurred to me in other meetings.

805
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:15,117
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know when Jackie ran the 200 Boston Ave, I know I could tell Jackie you were arm wrestling with this as well, is just how do you work through the things that were really limited to evaluating in connection with the site plan review?

806
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:23,758
[SPEAKER_15]: And so one of the finer things maybe that I'm struggling with is how to reconcile.

807
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:28,341
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you have, let me put it out there.

808
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:30,443
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got 11.7.10 standards for approval.

809
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,965
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's kind of like, oh, you know, are you worried about traffic?

810
01:12:34,025 --> 01:12:34,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you worried about safety?

811
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:36,487
[SPEAKER_15]: That sort of, okay, that's great.

812
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:42,692
[SPEAKER_15]: But it also says the site plan should be consistent with 6.4, which I think is good.

813
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:44,093
[SPEAKER_15]: That's performance standards.

814
01:12:45,745 --> 01:12:49,567
[SPEAKER_15]: But then there's 6.1 and 6.2 and 6.3.

815
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:54,989
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I've just, I'm sort of scratching my head along your lines of like, is this a typo or is it deliberate?

816
01:12:55,590 --> 01:13:03,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I feel like 6.2 on signage has always, everyone's always deferred to the building department on signage.

817
01:13:03,373 --> 01:13:05,594
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't seem like that really comes up for us to talk about.

818
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:10,216
[SPEAKER_15]: In 6.1, it's parking and loading, which,

819
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:21,685
[SPEAKER_15]: We might talk about if somebody's not meeting the standards or we want to know if they're hitting the standards or not, but it kind of speaks for itself.

820
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:37,918
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got 6.3, which is landscaping and buffering, which, like when we had the American Beer Hall recently, we were relying, I think, more on the PDS staff to kind of figure out, hey, how many trees are there and, you know, what's the open space looking like?

821
01:13:38,799 --> 01:14:00,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's some stuff within 6.4 itself, like the lighting standards that I think are more akin to like the science, like, you know, am I going to really add a lot of value in figuring out what the lighting, I don't even know what the units of measure are well enough to really talk to it, but maybe that's more like signage.

822
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:05,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess it's a long way of me saying that I feel like there are some things that are

823
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,362
[SPEAKER_15]: real good for the board to weigh in on and kind of look and feel kind of things.

824
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:17,626
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I feel like there's probably some of these items that really are more like just straight building commissioner, or city confirmation.

825
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,608
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, so much time to get that out.

826
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:25,329
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I think, if I may.

827
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:28,391
[SPEAKER_16]: So in site plan review.

828
01:14:29,751 --> 01:14:32,953
[SPEAKER_16]: You all can waive some of those standards

829
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:36,390
[SPEAKER_16]: and signage landscaping in the parking and loading.

830
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,851
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's why it's included.

831
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:46,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So if they were going to depart from the strict compliance, you could review those.

832
01:14:47,556 --> 01:14:55,541
[SPEAKER_16]: So in the future, and my goal for when the next decision is to be made is to have a draft

833
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:18,997
[SPEAKER_16]: like a draft decision with some, you know, some of the staff findings and outlining what needs to be met, you know, what complies, what doesn't comply, what you would need to review to kind of lighten the load of going through all the findings.

834
01:15:20,805 --> 01:15:23,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess just to respond to your, to your suggestion there.

835
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:41,497
[SPEAKER_15]: I, I don't know like if we have the right to leave some of the parking requirements that that makes sense to me but it's not, it's not within the scope of the standards for approval, you know, so it's a little bit, it's a little bit weird to me, but I guess if this.

836
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,182
[SPEAKER_15]: If we knew who was responsible for 6.1, like the building commissioner, right?

837
01:15:47,222 --> 01:15:49,802
[SPEAKER_15]: You go down there, you give them for a building permit, and they say, you're denied.

838
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:54,424
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to go to a special permit, or you're not in conformity for these following reasons, whatever it is.

839
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:57,345
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like 6.1 would lend itself to something like that.

840
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:05,708
[SPEAKER_15]: And then somebody would come to the board and say, oh, we're short, but we want forgiveness because of some discretionary basis.

841
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:18,846
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not something we have to decide here but I'm just trying to point out I feel like things are treated a little bit differently in section six, but maybe the groupings could be thought about so that the right ones are clumped together.

842
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:22,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what I'm trying to say.

843
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:29,789
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'm getting it and I think what some of what we're looking at is.

844
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:34,616
[SPEAKER_17]: a result of how these were put together.

845
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:35,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

846
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:38,658
[SPEAKER_17]: So the six sections, they existed.

847
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:44,982
[SPEAKER_17]: And then during the recodification, they put in the performance standards.

848
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:48,504
[SPEAKER_17]: And so some of these performance standards were kind of dropped in here.

849
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:49,264
[SPEAKER_17]: And then

850
01:16:50,485 --> 01:17:08,917
[SPEAKER_17]: there was an expectation that the city would refine them and that the council would refine them more, but they just got sort of put, and we tried to get some of them edited up, we all looked at them, but they didn't, it didn't like flow as one coherent document after that.

851
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:12,820
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's part of what we're hoping to do with

852
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:23,744
[SPEAKER_17]: The, so the council, and, you know, honestly I apologize because sometimes there are things that I know so is going on so well because I'm in the middle of that I forget who I've said this to.

853
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:28,005
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I apologize if I have and I apologize if I haven't said this.

854
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:34,908
[SPEAKER_17]: So the council has been talking for a while about hiring a consultant to do like a redrafting of zoning.

855
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:56,905
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is actually so I worked and Danielle and I worked with the city council president and vice president to draft the scope for a consultant, that would be planning and legal together, that would be hired jointly by the council and our office to work on a full revamp of zoning, like things

856
01:17:57,505 --> 01:18:09,418
[SPEAKER_17]: for example, that our zoning looks at stuff differently than other cities, right, like it's doesn't it ties uses to zones, but it doesn't tie dimensions really to our zones.

857
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,100
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's odd.

858
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:17,948
[SPEAKER_17]: But that also like what are the performance standards and what should they be that are appropriate for Medford,

859
01:18:18,508 --> 01:18:22,170
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a lawyer who came in and said, you should have performance standards.

860
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Here are some cookie cutter ones, edit them.

861
01:18:25,072 --> 01:18:31,456
[SPEAKER_17]: But we never had a consultant come in and say, here are performance standards that are appropriate for your community.

862
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:34,538
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is something that we're planning to do.

863
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:36,879
[SPEAKER_17]: The RFP is ready to go out.

864
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:40,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Honestly, it may have been posted.

865
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:41,562
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that it hasn't.

866
01:18:41,602 --> 01:18:46,144
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're waiting for the procurement officer for just a few last tweaks.

867
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:47,305
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're going to put that out.

868
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:56,894
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be money in the council budget and then some money from our office in the new fiscal year to pay for a consultant to work with us on all of that.

869
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:08,686
[SPEAKER_17]: And it feels like that kind of rework of which performance standards are there and where are they belongs in that mix and like thinking about it and what are the dimensional standards.

870
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:18,110
[SPEAKER_17]: I am kind of kicking your comment down the road, but because we have an intent I'd like to do it intentionally as part of an overall.

871
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:32,354
[SPEAKER_17]: If there is like there are a few things there's something around fences that the ZBA has said could we please fix that sooner, because it's causing them to have to have hearings on things that they don't really feel should be in their purview.

872
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:43,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so there may be more tweaks coming, um, and the ones that you'll see on this list are absolutely things that we said cannot wait for a full rewrite.

873
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

874
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:54,306
[SPEAKER_17]: But if there are other things, we do have to just work with what are the process and I just want to be careful about if we have a bunch of administrative changes,

875
01:19:55,733 --> 01:20:08,459
[SPEAKER_17]: I think for everybody's sanity, I'd like to move them through and then get another bunch and move them through and not have like some that are in this stage and some that are in that stage and have us leapfrog like that will confuse people.

876
01:20:09,879 --> 01:20:11,320
[SPEAKER_17]: But I could be talked out of it.

877
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:13,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not, I don't have my heart on that process.

878
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:16,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to share while we were all together on that.

879
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:20,344
[SPEAKER_15]: So I see Ari's hand up.

880
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that yes, Ari?

881
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Your sounds really bad, we can't understand your words.

882
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:56,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, Ari.

883
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:59,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Try again, maybe if you reconnect them.

884
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we lost Ari completely.

885
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:08,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like they're frozen.

886
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:14,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, poor Ari.

887
01:21:20,537 --> 01:21:23,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Was there other hands up Daniel you had, but you're okay now.

888
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:30,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we can email you the draft that went to City Council.

889
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:32,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, if you want sure.

890
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:39,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been looking at stuff, knowing that there might be tweaks from legal counsel.

891
01:21:40,805 --> 01:21:47,848
[SPEAKER_17]: I suspect that legally, and honestly I've done fewer zoning changes and you probably have Danielle.

892
01:21:48,410 --> 01:22:07,752
[SPEAKER_17]: that what went to council probably has to show up at cd board exactly like that as the referral but that we would also if legal counsel made suggestions about changes we would send those to you as well and then your recommendation back would include

893
01:22:09,227 --> 01:22:10,748
[SPEAKER_17]: those things.

894
01:22:11,748 --> 01:22:15,970
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think I either thought of saying this or maybe I'm repeating myself.

895
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:20,811
[SPEAKER_17]: If anybody would like to discuss any of these offline, you're welcome to do that too.

896
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:28,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Because sometimes some of these get super in the weeds and it can be easier to like, wait, I don't understand this.

897
01:22:28,714 --> 01:22:33,496
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we can talk it through if anybody needs or wants to do that.

898
01:22:34,712 --> 01:22:36,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Ari, Ari, my friend, you're back.

899
01:22:37,094 --> 01:22:37,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

900
01:22:38,074 --> 01:22:39,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the technical issues.

901
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:41,596
[SPEAKER_15]: You sound great, by the way.

902
01:22:42,297 --> 01:22:42,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

903
01:22:42,877 --> 01:22:43,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So glad to hear it.

904
01:22:44,838 --> 01:22:49,561
[SPEAKER_02]: It froze on a lot of faces of entertainment with my technical issues, which is fair.

905
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just hoping to ask for the two sentence summary of kind of the idea behind Councilor Behr's proposal.

906
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:03,360
[SPEAKER_17]: The one that's the vehicle changes the auto.

907
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:18,773
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a concern that there are too many big parking lots full of vehicles, there are too many auto repair shops that that's not the highest and best use of spaces, particularly along mystic gas.

908
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:27,520
[SPEAKER_17]: And that we know we would like to do a rezoning that allow multiple stories and more dense development.

909
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:36,727
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also know that there are there is at least one, if not more vehicle repair places

910
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:47,588
[SPEAKER_17]: actively trying to relocate to Mystic Ave because they feel it's an appropriate place to go because they're getting pushed out of Somerville, other place in Cambridge.

911
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:57,136
[SPEAKER_17]: And because they're actively trying to come and we actively, we would really like to see something more and better there.

912
01:23:58,377 --> 01:24:01,719
[SPEAKER_17]: They would like to change the uses from being

913
01:24:03,501 --> 01:24:11,929
[SPEAKER_17]: as of right to special permit, um, to sort of send the signal that actually we're, we're slowing down on these.

914
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:20,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think there was some thought they wanted to change them to just know, and, but that might be a little too much too fast.

915
01:24:22,018 --> 01:24:22,798
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the thinking.

916
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if there was someone actively trying to relocate there.

917
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:40,546
[SPEAKER_17]: There is actually, and the general feeling was also, I will tell you that there is interest in hearing from the board who you think the appropriate special permitting authority should be.

918
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:46,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, for some of them had been special permit by city council.

919
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:49,590
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the switch was to put them all there.

920
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:53,912
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the Councilor may come and say that they're not actually wed to that idea.

921
01:24:54,452 --> 01:24:56,333
[SPEAKER_17]: And should it be the plant the CD board?

922
01:24:56,493 --> 01:24:57,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Should it be the ZBA?

923
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,414
[SPEAKER_17]: So I actually give you that so you could ruminate on that in advance as well.

924
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:05,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's an open conversation.

925
01:25:05,395 --> 01:25:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, does that include our

926
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Item number four, zoning ordinance, we're all set.

927
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we move forward to the minutes?

928
01:25:19,446 --> 01:25:20,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, excellent.

929
01:25:21,347 --> 01:25:24,829
[SPEAKER_15]: We have before us the minutes from the April 26 meeting.

930
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:33,534
[SPEAKER_15]: There were a few changes made from based on board input and reflected in yellow on the draft that was shared amongst the board.

931
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:48,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there additional comments, questions, or if satisfied, would someone like to make a motion to approve the April 26 meeting minutes?

932
01:25:57,738 --> 01:25:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I so move.

933
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,621
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one, and do we have a second?

934
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:03,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second.

935
01:26:04,984 --> 01:26:09,588
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, roll call vote then to approve the meeting minutes.

936
01:26:10,068 --> 01:26:11,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

937
01:26:12,571 --> 01:26:12,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

938
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Christy Dowd.

939
01:26:15,313 --> 01:26:15,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

940
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:16,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily Headman.

941
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:18,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

942
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:20,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Ari Goffman-Fishman.

943
01:26:21,278 --> 01:26:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

944
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:23,600
[SPEAKER_15]: And Emily as well.

945
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:24,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, excellent.

946
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:26,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, everyone.

947
01:26:28,805 --> 01:26:33,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Miscellaneous updates we have anything going there Amanda other things to share.

948
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:34,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

949
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be quick.

950
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we do have a meeting on the 21st.

951
01:26:40,393 --> 01:26:49,299
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of items on the agenda, including possibly, or, well, including the continued hearing from tonight for H Mart.

952
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:56,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we will see another planned development district for 280 mystic have.

953
01:26:57,265 --> 01:27:09,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually, we have those materials now so I will forward them all to you all early just because so you don't have to be like chewing through all of that material over the weekend before.

954
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:27,658
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have, and I should mention for 280 Mystic Ave, it's sort of a very large life sciences park campus feel type development with some retail uses and I think restaurant uses proposed as well.

955
01:27:28,939 --> 01:27:30,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So exciting stuff.

956
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:39,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we'll see a petition for a zoning map change for a site at 99 Revere Beach Parkway.

957
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:50,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a PDD, just kind of a simple, you know, here's an existing parcel, zoned this with a petition to rezone to something else.

958
01:27:52,440 --> 01:28:05,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, a special permit review for Bank of America site in the Wegmans Plaza, so I think the address is 3085 Mystic Valley Parkway.

959
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:26,066
[SPEAKER_01]: They, the Special Permit Granting Authority is city council so in the head, a little weirdness with their permitting pathway which we can explain over email, but basically, the board will be making some recommendations to counsel.

960
01:28:28,485 --> 01:28:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that's it for next meeting.

961
01:28:32,528 --> 01:28:39,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to just acknowledge that terms are coming up for several of our members, so Christy, Klaus, and David.

962
01:28:40,434 --> 01:28:44,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So next meeting may be your last.

963
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:49,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be celebrating them and all they've contributed.

964
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,262
[SPEAKER_01]: We are interviewing several candidates.

965
01:28:52,282 --> 01:28:54,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some things set up next week.

966
01:28:56,471 --> 01:29:05,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just a gentle reminder for existing members to be thinking about elections in that first July 5th meeting.

967
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:10,674
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to speak on a July 5th meeting.

968
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:14,775
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that I will not be in attendance because I won't be in the states.

969
01:29:17,296 --> 01:29:22,337
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know where that leaves us with quorum or anything like that.

970
01:29:24,532 --> 01:29:26,892
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, yeah, we can talk offline.

971
01:29:27,753 --> 01:29:34,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have like feedback or any of that for the elections themselves too that you want communicated, we can figure that out.

972
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,834
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks for giving us a heads up.

973
01:29:38,335 --> 01:29:41,996
[SPEAKER_17]: People who don't show up to things get elected to stuff, you know, just saying.

974
01:29:42,056 --> 01:29:48,157
[SPEAKER_15]: When we come back, it'll be the one woman community development board.

975
01:29:51,497 --> 01:29:54,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of- Nothing, you couldn't handle it.

976
01:29:58,098 --> 01:30:01,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, history board or historical commission.

977
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

978
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:04,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there upcoming meetings?

979
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:09,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I agreed as an interim and just wanted to check in if there's anything I'm supposed to be doing.

980
01:30:09,506 --> 01:30:14,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the community preservation commission or committee.

981
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

982
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:15,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

983
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually.

984
01:30:19,788 --> 01:30:24,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check with Teresa, the new coordinator, on when the next meeting is.

985
01:30:25,512 --> 01:30:29,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sometimes there's a break in the summer, but I think that that's later.

986
01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:33,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that there may be a July meeting or so.

987
01:30:33,698 --> 01:30:34,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let you know.

988
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:36,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

989
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:46,788
[SPEAKER_16]: In the interviews with some of the new prospective board members, we're going to be pitching

990
01:30:47,622 --> 01:30:52,805
[SPEAKER_16]: that you get to serve on the CPA, the CPC.

991
01:30:55,467 --> 01:31:03,171
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully it'll be, your commitment will be short-lived, but we think that you'll fall in love with the CPC and you'll want to stay.

992
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:04,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Fall and try.

993
01:31:09,545 --> 01:31:11,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Two other just little administrative-y things.

994
01:31:13,008 --> 01:31:20,054
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure, but if you all are aware, in the last three weeks, we've had two new full-time staff start in our office.

995
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:26,359

1002
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:15,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a great time for us to be moving things forward.

1003
