1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:01,516
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:04,138
Thanks for waiting for us a little bit.

3
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:07,302
We just wanted to get our ducks in a row before opening up the meeting.

4
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,845
And we're just letting people file in.

5
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:12,627
I believe everyone is in.

6
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:15,110
And with that, I'll pass the baton to Chair Blumberg.

7
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:17,813
Thank you, Amanda.

8
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:21,257
Welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

9
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:27,688
I'll call the meeting to order and as always begin with some obligatory messages for you.

10
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,013
First, to let you know this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

11
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:37,235
No in person attendance of members of the public will be permitted.

12
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:44,883
but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in chapter two of the acts of 2023.

13
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:56,411
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford website.

14
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:04,096
If despite best efforts, we are not able to provide real time access, we'll post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

15
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:11,200
A reminder that given the remote nature of tonight's meeting, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

16
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:26,548
An additional reminder to everyone, project materials for the projects before us tonight and others that come before the board, past and future, can be viewed on the city's website medfordma.org

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:37,264
If you find your way to the tab for boards and commissions, you'll see Community Development Board they're listed alphabetically click through and you'll find the projects before us.

18
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:41,566
So begin with a roll call of members in attendance tonight.

19
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:42,826
My name is Dave Bloomberg.

20
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,127
Happy to have all of you here.

21
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,148
Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

22
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:48,688
Present.

23
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,069
Christy Dowd.

24
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:51,249
Present.

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,770
Emily Hedman.

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:53,970
Present.

27
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,491
Ari Goffman Fishman.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,065
and two members Clayson Peter absent tonight, but we'll move ahead with the group here.

29
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:13,674
And I guess I'll ask Amanda first to introduce the benefit of the public and others participating any of the city staff that are on the call tonight.

30
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:15,842
Thanks.

31
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:16,523
Thank you, Chair.

32
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:23,266
So myself, Amanda Centrella, planning staff in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

33
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:32,490
We're also joined by Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, and Danielle Evans, our senior planner, will be joining us shortly.

34
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,232
I also wanted to take a moment to introduce a new graduate intern in our office, Clem Doucette.

35
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:40,493
We're excited to have them.

36
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:44,715
And I believe that's everyone from Cityside who's attending tonight.

37
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:46,457
Great, thank you.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,109
Let's go to our first item on the agenda then.

39
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:55,239
We have a review of a proposal from Tufts University.

40
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,540
So let me read the public notice on this.

41
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:16,724
This is regarding a meeting tonight relative to an application for site plan review submitted by the trustees of Tufts College to construct a two-story, 3,595 square foot infill addition to an existing building, Eaton Hall at 0 College Ave here in Medford,

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,865
with landscaping and interior alterations.

43
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:26,867
The project is subject to site plan review for Dover amendment uses per our zoning ordinance.

44
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:34,149
And this is a bit of a new twist on our updated ordinance that a matter like this would be before us.

45
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,750
So with that, let me turn things over to the Tufts team.

46
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,231
Good evening, Mr. Chair, can you hear me?

47
00:03:43,198 --> 00:04:00,386
I can absolutely How are you doing attorney dash doing very well sir attorney Adam dash 48 Grove Street in Summerville and Davis Square representing the trustees of Tufts College with me tonight as you can see is Rocco Dorico the executive director of government and community relations for Tufts he and I will be doing presentation.

48
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:05,609
Jennifer also with us just in case there are questions or we brought everybody just you never know.

49
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:10,980
Jennifer Whitney, the Senior Project Manager for Capital Projects Department for Tufts is here.

50
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:15,384
Nicholas Botts and Joy Wang from Niche Engineering.

51
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,765
Peter Vieira from Payette Architects.

52
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,848
Regan Shields-Ives from Feingold Alexander Architects.

53
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:25,391
Nathan Scott, Associate Director of Capital Projects for Tufts as well.

54
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:31,695
But it's a fairly straightforward application, one would hope.

55
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:34,617
Welcome to all of your colleagues.

56
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,238
Thank you for being here tonight.

57
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:46,425
Just for the benefit of those maybe in the public who are watching and interested, we did ask, given the nature of this work and its location,

58
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,106
for you to maybe scale back in your presentation a little bit.

59
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:55,007
Tufts usually does a very robust presentation for us when matters come before the board.

60
00:04:55,388 --> 00:05:01,749
So just as a note for those who may follow matters with Tufts, I wanted to let you know.

61
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,970
Understood, and I can explain why that is.

62
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:04,970
Of course.

63
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:09,372
I do have some slides not as robust as one would usually see from us for that.

64
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,172
I can take a hint.

65
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:13,473
Can you see that on the slide?

66
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,283
It says sharing, but I don't see the material yet.

67
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,344
It says you are screen sharing.

68
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,224
There you are.

69
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:22,584
All right, cool.

70
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,444
All right.

71
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:38,027
So as you stated, this is an application or site plan review of a Dover amendment used for to construct a two-story infill addition with rooftop mechanicals to the building in the Tufts campus known as Eaton Hall, and to make some landscaping and interior alterations.

72
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,628
The slide would be on the left.

73
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:45,399
There we go.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:52,344
The location of it, as you can see here outlined in red, the building is completely surrounded by the Tufts University campus.

75
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,986
It is located in the apartment two zoning district.

76
00:05:55,046 --> 00:06:00,550
The only non-Tufts abutter is within 400 feet of the MBTA railroad tracks, and there's one rental property in Somerville.

77
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,412
It's all really surrounded by Tufts.

78
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:08,016
Going down here, you can see the existing conditions.

79
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,118
This is Eaton Hall, which is an academic building on campus.

80
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:20,070
The proposal is to build this infill addition in the center, which is a 3,595-square-foot, two-story infill addition.

81
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:34,614
This will increase the size of Eaton Hall such that the ground floor will increase from 12,755 square feet to 14,410 square feet.

82
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:40,115
And you can see it here on the front of the square where we're doing this infill addition where the building currently jogs in.

83
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,981
The use of the building is going to remain academic.

84
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:47,142
Rocco, can you explain just briefly what's going on and why we're doing this?

85
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:53,324
Thank you, Adam, and thank you members of the board for letting us present to you tonight.

86
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,205
As Adam mentioned, this is an academic building.

87
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,086
The use will remain academic.

88
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:07,269
This building houses our number of arts and sciences departments, including theology, sociology, and the classics.

89
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:13,172
As we're looking at many of the older buildings on our campus, we're looking to renovate them.

90
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:19,316
And our three main goals are sustainability, accessibility, and community.

91
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:28,982
From a sustainability standpoint, all the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems will be replaced and improved.

92
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:35,907
And this is part of our effort to make the building more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuels.

93
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:51,276
Um, from an accessibility standpoint, this renovation includes essentially located wheelchair, accessible entry that opens into a gathering space and has elevators and direct access to the academic green.

94
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:56,019
It also makes our classrooms offices, breakout areas and gathering spaces.

95
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:17,397
More accessible and then finally on a note on community, you know, we're really trying in these renovations to create breakout spaces and collaboration spaces that encourage community so that our students can gather together with faculty and staff.

96
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,461
and create and be innovative and discuss.

97
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:31,866
So this all fits in line with our larger mission and our larger philosophy on making improvements throughout the campus.

98
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:33,727
Thanks, Rocco.

99
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:39,651
You can see here, this is sort of a detail of the front end with the landscaping.

100
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:44,413
I would note that the building, the accessibility and the energy efficiency will be improved from the project.

101
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:46,995
Energy usage will be reduced.

102
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,370
So that's all to the good.

103
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,813
This is the dimensional table, which is in our application.

104
00:08:54,853 --> 00:09:02,697
The existing dimensional requirements will comply with the zoning ordinance, except the existing nonconforming maximum lot cover will be increased by 2%.

105
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:12,622
Of course, what is the lot, quote unquote, is a little bit less important because Eaton Hall faces on the entire green of all the buildings and it's sort of one interconnected whole.

106
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:18,259
So however, just to be technical about it, that is the, I do want to point that out.

107
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:22,421
As the board knows, this Dover amendment projects are limited to two inquiries.

108
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:30,604
One is a Dover protected use, which clearly an academic building is, and two, reasonable regulations to certain things can be imposed.

109
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:35,866
I would note again that the change in the existing non-conforming lot cover is only 2%.

110
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:42,629
The project's going to allow ADA and compliance and energy efficiency and adapt an old building to modern needs.

111
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:48,361
and there's no new nonconformity created, no other existing nonconformities are going to be exacerbated.

112
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:53,804
This is the project schedule because people often ask us what we're going to be doing and when.

113
00:09:53,824 --> 00:10:01,368
I saw that we did note, I just want to point out, and I have raised this with staff, that there are some condition proposals from various departments.

114
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,369
I would say that they're all fine.

115
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:08,352
There are maybe, there are three I wanted to point out that I think are boilerplate that probably don't really apply.

116
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:17,118
One is regarding filing 21E environmental reports, which really we don't have to do for something like this.

117
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:21,299
Second is about not making noise to bother the neighbors, and that's really only us.

118
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm happy not to do that, but I don't really think it really matters much.

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:36,723
And the last we've got to do is sanitary conditions, and I believe that's got to do with making sure we pull the proper permits to do the construction, which clearly Buff always does.

120
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,694
I think that's, we're gonna do those things.

121
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:48,920
I just wanted to clarify that those, just to clarify that those are what those three statements from the health department are about.

122
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,023
But other than that, the applicant asked that the board approve the site plan review for the project.

123
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,786
Adam, can I just point out one typo before you conclude?

124
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,649
Construction is actually proposed to start in fall of 2023.

125
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,753
So I apologize for the typo on the presentation.

126
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,303
All right, well, thank you for taking the hit on that one.

127
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,464
So I'm done sharing.

128
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,844
That's pretty much all it is.

129
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:16,265
It's just a relatively small info to an existing building.

130
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:17,826
Okay, great.

131
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:18,546
Thank you very much.

132
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,467
Amanda, anyone on the city side?

133
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:25,428
Not that anyone has to comment, but we always invite the city to comment.

134
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:30,490
I don't think we have any additional comments at the moment.

135
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:37,359
Okay, and we should solicit input from the public if there are members of the public here who'd like to participate.

136
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:52,935
Yes, so if I may, if anyone from the public would be interested in participating, you can use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the screen, or you can put your name in the chat.

137
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:58,660
I can also receive emails to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

138
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,324
And as I refresh that page now,

139
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,731
Let's see, we haven't received any emails up until this point.

140
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:12,314
And just going to give folks maybe a minute to see if anyone wants to speak.

141
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:22,260
And then nothing received in advance of tonight's meeting from public.

142
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,121
Correct.

143
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:25,582
That is correct.

144
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:30,385
And I'm not seeing any hands or notes in the chat either.

145
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,615
Okay, great, thank you.

146
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:37,577
We'll close the public comment period then and turn to the board deliberation.

147
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:47,281
We are limited in our second interview of this type of a use, of course, first to determine that it is a Dover amendment use.

148
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:58,025
I think, unless there's objection from another board member, we can take notice of the fact that an academic building in the center of the Tufts campus would satisfy that.

149
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,108
Then we could consider reasonable regulations.

150
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,692
If anyone feels like they want to speak on these matters.

151
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:22,265
Otherwise, I'll go through the list but speak up if you, if you have some comment or question regarding bulk and height of structures yard sizes lot area setbacks, open space parking building coverage requirements.

152
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:25,028
Any comments from the board.

153
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,754
This is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

154
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:37,020
As Attorney Dash has mentioned, the nonconformity increased by 2% of the lot coverage.

155
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,541
That really isn't a thing, right?

156
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,103
Because it's an academic quad.

157
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,986
I'm just, I want to make sure that we're clear here.

158
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:55,535
I don't I don't see any issues and as far as parking, because again it's academic why it does, I don't think that will increase parking is right.

159
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,976
Right.

160
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, no, I can respond to that if you'd like Mr. Again, this is according to the assessors.

161
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:06,004
This Eaton Hall is parcel T-00-21.

162
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:10,165
They divvied up the quad into little parcels.

163
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:15,106
There's really no reason for it because obviously it's not taxed.

164
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,867
I'm just being technical by the code terms.

165
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:26,210
I'm using the lot that the successors have put this building on, but it's really not lots, it's like a whole.

166
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,631
I don't think it's important, but I did want to call it out to be honest and open about it.

167
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,036
Yeah, I agree.

168
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,857
It's very common with campuses.

169
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,598
It's hard to define lots.

170
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:39,980
That's why we have three addresses for it, because it doesn't really have an address.

171
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,043
It's zero College Ave, or 5 the Green, or 8 Upper Campus Road, depending on where you are.

172
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:47,583
Yeah.

173
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:48,544
I just wanted to be clear.

174
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:48,924
Thank you.

175
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:52,686
And one other question that's kind of related, but not really.

176
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,486
When is sociology moving to Eaton Hall?

177
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:55,607
I'm a Tufts alum.

178
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,648
That's the only other question.

179
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,164
as they are very eager to get into this new building.

180
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:06,106
So they, I think, will be the first group to move in, Jackie.

181
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:10,348
So they're very eager to move in.

182
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:11,429
Awesome.

183
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:12,189
Thank you.

184
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,191
OK.

185
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:15,931
Yes, Christy.

186
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:18,573
I just have more of a question out of curiosity.

187
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,554
First, the rendering looks very nice.

188
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:27,197
But in terms of the glazing with the stretch code, what is proposed?

189
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,278
How are you addressing that?

190
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,410
Someone from the architecture team?

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,632
Yeah, I'm just curious because I'm doing a study for Harvard, and there's been a lot of discussion.

192
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,233
Sure, I can address that.

193
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:40,893
Hi, Peter Vieira from Payette.

194
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:50,096
So the project incorporates, obviously, there's some glass overlooking the quad very much in keeping with the idea of making this space more inviting.

195
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:56,638
But there are actually areas of solid and opaque glazing on the edges and up on the second floor behind.

196
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:59,419
a sort of glass screen that's in front.

197
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,539
So we do actually, of course, we need to meet that code.

198
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:10,701
We do actually meet the code, but it's through a creative use of how we've used the opaque portions of the cladding in conjunction with the glass.

199
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:14,942
And it's triple glazed, I should add to it.

200
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,043
It is all triple glazed.

201
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:17,423
Thank you.

202
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:18,663
Thank you.

203
00:16:20,443 --> 00:16:21,524
Okay, excellent.

204
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:26,705
Unless there's other discussion from the board, we could entertain a motion to

205
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,580
approve the application for site plan approval.

206
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,721
I'll make a motion to approve.

207
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,402
I'll second the motion.

208
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:41,125
Okay, and let's hit a roll call vote then we'll start, as always, with Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

209
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,146
Hi, Christie.

210
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,987
Hi, Emily.

211
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:47,589
Hi, Ari Guffman Fishman.

212
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,850
And I'm an eye as well.

213
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,713
Thank you, attorney dash and Rocco and everyone here on behalf of toughs.

214
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,909
Thank you very much on behalf of TUS for your time and attention to this.

215
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:00,750
Good evening.

216
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,911
Good night.

217
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:19,803
Okay, now we'll move on to our next item, site plan review for 285, 295 Middlesex Ave.

218
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:22,785
Let me pull up the notice on that.

219
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:25,446
Give me a moment.

220
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:49,026
Okay, this board will conduct a meeting tonight via zoom relative to an application for site plan reviews submitted by maldex limited partnership, regarding the tenant fit out of an existing 27,160 square foot building previously a fitness center to a supermarket at 285 to 95 mil sex have in Medford.

221
00:17:52,263 --> 00:18:02,291
This is a project that involves a change in principle use of an existing building containing 10,000 square feet or more, meaning that it meets the definition of a major project.

222
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,794
And under our zoning ordinance, it therefore requires site plan review by this board.

223
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:15,861
So let me invite the applicant team to introduce themselves and present.

224
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,421
Thanks.

225
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,682
My name is Katie Weatherby.

226
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,603
I'm here on behalf of WS Development.

227
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:30,446
We're the owners of Townline Plaza, which is the overall shopping center there.

228
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:35,189
And I'm joined tonight by H-Mart and our consultants.

229
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:42,054
We have Keith on the architecture team, Kristen on the traffic and engineering side, and then Joe on the civil engineering side.

230
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:51,561
I thought I would do something similar to Tess, do a brief overview, and then if there's questions, invite the experts to help chime in.

231
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:53,323
OK, great.

232
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:53,764
Thank you.

233
00:18:54,304 --> 00:19:02,610
I'm going to attempt to share my screen.

234
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:11,336
Are you able to see HMART at Townline Plaza?

235
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:12,477
Yes, we can see it.

236
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:13,338
OK, great.

237
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:20,703
So I thought first I would kind of orient people to the site.

238
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,925
This is called Townline Plaza.

239
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:30,831
I would say very appropriately as it is on the town line, but it's actually the city line, so it should probably be renamed City Line Plaza.

240
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:37,137
But this is the city line that goes through Medford to the south and Malton to the north.

241
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:41,461
The green line here, if you can see my hand, I'm following it.

242
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,503
If not, it is the green line around the property.

243
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:46,085
That shows the extent of our property.

244
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:56,219
We did want to call out that we have a parking easement to the south that feels very much like it's part of the property, but it is owned by the National Grid at this point.

245
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:02,221
And then just site where H-Mart is going to be going within that plaza.

246
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:07,663
Zooming in a little bit more, you can see where the proposed H-Mart is going.

247
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:12,685
This location was previously occupied by Crunch Fitness, if you're familiar with the area.

248
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:22,107
They relocated to our sister property, Broadway Plaza, just about a year ago in March of 2022 to make way for H Mart to come in.

249
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:26,769
And actually, before it was Crunch Fitness, it was a store market for about 20 years.

250
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:34,573
So this same location has actually been a grocery store before, which is one of the reasons why, as a landowner, we knew a grocery store would be a great idea.

251
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:43,976
Continuing on, I pulled some aerial street views from Google just to kind of orient people.

252
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:49,259
And then that way, if you want to do later, you could go and kind of replicate the same views.

253
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:51,881
If you're coming up from Middlesex Ave.

254
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:56,684
from Medford, there's a car wash to the right.

255
00:20:56,724 --> 00:20:58,745
And this is kind of your first view of the property.

256
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:02,367
This right here is the former Crunch Fitness, where H-Mart will be going.

257
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:10,094
If you continue a little bit ways up, you see that there's a right turn in only, which will actually bring customers right to H Mart.

258
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:13,276
So it is a really great feature of the property as it exists today.

259
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:18,260
So this is showing the lower right-hand view shows the right turn in only.

260
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:28,029
Continuing up Middlesex Ave and about to change to Highland Ave as we cross the town line is the main entrance to the property.

261
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,590
Dunkin Donuts is to the right.

262
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:31,452
This is a full,

263
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,659
Cars can go in and out at this intersection.

264
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,563
And then the northernmost property entrance is next to John Brewer's Tavern.

265
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:45,246
So that's kind of the full extent along Middlesex slash Highland Avenue.

266
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,549
And then some views from within the property.

267
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,493
There are two major buildings today, as well as a Dunkin' Donuts out parcel.

268
00:21:55,413 --> 00:22:00,817
H-Mart is going into the easternmost building, and they're kind of anchoring the building.

269
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:11,509
Along the strip today, there's a lot of existing stores, really a traditional shopping center in that it has a little bit of everything.

270
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,551
It does have restaurants, retail, some service uses as well.

271
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:23,136
In the top left view, Crunch is all the way at the end, sorry, former Crunch, future H Mart.

272
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:27,579
Then the bottom right view is just looking at that area a little bit closer.

273
00:22:30,563 --> 00:22:41,369
And then as you continue through the site, this is looking back towards the side of future H-Mart and kind of along H-Mart on the top left.

274
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:47,672
And then the bottom right view shows the large parking field that is behind H-Mart, where also they'll be doing a lot of their loading and service.

275
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,355
A little bit about H-Mart.

276
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,617
They are an Asian American market.

277
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,118
They've been in business for nearly 40 years.

278
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:02,260
They have over 78 stores in 14 states.

279
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,142
They do have other locations in Massachusetts already.

280
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,243
Cambridge is 1 of them.

281
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:14,228
They pick locations where they can really serve the community that they're in, and they're very attracted to Medford, particularly because of the college.

282
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:16,349
So great that tops was here earlier.

283
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,032
And these are some pictures from other locations.

284
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:32,795
The plans that were submitted, I'll go through them briefly as part of the site plan review application, showing the existing conditions.

285
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,797
The property was built in the 1960s.

286
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:40,863
We've had tenants go in and out of the various stores along the strip since then.

287
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,985
Duncan was added at some point after that.

288
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:49,271
But this main building was built in 1960 and it's had a lot of different uses, but mostly remained the same.

289
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:57,954
This page now shows some changes to the site that we're proposing to accommodate the use.

290
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:02,356
H-Mart is taking the building almost entirely as is.

291
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:09,118
Like I said, it was a grocery store before it was a fitness use, so the building actually was set up to pretty well already handle the use.

292
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:17,380
Because of that and because it previously had a grocery store in the shopping center, there's really not that many changes to the site that needed to be made to accommodate it.

293
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,982
The minimal changes include shifting one island

294
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,732
to accommodate a truck turn, which we will show later.

295
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:33,436
Then the elimination of some parking in the rear to allow loading and service in this back corner.

296
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:42,522
They're adding cart corrals, doing a lot of improvements inside the building, but the site mostly was set up already today to accommodate this use.

297
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,205
More technical drawings on the side improvements.

298
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,429
Then to understand the existing composition of the property,

299
00:24:53,573 --> 00:24:58,077
You know, there's Duncan, like I talked about proposed grocery store that we're talking about tonight.

300
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:01,940
There's retail, there's a doctor's office, there's some restaurants.

301
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,262
There's a smaller grocery store on the left.

302
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:07,224
There's actually like manufacturing and Armatron International.

303
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:12,989
And this is also another great view to kind of show where the city town line goes through the property.

304
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:22,016
And this is just an overall existing conditions view of the property that shows both

305
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,049
the Medford side, as well as the Malton side.

306
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:35,115
We received a lot of questions and comments through city review.

307
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:38,377
And so we pulled together a couple documents that address some of those.

308
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:44,600
And then we'd be looking forward to talking through any additional comments and some of those comments with the board this evening.

309
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,822
One thing we did want to note is the

310
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,145
The size of the project we understand warrants a major project.

311
00:25:51,225 --> 00:25:56,027
However, it is reoccupying an existing building and a mostly existing site as it exists today.

312
00:25:56,047 --> 00:26:00,150
A lot of the conditions we read almost like it was a brand new construction.

313
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,310
We were building 25,000 square feet.

314
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:08,054
So we just want to emphasize that we really tried to keep the site work as minimal as possible because it worked.

315
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:12,857
And so we weren't planning on doing a lot of site work because it existed and functioned well today.

316
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,378
So there were some questions about truck turning.

317
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:26,123
We actually, this is one of the items we worked really closely with H Mart on, was understanding how the site can accommodate the truck turns.

318
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:27,844
It's a shopping center.

319
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:34,768
We really want to make sure that customers are not impacted as the grocery tenant has a lot of trucks coming to and from the property.

320
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:38,150
So we need to understand how those trucks would service.

321
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,951
And so this shows the truck entering the property.

322
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,493
This helped us determine

323
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:57,331
the one area that we did need to modify the site, which is just, we had one loss of a parking space to accommodate an area that was previously a little tight on the truck turn.

324
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:01,913
But this shows the truck driving through the property and then backing into the loading dock.

325
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:10,917
And then in order to exit the same way, the truck just needed a little bit more maneuverability to take a couple of turns.

326
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,918
One thing I will note is that

327
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:16,109
These programs are often a little conservative.

328
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:23,974
I have seen truck drivers do some very, very tight turns, but this is a conservative, safe truck movement.

329
00:27:27,636 --> 00:27:34,181
There are also questions about existing bike racks and stop lines and adding some stop lines and stop signs.

330
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:38,524
So we do have some existing bike racks on property today on both sides.

331
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:42,166
This plan shows a couple here and then a couple over here as well.

332
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,868
So there are bike racks in both Malden and Medford.

333
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,871
And they look like little circles on the sidewalk today.

334
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,954
I can go back to different aerials if helpful to see them.

335
00:27:51,974 --> 00:28:01,502
And then we do have stop lines in some locations, but we do recognize that we probably need to add a few more stop lines throughout the property.

336
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:05,005
So this just shows that yes, we are accommodating those.

337
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,414
I'll pause there.

338
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:18,816
I included all the submission materials in case there were questions that were more helpful and answered by other materials that were not planned in nature.

339
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:25,117
But I just want to comment that the existing site does really accommodate the use well.

340
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:34,500
And some of the conditions imposed were for offsite work that we were a little surprised by because this is such a minimal change to the existing site.

341
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,851
to is at the end of your presentation.

342
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,613
We'll hear from some of your colleagues.

343
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,775
That's the end of the presentation.

344
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:53,257
And I think they're here more if there's specific questions.

345
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:56,180
Okay.

346
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:03,025
Any city staff in the queue to speak on this one, Amanda?

347
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:10,452
Alicia, Danielle, any comments you guys wanted to provide?

348
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:15,934
You don't have to, we always just invite.

349
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,922
Okay.

350
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,025
How about members of the public at this time?

351
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:30,850
Amanda, any folks who'd like to participate or speak on this matter?

352
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:42,672
Yeah, so once more, just want to invite folks who would like to provide comment that you can do so if you use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the screen.

353
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:52,336
You can also use the chat box if you're not sure how to use that feature and put your name in there and I'll call you in the queue.

354
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:55,317
And I do see a hand raised.

355
00:29:56,118 --> 00:30:00,660
So Judy Kim, if you could just provide your name and address for the record.

356
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,138
Hi, my name is Judy Kim.

357
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,702
I live in 48 McCormick Ave in Medford.

358
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:07,244
Welcome.

359
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:08,326
Thanks for being here today.

360
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:09,653
Yes, thank you.

361
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:17,616
This is my first time and I'm so excited for H Mart coming that this is my first time joining a meeting because I wanted to express my excitement for this development.

362
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:26,700
As Catherine had mentioned, there are several other locations within Massachusetts, but they are a pain to get to.

363
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,921
The one in Cambridge, the parking is abysmal.

364
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:32,742
The one in Burlington, you cannot get there during rush hour because of the 93-95 junction parking lot.

365
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,524
you know, having one in Medford is so significant for me.

366
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:46,606
I'm really excited for the diversity of produce and food products that aren't really available in existing grocery stores in Medford, but would be available.

367
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:57,049
And I also think I see the potential for a very large customer base, you know, not just in Medford, but also with our neighbors in Malden, which has a significant Asian population.

368
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,590
And so, you know, I was born and raised in Korea, I am now a US citizen, but

369
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:09,093
you know, it's always good to introduce, you know, neighbors and family to cuisine that's, you know, near, dear to my heart.

370
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:14,936
So I am very excited for this development and I hope you really consider this, you know, seriously.

371
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:15,537
Thank you.

372
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:17,558
Thank you.

373
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:18,998
Thanks for your comments.

374
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,522
Amanda, you're looking out into the universe there to see if we have

375
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:37,087
Yes, I'm seeing no other hands raised or chats and I'm just refreshing our inbox to make sure nothing else has come in via email.

376
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,149
And yep, it looks like nothing has.

377
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:45,272
Okay, so we'll close that public comment portion then.

378
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:50,515
Questions from the board for the applicant this evening?

379
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,431
I have one that's- Ari, go ahead.

380
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:01,091
Sorry.

381
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:04,672
I couldn't see you because I only have so many windows there.

382
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:05,152
Yep, sorry.

383
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:15,335
Love HMARC, super excited about this and agreed that it would be a great addition to the community.

384
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:20,016
My question is the Cambridge one I know has a food court as well.

385
00:32:21,016 --> 00:32:24,017
Is that something that's being considered or planned for this one?

386
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,340
Is that something you're able to answer?

387
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,103
I would say yes, but not with any certainty.

388
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:32,804
Yes, I can answer that.

389
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:37,008
Keith Bettencourt from BK Architects, I'm the architect of record for the project.

390
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:43,053
It will have food court functions as well, very similar to the Burlington and the other locations.

391
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:59,739
Great, I look forward to many delicious pastries and the kind of official route would love to kind of make sure that there's the appropriate trash and litter mitigation for outdoors, especially in the parking lot.

392
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:13,071
Any comments on the policing of the lot, maybe, issue that Ari's raising?

393
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:19,555
Yeah, so as the property owner, we do have border service that goes around and empties the existing trash cans.

394
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,496
We've actually something we monitored closely.

395
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:31,860
Really during COVID, we did notice an increase and we're very thankful it's returning to post COVID or pre COVID levels in terms of the trash on property.

396
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,582
But we do have existing landscapers that maintain the property itself.

397
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:42,037
And then with regards to H Mart, I've switched to this plan because they do have a lot of dumpsters.

398
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:49,743
They'll of course work with the health department on anything that's required permit wise, making sure it's adequate road and control and things like that.

399
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:52,825
But it's something we do take very seriously and we closely monitor.

400
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:03,403
David, this is Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

401
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:05,005
I have a couple of questions.

402
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:12,234
One, it is exciting to have this new means coming in, and I can definitely see a large customer base and maybe market demand.

403
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:16,019
And speaking of that, one of the things that I noticed

404
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:25,931
And just for the area over there in Middlesex Ave, is there, one of my first questions is, I wasn't aware that this was a grocery store previously.

405
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:28,553
I thought it was always a fitness center even before crunch.

406
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:32,976
So I didn't realize that it was already set up to be a grocery center.

407
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:38,900
So I'm trying to figure out how emergency vehicles and if trucks are tight and they're loading.

408
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,202
How would emergency vehicles go in there?

409
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:46,226
Then my second piece to that is traffic generation trips are going to be higher.

410
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:51,671
And I want to know if it was standard uses or if it was actually determined at certain peak hours.

411
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:58,878
And then secondly, the pedestrian set up over there is lacking on Middlesex Ave.

412
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:01,460
So I have a couple of questions surrounding safety.

413
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:11,875
And if it wants to just speak a little bit more on so basically my overall questions are safety.

414
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:16,482
Access for proper access for emergency vehicles and then.

415
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:33,260
traffic generation, which you say, for instance, this is as we just heard from one of our residents, Miss Kim stated that it would be a demand, even I was shocked, you know, it sounds like it's a great place going to bring all kinds of people.

416
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:38,343
Are we prepared for this and with the proper traffic generation resource?

417
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:49,224
Sure, so I will give high level overview answers, and then I'm going to turn over some of the experts, particularly on traffic, because we do have our traffic engineer here this evening.

418
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:55,309
So in terms of emergency access, the building today exists in the same condition.

419
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,792
We're not making any exterior changes that would impede access.

420
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:03,716
We're actually, we've had a lot of interaction, unfortunately, with the fire department in recent years.

421
00:36:04,657 --> 00:36:07,239
But they've been able to service the building to our knowledge,

422
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:12,296
This was in terms of a truck accommodating a turn was the one thing we had to make.

423
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:15,597
Fire truck access is a little bit different maneuverability.

424
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:20,558
We've never heard from the fire department of any issues accessing the space.

425
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:27,959
We'd be more than happy to submit a plan that shows the fire trucks circulating the property and work with the fire department if they do have concerns.

426
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:34,641
But the property as it exists today is being serviced by Medford Fire and I haven't heard of any challenges.

427
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,301
In terms of

428
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:37,727
level traffic.

429
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:43,490
And like I said, I'm going to turn it over to Kristen afterwards to talk in more detail because she's the expert.

430
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,232
This property was originally set up as a shopping center.

431
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:53,797
And so it was a grocery store back in, I think, stop star market closed in the late 90s.

432
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,738
But I can get that exact date for you if you'd like.

433
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:02,042
And one of the great things about a shopping center is that there's complimentary uses and different ebbs and flows throughout the day.

434
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:07,907
And the grocery use actually really works well with some of the existing uses on site.

435
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:14,592
Dunkin Donuts, we know, will be really busy first thing in the morning, not as busy in the afternoon when grocery store picks up.

436
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:18,314
Retail really is a weekend peak.

437
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:22,137
Grocery store does have a weekend peak, but it's a lot in the evenings.

438
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:25,860
In terms of the restaurants on property, which are another weekend peak,

439
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:27,517
they're scattered throughout.

440
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:37,882
So we do think while this will bring traffic to the property, we actually think the property is set up in terms of its existing parking and circulation to accommodate that.

441
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:42,205
As if you go by the property today, there's a lot of parking that isn't being used.

442
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:44,106
We're kind of waiting for this to come in.

443
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:49,549
Something that was commented on previously, I did want to address in that same vein as employee parking.

444
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:55,532
Currently today with this large vacancy at the end, employees are allowed to park throughout the property.

445
00:37:56,087 --> 00:38:02,672
we will encourage employees to park back in this large parking field once H Mart is open.

446
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:07,795
And that will really keep the open, the front parking area open for customers.

447
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:20,404
In terms of pedestrian access, there is sidewalk access off of this entrance going through the property along John Burroughs Tavern.

448
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:23,987
And then it is a parking lot.

449
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:28,536
I hope that cars are driving very carefully.

450
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:32,076
And we do have crossings from within the parking lots.

451
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:34,937
You'll see these existing cross points.

452
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:40,638
They're mostly set up with the existing ADA parking to make sure that they have a compliant route across the property.

453
00:38:40,658 --> 00:38:53,540
If you've been there during COVID, we previously had this drive lane shut down with some seating for the Donut Villa that actually will not be in place this summer now that we're post COVID, fingers crossed.

454
00:38:54,472 --> 00:39:03,597
but so this will have full access and having pedestrian crossings in this way helps to slow traffic down and making it more regular circulation throughout.

455
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:14,062
One thing that H-Mart did comment to us and one of the reasons they're excited for this location is with college students, they've noticed a lot of those students using Ubers.

456
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:21,866
They don't have cars and so college students will grab an Uber, which will actually then have a great place to drop them off near the front door.

457
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,887
So it's a different type of trip.

458
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:30,656
not really resulting in parking, and then brings them in close proximity, and then they can load the groceries up and get away.

459
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:34,458
I will allow, oh, sorry.

460
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:38,320
I'm sorry, one of my biggest concerns is that the walkability issue over there.

461
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,283
My dentist is actually located right next door to Crunch Fitness.

462
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:51,328
And when I walk over there, and so what you bring it in the college, tuck, tuck, and just having other options, not all will use Ubers a lot.

463
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:56,610
will implement the blue bikes that the city is installing around Medford now.

464
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,171
And so, and I've seen that a lot, even increasing with going to BJ's across the street from that.

465
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:10,034
And so I'm just a little concerned about, I literally, if I'm walking over, if I decide to leave my car at home and I'm walking over there, I'm making a run for my life.

466
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,495
And it's like, it's a little bit more than hoping that the cars will drive, you know, safely.

467
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,475
And I'm not putting it on you.

468
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,616
It's just that it is bringing in more traffic.

469
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,057
So that's where my concern comes.

470
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,844
We'd be more than happy to look to it, accommodating more bike parking.

471
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:28,187
That's great to hear that the existing parking might not be enough.

472
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,788
So we can definitely accommodate that.

473
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:37,174
Are you willing to accommodate the 13 that director Blake has asked for?

474
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:44,039
So we have 10 existing, so we can definitely add, you know, they're usually in pairs.

475
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,022
So we would add four more spaces, two more racks.

476
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,542
Jackie, I don't want to cut you off and I don't think we heard from the traffic engineer.

477
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:55,723
That's it.

478
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:56,363
Thank you.

479
00:40:57,744 --> 00:41:03,506
Yeah, Kristen, if you'd like to talk a little bit more about the technical traffic and how shopping center and grocery store work, that'd be great.

480
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,047
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,868
Thank you to the board for having us tonight.

482
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:09,929
Kirsten Braun, I'm the traffic engineer for the project.

483
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,111
And I work for Chapel engineering and associates.

484
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:19,223
So we did perform a traffic analysis as well as parking analysis for this site.

485
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:37,038
One important thing to note that I think Katie brought up a lot is there was previously a supermarket on the site, and generally shopping centers of this size will include a supermarket so it doesn't necessarily mean that re adding a supermarket is going to result in a significant amount of trips.

486
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:47,417
At any rate though, we did look at the increase in traffic associated with adding in the supermarket and the increases are not significant.

487
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,938
And that's for two reasons.

488
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:57,064
One of which is a lot of people when they go to a supermarket, they're on their way home, on their way to work, on their way to run some sort of other errand.

489
00:41:57,545 --> 00:42:01,388
And what they'll do is they'll swing through and go to the supermarket on their way to somewhere else.

490
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:05,092
So technically that traffic already exists on Middlesex Avenue.

491
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:15,804
The second reason is a lot of people too when they go to shopping centers, they won't necessarily only stop at H Mart, they might also go to another store within the shopping center.

492
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:22,132
So while that is two trips within the shopping center, it's really only one trip on the adjacent roadway.

493
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:28,693
So those are the real two main reasons why, you know, traffic isn't going to increase that much.

494
00:42:28,953 --> 00:42:40,076
Another thing to note that we didn't take a credit for in our study also is the fact that this is such a great area for walkability, bikeability, transit.

495
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:44,377
So we didn't take any sort of credits for that kind of activity on site.

496
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:49,558
But we probably do expect, given this location, that there will be

497
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:54,961
a decent amount of those types of trips, but we didn't take any sort of credit for those mode splits.

498
00:42:55,782 --> 00:43:07,170
But really, essentially, supermarkets within shopping centers don't result in a significant increase in trips because of all the various reasons that I had mentioned.

499
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:16,991
And I can answer any other specific questions related to that.

500
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:23,777
But that's just sort of a gist of the traffic study and what kind of traffic increases we can expect.

501
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:28,682
I guess.

502
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:48,194
I'm just having a hard time envisioning it only because I know just from being in Medford itself and living across from Wegmans with that, that's a larger and it brings a lot of traffic to the region.

503
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:56,077
And with H Mart being specialized, we just don't know the market base and what that traffic would bring.

504
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:01,379
So I'm just not convinced that it won't be a huge significant increase.

505
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,980
But I'll leave that to the traffic engineer.

506
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:15,183
Yeah, I think any of us who have been to the Burlington, I mean, I've never been in the Burlington market because I've never been able to park there.

507
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:15,804
Yeah.

508
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,480
That's anecdotal.

509
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,681
I'm not running the numbers.

510
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:22,721
Yes.

511
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:32,004
And my thoughts are anecdotal from being a neighbor, and from pretty much using all these spaces that we're referencing, and just me being over there.

512
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:35,745
So I guess I'll just, I'll defer to the experts on that.

513
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:40,267
It's just as a neighbor myself, or as a resident of Medford, it's just a concern.

514
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:44,568
We also separately took a look at parking.

515
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:49,671
And what we did is we counted the parking demand on site during peak periods.

516
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,794
So it's for shopping centers, it's typically midday.

517
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:59,799
And we did find that the existing parking lots are currently very underutilized as is.

518
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:05,643
So we don't expect a parking issue associated with the supermarket, even when we layer that traffic on.

519
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:13,867
And also Katie had mentioned something earlier as well that a lot of the uses within the shopping center have different types of peaks.

520
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:17,949
You know, coffee shops are morning, grocery stores might be midday.

521
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:23,471
Some of the restaurants are probably, you know, between the 7 to 8 p.m.

522
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:24,472
hours.

523
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:35,017
So it's really actually a good situation and that there's such a mix of uses on site that all their peak parking demand hours are all very different.

524
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:41,278
I see, oh, thank you.

525
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:45,131
Jackie, unless you have more, I see Amanda's hand.

526
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:45,934
Thank you.

527
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,691
Thank you, Chair.

528
00:45:50,271 --> 00:45:52,813
I just had, I think, a clarifying question.

529
00:45:54,175 --> 00:46:08,607
I want to say in Director Blake's memo that there was that acknowledgment of, you know, some underutilization of the parking, but that a lot of that may be parking in the rear of the site, and I was wondering if you could speak to

530
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:15,850
How, you know, the typical person, not necessarily an employee would access.

531
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:20,451
The, you know, and the rest of the property from the rear.

532
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,732
If there were to be parking back there, if there is there, like.

533
00:46:26,432 --> 00:46:29,313
Yeah, are there sidewalks that kind of connect to the front of the property?

534
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:35,609
There are not currently today, but we do mostly anticipate that to be employee parking.

535
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:42,250
If you visit the property today, almost anybody you see parking out front is actually an employee.

536
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:46,731
We will be shifting those employees back behind the property.

537
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:50,652
There is passage along the side of the building.

538
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:55,033
There's some parking that's striped along here that we could

539
00:46:55,682 --> 00:47:02,764
in the future look at removing a couple of spaces to create a striped walkway if we do find that customers are parking back here.

540
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:08,945
For employees, a lot of these doors, every single one you see here, including H Mart, does have a rear door.

541
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:15,667
So it's a really great place for employees to park because they can get in very quickly, particularly in the winter and not have to walk around.

542
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:20,108
But we do envision that the front parking will mainly be utilized by customers.

543
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:21,708
Thank you.

544
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,318
I did want to have just an overarching comment.

545
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:31,200
We definitely appreciate the board's interest and concern in parking and traffic.

546
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,544
And I wanted to say that as the property owner, and I'm also the property manager, we're very interested in as well.

547
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:42,567
If customers can't park on property, if they can't maneuver, they're not going to continue shopping there.

548
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:47,730
And so it is really, really in our interest to make sure that everything works really, really well.

549
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,033
We work closely with our leasing team to make sure we have the right mix of tenants on site.

550
00:47:53,982 --> 00:47:56,404
When I go on, sometimes I call them different flavors.

551
00:47:56,924 --> 00:48:01,607
But so we think about the different uses that are on the property and make sure that they're all complimentary to each other.

552
00:48:01,627 --> 00:48:05,630
A lot of thought went into adding HR in the grocery store and we think it will be really great.

553
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:20,009
I guess the potential rub on that is that this board is charged with evaluating, among other items, the safety from a pedestrian and vehicular point of view on the site.

554
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:32,676
And while I don't doubt the sincerity of your comments that you'll continue to evaluate the property, it is incumbent on us to evaluate it in its condition as it's presented.

555
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:45,745
And if we determine that more needs to be done to condition approval potentially on that, and I'm getting the sense from you that you're not open to making modifications to the site.

556
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:49,808
Maybe I'll let you speak to that or correct me if I'm wrong.

557
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,670
Before we go too much further.

558
00:48:53,651 --> 00:49:01,256
Yes, I'm sorry that came off that way we really had evaluated the site as it exists, and saw this use coming in.

559
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:09,786
you know, we know it's an existing use that's allowed and the size of it is discussing the major project and the site plan review.

560
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:16,248
So we really hadn't contemplated a lot of changes to the site, like if we were putting a brand new grocery store, that's kind of more what I meant.

561
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:26,052
We definitely if we feel like we need to stripe certain areas, reevaluate parking or traffic circulation on site, we could definitely do that.

562
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:29,194
We just had only received the comments on Monday.

563
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:32,075
So we would need to take a little time and go back and

564
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,912
do some layouts and see what we could accommodate, and then come back to the board if that's their wish.

565
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:38,773
OK, I appreciate that.

566
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:39,834
Thank you for clarifying.

567
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:41,255
Much appreciated.

568
00:49:42,556 --> 00:49:45,397
Other board members, before I ask any questions.

569
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah, I would just like to second what you are stating, David.

570
00:49:50,900 --> 00:50:00,746
I think I would be more comfortable if the proponent could digest the comments, consider them,

571
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:05,652
and then come back and see how much they can respond to.

572
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,715
I think it's a great project.

573
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:13,499
It's a wonderful opportunity to bring a grocer like this to our area.

574
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:26,852
However, it also presents other opportunities to improve what is a pretty rough looking area and the pedestrian safety is definitely of a concern.

575
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:37,664
But also as you know a good community member I would like to also see the opportunity to clean up the edges and improve.

576
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:47,559
landscaping, but primarily the pedestrian safety and really be clear about what's going on with traffic and how best to respond.

577
00:50:48,399 --> 00:51:00,404
Understanding that this site was originally a supermarket, you know, if that was in the 90s, I think, you know, fast forward, here we are 30 years later, let's just be clear about what has changed in the city.

578
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:09,838
You don't have to speak to that.

579
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:12,360
I just wanted to give you the opportunity, of course.

580
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,321
I appreciate that.

581
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:23,430
Yeah, we're happy to go back and review pedestrian circulation throughout the site and see if there's things we can do to accommodate the board as well as city staff comments on site.

582
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:30,776
I just want to clarify a lot of the questions and comments have been about circulation on site traffic obviously is off site.

583
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:36,381
Some of the comments we received from city staff previously were about offsite improvements.

584
00:51:37,142 --> 00:51:45,506
And that is really something that we'd have to take like a budgeting exercise and look into because this was an existing site.

585
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:51,849
So I don't wanna go off and look at onsite circulation and then have the board expecting other items.

586
00:51:52,309 --> 00:52:00,433
We'd be happy to look at pedestrian routes, provide a little bit more information, see if there's other things we can do to address the concerns on the property.

587
00:52:01,423 --> 00:52:03,286
I would just like to add to that though.

588
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:11,457
I would like to see as a board member what your best faith effort in responding to department comments about offsite mitigation.

589
00:52:11,477 --> 00:52:14,261
That's what we need to evaluate.

590
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:17,185
How do you respond so we can make a recommendation?

591
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,716
especially accessing the site from Middlesex Avenue.

592
00:52:21,756 --> 00:52:40,184
That's one of my biggest, because again, as Christy has already mentioned, as a board, we're looking to make sure that as you're building, we're making sure that we're getting, we're making sure that there's a community benefit and you being a community neighbor, this is our opportunity to make sure that it's done well.

593
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:45,607
And not to put the stress or burden or economic burden on you, but at the same time,

594
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,068
pedestrian safety should be at the top.

595
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:53,668
Definitely understood.

596
00:52:53,748 --> 00:53:01,150
And so I do just want to clarify that the sidewalks that exist out front of the property, including the crossing, are state lands.

597
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,010
And so that wasn't something we had contemplated.

598
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,771
We can definitely look at the landscaping.

599
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:12,412
We can have discussions with the state about any future plans they have to update the sidewalks in that area.

600
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:16,061
Striping in terms of things is relatively low cost.

601
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:21,348
So if the state would like us to strike the crosswalks at the entrance, that's a very easy thing for us to do.

602
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:26,175
Gets a little tricky sometimes just with jurisdiction, but we'd be happy to coordinate with them on that.

603
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:33,535
Other, I don't know if that was a good dialogue.

604
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:37,897
I don't wanna cut it short, but I don't wanna dwell on it too long as well.

605
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:44,621
If there are other comments, questions from board members or Christy, if you wanna keep the podium for any more comments you might have.

606
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:47,382
No, that was a fair response and I appreciate that.

607
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:47,783
Thank you.

608
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:51,685
Okay.

609
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,586
I can't see Emily on my screen.

610
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,667
Are you?

611
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:13,741
I echo other board members comments, and I think a nice response to this, I'm not saying your other responses aren't nice, but maybe a nice way to frame it would be to kind of tell, similar to how you did with the college students, telling the story about they arrive by Uber, they get dropped off here.

612
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:18,422
Tell us that same story for pedestrians coming from the north, coming from the south.

613
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:19,563
I mean,

614
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:28,709
I go to the advanced auto parts store at this plaza, you know, probably more than I should, and I drive there.

615
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:38,717
But if I was walking there, I can't see myself, you know, taking the long route all the way around, you know, the northern plaza to get to the southern plaza.

616
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:47,104
I see myself, you know, either walking all the way down to the southern entrance and then cutting straight up or, you know,

617
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,575
like Jackie was saying, putting my life in my hands and going all the way across.

618
00:54:52,356 --> 00:55:05,208
So if there's some way, whether it's through crosswalks or directionals or landscaping that you can kind of tell the pedestrian what their transit story should be, I think that would be really helpful for us.

619
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,152
Great, we'd be happy to come back and present that, thank you.

620
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:11,373
Yeah, but thank you for this.

621
00:55:11,714 --> 00:55:15,377
And I love H-Mart, so I'm really excited that this is gonna be in my neighborhood.

622
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,631
Excellent.

623
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:20,514
I have some sad news for you, though, that Advanced Auto Parts just closed.

624
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:24,538
Well, maybe that's good for both of us.

625
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:27,842
Thanks for the update.

626
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:45,225
Okay, well I had a number of things that I'll just, instead of sort of direct questions, maybe I'll just share them as feedback for tonight because it sounds like we'll be reconvening to talk about things in more detail.

627
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:57,116
Certainly, you know, WS is, I live amongst many of your buildings here in the seaport and you're certainly filled with very capable and creative people on your staff, I'm sure to be able to

628
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:08,437
to do a bang up job between now and our next get together but vehicle charging was one question I had again you don't have to respond to these I'm just sort of giving you my list.

629
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:16,427
The idea of requiring as opposed to just recommending the employees to park in the back I think would be a good thing.

630
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:29,408
I was going to ask you about some directional signage to inform members of the public that additional parking is in the rear maybe there are two or three of those that could be strategically placed.

631
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,149
We talked about the bike racks.

632
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:40,631
There was a comment from Director Blake as well about sort of scheduling the deliveries and maybe just as a practical matter, it's not that big of a deal.

633
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:44,292
H-Mart probably doesn't want deliveries coming in when all their customers are there.

634
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:49,654
So maybe you can just share some info there to satisfy that concern that was raised.

635
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:54,356
Stop lines, stop signs, it looked like you were indicating those on there.

636
00:56:55,136 --> 00:57:00,218
We'll ask Director Blake to take a look between now and our next get together to see if he has any thoughts on that.

637
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:25,302
Anything you can do to increase the number of crosswalks internal ones I think would be nice, just to sort of freshen things up and make sure that folks are feeling comfortable, getting from the public sidewalk from the south I know you pointed out pretty clearly where it is coming from north, and also just making sure that they can walk through the drive lanes and feel comfortable.

638
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:26,723
that we're doing so.

639
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:40,749
You had the traffic mitigation steps and Director Blake's memo, of course, and as you've already alluded to, a couple of those require some mass DOT participation, which I think we'd want your best efforts on.

640
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:51,314
And if that doesn't work out, maybe you can work with Director Blake slash the planning and development staff to come up with alternatives if DOT doesn't cooperate.

641
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:53,615
Down the road.

642
00:57:54,655 --> 00:58:13,983
So those are some of my things in the week was we have the letters with conditions from the various departments fire department diversity equity Board of Health traffic I've already mentioned but engineering as well so to the extent that you're able to look at those and

643
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:21,526
either say, yeah, it's a thumbs up all around, or here are a couple of things that we don't quite agree with the city on, and this is what we're doing instead.

644
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:27,649
That also is super helpful for us, so we can understand where we're going with our decision.

645
00:58:27,669 --> 00:58:30,230
Thank you very much.

646
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,430
I was taking a lot of notes.

647
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:35,912
On a lot of the conditions, I did want to clarify one thing.

648
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:43,796
A lot of them, particularly Fire Department, Board of Health a little bit, DEI, are items that would be on a building permit set.

649
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:50,088
And there's some work that the tenant has to do to figure out like location of sewer and a couple other things to clarify.

650
00:58:50,108 --> 00:59:00,223
I frankly didn't want to seem rude and say this will be on a subsequent set of drawings, but we can definitely go through and kind of call out which ones will be on future sets of drawings if that's helpful.

651
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:06,380
Yeah, you don't even have to for our purposes, just to fill you in kind of on our practice.

652
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:24,643
If there's something that is going to be addressed in the construction documents or in that building permit application phase, say we're in agreement with those conditions or we're happy satisfying the fire department's conditions 2, 3, and 4, whatever it is.

653
00:59:25,903 --> 00:59:26,524
That's kind of all.

654
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,264
We want to know if there's something

655
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,824
where there's a stumbling block, where there might be kind of an issue.

656
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:43,046
But if your feeling is, yes, in principle, I'm good with those, and we will address them in detail with the building permit, that works for the board.

657
00:59:43,106 --> 00:59:45,987
You can get past us with that sort of an explanation.

658
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:47,167
OK, great.

659
00:59:47,227 --> 00:59:51,668
Thank you.

660
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:51,868
OK.

661
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:55,349
And then I took all the notes on the comments.

662
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:56,849
Thank you very much for the feedback.

663
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,385
Employee parking, I'm going to go a little out of order.

664
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:05,810
Employee parking is something that we actually in our leases require that they do have to park where we tell them to.

665
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,631
So it is a little bit stronger.

666
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,993
We frankly are a little lax right now.

667
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:13,436
That's what I was trying to indicate, but we will definitely police that in the future.

668
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,758
Directional signs are a great idea.

669
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,761
I took notes throughout people's comments.

670
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:25,700
There's a lot of comments and great feedback on pedestrian access the roots Emily storytelling was a great idea.

671
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:34,127
I like to tell stories so we'll definitely come back to a future meeting and kind of tell more of the pedestrian story and the access way through the property before.

672
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:40,172
And, you know, I think, internal crosswalk stoplight stop sign walk through all all.

673
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:41,422
go to that.

674
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:46,364
Vehicle charging is a little, it's something we're definitely looking at across the company.

675
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:48,185
We've implemented them in a couple places.

676
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:52,006
It requires a partnership with a third party to do that.

677
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:58,689
One of the challenges we actually run into is that it's a little bit of a long process working with utility providers on the easements.

678
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:04,991
So as a company, you know, occupying an existing building we see is something that's very green.

679
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,772
We've recently switched a lot of our power supply to be green.

680
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:10,573
We're definitely trying to do more that's green and we're

681
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:18,669
open to it, it's just a little bit challenging for us to work through some of the technical things on the EV charging, but we're not closed to it.

682
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,752
So we'll definitely keep an open mind on that.

683
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:26,060
And I will definitely come back to a future meeting and address a lot of these comments.

684
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:28,713
Okay, that's that sounds really good.

685
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:32,335
I, I can't stop myself I'm sorry.

686
01:01:33,555 --> 01:01:46,202
But just my in my, to my own eye, we needed to see a little pedestrian crosswalk that would be along the building just some ability for someone to safely get from the back lot to the, to the entrance.

687
01:01:47,782 --> 01:01:52,246
unless there was an accessible entrance in the back and people could go in and out over there.

688
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:54,428
And sometimes the retail operator has that too.

689
01:01:55,649 --> 01:02:01,273
And then I just wanted to point out the drive lane requirements of the fire department.

690
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:09,360
And I don't know anywhere where your numbers are, but just as another thing to keep in mind as you do some planning on the site plan.

691
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,503
You mean the width of the drive lanes, correct?

692
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:13,638
Yeah.

693
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:34,214
And I guess to my, again, to my eye in particular, it's alongside the building, um, in either over or next to you, the easement for parking, you know, and is that, does that meet the city's fire department standards for width of a traveling?

694
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:38,358
We'll come back and do all of those things.

695
01:02:38,598 --> 01:02:38,798
Yeah.

696
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,080
So

697
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:50,213
Is it fair enough that we should talk about scheduling to have you come back and see us?

698
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:51,895
I see Amanda's hand is raised.

699
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,538
Maybe she was thinking like I was.

700
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,930
Thank you, Chair.

701
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:05,134
So two quick notes just for Katie and Janessa, who I believe is also on.

702
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:19,100
So PDS staff is more than happy to connect you with any of the appropriate staff as you guys are kind of digesting feedback and if you're wanting to discuss any of the above.

703
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,441
So obviously, you've got my number.

704
01:03:22,121 --> 01:03:23,982
We can figure that out after this meeting.

705
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:27,304
just wanted to make sure that that was really apparent.

706
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:41,153
And yeah, and as the chair mentioned, so if the board is interested in continuing the hearing, we'll need to continue to a date certain, which just means, you know,

707
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:48,637
whatever meeting seems appropriate for both the applicant and the board that's on the calendar in the future.

708
01:03:49,618 --> 01:04:01,684
So I'll throw out a couple of dates that we have, which is, so I don't know if it's too quick, but we do have a meeting in two weeks from now on the 21st of June.

709
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:11,050
We'll also have a July 5th meeting, as well as a July 19th meeting, and I'll pause there.

710
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,802
And just for my 2 cents, I'd encourage you to take the time you need.

711
01:04:19,102 --> 01:04:22,824
And I know, again, you're a really strong organization that has a lot of resources.

712
01:04:22,864 --> 01:04:33,050
So maybe a quick turnaround is not a challenge, but take the time you need, and then things will go that much more quickly for you, is my forecast when you return to the board.

713
01:04:35,091 --> 01:04:37,693
Thank you.

714
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:40,875
We would love to come back on June.

715
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:42,916
Oh, Danielle is signing on to us too.

716
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:47,683
Yeah, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

717
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:52,387
You can also request to be heard at the next meeting.

718
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:58,273
And if you're not ready in time, then we'll, you know, before we post the agenda, it'd be great to know if you're ready or not.

719
01:04:58,954 --> 01:05:04,660
And we can indicate on the agenda that you'd be requesting a continuance and you could do so.

720
01:05:07,623 --> 01:05:08,363
Great.

721
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:09,364
Without comment or

722
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,042
you know, any discussion if you're not ready.

723
01:05:13,102 --> 01:05:16,805
So if you wanted to shoot for that, but if you're not ready, that is an option.

724
01:05:19,287 --> 01:05:19,628
Thank you.

725
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:21,089
We would love to shoot for that.

726
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:26,374
We had talked earlier in the week that we had a lot of information to digest and we'd probably be continuing.

727
01:05:26,434 --> 01:05:29,877
So we were expecting June 21st, if that is still available.

728
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:34,721
And then Amanda and Danielle, I know we'll be talking a lot in the next two weeks leading up to it.

729
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:35,521
So thank you for that.

730
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,123
We will definitely

731
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:41,900
we're going to do our best and hope to get through all the comments and then be able to respond appropriately.

732
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:43,422
Thanks everyone for the input.

733
01:05:45,063 --> 01:05:45,503
That's great.

734
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:49,767
As a formality, do we want to vote on the on the continuance or okay?

735
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:50,467
Yeah, let's do.

736
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:51,168
Let's do that.

737
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:57,553
If there is there a motion to continue this matter until our next meeting on June 21st.

738
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:07,887
Christie Dowd.

739
01:06:08,387 --> 01:06:08,488
Aye.

740
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:09,608
Emily Hedman.

741
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:10,308
Aye.

742
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:11,849
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

743
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:13,110
Aye.

744
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,291
And I'm an aye as well.

745
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:16,992
Thank you, Katie.

746
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:17,892
Thanks for being here.

747
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,513
Thanks to all you and the rest of your team.

748
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,174
We look forward to seeing you again.

749
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:23,174
Great.

750
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:23,915
Thank you very much.

751
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:24,375
Thank you.

752
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:33,023
Okay friends.

753
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:38,648
Next item on the agenda, and I think it was on the public agenda so we'll have to make mention of it.

754
01:06:38,948 --> 01:06:45,333
It was a request to submit a petition to propose changes to the zoning ordinance so I'll turn this over to city staff.

755
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:50,517
I'm happy to jump in unless Alicia or Danielle wants to.

756
01:06:51,653 --> 01:06:55,436
Do you want why don't I just sort of go so I asked Amanda to put this on.

757
01:06:56,197 --> 01:07:13,110
I don't know how closely any of you guys follow the city council agendas, but you would see that the city council last night had on there, a bunch of zoning amendments, and a lot of them have been like how did those city counselors come up with those, those very technical like changes that feel administrative.

758
01:07:16,715 --> 01:07:26,277
So some of those, we met with the city council in a subcommittee about a change that one of the counselors wanted to propose about the use table.

759
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:34,018
And at that meeting, they said to us, they wanted to get those use table changes.

760
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:41,480
Basically they're changing automobile uses from a yes to a special permit is what they would like to do.

761
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:46,358
And they said they wanted to get that through as quickly as possible.

762
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:56,825
And they said to us, we know that you have administrative things and clerical type stuff that you've been talking about that you want changed right away.

763
01:07:56,885 --> 01:08:04,209
Do you want us to add any of those into the thing we're going to put on the agenda right now?

764
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:05,590
And we said yes.

765
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:16,456
In fact, yes, earlier today we were discussing putting them on the CD board agenda because they could come first from the CD board to the city council.

766
01:08:17,577 --> 01:08:19,798
So they invited us to draft some of those up.

767
01:08:20,979 --> 01:08:23,760
So we did, and we gave them to them.

768
01:08:24,121 --> 01:08:28,203
And I don't think any of them would be in any way stunning or shocking.

769
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:32,866
There are things that we've discussed here and there with some of you, or you'll look at them and go like,

770
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,688
Oh, that's really super technical.

771
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:42,052
So there will be a public hearing that we will be posting to discuss those.

772
01:08:42,132 --> 01:08:44,714
So last night, today's Wednesday, right?

773
01:08:45,274 --> 01:08:54,841
They voted automatically to refer them to the CD board for your public hearing, where you will then discuss one of the counselors.

774
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:58,304
I've actually talked with Councilor Behrs, who'd be happy to come talk

775
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:11,872
particularly about the one that is coming from the counselors, so that you would understand what they were thinking and why to help sort of move that along and make your recommendations on it.

776
01:09:12,132 --> 01:09:16,395
And then Danielle and Amanda and I can explain the rest of them.

777
01:09:17,272 --> 01:09:19,034
Um, we can send them to you now.

778
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:23,217
They were on last night's city council agenda, but they need to be publicly noticed.

779
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:28,581
And I will tell you that in, uh, we did move that through fairly quickly.

780
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:39,810
Um, so it was actually today that I sent them to city's legal legal council, just to say like, Hey, any comment, are these all appropriately drafted?

781
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,792
Do they need any edits, et cetera?

782
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:48,143
with the intention of, for your public hearing, having legal feedback, if there's any.

783
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:55,691
And most of it is extraordinarily straightforward, but people will ask, has a lawyer looked at this?

784
01:09:55,771 --> 01:10:02,238
So that's why it was on the agenda and why we all then never had any materials to give you.

785
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:09,338
So to clarify, this is for one change or a few changes?

786
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:12,900
There is, I think, six on there.

787
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:26,189
And I'm happy to sort of go through them, but like some were errors, some were like misunderstandings of how some were unintended consequences once we started applying things.

788
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:35,215
One of them's a clarification about who the SPGA is in certain situations that there's conflicting stuff.

789
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:45,483
Like the ZBA had been voted to have five members and two associates in when we did that change back

790
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,061
three years ago.

791
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:54,284
And then when they did the recodification, somehow what got written in there was five members and one associate.

792
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,285
And we actually went and pulled it.

793
01:10:56,325 --> 01:10:58,766
And we said, hmm.

794
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:06,228
So some of these things like that, you could say, is that stenographer's error?

795
01:11:06,869 --> 01:11:09,790
But if we're doing changes, let's just do it as a change.

796
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:11,811
Then it's better.

797
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:16,275
and happy to discuss them all in detail.

798
01:11:16,895 --> 01:11:26,380
They're not in detail on your agenda tonight because what we wrote, the original plan was that I was gonna explain a bunch of these and then have you review them.

799
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:33,523
I'm also, if anybody wants to discuss them offline, obviously they're publicly posted.

800
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:36,124
You're welcome to talk to any of us.

801
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:39,505
I would say that Danielle and I are the real experts in them.

802
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:42,607
Some came from each of us.

803
01:11:46,352 --> 01:11:50,593
Can I throw one more into your mix just to think about?

804
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:58,394
And that occurs to me today as I was preparing for the meeting, and it's occurred to me in other meetings.

805
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:15,117
And I know when Jackie ran the 200 Boston Ave, I know I could tell Jackie you were arm wrestling with this as well, is just how do you work through the things that were really limited to evaluating in connection with the site plan review?

806
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:23,758
And so one of the finer things maybe that I'm struggling with is how to reconcile.

807
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:28,341
You know, you have, let me put it out there.

808
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:30,443
We've got 11.7.10 standards for approval.

809
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,965
And that's kind of like, oh, you know, are you worried about traffic?

810
01:12:34,025 --> 01:12:34,966
Are you worried about safety?

811
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:36,487
That sort of, okay, that's great.

812
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:42,692
But it also says the site plan should be consistent with 6.4, which I think is good.

813
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:44,093
That's performance standards.

814
01:12:45,745 --> 01:12:49,567
But then there's 6.1 and 6.2 and 6.3.

815
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:54,989
And so I've just, I'm sort of scratching my head along your lines of like, is this a typo or is it deliberate?

816
01:12:55,590 --> 01:13:03,173
Because I feel like 6.2 on signage has always, everyone's always deferred to the building department on signage.

817
01:13:03,373 --> 01:13:05,594
It doesn't seem like that really comes up for us to talk about.

818
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:10,216
In 6.1, it's parking and loading, which,

819
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:21,685
We might talk about if somebody's not meeting the standards or we want to know if they're hitting the standards or not, but it kind of speaks for itself.

820
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:37,918
You've got 6.3, which is landscaping and buffering, which, like when we had the American Beer Hall recently, we were relying, I think, more on the PDS staff to kind of figure out, hey, how many trees are there and, you know, what's the open space looking like?

821
01:13:38,799 --> 01:14:00,856
And then there's some stuff within 6.4 itself, like the lighting standards that I think are more akin to like the science, like, you know, am I going to really add a lot of value in figuring out what the lighting, I don't even know what the units of measure are well enough to really talk to it, but maybe that's more like signage.

822
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:05,440
So I guess it's a long way of me saying that I feel like there are some things that are

823
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,362
real good for the board to weigh in on and kind of look and feel kind of things.

824
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:17,626
And then I feel like there's probably some of these items that really are more like just straight building commissioner, or city confirmation.

825
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,608
I'm sorry, so much time to get that out.

826
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:25,329
And so I think, if I may.

827
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:28,391
So in site plan review.

828
01:14:29,751 --> 01:14:32,953
You all can waive some of those standards

829
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:36,390
and signage landscaping in the parking and loading.

830
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,851
So I think that's why it's included.

831
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:46,896
So if they were going to depart from the strict compliance, you could review those.

832
01:14:47,556 --> 01:14:55,541
So in the future, and my goal for when the next decision is to be made is to have a draft

833
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:18,997
like a draft decision with some, you know, some of the staff findings and outlining what needs to be met, you know, what complies, what doesn't comply, what you would need to review to kind of lighten the load of going through all the findings.

834
01:15:20,805 --> 01:15:23,967
I guess just to respond to your, to your suggestion there.

835
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:41,497
I, I don't know like if we have the right to leave some of the parking requirements that that makes sense to me but it's not, it's not within the scope of the standards for approval, you know, so it's a little bit, it's a little bit weird to me, but I guess if this.

836
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:47,182
If we knew who was responsible for 6.1, like the building commissioner, right?

837
01:15:47,222 --> 01:15:49,802
You go down there, you give them for a building permit, and they say, you're denied.

838
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:54,424
You have to go to a special permit, or you're not in conformity for these following reasons, whatever it is.

839
01:15:54,524 --> 01:15:57,345
It feels like 6.1 would lend itself to something like that.

840
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:05,708
And then somebody would come to the board and say, oh, we're short, but we want forgiveness because of some discretionary basis.

841
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:18,846
This is not something we have to decide here but I'm just trying to point out I feel like things are treated a little bit differently in section six, but maybe the groupings could be thought about so that the right ones are clumped together.

842
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:22,227
Maybe that's what I'm trying to say.

843
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:29,789
I think I'm getting it and I think what some of what we're looking at is.

844
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:34,616
a result of how these were put together.

845
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:35,496
Right.

846
01:16:35,516 --> 01:16:38,658
So the six sections, they existed.

847
01:16:38,678 --> 01:16:44,982
And then during the recodification, they put in the performance standards.

848
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:48,504
And so some of these performance standards were kind of dropped in here.

849
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:49,264
And then

850
01:16:50,485 --> 01:17:08,917
there was an expectation that the city would refine them and that the council would refine them more, but they just got sort of put, and we tried to get some of them edited up, we all looked at them, but they didn't, it didn't like flow as one coherent document after that.

851
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:12,820
I think that's part of what we're hoping to do with

852
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:23,744
The, so the council, and, you know, honestly I apologize because sometimes there are things that I know so is going on so well because I'm in the middle of that I forget who I've said this to.

853
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:28,005
So, I apologize if I have and I apologize if I haven't said this.

854
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:34,908
So the council has been talking for a while about hiring a consultant to do like a redrafting of zoning.

855
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:56,905
And that is actually so I worked and Danielle and I worked with the city council president and vice president to draft the scope for a consultant, that would be planning and legal together, that would be hired jointly by the council and our office to work on a full revamp of zoning, like things

856
01:17:57,505 --> 01:18:09,418
for example, that our zoning looks at stuff differently than other cities, right, like it's doesn't it ties uses to zones, but it doesn't tie dimensions really to our zones.

857
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,100
And that's odd.

858
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:17,948
But that also like what are the performance standards and what should they be that are appropriate for Medford,

859
01:18:18,508 --> 01:18:22,170
We had a lawyer who came in and said, you should have performance standards.

860
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,412
Here are some cookie cutter ones, edit them.

861
01:18:25,072 --> 01:18:31,456
But we never had a consultant come in and say, here are performance standards that are appropriate for your community.

862
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:34,538
And that is something that we're planning to do.

863
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:36,879
The RFP is ready to go out.

864
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:40,121
Honestly, it may have been posted.

865
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:41,562
I think that it hasn't.

866
01:18:41,602 --> 01:18:46,144
I think we're waiting for the procurement officer for just a few last tweaks.

867
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:47,305
And we're going to put that out.

868
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:56,894
There's going to be money in the council budget and then some money from our office in the new fiscal year to pay for a consultant to work with us on all of that.

869
01:18:57,275 --> 01:19:08,686
And it feels like that kind of rework of which performance standards are there and where are they belongs in that mix and like thinking about it and what are the dimensional standards.

870
01:19:10,348 --> 01:19:18,110
I am kind of kicking your comment down the road, but because we have an intent I'd like to do it intentionally as part of an overall.

871
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:32,354
If there is like there are a few things there's something around fences that the ZBA has said could we please fix that sooner, because it's causing them to have to have hearings on things that they don't really feel should be in their purview.

872
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:43,860
Um, so there may be more tweaks coming, um, and the ones that you'll see on this list are absolutely things that we said cannot wait for a full rewrite.

873
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,801
Okay.

874
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:54,306
But if there are other things, we do have to just work with what are the process and I just want to be careful about if we have a bunch of administrative changes,

875
01:19:55,733 --> 01:20:08,459
I think for everybody's sanity, I'd like to move them through and then get another bunch and move them through and not have like some that are in this stage and some that are in that stage and have us leapfrog like that will confuse people.

876
01:20:09,879 --> 01:20:11,320
But I could be talked out of it.

877
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:13,481
I'm not, I don't have my heart on that process.

878
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:16,202
I just wanted to share while we were all together on that.

879
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:20,344
So I see Ari's hand up.

880
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:22,105
Is that yes, Ari?

881
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,623
Your sounds really bad, we can't understand your words.

882
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:56,288
Sorry, Ari.

883
01:20:57,869 --> 01:20:59,670
Try again, maybe if you reconnect them.

884
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,013
Oh, we lost Ari completely.

885
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:08,214
Looks like they're frozen.

886
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:14,178
Oh, poor Ari.

887
01:21:20,537 --> 01:21:23,178
Was there other hands up Daniel you had, but you're okay now.

888
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:30,801
Yeah, we can email you the draft that went to City Council.

889
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:32,822
Oh, if you want sure.

890
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:39,265
I've been looking at stuff, knowing that there might be tweaks from legal counsel.

891
01:21:40,805 --> 01:21:47,848
I suspect that legally, and honestly I've done fewer zoning changes and you probably have Danielle.

892
01:21:48,410 --> 01:22:07,752
that what went to council probably has to show up at cd board exactly like that as the referral but that we would also if legal counsel made suggestions about changes we would send those to you as well and then your recommendation back would include

893
01:22:09,227 --> 01:22:10,748
those things.

894
01:22:11,748 --> 01:22:15,970
And I think I either thought of saying this or maybe I'm repeating myself.

895
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:20,811
If anybody would like to discuss any of these offline, you're welcome to do that too.

896
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:28,614
Because sometimes some of these get super in the weeds and it can be easier to like, wait, I don't understand this.

897
01:22:28,714 --> 01:22:33,496
And then we can talk it through if anybody needs or wants to do that.

898
01:22:34,712 --> 01:22:36,613
Oh, Ari, Ari, my friend, you're back.

899
01:22:37,094 --> 01:22:37,694
Welcome.

900
01:22:38,074 --> 01:22:39,655
Sorry about the technical issues.

901
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:41,596
You sound great, by the way.

902
01:22:42,297 --> 01:22:42,757
Excellent.

903
01:22:42,877 --> 01:22:43,818
So glad to hear it.

904
01:22:44,838 --> 01:22:49,561
It froze on a lot of faces of entertainment with my technical issues, which is fair.

905
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:57,727
I was just hoping to ask for the two sentence summary of kind of the idea behind Councilor Behr's proposal.

906
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:03,360
The one that's the vehicle changes the auto.

907
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:18,773
There is a concern that there are too many big parking lots full of vehicles, there are too many auto repair shops that that's not the highest and best use of spaces, particularly along mystic gas.

908
01:23:19,693 --> 01:23:27,520
And that we know we would like to do a rezoning that allow multiple stories and more dense development.

909
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:36,727
And we also know that there are there is at least one, if not more vehicle repair places

910
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:47,588
actively trying to relocate to Mystic Ave because they feel it's an appropriate place to go because they're getting pushed out of Somerville, other place in Cambridge.

911
01:23:48,449 --> 01:23:57,136
And because they're actively trying to come and we actively, we would really like to see something more and better there.

912
01:23:58,377 --> 01:24:01,719
They would like to change the uses from being

913
01:24:03,501 --> 01:24:11,929
as of right to special permit, um, to sort of send the signal that actually we're, we're slowing down on these.

914
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:20,717
Um, I think there was some thought they wanted to change them to just know, and, but that might be a little too much too fast.

915
01:24:22,018 --> 01:24:22,798
That's the thinking.

916
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,703
I was wondering if there was someone actively trying to relocate there.

917
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:40,546
There is actually, and the general feeling was also, I will tell you that there is interest in hearing from the board who you think the appropriate special permitting authority should be.

918
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:46,610
Um, for some of them had been special permit by city council.

919
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:49,590
And so the switch was to put them all there.

920
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:53,912
But I think the counselor may come and say that they're not actually wed to that idea.

921
01:24:54,452 --> 01:24:56,333
And should it be the plant the CD board?

922
01:24:56,493 --> 01:24:57,813
Should it be the ZBA?

923
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,414
So I actually give you that so you could ruminate on that in advance as well.

924
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:05,375
Because that's an open conversation.

925
01:25:05,395 --> 01:25:10,537
All right, does that include our

926
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,937
Item number four, zoning ordinance, we're all set.

927
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,320
Can we move forward to the minutes?

928
01:25:19,446 --> 01:25:20,327
Okay, excellent.

929
01:25:21,347 --> 01:25:24,829
We have before us the minutes from the April 26 meeting.

930
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:33,534
There were a few changes made from based on board input and reflected in yellow on the draft that was shared amongst the board.

931
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:48,383
Are there additional comments, questions, or if satisfied, would someone like to make a motion to approve the April 26 meeting minutes?

932
01:25:57,738 --> 01:25:58,299
I so move.

933
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,621
That's one, and do we have a second?

934
01:26:03,243 --> 01:26:03,983
I'll second.

935
01:26:04,984 --> 01:26:09,588
All right, roll call vote then to approve the meeting minutes.

936
01:26:10,068 --> 01:26:11,950
Vice Chair Jackie McPherson.

937
01:26:12,571 --> 01:26:12,691
Aye.

938
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,332
Christy Dowd.

939
01:26:15,313 --> 01:26:15,433
Aye.

940
01:26:16,134 --> 01:26:16,714
Emily Headman.

941
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:18,676
Aye.

942
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:20,537
Ari Goffman-Fishman.

943
01:26:21,278 --> 01:26:21,418
Aye.

944
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:23,600
And Emily as well.

945
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:24,961
Okay, excellent.

946
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:26,102
Thank you very much, everyone.

947
01:26:28,805 --> 01:26:33,949
Miscellaneous updates we have anything going there Amanda other things to share.

948
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:34,909
Sure.

949
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,110
I'll be quick.

950
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,052
So, we do have a meeting on the 21st.

951
01:26:40,393 --> 01:26:49,299
There are a couple of items on the agenda, including possibly, or, well, including the continued hearing from tonight for H Mart.

952
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:56,024
So, we will see another planned development district for 280 mystic have.

953
01:26:57,265 --> 01:27:09,015
I'll actually, we have those materials now so I will forward them all to you all early just because so you don't have to be like chewing through all of that material over the weekend before.

954
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:27,658
We also have, and I should mention for 280 Mystic Ave, it's sort of a very large life sciences park campus feel type development with some retail uses and I think restaurant uses proposed as well.

955
01:27:28,939 --> 01:27:30,221
So exciting stuff.

956
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:39,127
Additionally, we'll see a petition for a zoning map change for a site at 99 Revere Beach Parkway.

957
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:50,555
So this is not a PDD, just kind of a simple, you know, here's an existing parcel, zoned this with a petition to rezone to something else.

958
01:27:52,440 --> 01:28:05,307
And in addition to that, a special permit review for Bank of America site in the Wegmans Plaza, so I think the address is 3085 Mystic Valley Parkway.

959
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:26,066
They, the Special Permit Granting Authority is city council so in the head, a little weirdness with their permitting pathway which we can explain over email, but basically, the board will be making some recommendations to counsel.

960
01:28:28,485 --> 01:28:31,507
And yeah, I think that's it for next meeting.

961
01:28:32,528 --> 01:28:39,593
I do want to just acknowledge that terms are coming up for several of our members, so Christy, Klaus, and David.

962
01:28:40,434 --> 01:28:44,237
So next meeting may be your last.

963
01:28:45,437 --> 01:28:49,400
And so we'll be celebrating them and all they've contributed.

964
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,262
We are interviewing several candidates.

965
01:28:52,282 --> 01:28:54,544
I have some things set up next week.

966
01:28:56,471 --> 01:29:05,593
And so just a gentle reminder for existing members to be thinking about elections in that first July 5th meeting.

967
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:10,674
I wanted to speak on a July 5th meeting.

968
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:14,775
I know that I will not be in attendance because I won't be in the states.

969
01:29:17,296 --> 01:29:22,337
So I don't know where that leaves us with quorum or anything like that.

970
01:29:24,532 --> 01:29:26,892
No problem, yeah, we can talk offline.

971
01:29:27,753 --> 01:29:34,794
And if you have like feedback or any of that for the elections themselves too that you want communicated, we can figure that out.

972
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,834
But thanks for giving us a heads up.

973
01:29:38,335 --> 01:29:41,996
People who don't show up to things get elected to stuff, you know, just saying.

974
01:29:42,056 --> 01:29:48,157
When we come back, it'll be the one woman community development board.

975
01:29:51,497 --> 01:29:54,138
Speaking of- Nothing, you couldn't handle it.

976
01:29:58,098 --> 01:30:01,220
Um, history board or historical commission.

977
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,241
Um.

978
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:04,523
Are there upcoming meetings?

979
01:30:04,643 --> 01:30:09,486
I think I agreed as an interim and just wanted to check in if there's anything I'm supposed to be doing.

980
01:30:09,506 --> 01:30:14,329
Oh, the community preservation commission or committee.

981
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,870
I'm sorry.

982
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:15,490
Thank you.

983
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,432
Um, actually.

984
01:30:19,788 --> 01:30:24,811
I'll check with Teresa, the new coordinator, on when the next meeting is.

985
01:30:25,512 --> 01:30:29,935
I know that sometimes there's a break in the summer, but I think that that's later.

986
01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:33,318
So I do think that there may be a July meeting or so.

987
01:30:33,698 --> 01:30:34,599
So I'll let you know.

988
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:36,900
Thank you.

989
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:46,788
In the interviews with some of the new prospective board members, we're going to be pitching

990
01:30:47,622 --> 01:30:52,805
that you get to serve on the CPA, the CPC.

991
01:30:55,467 --> 01:31:03,171
So hopefully it'll be, your commitment will be short-lived, but we think that you'll fall in love with the CPC and you'll want to stay.

992
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:04,192
Fall and try.

993
01:31:09,545 --> 01:31:11,987
Two other just little administrative-y things.

994
01:31:13,008 --> 01:31:20,054
I'm not sure, but if you all are aware, in the last three weeks, we've had two new full-time staff start in our office.

995
01:31:21,135 --> 01:31:26,359
So Laurel Siegel, who some of you may know, she's been active in the Medford community for many years.

996
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:32,063
She's our new CDBG Community Development Board Community Development Block Grant Manager.

997
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:35,025
She's very excited to be on staff.

998
01:31:35,846 --> 01:31:36,006
And

999
01:31:37,767 --> 01:31:47,640
Barbara Hines is not from Medford she's new to Medford for this is our new housing planner and she started about a week and a half ago I think maybe two weeks ago.

1000
01:31:52,863 --> 01:32:03,228
three additional students who have started, two, three additional students that have started in our office in the last two or three weeks.

1001
01:32:04,328 --> 01:32:12,452
So we are really staffed up during the summer when most of our students are gonna be working full time.

1002
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:15,793
So this is a great time for us to be moving things forward.

1003
01:32:16,254 --> 01:32:20,996
And if you stop by, it's like flooded with people here, like we're pouring out of the seams.

1004
01:32:22,783 --> 01:32:28,707
And we have an economic development planner position posted that we are still actively recruiting for.

1005
01:32:28,987 --> 01:32:45,558
So if you know economic development minded people, this position works a lot with small businesses, signs, outdoor dining, the former one has been doing electric vehicle charging stations.

1006
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:49,541
So that position we're actively recruiting for.

1007
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,881
And I'm in interviews for the climate planner position.

1008
01:33:00,085 --> 01:33:00,365
Okay.

1009
01:33:02,426 --> 01:33:06,208
I'm happy to talk to folks that are interested in the chair position as well.

1010
01:33:06,728 --> 01:33:09,109
So extend that invitation again.

1011
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:14,912
Unless there's something else we could entertain a motion to adjourn.

1012
01:33:17,314 --> 01:33:18,394
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1013
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:19,615
And is there a second?

1014
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,562
Let's go see a second.

1015
01:33:22,924 --> 01:33:26,611
All right, we'll call vote motion to adjourn vice chair jack McPherson.

1016
01:33:27,332 --> 01:33:29,056
Hi, Chrissy dot.

1017
01:33:29,456 --> 01:33:30,759
Hi, Emily heaven.

1018
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:33,063
I already government fishermen.

1019
01:33:33,584 --> 01:33:35,547
I, and I'm an eye as well.

1020
01:33:36,168 --> 01:33:38,653
Thanks, everybody for your work tonight appreciate it.

1021
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:39,975
We'll see you again soon.
