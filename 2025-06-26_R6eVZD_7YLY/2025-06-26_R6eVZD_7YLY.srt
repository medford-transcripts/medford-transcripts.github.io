[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, I said it wrong.

45
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:25,607
[SPEAKER_06]: We will conduct a public hearing on September 20th, 2023, after 6.30 via Zoom remote video conferencing, relative to a petition by 243 Mystic Ave LLC at 45 West 3rd Street, Boston, Mass, 021127, to amend zoning map, City of Medford, Mass, dated April 13, 1965, as referenced in Medford zoning ordinance.

46
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:26,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Chapter 94-2.2.

47
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:49,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property 243 Mystic Avenue as depicted on the plan entitled Site Layout Plan dated June 15, 2023 to Commercial 2, which is a C2 zoning district to a planned development district, which is a PDD, which would have a new development standards per Medford zoning ordinance Chapter 94-9.2.3.

48
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Gareth Bozeman,

49
00:03:55,608 --> 00:04:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: of Pierce Atwood has been retained by the city of Medford and is available as support and counsel for the board.

50
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:04,454
[SPEAKER_06]: He will assist the board in answering any questions or make a revision to the amendment.

51
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Board members should feel free to ask questions.

52
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:14,020
[SPEAKER_06]: First up, are there any comments from the city staff to add?

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle?

54
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:16,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

55
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:23,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to remind the board what stage of process we're in as we've seen

56
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:28,013
[SPEAKER_05]: a few PDDs churning through the process.

57
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the three phases.

58
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one you already saw for this, where you wrote the zoning, prepared the draft, and then it was submitted to city council.

59
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:53,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was at the first, the first meeting was on August 2nd, and then submitted to city council on August 15th, where they immediately refer it to the city board, which is tonight.

60
00:04:53,797 --> 00:05:03,080
[SPEAKER_05]: where you will then, um, the purpose tonight is to discuss the amendment and, um, you could vote on it tonight or you could continue it.

61
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:15,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically you're voting on what kind of language you'll be recommending that city council, um, approve at their, at another public hearing.

62
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:21,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

63
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Danielle.

64
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:36,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to have the representative from Greater Bayou introduce yourself.

65
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And please, you can begin to present.

66
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Madam Chair.

67
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, happy to start.

68
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll introduce ourselves around the table.

69
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:49,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Attorney Jim Heffernan and Rich May, representing Greater Bayou.

70
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew Juras, Principal at CI Design Architects in Boston.

71
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Kadisha Hindi, co-principal at Vernon Bio.

72
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:01,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug Medveds, co-principal at Vernon Bio as well.

73
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just add, Danielle Stoll, what I was mostly going to say about the process where we're at.

74
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:19,590
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been no changes to what we presented to you back on August 2nd, and the city council didn't add anything else from their discussion.

75
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have no additional changes from what Attorney Horsman and I had worked out in July.

76
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:40,972
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not gonna re-repeat, but if you want us to repeat anything, we're happy to, and we're happy to discuss the draft zoning however you and the board would like to discuss it.

77
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for hearing us today.

78
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

79
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:45,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

80
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any members of the board

81
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:56,907
[SPEAKER_06]: that were not participating previously that would have questions for the proponent?

82
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at this point, if you were absent on the first hearing, you are now able to participate.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:40,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was not present on August 2nd, but I actually, my first meeting was one of the earlier meetings you guys had before the PDD process, but I wanted to, if I could get a recap as I leave into what the zoning changes exactly, because I mean, I can, I've been reading through the materials

84
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:46,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Chair, if I may.

85
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:48,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

86
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to pose the question to Attorney Boersman.

87
00:07:51,891 --> 00:08:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Since this is a new public hearing that kicks off the actual zoning amendment process, we probably should have a presentation.

88
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:14,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to go into all the details, but it should cover basically the basics of what is in this proposed amendment.

89
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

90
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:33,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you're most, most of you are familiar with this from our last meeting and session on it, but, um, this is its own separate public hearing and, uh, could be helpful to, uh, do a very brief presentation.

91
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:41,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it necessarily has to show the project plans, but if anybody wants to see those, we can certainly talk about, or talk about the project itself.

92
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:45,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just a reminder, there really, really two things going on here.

93
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,764
[SPEAKER_00]: The rezoning, I should say, stands on its own, and it's its own process.

94
00:08:54,484 --> 00:09:04,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And the project that's contemplated by this rezoning will go through its own permitting process that will include site plan review and a special permit.

95
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:13,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't, at this stage, want to get into anything specific about the project itself, but the rezoning does

96
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,403
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplate this particular type of project here.

97
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like the two are totally separate.

98
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:32,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, did you want me to, did you want the applicants to do a presentation, Madam Chair, or how would you like to proceed?

99
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:36,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for asking, Attorney Gordon.

100
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:55,312
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, I think if you can give us a high-level overview of what the actual amendments are, since there's no changes from, but at the same time, because one of our board members was not present, I'm guessing he may want to see a little bit more of the proposal that's

101
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,542
[SPEAKER_06]: so that he can, at that point, know.

102
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:06,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter, if I'm not correct, if I'm correct, are you looking for the proponent to do an actual overview?

103
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:08,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you just want to do a high level?

104
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I was more interested in the zoning changes.

105
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:20,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I was present for one of the proponents' previous presentations before the board of the project, so I'm familiar with the project.

106
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:26,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was looking for more of the specific what we'll be discussing this evening.

107
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm aware of the project.

108
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:36,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, my first meeting was the first or second time you guys came in.

109
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:50,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Then in that case, Attorney Wiseman, because it's being immediately referred back from the city council and to me, um, standing alone and saying this, I think it's just more of an administrative process of it coming back to the board to be represented.

110
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:54,194
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could just give us the high level, um, details, I think that would suffice.

111
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:55,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

112
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:55,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

113
00:10:55,815 --> 00:11:06,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we're creating an overlay zone, um, called the, uh, PDD to be, I think, um,

114
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,608
[SPEAKER_00]: PD to Mystic Avenue Plan Development District.

115
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,271
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying zoning does not go away.

116
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:21,934
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody could still come in and make those uses in the underlying zoning.

117
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:34,940
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is if somebody pursues this overlay zone PDD district and applies for and receives a special permit, then they've opted into the overlay zone and they can no longer do the underlying zone.

118
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So you choose one or the other.

119
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:41,023
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have the front option of choosing one or the other.

120
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:50,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We're presuming the applicant here is going to choose to go ahead with the special permit process and exercise the PDD 2 zone.

121
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:58,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that would do is primarily make what is

122
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:15,776
[SPEAKER_00]: make the life sciences and research use that is contemplated by this particular project essentially by right in that they don't need to go for a special permit before the Board of Appeals or the CDB or anyone else.

123
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:25,282
[SPEAKER_00]: But the applicant does still need to go and get a special permit for the PDD district from the city council.

124
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,086
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have that level of review and discretion.

125
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:50,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that the zoning does is ensure that either before or concurrent with the city council's special permit, which would ultimately approve both the project and the PD2 district, the project does go through site plan review with the community development board.

126
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see the specifics of the project at that stage again.

127
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:03,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the PDD2 district, we've created this by right use.

128
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:20,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's exercised, eliminated a lot of other uses like automobile repair that we're not so interested in being made of this property, specifically at the kind of density that's allowed by the PDD2 rezoning district.

129
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating new dimensional requirements or allowances that will allow

130
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,482
[SPEAKER_00]: A life sciences building to be built out, um, at a greater density than the underlying zoning allows for any development.

131
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:47,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're reducing the parking requirements to encourage a more transit oriented development and allow for that, uh, greater density.

132
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have a few provisions that we.

133
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,932
[SPEAKER_00]: have put in place to increase flexibility to make this process smoother.

134
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:21,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then you sometimes see in a special permit process, uh, there's, there's an option for the applicant to work with the city, city staff, um, to create a so-called cooperation agreement that would deal with mitigation, um, any, you know, potentially construction sequences, sequencing, any types of, uh,

135
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,170
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that give rise to impacts that the city would want to be dealt with.

136
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:48,424
[SPEAKER_00]: If the applicant turns, you know, just chooses to go forward with the cooperation agreement, we would try to hammer that all out in advance through talks and negotiations and meetings, and then present it to the city council as part of the special permit process for the city council to adopt or not adopt.

137
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,365
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city council prefers to go through

138
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:58,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes the more arduous task of, of devising its own special permit conditions on the spot, it can still do that.

139
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:07,041
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea behind the, uh, cooperation agreement is, is to try and work out as much of this we can, as we can in advance.

140
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:20,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've created flexibility so that, uh, the, um, the developer can come to agreement with the, with the planning division on, uh,

141
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:27,810
[SPEAKER_00]: in-kind linkage as opposed to just paying a fee for linkage as is ordinarily required.

142
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:45,321
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are specific actual things a developer can do or build that would be better suited for mitigation than your typical linkage fee, we have the option of doing that.

143
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's an option, it's not mandatory.

144
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:51,205
[SPEAKER_00]: If people choose to go with the ordinary linkage approach that applies

145
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,634
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also requirements in terms of the process here.

146
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:08,440
[SPEAKER_00]: The applicant has already proposed and demonstrated a preliminary plan showing the project.

147
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,681
[SPEAKER_00]: That plan hasn't been acted on in any way.

148
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:17,625
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really more informational and serves as a basis for this zoning, rezoning bylaw.

149
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:26,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it goes for that special permit before this, the, uh, city council, it will have to, um, produce its final app, its final plans.

150
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:36,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there are limited instances and limited ways in which the final project can be different from the, uh, preliminary plans.

151
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:45,951
[SPEAKER_00]: But the overall idea is that, you know, if there are any changes, they have to be adequately mitigated and they have to be relatively minor.

152
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:53,861
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we already know what we're kind of anticipating in terms of an actual project proposal at this special permit stage.

153
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:58,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I have anything else we should cover.

154
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:07,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then finally, you know, we created a provision at the end.

155
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,292
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is if the applicant goes forward with the,

156
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:24,884
[SPEAKER_00]: the PDD district, then the specific terms and anything specifically spelled out in the PDD rezoning needs to be complied with.

157
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:34,392
[SPEAKER_00]: There sometimes are in any rezoning, as I'm sure you experienced, unanticipated consequences when you're not aware of a provision.

158
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:38,294
[SPEAKER_00]: that that might affect what you just amended.

159
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:50,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we created a provision at the end of the PDD rezoning so that the city council and its special permit proceeding can waive other requirements of the zoning ordinance.

160
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:58,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so long as it's not directly contrary to the PDG PDD, uh, zoning, zoning ordinance.

161
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,933
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I don't anticipate that happening.

162
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nice to have it.

163
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:13,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we find anything during the application process needs to be dealt with, we really don't want to be going back to square one and revising the rezoning ordinance and doing it all over again.

164
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:20,904
[SPEAKER_00]: That would require going through the prior meeting, the city council meeting, this meeting, and redoing everything.

165
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,485
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sought to avoid that.

166
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:26,226
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, by allowing for some flexibility for waivers from the ordinance.

167
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:33,192
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, anything that's specifically spelled out in the rezoning ordinance that we're contemplating today must be complied with.

168
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that clear enough?

169
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:37,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

170
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:38,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

171
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:39,458
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

172
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, attorney.

173
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:42,181
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

174
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other questions from board members?

175
00:18:53,872 --> 00:19:14,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I do have one for, um, attorney Rosemond and that's just, it sounds like at this point, um, unless I'm missing something, it's already gone through an inner, an inner process back, um, with yourself and, um, attorney Heffernan, um, with comments from city staff.

176
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:18,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I don't have any other questions.

177
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:22,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know if there was any concerns from the city or from yourself at this, at this juncture.

178
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any concerns.

179
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:34,278
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, you know, the city is still protective, protected.

180
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:38,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's still discretion in the special permit process.

181
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:49,345
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, you know, there are requirements that the developer needs to meet, but we've also sought, I think appropriately for a development of this complexity.

182
00:19:50,143 --> 00:20:06,314
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a process where we can work out any things, you know, that, that comes up with, with the, um, developer, hopefully cooperatively and address what's going to be the big concern here will be, you know, what impacts this project has and how we can mitigate them.

183
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:11,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I think we, we both protected the city and created flexibility.

184
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:12,618
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helpful to the developer.

185
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:14,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have concerns with the process.

186
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,602
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're at our third meeting on this and nobody's.

187
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,404
[SPEAKER_00]: raised any issues or concerns.

188
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty well vetted before it came before you.

189
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:24,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

190
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate your full detail.

191
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:30,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

192
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:36,146
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no other questions from the board, I will open up for public comment period.

193
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:42,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

194
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:46,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

195
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:50,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

196
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:56,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

197
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:06,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any raised hands.

198
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:17,003
[SPEAKER_05]: There were no emails up until the start of this meeting, but I can check.

199
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you able to log into that?

200
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that added to my Outlook yet.

201
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:26,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm checking it.

202
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:39,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, we use this email box for anybody who wants to reach the office for other things.

203
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:44,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am just making sure that none of these unread emails are in any way relevant.

204
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,498
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay.

205
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:53,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing today.

206
00:21:55,639 --> 00:22:01,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm through all of today's email and there's nothing relevant for this project.

207
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

208
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:10,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I will close the public comment period and bring it back to the board.

209
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:16,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any, does anyone have any final concerns or questions to be clarified?

210
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at this time.

211
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:31,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm forward to seeing the team for their, for their special permit and they hash out this project and get it moving.

212
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

213
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:56,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Then at this point, I will look for a motion to recommend the PDE for 282.43 for the planned development district for the zoning amendment to the city council for recommendation of adoption for review and possible adoption.

214
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I so move.

215
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:00,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I second it.

216
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:03,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do a roll call.

217
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:06,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter Kautz?

218
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:07,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

219
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:09,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Ari Fishman?

220
00:23:10,503 --> 00:23:10,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

221
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:12,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Pam Mariansky?

222
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:13,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

223
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharad Baracharia?

224
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:17,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

225
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:20,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.

226
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:32,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much to all that are representing the Vernon Bio from CI Boston Design, Tony Heffernan, and everyone else that has come tonight.

227
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,773
[SPEAKER_06]: We look forward to seeing you in the future.

228
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, madam chair.

229
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

230
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, madam chair.

231
00:23:38,302 --> 00:23:39,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, attorney with me.

232
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:40,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

233
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:41,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great evening.

234
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:43,586
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

235
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:43,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.

236
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:44,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

237
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:48,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

238
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:54,592
[SPEAKER_06]: The next item on our agenda tonight is approval of minutes.

239
00:23:54,632 --> 00:24:00,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we move to approve the minutes, I do have one quick thing and that's just the consistency of, um,

240
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:07,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my title within some places it says chair, some places it says vice chair.

241
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:11,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, I don't see a problem with them.

242
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:14,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are the minutes from August 2nd, 2023.

243
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:27,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So while Danielle's reading them, it's technically possible to make the motion to edit it.

244
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:36,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So anywhere it says vice chair, that we correct it to say chair, and then somebody else can make the motion to approve the minutes as amended.

245
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And that you're just trusting that those typo type errors will just take care of them.

246
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sorry.

247
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:55,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, and that's literally what I was, um, I didn't know if anyone else had any changes or anything like that, but if, if no further changes or concerns, uh, I will.

248
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,149
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion to approve the minutes from August 2nd, 2023.

249
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:04,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

250
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:07,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And a second.

251
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:09,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

252
00:25:11,987 --> 00:25:12,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

253
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:14,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter Cowles?

254
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:15,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

255
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Ari Fishman?

256
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

257
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:19,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Pam Marianski?

258
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:20,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

259
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharad Bharacharya?

260
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

261
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, Jackie McPherson.

262
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:27,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

263
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next item would be, sorry, it's just miscellaneous items if the city has anything.

264
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:43,107
[SPEAKER_06]: or any other updates or anything for us at this point?

265
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:57,889
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that I wanted to just call myself, if you don't mind.

266
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:01,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just recognizing the Roberts Rules of Order.

267
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that all of us have anyone can put

268
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:14,378
[SPEAKER_06]: have the ability to discuss within a meeting, obviously, and present a motion, but they must be recognized through the chair.

269
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:23,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So going forward, I just want to make sure that as we proceed with these meetings, that any discussions or motions put on a table are actually through the chair.

270
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just stating that for public record.

271
00:26:33,564 --> 00:26:37,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything else from the city or

272
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:41,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Our next meeting is October 4th.

273
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct, Daniel?

274
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:47,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is the next meeting.

275
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:52,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we should bring up that it's the same night as the mayoral debate.

276
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:54,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It was brought up to our attention.

277
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:54,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

278
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:56,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

279
00:26:56,672 --> 00:27:06,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fairly certain that that debate will be recorded, and there won't be live participation, like asking questions from the audience.

280
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:23,965
[SPEAKER_05]: We did get a request to see if possibly some agenda items could be continued to another meeting, but I don't know.

281
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:30,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the board can vote on that, but I am highly interested in that debate.

282
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:37,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That night, and I know that it's recorded, but I've been anticipating it for a while.

283
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

284
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that others would participate that night if we would have full participation of items.

285
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:48,657
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, I would like to go to the debate.

286
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:56,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would not, you know, I wasn't the person who asked it to be moved.

287
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:04,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it is compatible with other people's schedules to find another time, I would also be very interested to see how it goes.

288
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:09,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely be available for me and don't get me wrong.

289
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:12,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I was going back to if

290
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:21,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever's presenting materials for the meeting that night, if they're interested in continuing, I'd be OK with that.

291
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we normally start at 6.30.

292
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the debate starts at 7.

293
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:34,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there'd be any appetite to start at 6 to do both.

294
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:46,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I think anything that's public hearing, we couldn't take before 6.30, but if it was just a public meeting, we could take it earlier.

295
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:58,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have 590 Boston Ave is proposed to be on the agenda that night, but it's not a public hearing.

296
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:04,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a meeting where the city board is advisory.

297
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:15,418
[SPEAKER_05]: making a recommendation to the zoning board, as this is amending a previous site plan review variances.

298
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there might be a special permit in there.

299
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could conceivably be taken up at 6.

300
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:30,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanted to put it out there that we had gotten someone from the public.

301
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:31,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

302
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:34,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I wanted to be there.

303
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:34,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

304
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:46,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think about it, I don't, I personally, and this is for the board's review, wouldn't want to see all of those items pushed on to the next meeting, and then we're there all night either.

305
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know, whatever you decide, whatever is decided, if you can let us know, I guess.

306
00:29:55,436 --> 00:30:00,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there some things that have to, like you just continued the Bank of America.

307
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I wasn't focused on that.

308
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:05,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that get continued to that meeting?

309
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,079
[SPEAKER_05]: October 4th.

310
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:07,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

311
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:19,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do have a question on that since we have a full quorum and that's not so much discussing the item itself, but I'm just, I'm curious as to how the city's rectifying their situation with, um,

312
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:25,678
[SPEAKER_06]: or if the city is even involved with the tenant versus landlord parking issue.

313
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

314
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that going to continuously be a thing or are you asking for some proof to move forward?

315
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious.

316
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:45,576
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it was continued was because they knew not to come back in front of you without a level of agreement between the tenant and the landlord.

317
00:30:47,238 --> 00:31:09,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have provided us with some documentation about, so their full leases, I would frame it this way, they do not fill our public documents, but they provided us with excerpts from the lease and a letter from one of their tenants expressing concerns and exercising their rights in the lease.

318
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:19,043
[SPEAKER_03]: To require a certain amount of parking, therefore, they're not coming back in front of you until they have a site plan that.

319
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:24,605
[SPEAKER_03]: The landlord has signed off on basically, so they provided us with a draft site plan.

320
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was that sent to the board Danielle this week.

321
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:28,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1 that they sent.

322
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:30,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it in the packet.

323
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it was there, but the landlord is not agreed to it.

324
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:40,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, they, they chose to they said we don't we don't have agreement.

325
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're asking for continuance.

326
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:49,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have been going back and forth with them with the goal of not having it come in front of this board until the.

327
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,687
[SPEAKER_03]: applicant and the landlord agree.

328
00:31:54,707 --> 00:32:01,312
[SPEAKER_03]: If in the end, what they agree with is what we don't recommend as staff, then that's in front of you.

329
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't tell you what to decide or not decide, but they're trying to come to meet what we want.

330
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, they're not agreeing, but there's a possibility that they can agree on something that's still not in compliance with city zone for the parking lot.

331
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nothing would be in compliance with zoning, right?

332
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because of it's the nature of it.

333
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

334
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:30,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But they need site plan review regard.

335
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this isn't a zoning matter.

336
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:33,223
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a site plan review matter.

337
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,984
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, yeah.

338
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:39,906
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not meet our performance standards.

339
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I meant.

340
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:49,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much zoning, but for the parking lot itself and how many parking spaces are supposed to be there and so forth, is what I meant.

341
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: They have more parking than is required by our zoning?

342
00:32:52,987 --> 00:32:59,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are saying that their tenants have veto power over the use of parking.

343
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:06,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for them to turn parking into green space, their tenants have a say in that.

344
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:12,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And so until they have agreement from their tenants, the landlord will not approve it.

345
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:19,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's possible that they'll come back with something that we all love, and that would be lovely.

346
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:27,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's possible that they will come back with something that we don't love, but it is what they like their best offer.

347
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:31,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that will come in front of this board to make a decision on.

348
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:37,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we don't want to do is have them show you things and then happen what happened last meeting.

349
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:43,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they haven't agreed on it themselves.

350
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:47,629
[SPEAKER_04]: So they show us something and they can't even do that.

351
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

352
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:49,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

353
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:54,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, I mean, we're hopeful that they'll have a decision.

354
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hopeful that they'll have something for the next meeting, because they would like to move forward with this project.

355
00:33:59,660 --> 00:33:59,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But

356
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:03,917
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we know?

357
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've met with them a little bit.

358
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We've exchanged a number of emails.

359
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:12,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We've offered to meet with, well, actually, we discussed tonight offering to meet with one of their tenants.

360
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:18,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been working it behind the scenes.

361
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

362
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:28,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like there's other administrative stuff that you would like to know.

363
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:36,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We had so many things at city council last night, the city passed the extended stretch code.

364
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:41,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, there's the stretch code and then there's the additional, like, the more strict 1.

365
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:48,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So last night Medford became the 20th city to pass it in the Commonwealth, the 20th community.

366
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:53,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford in passing an ordinance has to vote, publish it in the paper and vote again.

367
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:04,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So it passed its first reading last night, but it's unusual for Medford to pass it once and then not vote for it and then deny it the second time.

368
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:06,427
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be very weird.

369
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: We also approved a DIF, a District Incremental Financing for Medford Square, also passed its first reading last night.

370
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:21,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So that plan is available, that is to help with the development of Medford Square.

371
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:30,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on the City Council for five items, just trying to think if anything else was relevant to this board.

372
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:33,043
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have?

373
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring them.

374
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:36,907
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

375
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a property that may come in front of this board for an A&R or subdivision.

376
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to meet with legal first.

377
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:57,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to go to the MBTA community's public meeting.

378
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that go?

379
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:06,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So we basically took feedback on that.

380
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,767
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at a bunch of different things.

381
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we could send you the slides.

382
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:19,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume, are they on a municipal website somewhere, and I could look them up?

383
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:20,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

384
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,240
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, gotcha.

385
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

386
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:26,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a web page, right, Danielle?

387
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:26,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

388
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:31,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll message Emma to see if she can get them on.

389
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:35,825
[SPEAKER_03]: She's usually quite quick if we send her stuff.

390
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:40,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be on, we recorded it.

391
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

392
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford TV is understaffed.

393
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They lost their key staff people, so they're a little behind.

394
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:54,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy enough for us to send the Zoom link and password if you wanted.

395
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,716
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just post the slides somewhere.

396
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,987
[SPEAKER_03]: In a big picture way, we're looking at the area around Wellington Station.

397
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:10,690
[SPEAKER_03]: The state changed some of the guidelines very recently, like three weeks ago.

398
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're kind of scrambling.

399
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:18,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mass Housing Partnership agreed this week that we need more technical assistance.

400
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Danielle and I are meeting with a likely consultant tomorrow to just review the scope and make sure she can do it.

401
00:37:27,222 --> 00:37:38,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to get draft zoning to the City Council by October 3rd or 4th, whatever day is the Tuesday, which, as you can imagine, feels a little insane.

402
00:37:38,646 --> 00:37:41,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty tight.

403
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would allow this board to have a public hearing on it.

404
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:55,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Mid-October and then the city council to hear it in November with a goal of saying to this board, you could have two or three meetings on it.

405
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:56,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You can continue it.

406
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:57,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

407
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,356
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not under the gun.

408
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:03,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the goal would be to say to the city council, you could have multiple meetings.

409
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to vote in like we hate saying to somebody, you have to vote for it tonight or else we're going to get in trouble.

410
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:10,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

411
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're trying to avoid.

412
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,180
[SPEAKER_03]: The end result is we're probably I don't.

413
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what the consultant thinks we can do tomorrow.

414
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:25,968
[SPEAKER_03]: This state would like it to all be passed by December 31st.

415
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:37,318
[SPEAKER_03]: By advertising the public hearings, it'll give us a lot more flexibility, because if it's not ready in time, then we just continue the public hearing.

416
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:55,724
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to literally advertise, send something to the newspaper tomorrow in order to have a legal public hearing on October 18th, because the lead times with the newspaper and the frequency that it prints.

417
00:38:58,324 --> 00:38:59,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes things a little

418
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say stressful, but we're trying to guess when we could have it ready rather than push it out further.

419
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you aware that the state has a deadline that they want rapid transit communities like Medford to have this by December 31st?

420
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:26,782
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they just updated the guidelines pretty significantly at the end of August.

421
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:31,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they changed everything over halfway through the year.

422
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:33,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, oh, now you have five months to do everything.

423
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:50,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny because part of the language in the updated guidance requires a 90-day application in advance to try to incorporate this new mixed-use provision.

424
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:54,241
[SPEAKER_05]: And there literally isn't 90 days from when they passed.

425
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,282
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't even have an application yet.

426
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, we could never.

427
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:01,568
[SPEAKER_05]: conceivably meet this new 90-day deadline.

428
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:07,952
[SPEAKER_05]: No rapid transit community can because it's long after when it was due.

429
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:21,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the 12 communities that are the rapid transit communities, it's been very challenging because we have the most complicated issues, we're denser, more

430
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mostly redevelopment.

431
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:25,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of us are coastal.

432
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have some flooding issues to contend with.

433
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:33,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, it's interesting.

434
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are meeting tomorrow.

435
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle and I are meeting with the state.

436
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:47,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are meeting with a consultant to determine if they're going to be able to help us out in a short time frame.

437
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:59,356
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I'm going to ask the consultant for is, Danielle, I can never think of the word that I want that's like the visuals that show you the massing study.

438
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:00,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Massing study?

439
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:01,277
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the word.

440
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,477
[SPEAKER_03]: A massing study, right?

441
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So it shows you like boxes.

442
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:09,439
[SPEAKER_03]: in your street layout so you have an idea of kind of how dense that would be.

443
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would really like to have a consultant.

444
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a consultant that helped run numbers, did data crunching with us, but that's not really his area.

445
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're going to talk to another consultant to see if they can help with that and to refine the numbers and to help draft the zoning.

446
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

447
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:29,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

448
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:31,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the update.

449
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought about that.

450
00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: By the next meeting, it may be all written.

451
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll come to you for a public hearing.

452
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:43,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys definitely get a say in what it actually says.

453
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:47,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be coming as early as October 18th.

454
00:41:54,642 --> 00:42:04,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just smiling, because when it comes to MBTA communities, and I'm sure this is not a conflict, but I always literally I have Chris Clutchman at my disposal, like, can you can you explain this to me?

455
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:14,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now that it's met for it, it's like, I don't have that to explain it to me, because I can't reach out for it.

456
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:22,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's interesting, you know, that Danielle used to work for Chris Clutchman.

457
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:25,875
[SPEAKER_06]: she's my old boss.

458
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:33,860
[SPEAKER_06]: She just got she's like moving on up over and what is the executive office of communities and livable cities?

459
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:34,281
[SPEAKER_06]: H?

460
00:42:35,682 --> 00:42:36,542
[SPEAKER_06]: The old DHT?

461
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:38,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

462
00:42:38,864 --> 00:42:43,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she's now she took over for her former boss, which I don't really know what that title is.

463
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,669
[SPEAKER_06]: But she's like heading up that department now.

464
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:46,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So which is cool.

465
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, alright, so I don't want to drone on about things.

466
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:52,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

467
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:58,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you for all your work and thanks for the update on that.

468
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:58,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

469
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:06,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just going to say that those zoning amendments all passed at city council, but we may have even had a meeting since then.

470
00:43:06,676 --> 00:43:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, so you guys approved zoning amendments.

471
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:17,519
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council accepted all of the amendments that all of the recommendations that this board made.

472
00:43:18,281 --> 00:43:33,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So this board is now the SPGA for a bunch of uses in a bunch of zones, like car dealerships.

473
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:40,733
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a major car dealership that may be applying to move their

474
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: the equivalent of their corporate headquarters to Medford, so might not be a bad.

475
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:54,026
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as a board, we will review it for the highest and best use for Medford.

476
00:43:54,046 --> 00:43:55,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we will, right?

477
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:55,787
[SPEAKER_06]: All of us.

478
00:43:56,707 --> 00:43:57,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what's what.

479
00:43:58,288 --> 00:43:59,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're here for.

480
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:00,789
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're here for.

481
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:01,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be fair.

482
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:03,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

483
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So did we make a decision on October 4th?

484
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:13,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Or should we figure this out in the interim?

485
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:16,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I wasn't trying to shut it down myself.

486
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:17,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to I could.

487
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:24,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Me as it wasn't board member, I wouldn't want to not have the meet and just because.

488
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:29,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I can, I can always view the debate later, which would be a bummer.

489
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:29,843
[SPEAKER_06]: However.

490
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:40,340
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if there's pressing items on the agenda or so many items that they would spill over to the following meeting and we would be there all night.

491
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 18th would be the 3A zoning meeting.

492
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:44,464
[SPEAKER_05]: 3A, MBTA.

493
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:44,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

494
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

495
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:47,326
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 4th, it's the Walking Court PDD.

496
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:00,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, 590 Boston Ave.

497
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:05,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And Walkland Court, that will be their third time coming before us?

498
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:07,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

499
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, yeah.

500
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,240
[SPEAKER_04]: They came in August.

501
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:10,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

502
00:45:10,901 --> 00:45:15,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been legally referred to, and their public hearing is advertised.

503
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:21,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we also advertise it for the first, for the mid-November?

504
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:22,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

505
00:45:22,744 --> 00:45:25,805
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that got continued two weeks,

506
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: That shouldn't be any problem.

507
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a, well, I know that's not at your level, but I was talking to Danielle about that the other day.

508
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:46,744
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of those, I just, I don't get the second meat and it just feels like it should be, it's an administrative process that feels like it should just be handled with the city solicitor or the city clerk and not coming back to city.

509
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:47,924
[SPEAKER_06]: But who am I to talk?

510
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just.

511
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:51,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a legal zoning process.

512
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:59,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've been told is that you could hold the city board public hearing and the city council public hearing jointly.

513
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:06,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you would have like 15 of you all being there to ask questions.

514
00:46:07,053 --> 00:46:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And like some places do this regularly.

515
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford never has.

516
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:24,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe once the new city council's elected, maybe it's something to consider that you legally can hold the public hearings jointly.

517
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:28,379
[SPEAKER_03]: then they would present once to both of you.

518
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you would all deliberate separately.

519
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:34,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand how that would work.

520
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to have that explained to me.

521
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:40,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, did you ever participate in those in another community?

522
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:42,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

523
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:55,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the situation that was different was that it was sort of like that intro initial meeting.

524
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:01,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But they definitely voted at their own meetings, I believe.

525
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'd get a presentation and then still have a separate meeting for voting?

526
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I thought the whole idea was to have you could have one public hearing with both the city board and the city council present.

527
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:17,918
[SPEAKER_03]: They could both ask questions.

528
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:24,581
[SPEAKER_03]: The city board would make recommendations right there in live real time to the city council.

529
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:26,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the city council would vote and approve it.

530
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:28,684
[SPEAKER_05]: or deny it.

531
00:47:29,405 --> 00:47:37,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I can remember how we did it, because we definitely did in Watertown and Somerville, but I've just lost so many brain cells since those days.

532
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:49,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a public hearing, but I'm still, and this is not to hash out here, I'm just so confused on the legal process of it coming before us for the initial recommendation.

533
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: They refer it back to city council.

534
00:47:51,923 --> 00:47:58,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Because city council can't do it for, like, whatever, a certain amount of days, it comes back to us.

535
00:47:58,226 --> 00:48:05,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that is where it can be clinked up at or coordinated, but I could be wrong.

536
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll read Lynn's handbook to try to figure it out.

537
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:10,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a lawyer.

538
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:16,475
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sounds like there's something disconnected in the process that...

539
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:21,916
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't matter legally as long as we're following the proper administrative process.

540
00:48:21,976 --> 00:48:24,462
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I don't, I'm not strong in that.

541
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:26,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to figure it out.

542
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:36,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's because the way that the PDD zoning was written was that the CD board writes the zoning and submits it.

543
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:41,299
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's so many different entities that can propose a zoning amendment.

544
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,500
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those is a planning board, which you guys are.

545
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be so many residents.

546
00:48:48,504 --> 00:48:50,806
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be our office.

547
00:48:54,751 --> 00:48:55,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

548
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:56,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So since we are the ones, right.

549
00:48:56,773 --> 00:48:57,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

550
00:48:57,273 --> 00:48:59,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's, yeah.

551
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:03,838
[SPEAKER_05]: So it feels redundant, but it's, you're agreeing on the zoning.

552
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:16,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We hereby now are agreeing on the zoning that we wrote, even though it's initiated by a property owner, essentially though.

553
00:49:16,629 --> 00:49:16,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

554
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:19,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, it does feel kind of an extra step.

555
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:20,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

556
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

557
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:23,829
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, thank you.

558
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't belabor that.

559
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:33,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, thank you so much for letting us know about things to come going forward and not to hold us up anymore.
