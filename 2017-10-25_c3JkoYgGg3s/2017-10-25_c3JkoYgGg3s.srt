1
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,397
[SPEAKER_09]: This really is an honor for me to be here today.

2
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:20,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Mr. Camargo and Mr. Orlando have been working diligently for years to try to get a plaque to memorialize the Citizens of the Year of the city of Medford.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,042
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had some amazing people that have come from our city and they've done so many things on behalf of our citizens.

4
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:39,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So really today is a day to honor their service, their commitment to our community, and also just so that when people pass through this beautiful building, they can come up, take a look, and they can see some of the spectacular names.

5
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:49,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that you're going to recognize many of them, and you'll remember the story of what they did when they did travel through these halls and through the City of Bedford Street.

6
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:54,537
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody, at this point, I want to introduce Mr. Fred Dello Russo.

7
00:00:54,617 --> 00:01:03,063
[SPEAKER_09]: He is one of our city councilors, and he would like to, this plaque has a special place in his heart that he'd like to express to you.

8
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Dello Russo.

9
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

10
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:07,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Two things I want to mention.

11
00:01:08,147 --> 00:01:13,911
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, about the importance of this honor that's bestowed on the citizens of Medford.

12
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:19,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only just to recognize the good works that these people have

13
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:31,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also important because they're held up as examples and as persons.

14
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:42,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think all of us in the city are inspired by the recipients of this honor in many ways throughout the year.

15
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:57,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And one in particular has inspired me, and I'm reminded of that inspiration every time, not only I show up to work in the Minor, but every time I walk into this building to do the business of government.

16
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:01,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my father, Fred DelRusso, who was honored at City Hall.

17
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:21,154
[SPEAKER_06]: in many capacities throughout the years, not only professionally, but as a volunteer, and certainly as a service here in City Hall, as a member of our city council, and as mayor of the city.

18
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:23,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Dad, thank you for your inspiration.

19
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:36,545
[SPEAKER_06]: All of you, and to all the people who are mentioned on this plaque, both here with us, those who weren't able to join us, and those who have gone to God, we thank them.

20
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:48,129
[SPEAKER_06]: for their inspiration and for how they have given us a challenge to inspire us to live towards greatness.

21
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:48,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all.

22
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:56,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And Madam Mayor, we're gonna invite up now Tina Caruso, President of the Chamber of Commerce.

23
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,091
[SPEAKER_10]: She's not here yet.

24
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dominic Camaro.

25
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:08,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is like the dean of the College of Cardinals.

26
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

27
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madame Mayor.

28
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:13,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.

29
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:14,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

30
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:21,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

31
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:27,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish Tina had come because she was supposed to introduce me as the chair of the CODI Alumni Association.

32
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:30,797
[SPEAKER_03]: CODI is an acronym that means Citizens of the Year.

33
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:31,278
[SPEAKER_03]: C-O-D-Y.

34
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just have a few, lots and lots of thank yous to give.

35
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me start right here to my left.

36
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:49,072
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, thank you all, living citizens of the year, Cody's, and friends and families of the departed citizens of the year, for coming today for this Cody plaque dedication behind us.

37
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:58,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And let us, the Medford Citizens of the Year Alumni Association, thank Mayor Stephanie Mugini-Burke, especially for making this dedication possible here at City Hall.

38
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us thank the Chamber of Commerce for instituting the Citizens of the Year award since 1971, with its first recipient, the iconic, and I mean iconic, and lots and lots of names on this plaque, like Fred Jr.

39
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,076
[SPEAKER_03]: pointed to his father, the iconic Fred L. Russo Sr.

40
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:24,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was I?

41
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my place.

42
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:31,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I found a rolling pop here.

43
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And continue to organize the award to this day at its own expense in the labor.

44
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,590
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Chamber of Commerce.

45
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:44,937
[SPEAKER_03]: A big thank you to the living Cody's in the Alumni Association who contributed and funded the making of this plaque that you see here today.

46
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:46,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of thank yous.

47
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank, a big thank you to Rick Orlando, where is Rick?

48
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here to my left.

49
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:58,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch my face again.

50
00:04:58,647 --> 00:04:59,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.

51
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:05,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Rick Orlando, 2004 Citizen of the Year for helping throughout to make this day possible.

52
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to some of the alumni for helping to track down, this is very important, track down the information of the deceased, the departed Cody's, because you know what, and there's 25 of them, which we're going to honor in just a little while, in a few minutes, by a moment of silence, and to track down the contact information of the friends and family of the departed Cody's, and I can see before some of my former students and friends that I, I know their mom and dad was a former Cody that has deceased, and I see them all out there.

53
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just a few remarks about the Cody recipients themselves.

54
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:47,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 1971, this is very odd by the way, since 1971, the first one, no Cody ever selected by the Chamber of Commerce and the past recipients was ever born in January.

55
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,196
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about January?

56
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,720
[SPEAKER_03]: All the other months are represented except for January.

57
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:03,257
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the Cody's, whose first name is May, was born in May.

58
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is surprising.

59
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:10,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody ever born in January, but somebody by the name of May was actually named May.

60
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:24,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, on this list, when the mayor will unveil this little ceremony, you're gonna see, I don't know if you can see it, but you'll know, and I'm gonna tell you about three special things.

61
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two sets of husband and wife.

62
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:31,110
[SPEAKER_03]: that were named Cody's, you know, since the year, and then father and daughter.

63
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 1998, Vincent and Jerry DiClemente, right here, sit right here.

64
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:43,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on it, obviously, with the wife.

65
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,563
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2008, John Lonergan, deceased, obviously, the body was ordered, and his wife, Judy Lonergan, followed him in 2015.

66
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure Judy's out here somewhere.

67
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:08,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, to me, is really even more special because in 1986, Daniel Bates, talk about iconic in the city of Medford, extremely iconic, he was honored in 1986, and in 2013, his daughter Andrea, where's Andrea?

68
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:27,357
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, we'd like to pay respect to the departed citizens of the year and observe some moments of silence.

69
00:07:27,837 --> 00:07:33,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm going to do is very briefly, I know there's 25 in the whole thing of it, but I want to list them.

70
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: The living ones you can see afterwards, take your time.

71
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:42,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But here I am, I even brought a little... So, if you don't mind, a moment of silence, I'll read off the names from 1971.

72
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:44,046
[SPEAKER_03]: 1971, Roman Parkgate.

73
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,335

00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,551
[SPEAKER_03]: 1986, Mr. Dan Bates, I previously mentioned.

00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:19,392
[SPEAKER_03]: 1987, Mr. John McGlynn.

00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:20,632
[SPEAKER_03]: 1988, Mr. Anthony Lucci.

[SPEAKER_03]: 1991, Benjamin Anabow.

[SPEAKER_03]: 1982, Mr. Robert H. Sarabia.

00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:23,633
[SPEAKER_03]: 1993, Laura F. Cronin.

91
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,833
[SPEAKER_03]: 1995, Joseph Valeriani.

[SPEAKER_03]: 1996, Alfred Pompeo Sr.

00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: 1997, Wallace Kautz.

94
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:45,953
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000, Joseph E. Mahoney.

95
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:46,633
[SPEAKER_03]: 2008, John Lonergan Sr.

96
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, 2014, Mrs. Cheryl White.

97
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,454
[SPEAKER_03]: A moment of silence.

98
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:07,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

99
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:13,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, if our wonderful, wonderful mayor will do the honors.

100
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to that, I just want to say, come on, Rick.

101
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you want to say a couple of things.

102
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

103
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:18,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you do.

104
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:18,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

105
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:21,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what would you like to say?

106
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone.

107
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go on.

108
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:32,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to say how a privilege and a pleasure it's been to get to know more of the Cody family.

109
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the only regret that Don and I had the past year or so

110
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:57,698
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been a great pleasure and an honor to do this, and I thank you very much for your help.

111
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry I'm late.

112
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

113
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:08,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking to Don today, and I said to him, we are so lucky to be here in Medford.

114
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of us work in Medford.

115
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:12,989
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of us live in Medford.

116
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:26,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited that the mayor, Greg Don, I know Mrs. Long had a hand in this, and this is a beautiful day.

117
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:32,388
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a great day for all of us to recognize our past and our future citizens of the year.

118
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

119
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,834
And now, on the count of three, one, two, three, go!

120
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,642
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, this wall is a living wall.

121
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:01,845
[SPEAKER_09]: So we look forward in the future to add new names to it each and every year.

122
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:06,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And the list that Dawn just read off, some amazing, amazing people.

123
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're just really privileged to have known as many of them.

124
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,330
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know some of you have traveled so far.

125
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:15,092
[SPEAKER_09]: From Maine, the Zamperales are down from Maine.

126
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,541
[SPEAKER_09]: and New Hampshire.

127
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:23,247
[SPEAKER_09]: People are here from all the greater New England states, and I believe one from maybe Florida, too.

128
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all for making this trip up.

129
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,871
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really celebrating life here today.

130
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:30,453
[SPEAKER_09]: This building, we restored it.

131
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:37,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Between myself and the city council, we put a little over $2 million into restoration for this lovely building.

132
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,703
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think when you walk through it, you're probably not going to notice any changes because we're really trying to stay true to its integrity.

133
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:47,805
[SPEAKER_09]: But this foyer really is a welcoming point for our city government.

134
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:53,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope that people will come in and spend some time here and really look at these names and think of some of the stories.

135
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:58,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're talking about in the future maybe having an electronic storytelling machine in here.

136
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,653
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could actually look at a name and then listen about what your family says about them.

137
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So we plan on doing that in the very near future.

138
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:10,676
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you turn around and you look directly across from me, we have Mayor Irwin.

139
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We have his portrait as well.

140
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:19,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Irwin was instrumental in obtaining the funding for this building and seeing the construction start.

141
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And his granddaughter, Anne Marie, actually is our treasurer today.

142
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:32,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So talk about life is a big circle, and it's just really a privilege and honor to be able to recognize Mayor Irwin as well for his deeds in building this gorgeous building.

143
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:38,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is, the portrait that hung in my grandparents' house for many years.

144
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:44,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when their house was sold, they dedicated it to City Hall.

145
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:49,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been in a couple of different locations in City Hall, but I think this one is very fitting.

146
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:55,448
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the mayor when City Hall was built and he found the funds to do that.

147
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:02,654
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he wanted a new City Hall because he felt so passionately about public service.

148
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:09,640
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt like the citizens of Medford and the employees of Medford deserved a place that was

149
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,102
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and safe and beautiful to conduct city business.

150
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:23,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a priority of his and he saw it through to fruition 80 years ago.

151
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,726
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy that I am here

152
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:41,364
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 years later as his granddaughter serving as the treasurer of the city and I learned about public service from my grandfather who really valued public service and taught his children and grandchildren how important it was.

153
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:45,908
[SPEAKER_00]: He never felt that anybody was more important than anybody.

154
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:47,169
[SPEAKER_00]: He enjoyed being mayor.

155
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:49,190
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved being mayor, and he loved this building.

156
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would like to wish Medford City Hall a very happy 80th birthday.

157
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:59,377
[SPEAKER_00]: It's near and dear to me, and I'm grateful for this celebration today.

158
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 80th birthday to Medford City Hall.

159
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:04,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 80th birthday to Medford City Hall.

160
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:12,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 80th birthday to Medford City Hall!

161
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 80th birthday Medford City Hall!

162
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 80th birthday Medford City Hall!

163
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:25,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that Mercury had an awful lot of advanced publicity about the new City Hall.

164
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:30,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very big thing for the city because it was a small city.

165
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,601
[SPEAKER_01]: and very community-oriented.

166
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:45,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the day came, Mayor Irwin presided, and the dedication took place right in front, in the walkway in front of the building.

167
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:50,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I remember it, I was only a kid, 11 years old, with my dad.

168
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:56,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure they gave us a tour of the building.

169
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:58,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an exciting day.

170
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:02,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy 80th, Medford City Hall!

171
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:05,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday to Medford City Hall!

172
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!

173
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everybody.

174
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:21,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again for walking out here so that we can pay tribute to more home and veteran citizens that gave so much to this community and made it the great community that it is today.

175
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:26,663
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I would like to recognize some of our elected officials that are in the audience.

176
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:29,464
[SPEAKER_09]: From the City Council, we have President Rick Caraviello.

177
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:37,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael Marks, George Scarpelli, Adam Knight, John Falco, and Fred Dello Russo.

178
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:44,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And bring them on over here, everyone.

179
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:48,596
[SPEAKER_09]: From our school committee, we have Kathy Kreatz, Amory Cuno, Aaron DiBenedetto, and Bob Skerry.

180
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:52,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

181
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,500
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our representative, Paul Donato, here.

182
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:05,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have former Mayor Michael J. McGlynn is present.

183
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:12,100
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some people that touch your lives and they really have an impact, an impact on you.

184
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know that everything they did was for the betterment of others.

185
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And Steve Honeycutt was that man.

186
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:21,998
[SPEAKER_09]: He never put himself first.

187
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:25,639
[SPEAKER_09]: He always wanted to be there to speak for those that couldn't.

188
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:35,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And he led this city so strongly in the Human Rights Commission and the Persons with Disability Commission to make sure that all those had a voice.

189
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're very blessed today to have many members of his family here.

190
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could just acknowledge the Honeycutt family.

191
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:48,523
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Steve's wife Diane, his daughters Stacey and Perry Royce, granddaughter Erin,

192
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,447
[SPEAKER_09]: His mom, Elaine Honeycutt.

193
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:53,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Brother, Billy Honeycutt.

194
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Sister, Barbara Sherratt.

195
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Nephew, Matthew Sherratt.

196
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:00,753
[SPEAKER_09]: His nephew, David Honeycutt.

197
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:03,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And his sister-in-law, Heath Honeycutt.

198
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, I recognize the Honeycutt family.

199
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, I'm sorry.

200
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,171
[SPEAKER_09]: very important to us.

201
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:26,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have someone with us, our former diversity director, Diane McLeod, who had the honor and privilege of working with Stephen on so many causes over the course of her tenure with the city of Medford.

202
00:17:26,882 --> 00:17:29,204
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really thrilled that Diane came back today.

203
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:37,691
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're trying to get her back a little bit more, but we're happy to have her back today because she would not miss this for the world, and she wants to pay her tribute to Stephen.

204
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:38,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Diane.

205
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:39,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

206
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Medford, and thank you for having me back here.

207
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very important day for me.

208
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that the introductions have already been done, I just wanted to start off.

209
00:17:51,164 --> 00:18:00,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve Hunnicutt was an electrician here in the city of Medford and around the city of Medford who had a passion about disability issues.

210
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I met Steve about 25 years ago when I was interviewing for the diversity director job here in Medford.

211
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:16,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Another soon-to-be friend and a great person who led the committee was Rich Lee, who will be honored a little later on here today.

212
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:24,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Both of these individuals, besides being very caring, had a dry sense of humor and always enjoyed a good laugh.

213
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:29,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It's truly fitting that these two friends are being honored on the same day.

214
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,765
[SPEAKER_05]: During my hiring process, I could tell how truly dedicated Steve was to persons with disabilities.

215
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:50,130
[SPEAKER_05]: He not only wanted them to grow and succeed as individuals, but also wanted others to understand and accept that all of us are valuable human beings who all contribute differently to the world.

216
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:57,373
[SPEAKER_05]: He never shied away from standing up for people and issues that may have made some people uncomfortable.

217
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:05,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve was the impetus for the fighting and winning the group home issue here in Medford close to 30 years ago.

218
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:12,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this was the beginning of the community taking notice of disability issues.

219
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, Rich Lee told me years later that when the hiring committee was formed, there was no one on the committee representing persons with disabilities.

220
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:30,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve went to the mayor and demanded there be representation on that committee, and he was that representative.

221
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:39,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighting for awareness and rights of persons with disabilities was not only Steve's passion, but his family's.

222
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,885
[SPEAKER_05]: As I came to know his wife, Diane, and his daughters, Stacey and Kerry, it was evident this was truly a family commitment.

223
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:54,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve volunteered his time to the City of Medford Disability Commission for 25 years.

224
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,155
[SPEAKER_05]: His only compensation was the minds he changed and the persons he helped.

225
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:08,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It is appropriate that as an electrician, I feel he enlightened the community.

226
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:14,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Diane, Carrie, and Stacy, we thank you for sharing Steve with us for over 25 years.

227
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with your passion and commitment that undoubtedly supported him throughout his life.

228
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,937
[SPEAKER_09]: This time we'd like to invite members of the family to unveil.

229
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:18,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Stephen C. Honeycutt, Chairperson, Medford Commission for Persons with Disabilities, appointed 1993 to 2015.

230
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: He lit the way for disability issues for an entire community and stood for those individuals facing challenges, dedicated this day, October 19, 2017, by myself.

231
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little darker by now, and we have this great plan to light up City Hall on the roof.

232
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:58,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately we moved along a little too quick, but hopefully you'll come back because part of this, he did look like the way for Medford and for people, and he always taught me to have a strong voice.

233
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:04,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And so come back, please look at it, and then see the lights that are around because they reflect him.

234
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all very, very much.

235
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:13,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall, the best city hall in the country.

236
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stand by that.

237
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:21,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall.

238
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers, happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall.

239
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here this evening.

240
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:33,023
[SPEAKER_09]: This really is an honor for me to be able to spend some time with the Lee family.

241
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I got to know Richard a little differently than most of you.

242
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:42,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I see all of his girls that he has in the office, and it's appropriate to say so, and his family members.

243
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,572
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got to know Richard Lee through baseball.

244
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Our two old boys play ball together.

245
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:53,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And I quickly learned that he had a dry sense of humor and a really clever wit.

246
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,892
[SPEAKER_09]: And you never quite knew if he was kidding or not.

247
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was always a fun day when we went to the park.

248
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:07,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So much so that, like I said, my older boy played with his son Andrew, my son Ryan and Andrew.

249
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had a middle guy named Connor.

250
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason, Richard decided to rename him Harry.

251
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:15,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

252
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea, but it stuck.

253
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:26,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And Harry, when he walked in the park and he saw Richard, eyes lit up and he just was like a magnet going over to him.

254
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was really blessed to have Richard in my life before I took public service on.

255
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:39,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course, being a Councilor and being a CPA at budget time, Richard and I returned into

256
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,122
[SPEAKER_09]: We butted our heads together.

257
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:44,864
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was always professional.

258
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:51,109
[SPEAKER_09]: We always walked away at the end of budget hearings and could have a laugh together, could shake hands.

259
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way it's supposed to be.

260
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,234
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to be able to leave everything in the room and then go out and be cordial, be friends.

261
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:04,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's one thing that Richard always taught me is that life is bigger than the job and make sure you always do your best.

262
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:10,019
[SPEAKER_09]: work hard, and you know at the end of the day that you did something good.

263
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really blessed to be here, and I'm with his wife.

264
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,444
[SPEAKER_09]: His wife Cheryl is here in attendance as well.

265
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:23,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherry, we all call her.

266
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,872
[SPEAKER_09]: His lovely daughter Megan is here.

267
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,199
[SPEAKER_09]: His eldest son Andrew.

268
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:40,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mikey would love to be here, but unfortunately he couldn't attend today.

269
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:45,914
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just a beautiful family, caring people, and they always gave back to their community.

270
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:52,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, when I walk down this hall, I think it's just the right place for Richard to be.

271
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:57,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get to share with him every day and I can feel his eyes on me right now.

272
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Harry's at the back of the room and he's feeling his eyes on him right now too.

273
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:09,225
[SPEAKER_09]: But without further ado, I would like to introduce one of his best friends, Mark Brumley, who got to work.

274
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:21,343
[SPEAKER_09]: He got to play, he got to go to proms, he got to work with Richard, and I know that every day Mark misses Richard.

275
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:25,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mark, please step forward and speak about your friend.

276
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:25,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

277
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:32,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

278
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:34,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that members of the family would know that

279
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:39,195
[SPEAKER_11]: the mayor should feel thankful that he didn't call her son Rupert.

280
00:25:39,335 --> 00:25:42,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone in the Lee family would know what I'm talking about.

281
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:48,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Richard got that from his father, and it was an alternate name for almost everyone.

282
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:51,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially elected officials, but I won't go into those often.

283
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,701
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought Harry was unique.

284
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:55,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Harry is unique.

285
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,143
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the only one.

286
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Most other people would have been Rupert.

287
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:00,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I do miss him every day.

288
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss all of the experiences I have with him every day.

289
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:14,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know when I've spoken about him in the past, I can feel his presence telling me, really?

290
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:15,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to go on?

291
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you just be quiet?

292
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:18,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be.

293
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Because sometimes somebody special comes into your life.

294
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:30,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes somebody comes into your life who's not, never puts on airs, who's never disingenuous, who's always exactly the way he is.

295
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:32,368
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a genuinely good,

296
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,723
[SPEAKER_11]: loving, hard-working person.

297
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:38,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So, all of his family members know that.

298
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:43,151
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did love his girls, and I knew all of his girls.

299
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:45,012
[SPEAKER_11]: All of them.

300
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did love them all.

301
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:53,340
[SPEAKER_11]: But the portrait being here at City Hall is important for a number of different reasons.

302
00:26:54,087 --> 00:27:03,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the least of which is, I believe that this is the first time in Medford history, the first time in the history of this building, that a city manager is being honored.

303
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:17,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And those of us who came up through the manager form of government know that those nine managers who served from the 50s through Richard in the 80s, served the city well, served the city competently and with dignity every day.

304
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them in particular, Richard interned with when he was at Merrimack.

305
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,949
[SPEAKER_11]: We were both at Merrimack political science majors.

306
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:28,350
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was part of the internship program.

307
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:34,854
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was assigned to City Hall, where he worked with John Maloney, who was the assistant city manager at the time.

308
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:41,458
[SPEAKER_11]: So later, when they were looking for somebody to be hired to that position, Richard had already experienced it.

309
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:43,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And John hired him very wisely.

310
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:48,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Because John ended up hiring the person that I call singularly

311
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:57,541
[SPEAKER_11]: singularly, the finest human being, elected or appointed, who has ever served the city of Medford.

312
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,241
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no exceptions to that rule.

313
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:15,584
[SPEAKER_11]: The singular finest, because he was a man of honesty, dignity, character, very, very human, and he knew something that's lost on some others, and that is that the strength of this building is in its people.

314
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:18,065
[SPEAKER_11]: He said to me on more than one occasion,

315
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:26,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Always remember, the members of the clerical union are the ones that make us all look good.

316
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And he meant that.

317
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,604
[SPEAKER_11]: He understood that work is prayer.

318
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:37,068
[SPEAKER_11]: That all work is entitled to dignity and respect.

319
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:45,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And he implemented that day in and day out in the large decisions that he was part of them all, and in the smaller decisions.

320
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:52,615
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's almost in the smaller decisions that made people be drawn to him because he exhibited love.

321
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:54,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And love always means truth.

322
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Love always means being genuine.

323
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:02,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And love always means being present to those who need your presence.

324
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:05,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I could give you a thousand stories about all this.

325
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:11,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I started talking to his brothers earlier, and I consider myself to be one of the brothers in a certain way.

326
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And I say to one of them earlier,

327
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:24,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I can't tell you about the fullness of Ritchie because if I had to, I'd have to go through music and art and sports and all kinds of things that we don't have time for.

328
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:34,551
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we pause to say that this human being has touched our lives, then we have to do something about it.

329
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:44,733
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we have to do is to mimic that and reflect that every day when we come into this building and to serve the people of Medford well, the way that he did.

330
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:56,797
[SPEAKER_11]: because we're not employees, and I mean this respectfully and with love, we are not employees of the mayor, we're not employees of the city council, and we're not employees of any of the state delegation.

331
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:09,403
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the employees of the residents of the city of Medford whom we serve day in and day out according to the policies that are set by the mayor and the city council, et cetera.

332
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:13,005
[SPEAKER_11]: But the people that we serve, the one who we're hired by,

333
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:20,742
[SPEAKER_11]: The people of the city of Medford, the residents, the ones who work every day and come to this building and ask, can you do this?

334
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:22,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I need that?

335
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:29,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we respond to their inquiries, we have to respond the way Richard did, which is, yes, how can I help you?

336
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:36,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can call ourselves city employees at the highest level.

337
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:41,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the person that served at the highest level for all those years is my best friend,

338
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:12,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say on that my family was so grateful.

339
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: This just feels like the right spot for my dad's portrait.

340
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:19,497
[SPEAKER_04]: He loved

341
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,102
[SPEAKER_04]: He loved Medicine City Hall.

342
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:25,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It was his second family, so he's right at home.

343
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:25,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

344
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:40,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this time, the Lee family would like to officially take the chair.

345
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:41,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

346
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see that beautiful name.

347
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:46,156
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a modern hug.

348
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:20,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!

349
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:23,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy 80th birthday from Medford City Hall!

350
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!

351
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:26,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey everyone!

352
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:33,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being a part of this beautiful celebration of life tonight.

353
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,368
[SPEAKER_09]: As you all have heard, possibly during the course of the evening, this lovely building turned 80 years old under temporal weather.

354
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:42,631
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, we had the work underway.

355
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:49,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You notice that we did the beautiful plaster job and restored all of the woodwork that had been damaged through leaking and ruining.

356
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did a new roof on the top and a new dome.

357
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:55,864
[SPEAKER_09]: And the front, of course, fully handicapped accessible.

358
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:58,426
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're really proud of the building.

359
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,247
[SPEAKER_09]: New doors are coming.

360
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just waiting a couple of weeks for them to be installed.

361
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:05,751
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be new front doors that will open automatically and whatnot.

362
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So fully accessible, which is our goal in Bedford.

363
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all for being here tonight.

364
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank the alumni again for participating.

365
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:15,898
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be doing a happy birthday tomorrow in a few minutes.

366
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:20,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also have students from Bedford High School that were up in the lobby that have been playing all evening.

367
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you talk to them about thank you and what a nice job they do.

368
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:33,729
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really blessed in Bedford to have a rich music program and we're thankful that the kids are always willing to step up and participate and come out and add colors to our band.

369
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you alumni, thank you Bedford High School.

370
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:47,383
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be greeted by the Jingle Bell ladies.

371
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:57,650
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know that every year they hold an event right here in the communal chamber where they auction off trees and all sorts of different things.

372
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,813
[SPEAKER_09]: And most of the money goes towards the community family for our hearts.

373
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:05,335
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to thank the Jingle Bell ladies for helping us all.

374
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:12,625
We have all of our chamber performers.

375
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:13,185
It's just the year class.

376
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:13,385
Thank you.

377
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:13,825
All right, let's go.

378
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:44,290
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

379
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:17,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!

380
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!

381
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:24,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy 80th birthday, Medford City Hall!
