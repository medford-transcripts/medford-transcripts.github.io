1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:12,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everybody, today is Wednesday, March 27th, and this is the March meeting for the Commission of Persons with Disabilities.

2
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:15,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, would you like to go around and introduce yourself?

3
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:20,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah, I can take the lead on that.

4
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Linda Braden, I'm the vice chair of the commission, and I've been on the commission for the past

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,430
[SPEAKER_02]: two to three years.

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:40,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a resident of Medford and I guess my specialty and contribution to the group largely is for digital accessibility.

7
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:47,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will pass, I'll popcorn it over to Sue Bibbins, Susan Bibbins.

8
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:55,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Susan Bibbins.

9
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I am

10
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: My pronouns are she, her, hers, and I'm a resident of Medford, have been on the commission for

11
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:19,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long, but it's been so long that I've forgotten how long I've been on the commission, but it's a long time.

12
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:24,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been chair and vice chair formally, and so that's been my experience.

13
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And I live in South Medford.

14
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

15
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:54,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Sue Falafan and I live in on the Medford Malden line up in the Heights area, I guess.

16
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:59,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm getting close to a year and a half, if not two years.

17
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:06,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about it, I guess.

18
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Commissioner Nabb and

19
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at Mass General Brigham.

20
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a commissioner for three months.

21
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:25,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to move over to Joe.

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Joe Casey, lifelong resident of Medford.

23
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I live up in the Heights, North Medford.

24
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And Medford's been a good city to me.

25
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:44,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just here to help, to see what I can do to make it a better place.

26
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:46,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

27
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:48,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I love what you said.

28
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:54,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

29
00:02:55,258 --> 00:03:10,468
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next, the first thing on the item on our agenda is actually before we dive into the agenda, is anyone able to take notes in Gabby's absence or does anyone have any?

30
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's the first question.

31
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anyone able to take notes?

32
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Linda, I'm taking very brief notes.

33
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:23,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I can help support with very brief notes.

34
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, awesome.

35
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Frances.

36
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:32,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving on to the first item on the agenda, the motion to approve the February 2024 meeting notes.

37
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually have a question about this.

38
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:43,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to, Francis, this might be a question for you, or you can let me know who I need to ask.

39
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:59,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to provide the Medford Senior Center clarification on our request before we approve the meeting minutes so that that can be captured in the meeting minutes, or do we want to provide the clarification in the March meeting minutes?

40
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:00,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

41
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:13,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if Francis or let's go ahead and approve the minutes for February.

42
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:13,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

43
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And then any clarification can be put on March notes.

44
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Has everyone had a chance to read the minutes?

45
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I read them and I approve.

46
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:26,389
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, can we get a vote to approve the minute?

47
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, go ahead, Frances.

48
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:32,710
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Sue approved and Susie approved and Sue seconded.

49
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I getting this right?

50
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

51
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we need to put it to a vote.

52
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:39,812
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

53
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

54
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:42,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

55
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it passes unanimously.

56
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:50,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would mean that there were no nays and no abstentions.

57
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:53,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

58
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:55,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We can move right along.

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,510
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the next thing on the agenda is the Medford High School Building Committee update from Commissioner Knabb.

60
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:01,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it away.

61
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, awesome.

62
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:17,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to let the commission know that Medford High School applied and received the grant to start a phase one new building plan.

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're looking for members to sit on the building committee.

64
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:29,342
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a discussion about having someone with connection to the disability commission.

65
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:38,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And separately in my day job, I focus on health care.

66
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:46,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of opportunities that schools have to embed health care services directly on campus.

67
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:55,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would really like, if I'm selected to be on the high school building committee, I would want to channel

68
00:05:56,369 --> 00:06:16,204
[SPEAKER_01]: this commission's input into the process and then also try to help think about what school health care services, mental health, and other supports would be necessary for the new high school to be as inclusive as we can make it for all residents.

69
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:20,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to keep the commission informed and

70
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:29,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I can circle back with news of some appointments and we can go from there.

71
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Knapp, quick question please.

72
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you already apply to be on the committee?

73
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:41,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a deadline and it was last Friday.

74
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yesterday.

75
00:06:44,221 --> 00:07:01,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioners, I don't know how you feel, but again, this is one of those things where as members of the Disability Commission representing the City of Medford, it is important that when there are opportunities like this, someone is at the table.

76
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many other aspects that don't necessarily get seen because as the ADA coordinator, I have to review plans.

77
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be on the ground.

78
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:19,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to respond when people are saying, like, we can't park in our accessible spots because there's a car that's always there.

79
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:26,177
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that this is critical.

80
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:33,959
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us are individually responsible for the state of the high school at the time that the high school was built.

81
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It was up to par.

82
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,481
[SPEAKER_07]: It was one of those top-notch buildings.

83
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:43,222
[SPEAKER_07]: well, it's like, what, five, six decades later.

84
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:51,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So having the ability to really inform on what is truly accessible, I think it's going to be huge.

85
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's going to be great.

86
00:07:54,107 --> 00:08:01,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And any way that, you know, I urge the commission to support Commissioner Knapp's

87
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:27,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, application on behalf of the Disability Commission, and you don't have to do this, but even if you're so inclined as to just write a simple note that says, we the commissioners of the Disability Commission support the nomination of Commissioner Knapp to represent the Disability Commission at the table.

88
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,007
[SPEAKER_07]: This is huge.

89
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:33,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on another note, I'll just plug.

90
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:35,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask Cameron something?

91
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

92
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I allowed to ask Cameron something?

93
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:42,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends.

94
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,344
[SPEAKER_07]: If it has to do with the high school update, yes.

95
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,386
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, I would probably wait.

96
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have to do with the high school.

97
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, then go ahead.

98
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So Cameron, are you thinking about, and are they thinking about, because I've read about it a lot,

99
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they thinking about a totally new site?

100
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:11,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they talking about demolishing the old high school and then having an alternate site and then rebuilding on that same site?

101
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what

102
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:16,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

103
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:18,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can figure out.

104
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:27,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm under the impression, Sue, that this is just started based on the city's receipt of the grant.

105
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:38,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know how far the planning has gone or if there are sort of leanings one way or another about a new site.

106
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:45,063
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can report back if I get selected and can channel that information, I'd be happy to.

107
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm very interested in all that.

108
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I taught in public schools forever.

109
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:59,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of whatever about demolition, about renovation, blah, blah, blah.

110
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:07,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're talking about a high school built in 1950 versus now, it's a totally different, totally different.

111
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,901
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

112
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:35,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you want to, as the Disability Commission, again, just a suggestion, not a must-do, if you feel comfortable, if you want to send a note to support Commission Announce application, I think that that's a great idea.

113
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:42,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I obviously on my end will be supporting it because soon you will be happy to know that

114
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:57,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I might, we might finally have all the accessible spots out of the parking lot and in the front loop at the high school in April during April holiday.

115
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:04,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, barring Mother Nature's cooperation, of course.

116
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:11,522
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that we've been working on for a long time.

117
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:18,889
[SPEAKER_07]: We remain challenged fiscally and in other ways.

118
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I have had all the necessary meetings and there's a final meeting that will be happening.

119
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:29,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's next Wednesday and.

120
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:35,186
[SPEAKER_07]: We does have the machines.

121
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:38,991
[SPEAKER_07]: To do the paint work, so I'm hoping that.

122
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:54,589
[SPEAKER_07]: The weather will be nice during April vacation, and that front view will be strictly for accessible parking and 1 of the spots will be dedicated to purple hot veteran parking.

123
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:55,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

124
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:56,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

125
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:56,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

126
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:01,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody talk to Mother Nature.

127
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:03,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sue, do you have your hand up?

128
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:04,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry.

129
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

130
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:15,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Ognab, I just wanted to say that I have, I had,

131
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:33,944
[SPEAKER_04]: two kids that went to the high school and I've been working with Francis on getting the high school, particularly the high school, up to physical accessibility.

132
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:43,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working on a lot of physical accessibility, sort of minimum standards.

133
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:51,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to collaborate or ask me questions or pick my brain, I'm available for that.

134
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:52,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all over that.

135
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also work with the

136
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:05,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot about universal design standards and stuff like that.

137
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:11,368
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to ever pick my brain, I'm available for that.

138
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

139
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:23,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I might throw the idea out to add this as an agenda item in a future month's meeting so that we could do a collective brainstorm.

140
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:34,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to do some one-off interviews to pick folks' direct lived experience and, you know, the knowledge that we each have.

141
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:45,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it would be great to do sort of a joint brainstorm to get all of the ideas and then I could work with each of you to flesh them out one-on-one.

142
00:13:45,667 --> 00:14:02,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I also wanted to make a motion to write a letter to support CAM to the, write a letter to the housing, no,

143
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:07,660
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it again?

144
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Building committee something, something.

145
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:12,104
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll find, we'll find the right.

146
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Building committee and development committee in support of CAM's appointment to the Medford school, high school redevelopment.

147
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:29,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

148
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:30,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Commission.

149
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Susan, were you making that motion for you to write the letter?

150
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:47,449
[SPEAKER_04]: As a commission, we would write and send a letter.

151
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:58,639
[SPEAKER_04]: As a commission, I don't necessarily write letters well.

152
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking for any assistance.

153
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:15,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Francis do we need to have that in the motion when when Susan just made that motion, we couldn't remember the formal name of the building.

154
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:22,590
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sorry, Francis, but I was asking is do we need to have the person who's going to write the letter who starts the letter, like, who's actually we can.

155
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,452
[SPEAKER_07]: We can, I mean, Susan has made the motion.

156
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:32,857
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody seconds the motion, I can just speak on some, share some simple language that you can use.

157
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a statement.

158
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:48,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be something like along the lines of we members of the Disability Commission stand behind Commissioner Knapp's application to the blah, blah, blah on our behalf.

159
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really what it is.

160
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I have to figure that out now.

161
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:53,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

162
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could.

163
00:15:56,735 --> 00:16:00,379
[SPEAKER_07]: While she, while she continue with the meeting, I'm listening.

164
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I could put something in the chat, which, which sometimes it's easy when I type it out, it makes better sense.

165
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:13,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can all agree to okay, that statement sounds.

166
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,998
[SPEAKER_07]: good or doesn't sound good.

167
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:23,601
[SPEAKER_07]: But someone needs to second Sue's motion.

168
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:25,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

169
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:26,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second it.

170
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:27,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

171
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sue and Susie.

172
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:30,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

173
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:36,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all in favor, say aye or raise your hand.

174
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:36,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

175
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:36,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

176
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:36,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

177
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

178
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it's passed unanimously.

179
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no nays and there's no abstentions.

180
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:45,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

181
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:51,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on that topic that we want to cover before we move on?

182
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to cut it short if there's more to discuss.

183
00:16:54,099 --> 00:17:05,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go on mute so that I can type in the chat to flush out the idea, and then I'll just raise my hand when I'm ready to read the statement if you're all in agreement.

184
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:05,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

185
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:07,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound good to everyone?

186
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:09,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

187
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:09,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

188
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:15,543
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing on the agenda is the ADA Municipal Grant.

189
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:29,193
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes back to an email that was sent to us about an opportunity to apply for funding.

190
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:35,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can find the note.

191
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It was passed on, awarded from Tom, then from

192
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm having trouble finding it now.

193
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Linda, you're looking for the MOD?

194
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:58,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

195
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:01,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if I can pull that up for you.

196
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it was a, I thought I flagged it.

197
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:15,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Confirmation, no, that's not it.

198
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Municipal.

199
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:24,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got it up for you.

200
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, fabulous.

201
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:41,828
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got notice of this municipal ADA improvement grant grant application.

202
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was all forwarded via email and.

203
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can.

204
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:53,385
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, it looks like we're seeing just a slice of, oh, perfect.

205
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:53,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

206
00:18:53,645 --> 00:19:00,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So the application information, it looks like the application is going to be open from May 1st.

207
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:06,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And any town in Massachusetts, any city or town in Massachusetts is eligible to apply.

208
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:18,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be money that we could apply for improving the items here, like in programmatic access or removing barriers encountered by persons with disabilities.

209
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:23,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, in, in any of the city facilities.

210
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you scroll down a little bit more.

211
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we've got a project there's opportunities for a project grant or a planning grant.

212
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:52,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with these descriptions here, we wanted to discuss with the commission to see if there's anything that we want to actually apply for the grant to use the money towards improving anything for accessibility.

213
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So the project grant.

214
00:19:56,096 --> 00:20:06,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like it's like a one-time project and then a planning grant sounds like it's something to set the wheels in motion for something.

215
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Frances.

216
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:15,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to let you know that the city did apply for this grant last year and the city did not.

217
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:18,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

218
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I got distracted for a minute.

219
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: The city was not an award recipient of the grant.

220
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:35,043
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that also happened is I believe the school side applied for this grant as well.

221
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:43,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So coincidentally, I was speaking with the assistant principal, assistant superintendent of the school.

222
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:57,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it is best that the city of the O2, when I say the city, I mean O2155, one application and one application only comes from O2155.

223
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:05,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So it shouldn't be the commission for persons with disabilities because you're not a fiduciary.

224
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:08,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be the school and then the city.

225
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It should just be one application.

226
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:20,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I was speaking with our traffic engineer because you know as soon as there are some issues at the school.

227
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:38,042
[SPEAKER_07]: that I would really love to be able to address, such as the need for curb cuts that could run anywhere from $4,000 per curb cut, depending on how many of them you do, to $13,000

228
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:47,955
[SPEAKER_07]: ran per cup cut if you only doing a few.

229
00:21:48,435 --> 00:22:07,564
[SPEAKER_07]: The school certainly needs and when I say the school and speaking more about the high school now, certainly needs real accessible curb cuts, especially if we are starting to come into, Sue, would you say baseline compliance?

230
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:11,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

231
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:16,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading your lips because you're on mute.

232
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:19,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you talking to me?

233
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:22,376
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm talking to Sue.

234
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Your minimum compliance.

235
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:27,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking to Sue.

236
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

237
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:39,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're coming into like that sort of baseline compliance by making sure that the accessible spots are in the proper area.

238
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:45,023
[SPEAKER_07]: There is also the issue with City Hall, you know.

239
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:57,980
[SPEAKER_07]: a very, very public space where last year it was 100,000, the facility director and I applied for, you know, it was just very simple.

240
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,241
[SPEAKER_07]: We posted it out.

241
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:03,444
[SPEAKER_07]: We just needed $100,000 to start with updating wayfinding.

242
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:04,705
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wayfinding?

243
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:06,466
[SPEAKER_07]: It is signage.

244
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:10,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It is accessible, universal compliance signage.

245
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:22,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, yes, the fancy styles that we have at the very top of certain offices are nice, but those are not compliant.

246
00:23:24,218 --> 00:23:25,279
[SPEAKER_07]: But we didn't get that.

247
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'm throwing these ideas.

248
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:39,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Out there traffic engineer says that, you know, he feels that the curb cuts have a bigger.

249
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:46,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Bang, and that should probably be the direction that we should go and then we should try to.

250
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:48,770
[SPEAKER_07]: No more figure it out elsewhere.

251
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:50,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

252
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:53,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis, what did we apply for last?

253
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:56,758
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the item or what was the project that was applied for last year?

254
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wayfinding.

255
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Wayfinding, okay.

256
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But inside the city hall building.

257
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:09,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the school tried to address some accessible things as well, but it was two separate applications.

258
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

259
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:17,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if we, as a commission, I guess that's a question the commission that we should discuss, as a commission,

260
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: do we support like the curb applying, using the, applying for the grant to use the fund for curb cuts for, and Frances, you were saying this specifically for the high school, is that right?

261
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:40,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the curb cuts for the high school are, you know, from the time that I have been on, I just, I can't.

262
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's for the current high school, right?

263
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it is, you know,

264
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:58,611
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever we can do right now with the high school, because remember, right, our students, it's not just our students that go there.

265
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:12,855
[SPEAKER_07]: That space is used for people who are going to see shows, people who are going to events, people who are going to pick up their children, people who, you know, people coming from other towns.

266
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:24,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're taking public transportation and the bus drops you off, good luck figuring how you're going to get up.

267
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

268
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:27,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally.

269
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

270
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:31,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that to me sounds like a great application.

271
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:40,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I have very little experience with grant applications, but it sounds like very discreet, very specific, very much like this is how much

272
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:48,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll cost, it's for something beginning and an end, it's definitely going to make a difference.

273
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:55,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to make a motion or something as a commission to support that?

274
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Commission can support it.

275
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:06,352
[SPEAKER_07]: The way the MOD grant applications work, their application is within their system.

276
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:15,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Right so it's not something that you print out and then you have to write, you just go in the system and you put it in.

277
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:22,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So, last year, Paul, the facilities director for the city site did the application and I was a supporter.

278
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:26,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, I think that the commission can support it.

279
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to look back at some of.

280
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:38,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I will all the information soon to see if there is additional stuff from our universal access meetings.

281
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:39,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That I could.

282
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:47,224
[SPEAKER_07]: On there, or we could just keep it at as curb cuts and check in.

283
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:51,325
[SPEAKER_07]: With engineering and see what other areas.

284
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Need curb cuts in the city.

285
00:26:55,027 --> 00:27:00,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I would prefer I would prefer areas that open up increased access.

286
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:01,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

287
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:06,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't put a, I don't live in Medford, but don't put a curb cut by my house in Medford, right?

288
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:13,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Put a curb cut, let's say, to make it easier for somebody to get from one side of the Fellsway to the next.

289
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:15,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Just making that up as an example.

290
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:17,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

291
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:20,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that makes sense.

292
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:28,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there anything we need to do as a commission to move that forward or support it or anything we need to do as a commission?

293
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:38,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if the commission chose to support, they give the commission felt that curb cuts focusing on the current school.

294
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And then expanding out should be the priority.

295
00:27:43,851 --> 00:27:46,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I would suggest that emotion be made.

296
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And this, you know, a.

297
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:59,312
[SPEAKER_07]: a motion be seconded and then a roll call vote be taken because this is all very, very new.

298
00:28:01,874 --> 00:28:16,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as I think about it, if we can just think about the amount of dignity that it restores, if we can just chip away at things, not saying that it's going to be done overnight, let's just keep chipping away.

299
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:20,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to make a motion.

300
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: to support a grant up the M.O.D.

301
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:35,252
[SPEAKER_02]: grant application to be made for curb cuts at the high school and other places around the like public places around the city.

302
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I cover all the bases Frances?

303
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:40,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

304
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

305
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:44,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

306
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:48,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Francis, that reminds me of the roll call vote.

307
00:28:48,063 --> 00:28:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have to, is that meaning that like we go around and name each person?

308
00:28:53,747 --> 00:28:53,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

309
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:54,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

310
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:59,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that would mean that I'll just, I'm happy to facilitate that.

311
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go around and say, Joe, how do you vote?

312
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:03,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, nay, or abstain?

313
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

314
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And Susie, how do you vote?

315
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, nay, or abstain?

316
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:10,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

317
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

318
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

319
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Cam.

320
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,274
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you.

321
00:29:15,494 --> 00:29:15,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

322
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:16,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

323
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:20,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have unanimous passing of that motion.

324
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:24,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And then anything else we want to discuss on that before we move on,

325
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that is it.

326
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I will let Assistant Superintendent Cushing know of my meeting.

327
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I see him tomorrow.

328
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:43,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll let the facilities director know.

329
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:53,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe there's something we can do differently this time to make sure that the wealth flows to us.

330
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, I feel like this,

331
00:29:58,501 --> 00:29:59,501
[SPEAKER_07]: This would really help.

332
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:03,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah.

333
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:14,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, then the next thing on the agenda is an item I put on was resources to put on the web page from this is carrying over from.

334
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:24,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Last meeting when Gabby was talking about writing up a list of.

335
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:29,157
[SPEAKER_02]: resources add to our web page and she did that.

336
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:29,837
[SPEAKER_02]: She sent it to me.

337
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:44,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to run it by the rest of the members of the commission to see if there are any additional resources that other folks know of that we want to add to this list.

338
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:52,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be helpful for us to have our

339
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you do need to share it?

340
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.

341
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also going to just put the link to our page as it currently is so folks have a reference for what it looks like and where we would be putting these resources.

342
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll put the link.

343
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,680
[SPEAKER_02]: To our current page in the chat.

344
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that page.

345
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:34,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a section called Additional Links, and a section that says Useful Links.

346
00:31:34,504 --> 00:31:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Useful Links break it out into government agencies, financial, different categories, which

347
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:53,355
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be able to find another name other than useful links, like maybe resources or something like that.

348
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's for another day.

349
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the additional links or the useful links section is where we're talking about adding the links that Gabby sent along.

350
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will share my screen.

351
00:32:19,453 --> 00:32:19,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

352
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:20,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Share.

353
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:23,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to share this one.

354
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:24,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

355
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, Gabby sent.

356
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: A, um, Google doc, we're working on Google doc, uh, together.

357
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:38,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to share this with the commission to see what their thoughts was.

358
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as what's here and to see if there's anything folks would want to add.

359
00:32:46,526 --> 00:33:10,544
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford Special Education Advisory Council, Medford Council on Aging, the Senior Center, Medford Recreation, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Medford Planning Development Sustainability, Medford Park Linktree, Medford Library and a link to sign up for their digital newsletter, some city alert sign up.

360
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:15,488
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the Office of Planning and Development Sustainability newsletter sign up.

361
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:44,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Community Preservation Act newsletter sign up, city newsletter sign up, some Facebook, like a Facebook page, the Medford, Massachusetts Facebook page, the Go Green Medford link, also potentially like a link to the Instagram and the Facebook for Go Green Medford, Medford Family Network newsletter sign up, city recreation programs,

362
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the comprehensive plan, got some other plans listed out here.

363
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:56,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like we've got Medford Parks Link tree down here again.

364
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:02,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to read them out so folks could could hear what's on there.

365
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other resources that folks that come to folks minds at this point in time, this is not the only time you ever can add resources, but I thought this would just be a good time.

366
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that we're collecting whatever's on top of mind for folks.

367
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Suzy, see your hand.

368
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:26,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm thinking that there is, I do a lot of links to transportation for disability.

369
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't see any of them on there, but I would have to look them up, like tomorrow.

370
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

371
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's some two or three big links about transportation for disability.

372
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: disabled.

373
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:51,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only in our community, I know that one of these here has a link.

374
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:52,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up higher.

375
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:54,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have it in front of me.

376
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:01,771
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're either in our city or outside our city.

377
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:04,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really want to get that on there.

378
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:09,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, if you send them to me, I'd be happy to add them to the running list.

379
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

380
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:13,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Cam, can I see your hand up?

381
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Linda.

382
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,274
[SPEAKER_01]: One link that we might consider

383
00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:36,239
[SPEAKER_01]: putting under health care would just be linked to MassHealth.

384
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state has an integrated eligibility system.

385
00:35:41,403 --> 00:35:49,688
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you apply to MassHealth, if you qualify for other social services, it'll let you know.

386
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:59,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting health care, MassHealth, and that integrated eligibility system, I think, would be a really key resource.

387
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:06,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, yeah, do you have the URL for it or?

388
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I'll bring it to you.

389
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,891
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, perfect yeah and I can add that on there.

390
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be got a lot of miscellaneous.

391
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:21,555
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing that would be really great.

392
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:23,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done that.

393
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:27,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've did this last year just as a yearly cleanup.

394
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: If folks could take a look at the resources that are on here and

395
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:38,397
[SPEAKER_02]: decide, like, decide if you think that they're still relevant.

396
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Disability Law Center is a really good center.

397
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:48,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't mean you had to look at it right now.

398
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:55,336
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some things that I'll need Gabby's feedback on, so we'll move this on to the next meeting as well.

399
00:36:55,376 --> 00:37:10,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But by next meeting, folks could take a look at this and see if there's anything that doesn't quite fit anymore, bring their suggestions to add resources, or if you want to email me in the interim.

400
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:13,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to collect them.

401
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:22,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis, is there a motion I need to make in order to continue working on this?

402
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:34,486
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to continue working on it, I think that it would suffice to say that we should just say we'll continue working on it.

403
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is definitely a work in progress.

404
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:46,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember also that the individual pages of the website are set up a specific way.

405
00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:48,915
[SPEAKER_07]: There is only so much

406
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:55,474
[SPEAKER_07]: way that we have with redesign and things of that nature.

407
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:57,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the exact words.

408
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:04,176
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have a lot of cleanup that needs to be done.

409
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a mess that was inherited.

410
00:38:09,898 --> 00:38:14,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have to take our time and go through each step.

411
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:18,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say simplify and make things easier.

412
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

413
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:22,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, additional links, useful links.

414
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,774
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference?

415
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:29,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Resources are resources, and maybe we should just call them resources and list them alphabetically.

416
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:29,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

417
00:38:29,538 --> 00:38:29,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

418
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

419
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can definitely.

420
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:47,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I 100% agree with that, and I'm happy to come up with some suggestions about how to reorganize everything from additional links on down on the page for accessibility and usability.

421
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:58,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, you know, I think it's one of those things that shows up maybe on the agenda next month as a continuous work in progress.

422
00:38:59,017 --> 00:38:59,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be great.

423
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:01,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

424
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:05,538
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to stop sharing my screen.

425
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:16,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let me see what the next item is on the agenda.

426
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:26,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Carr Park, Shanine, looks like, was she supposed to be?

427
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:31,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead, Frances.

428
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:40,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I was under the impression that she was going to spend 15 minutes at each meeting, 15 to 20 minutes just discussing

429
00:39:41,758 --> 00:40:02,817
[SPEAKER_07]: car park updates unless that has wrapped up so i've just consistently left her on the agenda okay um but i do have i do have the right if you would like me to read edge sure i i'm okay with that if others are okay with it

430
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:05,473
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

431
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:17,942
[SPEAKER_07]: We, the members of the Medford Commission for Persons with Disabilities, write to support the application of Commissioner Cameron Knabb for the blank, blank, blank.

432
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:21,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And the blank, blank is because I can't remember that long name of what they called it.

433
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:28,951
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you like that, I will put that in the chat.

434
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:33,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good to me.

435
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:37,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone has opened the floor to anyone else who has thoughts or ideas?

436
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:43,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, it's a go.

437
00:40:43,854 --> 00:40:51,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and I will list the names of all of you that are on here.

438
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:56,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make sure I share this.

439
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,168
[SPEAKER_07]: with all of you.

440
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:05,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody please respond because if you do, even just simply saying, oh, that's good.

441
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:06,531
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.

442
00:41:06,571 --> 00:41:08,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited about this.

443
00:41:08,252 --> 00:41:18,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Just from last month's open meeting law training, we could just innocently find ourselves in all kinds of situations.

444
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:23,678
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I will make sure that this gets in the hands of

445
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:30,440
[SPEAKER_07]: the selection committee, because it has to be whoever's doing the selecting.

446
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you think that it would be helpful to get this to the school committee as well?

447
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

448
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make sure it gets to the selection committee and the school committee as well.

449
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:47,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will definitely find out the correct name.

450
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:48,928
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called something.

451
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I was muted, sorry.

452
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just saying thank you for doing that, Frances.

453
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're welcome.

454
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:06,908
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the next thing on the agenda is ablewell.org.

455
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:14,014
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, well, there was correspondence shared with the commissioners on March 23rd, 2024.

456
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:20,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the commissioners interested in inviting Mary Wilson to an upcoming meeting to share more, provide clarification?

457
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:25,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Did everyone get a chance to read that email that Francis sent?

458
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:30,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

459
00:42:30,536 --> 00:42:30,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

460
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:36,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Then do we have like a million windows open?

461
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:40,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to discuss anything about that?

462
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we feel about that?

463
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:47,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Would we want to have Mary Wilson come talk to an update?

464
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:48,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

465
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:49,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm for it.

466
00:42:50,765 --> 00:42:50,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

467
00:42:55,843 --> 00:43:01,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I just shared it because I'm not familiar with who Mary Wilson is.

468
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:14,445
[SPEAKER_07]: The request actually went to the clerk's office, and it seems like Mary wanted to write an article to put it on the webpage for the Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

469
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So that came in as I saw some of the agenda items.

470
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:29,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought, I think that maybe this is really an opportunity to ask more clarifying questions.

471
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:44,992
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and to find out if there is a true connection, because I see the Disability Commission's webpage as a resource webpage, right?

472
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:59,783
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there is an article of importance or if somebody says that, you know, my passion is writing articles that focus on the different disabilities that are highlighted during the month throughout the year, very, very different.

473
00:44:01,963 --> 00:44:05,805
[SPEAKER_07]: from just random articles.

474
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:09,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what style of article, you know?

475
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:22,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I would welcome to if, you know, if Mary was a person with a disability, yes, I would, you know, welcome her to write something for the disability page because of that lived experience.

476
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,760
[SPEAKER_07]: But I felt like the commissioners really need to like,

477
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:32,110
[SPEAKER_07]: think this through and maybe hear what Mary has to say.

478
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

479
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need a motion to invite Mary?

480
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the question was from me, right?

481
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, correspondence shared.

482
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:49,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think the question was from me to the commission.

483
00:44:49,549 --> 00:45:03,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can simply state, I can simply, you know, take it that commissioners, because I saw some commissioners nodding, and Joe, you said yes.

484
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:09,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Invite Mary, also no, or do roll call vote.

485
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,144
[SPEAKER_04]: On the fence.

486
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:13,625
[SPEAKER_07]: You're on the fence.

487
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

488
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:22,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I think on the one hand, it could be valuable on the on the other.

489
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:25,452
[SPEAKER_04]: She could.

490
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:28,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Require compensation.

491
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Or ask for compensation.

492
00:45:36,437 --> 00:46:03,622
[SPEAKER_04]: and she could or she could espouse theories or beliefs or values that are counter to our our values and um and she could just

493
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she's out of the blue.

494
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:11,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of her.

495
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:15,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never read an article by her.

496
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:18,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm on the fence.

497
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have other things that might take up our time.

498
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely understand what you're saying, Sue.

499
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:36,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, usually when I get requests, they come directly to me, right?

500
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is listed on the website, right?

501
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:41,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fully transparent.

502
00:46:41,788 --> 00:46:44,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So this came through the clerk's office.

503
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:51,393
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, I did go to the able.org website.

504
00:46:52,874 --> 00:46:53,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very light.

505
00:46:54,881 --> 00:47:02,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what I, I mean, I felt like when I went there, I had an open mind, but I still found it very light.

506
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:10,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I was unable to get there.

507
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,352
[SPEAKER_04]: My computer, my tablet kept expressing an error message.

508
00:47:16,932 --> 00:47:17,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

509
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:17,913
Yeah.

510
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:27,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, the the able well dot org link in at the bottom of the email actually goes to an email as an email.

511
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah but then you have you know then yeah copy paste it yeah i just i am okay with it being a no right this is just one of those things i mean as far as this compensation that would never happen i mean we don't accept solicitation right right you know but i i clearly understand you know

512
00:47:55,323 --> 00:47:57,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I clearly understand what you're saying, Susie.

513
00:47:58,024 --> 00:48:00,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't come running to you guys fully excited.

514
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, hey, guess what?

515
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I just came across it.

516
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:07,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just cause for hesitation.

517
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:08,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

518
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:16,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why you brought it up, but I can also see why it's very vague.

519
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:17,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

520
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:18,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

521
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:20,173
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you thinking, Linda and Susie?

522
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:24,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Would there be a way we could, would it be helpful if we

523
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote back and asked if they require compensation before we invite them.

524
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if they require compensation, it would never happen.

525
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:38,745
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't solicit yet.

526
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:43,268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was thinking, is that if they require compensation, then we know it's an automatic no.

527
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:44,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

528
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:48,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't even want to engage in the conversation if it's that.

529
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:53,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel that the outreach came from an interesting avenue.

530
00:48:53,988 --> 00:48:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

531
00:48:54,568 --> 00:49:01,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was thinking if we reached out and said, do you, would this- I don't even have the bandwidth to engage.

532
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:06,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

533
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:10,176
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something about the website.

534
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the website.

535
00:49:12,897 --> 00:49:13,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is.

536
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,559
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just something that isn't-

537
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:25,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That might not be worth even having them like the time to have them come to our meeting to discuss what people do.

538
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:29,224
[SPEAKER_07]: in my email, right?

539
00:49:29,364 --> 00:49:37,406
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people in my email that reach out to me and I haven't responded to them because sometimes it's very simple.

540
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:46,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a new, you know, online degree, higher education, you know, online education or something.

541
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's very simple, right?

542
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:53,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I can take that information, send it over to comms, have them put it in the resource link.

543
00:49:54,452 --> 00:49:55,973
[SPEAKER_07]: They come directly to me.

544
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:57,674
[SPEAKER_07]: This person didn't come to me.

545
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:00,375
[SPEAKER_07]: This person went through the clerk's office.

546
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,996
[SPEAKER_07]: What is their connection to the city clerk?

547
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:04,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this a phishing email?

548
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:06,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

549
00:50:06,218 --> 00:50:20,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know, I don't wanna engage in any back and forth correspondence unless it's a, please come to the next commission meeting on such and such day so that you can share more.

550
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:23,967
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not even here today and our meetings are posted.

551
00:50:25,495 --> 00:50:25,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

552
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:26,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

553
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:33,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I do like what what you know, I would like to write an article on for your site.

554
00:50:33,357 --> 00:50:34,757
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you writing on?

555
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:36,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

556
00:50:37,058 --> 00:50:45,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would this be so my question the next question for the commission would be would able well the website, which I can, I now have pulled up I can put a link to in the chat.

557
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be something that.

558
00:50:49,928 --> 00:50:53,050
[SPEAKER_02]: We would want to list as a resource on our website.

559
00:50:53,690 --> 00:51:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: My line of thinking here is that if it's not even something we would want to list on our website as a resource and there's probably no reason to pursue it further.

560
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if we're not willing to be like, oh, this is a.

561
00:51:10,548 --> 00:51:11,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't, this is Cam.

562
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:21,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about it, but one thought is, you know, we could just, one of us, instead of inviting the person, one of us could just learn more.

563
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:28,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we don't think it should go on the resource list, cause other things are more important.

564
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:32,284
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we thought a lot about what should go on the resource list.

565
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:36,027
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's one way to think about it.

566
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:46,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can see, this is the extent of the site.

567
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Really just the one page.

568
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's contact.

569
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,547
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for resources.

570
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:05,408
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

571
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:24,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, looking at their site, and I definitely open the floor to other folks to to voice their their thoughts and opinions, but looking at their site, it doesn't look like it's adding it would be adding anything to our site that would be specifically relevant.

572
00:52:25,064 --> 00:52:26,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm imagining.

573
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:28,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

574
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:54,158
[SPEAKER_02]: This is total speculation, but I would imagine that the article that based on her email, I would imagine the article that she'd be writing would be something similar, like three things you can do to make living with a spinal cord injury easier, but based on what she was saying, the digital nomad lifestyle while managing disabilities.

575
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:06,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's something that we're like that topic or any topic would be something that we would want like to have a single article on our web page as a resource about.

576
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well.

577
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:15,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to.

578
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:20,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take this as a no.

579
00:53:21,688 --> 00:53:23,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, back to Cam's idea.

580
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:29,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone who wants to do a little bit more digging and learn more about this organization?

581
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who wants to engage with or engage with Mary to find out more?

582
00:53:42,144 --> 00:53:43,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't sound like it.

583
00:53:45,313 --> 00:53:50,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should have put more effort into the website, and then maybe we would care more.

584
00:53:50,036 --> 00:53:51,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

585
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:52,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't.

586
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:53,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, Cam.

587
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:54,839
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just something.

588
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,561
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something.

589
00:53:56,861 --> 00:53:58,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the thing is.

590
00:53:58,102 --> 00:53:59,663
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something I don't, you know.

591
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Too vague.

592
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:03,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

593
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:04,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm open to

594
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:16,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a woman, when we had our disability fair, there was a woman that reached out to me and she was a yoga instructor.

595
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:21,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And initially, I was like, OK, you teach yoga.

596
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:22,644
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's nice.

597
00:54:23,484 --> 00:54:24,424
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do for you?

598
00:54:24,705 --> 00:54:25,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you want to talk to us?

599
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:26,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you want to come?

600
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:27,926
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not paying anybody.

601
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:34,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it teaches a specialized kind of yoga.

602
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:36,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to look at our list.

603
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:37,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what it's called.

604
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:56,386
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is for people that have diabetes and neuropathy, people with cerebral palsy, people with physical and neurological and nerve related complications.

605
00:54:56,446 --> 00:54:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It begins with an S.

606
00:54:58,863 --> 00:54:59,583
[SPEAKER_07]: have to look it up.

607
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:03,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And something like that, yes, I would be interested in because you know what?

608
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:07,389
[SPEAKER_07]: You would not know that something like that existed.

609
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but this, I don't know, my cancer and I don't think this is gonna add anything to your site.

610
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:22,758
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

611
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:26,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for letting me not make that decision by myself.

612
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:35,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else anyone wants to chat about the Ablewell or Mary Wilson article?

613
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:38,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last thoughts before I move on?

614
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:46,769
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, the next thing on the agenda is the response to requests section.

615
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a couple requests here.

616
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Medford Housing Authority,

617
00:55:54,533 --> 00:56:01,494
[SPEAKER_02]: An invitation has been extended for a representative from the Medford Housing Authority to attend the April meeting and discuss the resident input process.

618
00:56:01,714 --> 00:56:05,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be on next meeting's agenda.

619
00:56:06,935 --> 00:56:09,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next item is the Medford Senior Center.

620
00:56:10,096 --> 00:56:12,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like we need some additional clarification.

621
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you asking about inviting employees or inviting attendees?

622
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:22,698
[SPEAKER_02]: This was clarifying from last meeting.

623
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:29,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that, Cam, were you working on that with Yvette?

624
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:31,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you happen to know?

625
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:32,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I was.

626
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:33,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you were, Susie.

627
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:34,416
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

628
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you happen to know?

629
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:43,763
[SPEAKER_06]: What I remember is that we wanted, somebody had suggested that we get to the senior center.

630
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:46,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had sent, when they're having events,

631
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and that somebody would represent us there.

632
00:56:50,901 --> 00:56:52,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna be away for St.

633
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:56,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrick's event, and then I don't know what the next event was.

634
00:56:56,544 --> 00:56:59,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been away, so I haven't gotten on top of that.

635
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:04,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But whether we can attend and sit there.

636
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's all I remember about that.

637
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

638
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:23,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part, Linda, because we talked about it and we went back and forth, so it was confusing.

639
00:57:23,295 --> 00:57:33,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what the commission wanted to do was suggest that we have one of our commission meetings where if folks are able,

640
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:57,641
[SPEAKER_01]: They, we all attend, you know, we coordinate with the senior center to reserve a large space where we could meet and then members of the public could attend in person and we would have sort of publicized that we were going to be in the building.

641
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:03,434
[SPEAKER_01]: we were going to have our meeting and that we were happy to connect and just listen to folks.

642
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, okay.

643
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:07,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

644
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:19,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So then Linda, I think that is sort of what we would suggest is, um, I'll go back down to the senior center and find out their next, um, events.

645
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:27,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, that's fine, but I want to go to something, um, next weekend, if this is an okay time,

646
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,946
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having a wellness event at the new library in Medford.

647
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:38,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say next Saturday, the 30th.

648
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:42,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the Medford Recreation Department will be there.

649
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:49,519
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be, now that I think about it, would be a fabulous place to have a little table.

650
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:59,707
[SPEAKER_07]: can I just wrap up the senior center invitation only because I'm confused.

651
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:01,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make sure that it's clear.

652
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:04,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to meet by Zoom.

653
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:06,333
[SPEAKER_07]: We can also meet in person.

654
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:08,334
[SPEAKER_07]: We can also meet hybrid.

655
00:59:09,475 --> 00:59:11,137
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to make sure that's clear.

656
00:59:11,777 --> 00:59:12,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not

657
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:17,847
[SPEAKER_07]: be renting space from the senior center for the meeting.

658
00:59:18,287 --> 00:59:21,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Reason being the senior center closes at four.

659
00:59:21,868 --> 00:59:27,710
[SPEAKER_07]: The council and agent is a business, so when I use them and use their space, guess what?

660
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:28,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Have to pay.

661
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So where is that coming from?

662
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:44,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, if we're going to have an in-person meeting, right, which is fine, we would want to make sure that it is in an accessible location.

663
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:53,357
[SPEAKER_07]: City Hall is completely out on Wednesdays, because remember, you've got council meetings that are happening.

664
00:59:54,884 --> 01:00:01,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, you know, I-I asked, you know, back in the day, where did people have these meetings?

665
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:05,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the DPW offices, and the library, and the this and the that.

666
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:14,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I don't consider... The library itself, the physical location of the library is access... is... is... The library is an accessible library.

667
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,062
[SPEAKER_07]: But getting to the library is not accessible for many people.

668
01:00:18,162 --> 01:00:20,344
[SPEAKER_07]: People think it is because it's on High Street.

669
01:00:20,844 --> 01:00:21,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not.

670
01:00:21,345 --> 01:00:24,207
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many people who are actually afraid

671
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:37,009
[SPEAKER_07]: because it is extremely congested, the visibility is bad, and at the time that we have our meetings at 5.30 in the evening, I'm not putting that stress on anyone, right?

672
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So then that leaves us with options such as looking at the schools, which would be the next big space, and it depends on what they have on their calendars.

673
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:57,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But I say this because I just wanna make sure that folks know that Zoom is not the only option.

674
01:00:57,265 --> 01:01:00,527
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do hybrid and we can do in-person as well.

675
01:01:02,548 --> 01:01:06,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And then these are open meetings.

676
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:15,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would not single out just one group to invite because then you're gonna have to answer a lot of questions.

677
01:01:15,618 --> 01:01:17,359
[SPEAKER_07]: These are open public meetings.

678
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:20,001
[SPEAKER_07]: So we should probably just advertise that, hey,

679
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:36,413
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be in person, come meet or maybe if you wanted to do more of a social advertise that, hey, this meeting is going to be like our, you know, social pastries and like refreshments and do it that way.

680
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:54,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think what, and I could be wrong, I wasn't the one who came up with the idea, but I think the idea was because folks have challenges getting, you know, getting around that we should go to them.

681
01:01:55,336 --> 01:02:05,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, having one of our meetings be hybrid and having some people be at the senior center would be nice,

682
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:13,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear you that we don't necessarily have to do anything special to make that happen.

683
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:33,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should consider rotating a few different in-person locations in different months so that we're not, you know, accidentally excluding a population or a geography from attending in person if they wanted.

684
01:02:33,907 --> 01:02:39,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we could obviously let them know that virtual participation is always welcome.

685
01:02:40,490 --> 01:03:00,558
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Yvette was suggesting that some of us go to the senior center and because we would be there, it would maybe be more accessible and residents would interact with us and would feel more appreciative that we went to them.

686
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,961
[SPEAKER_01]: and minimize the work that they had to do to attend.

687
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:06,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

688
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:22,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Frances, would something like that be possible?

689
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:31,059
[SPEAKER_07]: To be quite honest with you, I really don't know how the senior center closes at four.

690
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,581
[SPEAKER_06]: The events are usually at noontime.

691
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:37,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

692
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:41,902
[SPEAKER_06]: The events there, the big events, St.

693
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:45,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrick's or whatever else, are usually at noontime.

694
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:51,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Susie was saying that the events happen at noontime.

695
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Susie, are you suggesting that we change our meeting time to noon?

696
01:03:54,786 --> 01:03:54,926
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

697
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought myself and Cam were saying, we meet them.

698
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:01,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a meeting.

699
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:11,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought like two months ago, we talked about just being there and saying, do you know about the disability board?

700
01:04:13,658 --> 01:04:18,280
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a meeting, but maybe I'm breaking, I don't know.

701
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:24,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Susie, I think that there are two different conversations going on.

702
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're referencing outreach.

703
01:04:27,226 --> 01:04:29,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when you wanted to do some outreach?

704
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:30,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

705
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:36,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But Cameron is responding to a request that was made.

706
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:42,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's sort of like a different conversation.

707
01:04:42,184 --> 01:04:44,668
[SPEAKER_07]: The senior center closes at four o'clock.

708
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:53,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So being able to go there and have a meeting is not on the table unless the disability commission has a way.

709
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:57,740
[SPEAKER_07]: My office is an accessible office.

710
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So the option is for people to also come here.

711
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:10,105
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we are going to have all commissioners on site, it's not going to be big enough.

712
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:13,066
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have access to the chambers.

713
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:18,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So these things, they sort of need to be planned out.

714
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:29,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have just one question and then I'm happy to email Yvette to kind of clarify what the idea is.

715
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:37,687
[SPEAKER_01]: The one question I have is I've never been to the senior center or I think, do people live there?

716
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:37,747
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

717
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,832
[SPEAKER_01]: That huge skyscraper is empty.

718
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:45,394
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's not the senior center.

719
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:48,797
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the big skyscraper?

720
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:55,064
[SPEAKER_07]: The huge skyscraper that you see them working on, that's senior housing.

721
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:59,867
[SPEAKER_07]: That has nothing to do with the city, that is Medford Housing Authority.

722
01:06:00,768 --> 01:06:13,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but for instance, that's, so what Yvette is saying is that's where the people we want to invite to our meeting, that's where they live, and so we should be really close to them.

723
01:06:15,698 --> 01:06:16,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

724
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:21,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that's the set, so that's Medford Housing Authority.

725
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:23,025
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a different entity.

726
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not run by the city, they're overseen by the federal government.

727
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:30,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and you know, they're ours.

728
01:06:31,873 --> 01:06:36,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yvette had just talked to them, and that's the connection.

729
01:06:36,297 --> 01:06:41,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Yvette went there, and they're willing to host us, and they just wanna know when.

730
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:46,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they could certainly host something.

731
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:52,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have Tamponi, which is over, that is on the western side of Method.

732
01:06:52,862 --> 01:07:01,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're doing anything at that location right now because that building is under construction.

733
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:08,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it would be,

734
01:07:11,535 --> 01:07:13,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The time, I think, would be the issue.

735
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:18,981
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you talking about hosting having a meeting happen there?

736
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:20,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still confused.

737
01:07:24,505 --> 01:07:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that is the idea.

738
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:36,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Yvette was suggesting that rather than meeting in a place like the library and trying

739
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:49,216
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make people come to us to be able to attend in person, which, as you pointed out, you know, like, it's not, it's not at all, you know, all that easy to get to the library.

740
01:07:49,576 --> 01:07:59,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Yvette's suggestion was she had gone to that senior housing center and asked them if

741
01:08:01,397 --> 01:08:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we could meet on location and then the residents would be able to share their experience with us and potentially attend our, you know, our meeting in person since we were there.

742
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:28,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, I think that's what, that's all the idea is, is just, you know, if we wanted to host a meeting so that they could come down,

743
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:33,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, this has nothing to do with the senior center then.

744
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:41,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the senior center is something completely different.

745
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:44,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sue, what happens?

746
01:08:44,405 --> 01:08:45,886
[SPEAKER_07]: You've lost your volume now.

747
01:08:54,031 --> 01:08:55,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happens, Sue.

748
01:08:58,728 --> 01:08:59,589
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't hear me.

749
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:00,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

750
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:01,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we can hear you.

751
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:09,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the, they have events at the senior center about once a month about noontime.

752
01:09:10,538 --> 01:09:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the people that attend are from that senior housing building or other senior centers, whether they're private or whatever throughout the city.

753
01:09:26,688 --> 01:09:32,111
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I think two months ago we talked about was being there.

754
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:52,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about our 5.30 to 7 o'clock meeting, that somebody would be there, one or two people from the commission, and be there saying, we're from the commission, if you have any questions or suggestions, we're here.

755
01:10:07,697 --> 01:10:09,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have anything to add?

756
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Sue B, that is.

757
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,903
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just said that.

758
01:10:16,943 --> 01:10:18,384
[SPEAKER_06]: You're Sue, I just said that.

759
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:22,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything to add, Sue?

760
01:10:24,908 --> 01:10:30,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're saying something different than Cam is.

761
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:35,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're talking about two different events, a meeting,

762
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: and something at senior center.

763
01:10:43,796 --> 01:10:44,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you talking to me?

764
01:10:45,677 --> 01:10:45,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

765
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:47,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

766
01:10:47,178 --> 01:10:49,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Kim and I are on the same page.

767
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,642
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows that that big building is full of senior people.

768
01:10:56,402 --> 01:10:58,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're Medford Housing Authority.

769
01:10:59,024 --> 01:11:00,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that very well.

770
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:05,667
[SPEAKER_06]: A number of them are disabled, very disabled.

771
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:20,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we're saying is, why don't we go to the senior center where those people go for a lot of different social things?

772
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:28,444
[SPEAKER_06]: They go for busing to malls, they go to play card games, they go to yoga chair stuff.

773
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:35,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't one or two of us there when they have a bigger event

774
01:11:36,644 --> 01:11:52,741
[SPEAKER_06]: like st patrick's like where at the senior center okay and cam is talking about having a meeting at senior housing no i don't think so

775
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:59,839
[SPEAKER_07]: How about we do this?

776
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make an executive decision here for everybody.

777
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:19,063
[SPEAKER_07]: If members of the Disability Commission feel like they want to attend things that are occurring at the senior center, which is run by the Council on Aging, the short squat building,

778
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:26,783
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of outreach and things of that nature, let me know.

779
01:12:27,403 --> 01:12:32,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I can arrange it with Pam as long as no more than two people attend.

780
01:12:32,084 --> 01:12:40,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I say no more than two people is so that we don't run into any forum issues accidentally, right?

781
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me advance notice.

782
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:45,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't call me the day before and say you're planning on going tomorrow.

783
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:55,872
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I say give me advance notice is so that I can see if we have any leftover swag or something that you can take with you.

784
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, that is just for outreach.

785
01:13:00,636 --> 01:13:02,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, back to Cam's suggestion.

786
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm understanding is that Commissioner Welch put forward a suggestion of maybe having one of the evening meetings be an in-person meeting.

787
01:13:15,206 --> 01:13:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, for the record, making it clear.

788
01:13:18,563 --> 01:13:20,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Meetings are in-person.

789
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:23,686
[SPEAKER_07]: In-person meetings have not been canceled.

790
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:40,457
[SPEAKER_07]: The hybrid model, I mean, the online model has just continued because for many people, it actually works for them and it's actually equitable because they are not running from transport to transport waiting for rides, whatever.

791
01:13:41,598 --> 01:13:45,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks are more than welcome to join me in my office

792
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:48,635
[SPEAKER_07]: if they want to be in person.

793
01:13:49,175 --> 01:14:09,699
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we are to post an actual in-person, in-person meeting, we would need an owl or somebody to lend us an owl because you can't be in person and be hybrid at the same time, depending on your location, right?

794
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:16,160
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would need a space that everybody could get to easily.

795
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:37,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And if Kristen or Sandra or somebody from the housing authority, the Medford Housing Authority, if they are willing to set up space for us, I would have to double check and make sure that it could be at 530.

796
01:14:39,052 --> 01:14:48,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you all agree that, hey, you know what, maybe our final meeting in June before we go on hiatus,

797
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:58,245
[SPEAKER_07]: wish you have like a meet and greet in person, and it can be at a specific location, I can help support that as well.

798
01:15:00,006 --> 01:15:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be clear, the Senior Center is run by the Council of Aging, very, very different.

799
01:15:08,554 --> 01:15:11,536
[SPEAKER_07]: The Housing Authority is also different.

800
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And whilst those two buildings are close together,

801
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:22,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to also add that many non-Medford people also attend the senior center.

802
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the misconception is that everybody from the buildings goes to the senior center.

803
01:15:28,312 --> 01:15:29,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually not accurate.

804
01:15:29,632 --> 01:15:35,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of non-Medford people that also attend.

805
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:44,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe, you know, think about that and then just get back to me individually via email.

806
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:51,382
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, yeah, that was a super summary.

807
01:15:53,405 --> 01:15:53,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So that again.

808
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear that.

809
01:15:56,972 --> 01:15:57,192
[SPEAKER_07]: That was.

810
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:02,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was saying I was saying super helpful Francis.

811
01:16:02,337 --> 01:16:10,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you summarized it well and and I know I will email you with how I'm thinking so just yeah, thank you.

812
01:16:10,921 --> 01:16:17,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and then I don't know where Susie is, but maybe Susan will be back shortly.

813
01:16:19,505 --> 01:16:20,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

814
01:16:23,027 --> 01:16:23,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we?

815
01:16:25,217 --> 01:16:27,398
[SPEAKER_02]: move on to the next agenda item?

816
01:16:27,438 --> 01:16:30,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think so, because we're at 6.55.

817
01:16:30,839 --> 01:16:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it looks like the next thing on the agenda is Frances put on a commissioner term expiration and to kind of be planning ahead for the next set of terms.

818
01:16:46,245 --> 01:16:53,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're interested in renewing your term or appointment, please send an email to Frances indicating your interest no later than the May 2024 meeting.

819
01:16:55,666 --> 01:17:03,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like pretty much all of us have, not all of us, but most of us, the great majority of us.

820
01:17:03,154 --> 01:17:12,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim, since you've just joined three months ago, you are not on the list for renewal quite yet.

821
01:17:16,142 --> 01:17:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, Gabby is, Joe, you are, Susie, and Yvette.

822
01:17:21,444 --> 01:17:25,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like, yes, Susan, Bibbins, you are also in the clear for now.

823
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:39,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So any of those folks who are interested in renewing your term or appointment, please send an email to Frances indicating your interest no later than the May 2024 meeting.

824
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the second page, we've got some new business.

825
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:54,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like what the question on here on the agenda is, what steps are the commission taking to recruit for the vacant commissioner position?

826
01:17:54,278 --> 01:18:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be like the secretary position and possible vacancies that will arise from the non-renewal term limits.

827
01:18:03,305 --> 01:18:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And what support does the commission need to be effective with its recruitment?

828
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:27,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if there's anything like off the top of anyone's head that we want to talk about now or if we want again, given the fact that we have three minutes left, if we want to think about these things and bring this to the April meeting about how are we going to recruit for the vacancies on the commission.

829
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:46,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a person that I've talked to that is raring to go and she submitted her application and she wants to serve.

830
01:18:46,754 --> 01:18:49,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend her.

831
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:56,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

832
01:18:56,947 --> 01:19:04,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you comfortable emailing me her name only because I don't want to, the person is not here and I don't want to speak about them.

833
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:06,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, absolutely.

834
01:19:06,731 --> 01:19:07,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

835
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:11,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That way I can follow up because the applications actually don't come to me.

836
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:13,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay.

837
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:16,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They go into like some smart sheet portal thing.

838
01:19:17,654 --> 01:19:18,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

839
01:19:18,635 --> 01:19:19,855
[SPEAKER_07]: That way I can follow up.

840
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:20,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

841
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:24,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

842
01:19:24,685 --> 01:19:25,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

843
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:27,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

844
01:19:27,467 --> 01:19:31,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can keep thinking about that and bring that to the next meeting.

845
01:19:31,628 --> 01:19:38,111
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about renewals and vacancies next meeting.

846
01:19:38,971 --> 01:19:42,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got one thing under correspondence and announcements.

847
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:45,854
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a flyer attached in the e-mail with the agenda.

848
01:19:47,865 --> 01:20:04,270
[SPEAKER_02]: The Metro Regional Disability Inclusion Summit is happening on April 11th from 9.30 to 2 at the Walter Denny Youth Center, the Boys and Girls Club Dorchester, and there's an address there in Dorchester if anyone is interested and able to attend.

849
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:10,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other information you wanted to include on that, Frances?

850
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:12,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that is

851
01:20:15,693 --> 01:20:18,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to ransack my brain quickly.

852
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:21,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That is pretty much it.

853
01:20:22,176 --> 01:20:40,044
[SPEAKER_07]: The ICCM, Islamic Cultural Center of Medford, in partnership with the interfaith community, is holding the Community Iftar on Sunday, April 7th from 6 to 8.

854
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:51,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Iftar is the meal that is eaten when the fast is broken during the time of Ramadan.

855
