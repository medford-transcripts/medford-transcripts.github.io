    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=0.723s">The</a>  10th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=4.247s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=12.094s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=13.015s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=15.577s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=16.658s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=17.659s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=19.601s">Vice</a>  President Lowell-Curran? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=23.245s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=23.765s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=24.786s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=27.082s">President</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=28.062s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=28.802s">Six</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=30.183s">Please</a>  rise to receive the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=33.423s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=46.086s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=49.627s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=50.527s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=51.787s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=53.088s">Suspension</a>  of the rules is granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=55.505s">Item</a>  number 16-306 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council award a certificate of appreciation to Chad Murphy and Associates for their volunteer work on the home of Frances Blomworth, a World War II veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=68.455s">Chad</a>  and Associates installed an elevator lift ramp and updated electrical services on Mr. Blomworth's home with funds they raised for veterans in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=77.702s">The</a>  elevator was donated by Kate Trevor Morris, who just moved to Medford nine months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=82.645s">Councilor</a>  Coffey.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=83.937s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=84.917s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm happy to be there tonight giving this certificate out to Chad and his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=92.001s">About</a>  three years ago, Chad left to me and asked me about starting a program helping the veterans that needed repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=101.245s">And</a>  since then, it's grown into something that's been pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=105.987s">Anytime</a>  I've called Chad and his friends, they've been there to help out a veteran or a veteran's family in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=112.35s">On</a>  this particular one, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=114.548s">This</a>  is a project that maybe got a little bit out of control for us, and maybe we got a little bit over our head on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=122.394s">But</a>  just to give you a short story, Ernest Lindsay, the veteran service director, called me with a gentleman that was stuck in his house for the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=132.141s">So,</a>  Chad and myself went over to the house, figuring that the gentleman was looking for a ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=138.365s">Soon</a>  after we got there, we find out the guy's not looking for a ramp, but he needs <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=142.682s">an</a>  elevator lift to get up and down out of his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=144.562s">His</a>  house is a raised ranch, and he's probably about 10 or 15 feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=149.964s">And</a>  guy hadn't been out of the house in a couple of years, and every time he goes out, it costs about $385 to go out by ambulance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=157.045s">So</a>  we go in there, we explain to the guy that, you know, this is really not what we do, you know, it's kind of a little bit over our head, you know, funds and everything, but we'd look into it and maybe see if we can find him, you know, something or another agency to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=170.108s">So</a>  we left, and Chad, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=173.002s">said</a>  he maybe knew of a friend that had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=175.804s">I</a>  myself, I made a couple of calls, and one of the calls I made to was my favorite veteran, Dominic Marcellino, and within two hours, Dominic calls me up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=187.01s">He</a>  says, I found you a lift on the House on Gordy Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=191.372s">He</a>  said a friend of his they knew was over there had passed away and the house had been sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=195.594s">I</a>  went over there and I met the people, nice people, the Morris's. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=201.195s">And</a>  I asked them if they would be kind enough to donate the lift to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=205.678s">And</a>  they said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=206.799s">I</a>  called Chad. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=208.28s">He</a>  came down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=208.82s">We</a>  looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=209.3s">We</a>  thought we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=211.061s">And</a>  the next week we picked it up and he brought it over there with his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=214.103s">And</a>  I think soon after we got it over there, what we thought was going to be a simple, you know, put it in the ground and put it up and down, got a little crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=223.289s">Before</a>  you know it, they're cutting down trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=225.491s">He</a>  had to extend the deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=227.792s">The</a>  power had to be brought into the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=229.453s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=231.09s">I</a>  don't know if anybody saw the story on Channel 5 that ran this week, 5 for Good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=235.311s">A</a>  citizen called up, commending us for our work, and I want to thank the citizen who did that, and they made it sound like we had it done in four hours, if you watched the show there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=245.255s">But</a>  again, this was a good thing, and if you saw the story, and you saw Mr. Bloomer's face when he was down in his driveway by himself for the first time, you see the smile on his face, you'll say, this is why we do the job we do, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=260.23s">And</a>  that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=262.112s">And</a>  at this point, if Chad can come up here.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=272.721s">Mr.</a>  Messenger, why don't you let him into the council?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=276.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=285.38s">Unfortunately,</a>  the Morrison's won't be here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=288.141s">They</a>  had a work commitment, and I will deliver the certificate to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=291.463s">But</a>  Chad's here, and all his friends have helped out on this massive project. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=296.605s">Chad,</a>  if you want to say a few words.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=297.526s">I</a>  really don't, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=302.068s">I</a>  thank you, Rick Caraviello, for all your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=304.609s">He's</a>  really willing to put it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=305.949s">We</a>  do this, my brothers and I, a club that we have out of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=310.351s">We</a>  raise some money every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=311.432s">We</a>  try to find a local hero that needs a little bit of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=314.095s">And</a>  we're more than willing to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=315.536s">I</a>  think the thanks goes to Mr. Blumenth, who devoted his life to serve for this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=320.922s">So</a>  we're happy to do what we can for as long as we can.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=347.878s">The</a>  Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Chad Murphy and Associates in recognition and appreciation to Chad and Associates for their volunteer work on the home of Francis Bloomer, the World War II veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=360.367s">Chad</a>  and Associates installed an elevator lift ramp up the electrical service at Mr. Bloomer's home with the funds they raised for our veterans in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=368.494s">Chad,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=369.414s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=369.895s">And</a>  on Friday, when we finish the project, the first thing Chad said to me, let me know what's next, what do you need to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=377.072s">So</a>  again, I can't thank these guys enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=378.792s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=438.887s">Southern</a>  New Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=439.768s">Can</a>  you get any smaller guys going?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=475.355s">While</a>  we're on to suspension, we'll take 16-309 communications from the mayor to President Frederick N. Dello Russo Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=498.223s">and</a>  honorable members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=500.718s">Mayor</a>  Stephanie M. Burke, amendment to Article 8 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Outdoor Dining Licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=509.502s">Dear</a>  President Dello Russo and honorable members of Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the attached amendment to Article 8 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Outdoor Dining Licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=523.508s">This</a>  amendment clarifies and codifies the original purpose of the Outdoor Dining License ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=528.728s">which</a>  is to allow for a process to review and approve the use of sidewalks and other property which is under jurisdiction of the city to be used by an appropriate entity for outdoor dining. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=538.674s">In</a>  addition, it makes clear that the provisions of the ordinance do not apply to property which is privately owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=544.877s">Of</a>  course, any rules and regulations, e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=547.158s">zoning,</a>  building, liquor, and health that apply to outdoor dining use on private property will remain in effect and not be altered by this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=555.283s">The</a>  following is a text of the proposed amendment <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=558.07s">respectfully</a>  submitted yours, Stephanie Yenberg, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=561.431s">And</a>  then we have the ordinance before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=564.212s">Before</a>  us to present tonight on the matter is the right honorable city solicitor, Mark Rumley.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=573.034s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=574.935s">My</a>  name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=576.075s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=578.275s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=580.236s">This</a>  is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=582.137s">This</a>  amendment to this ordinance is to make clear in our outdoor dining ordinance that <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=588.258s">entities</a>  would have to come before the city council for their approvals if it were on city or municipal property like sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=596.802s">And</a>  that's really the only purpose here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=599.324s">Those</a>  of you who were on the council when this was initiated know that that was the tenor of our early discussions, but for whatever reason, and they're really not that important, it's been interpreted to apply even to private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=613.111s">And</a>  so this would make it clear that private property would still have to comply <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=618.0s">with</a>  zoning, health, et cetera, all those rules and regulations, but they would not have to come before the council for an outdoor dining license. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=626.106s">So</a>  it's a matter of streamlining the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=628.709s">And</a>  I've spoken to all my colleagues in particular, Mr. Finn and others, and we all think that this would be an appropriate improvement to the ordinances and would ask your approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=641.359s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=643.169s">Mr.</a>  President, in review of the ordinance and in my discussions with Councilor Rumley when I received this in my packet, I see no problem with the proposed language and I would move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=651.631s">If</a>  my fellow colleagues have anything to say, I'd certainly welcome the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=654.711s">But</a>  as far as I can see, this looks like the paper just clarifies a problem that was discussed and identified by the council in previous sessions and terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=661.653s">And</a>  right now, it's our opportunity to correct the inaccuracies of the prior ordinance, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=668.44s">Uh,</a>  the motion for approval by council night, seconded by Councilor, uh, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=676.543s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=677.464s">And</a>  I appreciate the city solicitor coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=680.605s">And,</a>  uh, I remember we had a few outdoor dining licenses, uh, one being Wendy's that came before us, uh, with, uh, a need to approve the outdoor dining that was on their own property and, uh, some clarification in the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=696.116s">is</a>  needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=697.197s">However,</a>  I would recommend, even though this may seem minor in nature, where this is a change in city ordinance, that it be sent to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee just for a quick perusal and see where it fits within the zoning laws and rules and regulations, and then move from that committee, Mr. President, with the recommendation, rather than just approve it here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=724.129s">So</a>  I would ask that it just receive <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=726.281s">the</a>  ample opportunity for review in subcommittee first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=729.563s">Well,</a>  we have a motion before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=732.325s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=733.306s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with reviewing the matter in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=736.608s">However,</a>  I feel as though where it's a zoning issue, that the zoning and ordinance subcommittee would be the appropriate place to look at it, if in fact that's the approach we're going to take.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=743.252s">Does</a>  Councilor feel amenable to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=744.953s">I'm</a>  amenable to that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=808.635s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=810.357s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=811.117s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=812.218s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=812.958s">This</a>  paper was laid on the table at the close of last session. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=815.764s">It's</a>  been on the table now for over 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=818.266s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=818.426s">Mill</a>  is here before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=819.707s">I</a>  would wonder if she'd be willing to give us a brief rundown as to where we are in the process of the subrogation between the vendor that we have taken to court and the situation with the Winthrop street rain project.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=833.416s">We</a>  have not filed a lawsuit at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=836.277s">We</a>  are scheduled for mediation on May 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=840.38s">We</a>  have retained counsel and the contractor has retained counsel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=845.604s">We're</a>  actually very optimistic that we will reach a good settlement for the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=855.429s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=856.95s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=858.491s">On</a>  that, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=859.031s">Miller,</a>  can you remind us how much is being held from the contract?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=862.733s">There</a>  is no amount that's being held from the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=865.355s">It</a>  is the engineering firm that the city has a claim against, not the contractor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=870.959s">for</a>  the contract between the engineering firm and the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=873.381s">Wasn't</a>  there a portion of money that's being held, which is why you're going to mediation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=877.143s">No,</a>  there is no amount of the engineering funds that is being held. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=882.087s">So</a>  how much are we requesting?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=884.589s">We</a>  were looking for $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=885.309s">Were</a>  we withholding it at one point, and then did we end up paying? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=891.654s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=891.834s">Or</a>  was that a different, because I know we had two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=894.336s">So</a>  I'm thinking of the other one.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=895.757s">Yes,</a>  it's the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=896.978s">On</a>  this one, we simply stopped using the engineering firm.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=902.853s">And</a>  is it a, it's mediation, so no high or low? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=906.254s">No,</a>  we have an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=909.155s">You</a>  have an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=909.795s">Any</a>  figures discussed with regards to high, low mediation?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=914.357s">There</a>  were, but these are in anticipation of litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=917.878s">I'm</a>  not sure that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=919.826s">figures</a>  that we would discuss publicly at this time.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=922.228s">Uh,</a>  no, we prefer not to discuss opposition publicly with the mediation coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=926.63s">Uh,</a>  we have met with, uh, uh, our attorney who is a, uh, specialist in construction law, especially this, this kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=933.695s">We've</a>  had meetings with the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=935.656s">We've</a>  made our demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=936.937s">We're</a>  preparing our evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=938.358s">We're</a>  going forward with the hearing and we're not going to show our hand tonight.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=941.8s">Tonight.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=942.16s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=943.221s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=943.541s">Madam</a>  vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=947.984s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=948.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=949.105s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=950.253s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=950.573s">Miller,</a>  if I remember correctly, the engineering firm that was hired gave us some engineering plans relative to the replacement of the drains on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=958.778s">Those</a>  plans were inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=959.898s">Public</a>  utilities had to be moved, which resulted in a cost overrun on this project, if I remember correctly.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=964.401s">Yeah,</a>  there were two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=965.441s">One</a>  issue was a failure to identify some rock, basically, on the road so that the work had to be done by hand rather than other methods, which would have been less expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=978.916s">And</a>  then there was an unmarked duck bank that was an electrical and a gas duck bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=984.541s">And</a>  we had to move part of the water main in order to accommodate the duck bank that was unmarked.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=992.187s">And</a>  this $350,000 is owed to the people that actually did the work as opposed to the engineering firm, correct?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=997.951s">No,</a>  this is the money that we feel that we would not have had to spend <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1005.551s">had</a>  the engineering firm done its due diligence at the time of the design, so that when we went out to bid, the water main would have been in the right location. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1014.457s">We</a>  wouldn't have had to spend money to move it basically in the middle of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1019.36s">And</a>  different means of removing the rock would have been used by the contractor, had we known that there was the amount of rock there where the drain pipe was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1029.887s">And</a>  it was a large drain pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1031.048s">It</a>  was a 48-inch pipe that had to be dug down. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1035.885s">very</a>  deep for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1040.628s">So</a>  this $350,000 is to make the city whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1043.629s">Right</a>  now, we're basically short $350,000 that we paid out to the contractor that would have to be covered by the water operating budget if we do not get this loan authorization.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1066.75s">Mr.</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1072.571s">I</a>  move for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1074.111s">On</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Knight, second by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1079.212s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1080.012s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1081.472s">So</a>  Louise, has the engineering firm been paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1084.053s">I</a>  guess I'm not sure about that.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1085.873s">They</a>  were paid for all the work that they performed up to the time that we discovered that the work was not adequate, at which point in time the firm, we stopped using the firm, the city did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1097.122s">So</a>  we had paid them up to the point at which we stopped using them.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1101.946s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1102.227s">So</a>  is any portion of this 350,000 going to the engineering company?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1106.21s">No,</a>  it is going back to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1111.334s">It</a>  is going to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1113.696s">If</a>  we do not authorize this loan order, the $350,000 is going to have to be made up out of a fund of the seated that additional $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1124.374s">So</a>  either we're going to have to make it up with water, most likely enterprise funds, or some other source of funding.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1131.297s">But</a>  it's going back to the city with the purpose of what?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1134.919s">Replenishing</a>  our own funds.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1137.36s">And</a>  not to pay the engineering firm?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1139.16s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1140.121s">We</a>  are not paying them another dollar.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1142.222s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1142.342s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1144.303s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knightson. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1145.243s">A</a>  motion for approval by Councilor Knightson, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1149.025s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1169.141s">There's</a>  another loan order.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1171.222s">While</a>  we're under suspension, Councilor Knight, I move to take paper 15-734, loan order additional DPW facility project funds in the amount of $300,000 off the table.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1219.0s">for</a>  a first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1219.941s">Mr.</a>  President, looking through the breakdown of the legislative history of this piece of legislation, this paper was brought before the council due to underestimation of contaminants at a DPW site, and as such, there was some cost overruns related to the removal of contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1240.217s">Because</a>  of that, we had to add to the project scope, and that cost about $300,000 is my understanding, but I think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1245.621s">Miller</a>  will be able to give us a better breakdown than I.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1248.78s">No,</a>  that is entirely correct.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1253.162s">Chair</a>  awaits a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1257.323s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Juan Gocart.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1259.584s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1261.305s">With</a>  regards to the loan order portion of it, is there going to be any combined? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1266.407s">Are</a>  we just going to go out to bond for $300,000, or is there anything else that the city is looking at grouping this with?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1273.389s">Well,</a>  we would combine it with the $350,000 from the Winthrop Street.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1276.671s">So</a>  those will be the only two, so it'll be a $650,000 bond?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1280.074s">At</a>  this time, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1282.717s">That's</a>  all we have.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1286.821s">And</a>  the mayor has asked for a few different expenditures from the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1292.005s">Has</a>  free cash been discussed with regards to these two projects?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1296.81s">We</a>  did discuss it with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1299.132s">I</a>  don't remember at which other meeting we talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1301.314s">Committee</a>  of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1302.537s">At</a>  the Committee of the Whole meeting, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1304.599s">And</a>  my own recommendation to the council is that we bond this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1310.784s">The</a>  two projects were originally bonded and we should continue to bond them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1314.747s">My</a>  recommendation is to continue doing what we started doing last week, which was using the free cash to fund studies and smaller items of capital that come up before council and that we bond larger construction costs and construction projects.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1331.309s">And</a>  after last week's vote, you had mentioned the figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1335.071s">Are</a>  we still at $9 million?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1337.413s">After</a>  last week, we're at about $9.3 million.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1346.298s">That's</a>  $9,300,000.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1347.859s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1348.279s">$9,300,000,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1348.84s">Thank</a>  you so very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1353.122s">Madam</a>  Vice President?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1356.885s">I</a>  guess since the last bond, since those <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1361.316s">new</a>  certified cash just came in from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1364.997s">Was</a>  it discussed further? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1366.117s">I</a>  know we, cause we had our subcommittee meeting back December 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1370.178s">Has</a>  it been discussed further to take anything out of free cash for this particular item?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1375.319s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1375.779s">And</a>  I really would not recommend that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1378.199s">We're</a>  going to start the budget process and we're going to try to put together a capital plan over the, that's going to be a longer term capital plan over five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1386.821s">And</a>  we're going to, um, propose different funding methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1391.499s">depending</a>  upon the type of capital. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1393.159s">And</a>  I think it will be a much more comprehensive capital plan that includes vehicles, smaller capital items, sidewalks, roads, and building projects as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1403.582s">So</a>  until we have that capital plan, I would not recommend that for these two projects right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1409.304s">What</a>  is the, I know it's been three, four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1412.845s">So</a>  what is the interest rate as of today if we went out to bond for 650,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1416.086s">I</a>  still think it's just under 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1423.359s">And</a>  can you remind us, because it has been a while, how many years are we going to take out the loan for? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1428.343s">20</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1429.104s">That's</a>  all the questions I have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1437.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1437.911s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1439.091s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1441.153s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1442.334s">On</a>  a motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Martins.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1445.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1446.337s">Just</a>  where this has been several months now, can you refresh my memory on the consultant firm that was hired by the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1453.393s">what</a>  their actual report back to the city was regarding the cost for the contaminants to be removed, and ultimately, what did it end up costing us?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1462.935s">So</a>  basically, in rough numbers, they had estimated approximately $1 million to remove the contaminants from the site, and it was approximately $1.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1471.397s">We</a>  were $500,000 over the total estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1472.258s">And</a>  will any portion of this $300,000 go to this particular consultant? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1482.268s">No,</a>  it will not.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1483.769s">Have</a>  they been paid in full?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1485.47s">They</a>  were. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1486.17s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1487.191s">And</a>  I know we had discussions with the city solicitor regarding trying to recoup some of our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1492.574s">Is</a>  that futile right now or is that ongoing?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1498.197s">That</a>  was part of the discussion that we had with our construction experts and the, just to put it in the briefest way possible, no matter how you look at it, we would have had to expend those dollars to remove that contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1511.104s">Therefore,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1512.209s">the</a>  prospects of recovery on this matter would not be more probable than not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1518.074s">We're</a>  focusing in on the other part of the case that deals with the ledge and the other, the vault, which was subsurface that caused us so much delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1526.601s">But</a>  on this one, no matter how they estimated the soil, the amount of money would require to remove that soil, we would have had to have done some under any circumstances because we're the owner of the property.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1540.805s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1541.425s">That,</a>  that is one way of looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1544.046s">And</a>  then another way is if there were other options on how to treat this, it could have been a plan a plan B plan C. And based on the dollar amount, we could have opted for a different plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1554.691s">So</a>  I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1556.772s">And</a>  you know, if it had to be removed, it was going to cost us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1559.733s">But</a>  I have a tough time paying a consultant company that comes in and this is their expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1565.627s">and</a>  for them to go over $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1567.847s">We're</a>  talking originally a million, and they said, oh, we're off by $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1573.688s">Why</a>  pay this consultant company? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1575.389s">I</a>  mean, why are we paying them?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1576.449s">Of</a>  course, there's a — respectfully, I'd say there's a bit of hindsight involved in why pay them, because at the time, we didn't know that their estimates were so — were so low. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1586.171s">And</a>  the fact that they were doesn't change the fact that all cases against a third party for negligence, which we use one standard, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1595.173s">always</a>  requires an element of damages, and the damages would be that we spent more money than we should have because of their negligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1604.301s">In</a>  this case, we spent the amount of money that we're required to spend to get rid of that contaminated soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1611.207s">I</a>  know that it sounds a little bit vague and maybe even esoteric, but that's the conclusions that I think are warranted under the law, and that's the way we've decided to proceed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1621.897s">And</a>  we had a discussion some time back regarding what the protocol is with these particular companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1630.883s">And</a>  I was under the impression that choosing anywhere from 5 to 10 percent, the margin of error, and to have the margin of error that's 50 percent, to me, would lend itself to some type of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1643.911s">And</a>  I just see it on a number of fronts that <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1648.654s">Yeah,</a>  I could have gave him that estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1650.436s">It's</a>  a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1651.577s">I</a>  mean, and I have no background in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1653.919s">Here's</a>  a company that we bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1655.24s">What</a>  do we pay this company? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1657.382s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1659.444s">I</a>  don't recall off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1661.686s">I</a>  would guess approximately $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1664.288s">That</a>  would be my guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1666.089s">But</a>  I do not know for certain.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1668.391s">We</a>  were better off just doing it off the cuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1671.213s">could</a>  have saved the $200,000 and just estimated ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1674.195s">I</a>  mean, really, when you think about it, to be off $500,000, you know, I know we have to pay the bill, but it just really troubles me that, you know, they're allowed to get away with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1687.644s">And,</a>  you know.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1689.445s">I</a>  am not going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1691.327s">There's</a>  no dispute that I would raise with the logic that you've just applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1695.709s">So,</a>  I'd say to you that it's simply common sense what you've just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1700.065s">If</a>  the margin of error is 5 to 10 percent, well, how could they possibly have been so high? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1706.23s">But</a>  the element of damages which is required in any claim, in this case, would be zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1713.656s">Damages</a>  in terms of measured by how much we had to take out of the ground and what it cost to take it out of the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1720.781s">So</a>  I think that I understand your position, and I hope that you understand mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1727.274s">But</a>  I think it's time to say that on this issue, that horse has left the barn. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1732.216s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1733.016s">Are</a>  we going to use this company again?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1734.357s">No,</a>  we do not have a contract with them currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1738.378s">What's</a>  the name of the company? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1741.219s">Brown</a>  and Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1742.799s">Brown</a>  and Caldwell.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1743.96s">We've</a>  used them in the past on a number of things.</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1746.181s">We</a>  have used them in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1747.301s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1748.061s">They</a>  no longer are our engineering on call. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1751.402s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1751.683s">And</a>  you're saying the city stance right now is that we're not going to use them going forward?</p>

    <p>[Louise Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1754.964s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1756.789s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2148.252s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2149.393s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2150.374s">This</a>  resolution tonight is to bring additional transparency and to our current process through technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2157.558s">Legislative</a>  software is becoming more popular <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2160.175s">It's</a>  used in many communities throughout the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2163.957s">And</a>  there are many benefits to this type of software. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2167.059s">And</a>  I know that the city clerk is probably somewhat familiar with the software that's being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2172.221s">It</a>  simplifies meeting management, saves time and reduced costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2177.044s">It</a>  keeps staff and citizens informed, and it promotes accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2181.266s">It</a>  truly makes the city clerk's office more efficient, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2186.177s">As</a>  soon as you post the agenda, it goes out online right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2188.859s">The</a>  whole community can see it and they can see all the background documents that the public currently doesn't see today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2195.125s">So</a>  any type of background material to the agenda, uh, they would receive that online. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2199.989s">And,</a>  uh, there's also the options to add cameras to this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2203.072s">So</a>  we could, if we wanted to, we could, uh, uh, put a camera in the city council, uh, meeting room. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2208.416s">I</a>  know, uh, council Lungo had mentioned last week about, uh, filming community committee, the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2214.152s">This</a>  would also go for a board and commission meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2217.414s">Uh,</a>  they could be filmed and immediately loaded right onto the, uh, city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2222.478s">So</a>  everyone could actually view and see what's going on, uh, if they can't make it to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2228.583s">Um,</a>  so I think it's worth it to, um, schedule committee, the hall and bring in a number of vendors to actually just show us what options are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2237.329s">Like</a>  I said, I think it makes the process more efficient, but more, uh, important, it makes the process transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2244.44s">And</a>  it promotes civic and community engagement, and it just makes government more accessible to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2251.045s">I</a>  actually did sit down with a vendor and did a half-hour demo over the phone, and they walked me through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2259.29s">It's</a>  pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2260.511s">So</a>  I think it's, you know, worth an hour to sit down with a vendor and just see how we can improve the process even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2265.274s">And</a>  I'd ask that if you could please schedule a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2268.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2269.777s">The</a>  President Thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2272.019s">Citizen</a>  — please. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2274.649s">Just</a>  to, there are a number of towns, surrounding towns that actually use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2279.472s">Melrose</a>  uses it, Somerville uses it, Cambridge, Westwood, and I think Framingham, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2285.176s">Some</a>  cutting edge places. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2286.657s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2287.297s">So</a>  I just think it's something that we should definitely look into.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2291.4s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2292.5s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2295.202s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2297.624s">I</a>  know we're going to discuss it in the committee of the whole meeting, but what is the price tag on something like this?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2303.174s">It</a>  depends what option you go with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2304.654s">And</a>  I only talked to one vendor, so I would imagine there's some flexibility to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2309.075s">So</a>  I think if you want, it's, I think, up to maybe like $1,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2314.257s">But</a>  if you add cameras to it, of course, that's more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2317.617s">But</a>  that was just one vendor, so I'm sure that's negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2321.918s">But</a>  what it does is, I mean, if you want, everything's on camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2326.42s">So</a>  if you came up from work tonight just saying you wanted to watch the meeting, you get to your house and it's 8 o'clock, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2333.155s">You</a>  can actually go back and watch it from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2335.656s">You</a>  can just watch a slice of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2337.757s">You</a>  can research through the tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2339.538s">If</a>  you wanted to see all of the resolutions that Councilor Caraviello has made since he became a councilor, you can go back and look at all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2347.702s">You</a>  can search for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2351.204s">If</a>  you wanted to look at public safety, you could look at every resolution on public safety, and it would pull up all the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2357.227s">So</a>  it's a good way for the citizens to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2361.463s">It</a>  just provides a lot of transparency to what we do.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2365.124s">So</a>  if, say, somebody wanted to watch a school committee meeting on a Wednesday, they could just live stream it from their computer at the Monday meeting?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2373.146s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2374.506s">Oh,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2375.346s">So</a>  it's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2376.047s">It's</a>  all easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2377.247s">And</a>  that's really the big bonus to it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2380.648s">We</a>  don't have to rely on, I know we have some private citizens right now that actually film some of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2386.049s">Or</a>  actually, they get a disc and put them on YouTube or Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2390.381s">So</a>  we can actually do this, the city should be doing this, and this is something that, this service that we can provide to the community, and it definitely, I think, would help the city clerk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2401.155s">So</a>  there's a lot of benefits to it, but I think having a vendor come in and actually describe the process of what they do would be beneficial to all of us.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2410.479s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we have our meetings only on Tuesday, and then it's replayed once. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2414.082s">So</a>  you have people in our audience, either committee of the whole meetings or school committee meetings, different board and commission meetings that are actually like typing down, posting on Facebook, everything that's said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2422.708s">So</a>  if somebody isn't available on a Tuesday or Thursday to watch a council meeting, they have to rely on Facebook or the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2428.372s">So</a>  this would be, people always ask, when are the replays? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2431.434s">And</a>  if they can't get it, they can't watch a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2433.335s">So</a>  this would definitely be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2435.137s">something</a>  I'd be interested in discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2436.738s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2788.569s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2789.869s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2791.59s">Last</a>  week, a gentleman named Mr. Serino from Bradshaw street came before this council and he spoke about a problem that he had relative to adding an additional parking spot at his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2801.255s">And,</a>  um, I did a little bit of research on the subject and if we look at our, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2804.891s">Zoning</a>  ordinances, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2806.392s">In</a>  division three, we have parking and loading, section 94-191, general parking and loading requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2813.075s">It</a>  is the intent of this division to reduce congestion in the streets and to contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for standing and storing of off-street motor vehicles associated with any use of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2825.242s">Continue</a>  on, Mr. President, through that division, and what we'll find is that under section three, parking spaces not enclosed in a structure may be provided anywhere on the lot except in an inner court <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2834.773s">except</a>  that no parking may be provided within the required front yards in sf1, sf2, and gr districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2842.039s">Sf1,</a>  sf2, and gr districts, Mr. President, require maybe 15 feet of footage, frontage, at each home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2850.265s">So</a>  in my discussions with Mr. Bavuso and Mr. Moki, they said that this has been one of the most voluminous requests that they've received in their office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2860.613s">More</a>  often than not, people are coming down that say they'd like to add a parking spot, but they're not able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2864.4s">because</a>  the local zoning ordinance is prohibited. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2867.361s">So</a>  in an effort to see if we can alleviate some of the congestion in our city streets and provide more off-street parking, I'd suggest that the building department provide us with recommendations to amend our zoning ordinance in this regard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2879.405s">So</a>  they're the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2880.506s">They</a>  understand what would be best in terms of frontage and rearage and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2887.228s">But</a>  I think this is a step in the right direction to ensure that residents in the community have ample parking on their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2893.937s">and</a>  in their, on their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2895.538s">And</a>  I would move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3009.922s">They</a>  were also supposed to do, if I remember correctly, Councilor, some cleanup of the paving in that whole quadrant there, up to the Fellsway, to clean up that roadway, because it's awful uneven. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3025.808s">And</a>  also, if I remember correctly, there was attached to all the approvals, we had a provision that there was supposed to be painted in there, one of those big Xs, so that the <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3040.435s">grid</a>  isn't, gridlock isn't created at the entrance and egress of that parking lot.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3047.297s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3047.937s">Was</a>  the city going to do that or were they going to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3049.857s">I</a>  thought the city was going to undertake that, but we can also ask that as a secondary, because you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3056.299s">Cars</a>  are now stopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3058.6s">The</a>  people that are gracious enough are stopping and allowing traffic to come in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3062.861s">But</a>  someone that lives in the area, I can tell you that's gridlock around the clock in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3069.293s">go</a>  in and out of that entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3071.335s">So</a>  I would ask that be added, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3073.817s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3074.218s">So</a>  on the motion approved by Councilor Marks, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3077.661s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3080.363s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3081.765s">We've</a>  done everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3082.645s">The</a>  records of the meeting of March 18th, 2016 will pass to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3088.511s">Councilor,</a>  Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3091.614s">If</a>  I could just ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3093.255s">the</a>  council could vote to approve just a request of the mayor to work with waste management for a spring cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3100.899s">Residents</a>  have been asking if there's a day where they can put out extra rubbish, spring cleaning from their homes, just a one day pickup where they won't have to call bulk mail if it's a large item and waste management can come and collect everything for the entire city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3118.947s">On</a>  the motion of approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3121.405s">for</a>  under suspension offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn that the mayor reach out to waste management to request a scheduled spring cleanup day so people can clean out their houses, get rid of all their junk, and also we begin our yard waste effort in that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3143.593s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3148.035s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3148.395s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3150.066s">One</a>  more thing while we're under suspension.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3151.587s">One</a>  more thing while we're under suspension, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3154.288s">Just</a>  an announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3155.168s">There</a>  is a road race in Medford at the Elks on Sunday the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3160.55s">It's</a>  the leprechaun run. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3161.79s">It's</a>  at 11 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3163.071s">All</a>  are welcome, and all proceeds benefit the Children's Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3166.672s">So</a>  I just wanted to make that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3168.033s">It's</a>  a great event. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3170.274s">500,</a>  600, 700 people attend and run, whether it's raining or snowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=3174.295s">It's</a>  a 5K.</p>
