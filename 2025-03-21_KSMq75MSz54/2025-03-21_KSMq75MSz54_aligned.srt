Six present, one absent.

16
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:31,423
Please rise to receive the flag.

17
00:00:33,423 --> 00:00:45,186
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,887
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello for suspension of the rules.

19
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:50,507
All those in favor?

20
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:51,287
Thank you, Mr. President.

21
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:52,628
All those opposed?

22
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:54,448
Suspension of the rules is granted.

23
00:00:55,505 --> 00:01:07,995
Item number 16-306 offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council award a certificate of appreciation to Chad Murphy and Associates for their volunteer work on the home of Frances Blomworth, a World War II veteran.

24
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:17,121
Chad and Associates installed an elevator lift ramp and updated electrical services on Mr. Blomworth's home with funds they raised for veterans in our community.

25
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:22,305
The elevator was donated by Kate Trevor Morris, who just moved to Medford nine months ago.

26
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:23,226
Councilor Coffey.

27
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:24,697
Thank you, Mr. President.

28
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:31,200
Mr. President, I'm happy to be there tonight giving this certificate out to Chad and his friends.

29
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:40,905
About three years ago, Chad left to me and asked me about starting a program helping the veterans that needed repairs.

30
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:45,066
And since then, it's grown into something that's been pretty good.

31
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:51,409
Anytime I've called Chad and his friends, they've been there to help out a veteran or a veteran's family in need.

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,210
On this particular one,

33
00:01:54,548 --> 00:02:01,894
This is a project that maybe got a little bit out of control for us, and maybe we got a little bit over our head on it.

34
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:12,101
But just to give you a short story, Ernest Lindsay, the veteran service director, called me with a gentleman that was stuck in his house for the last couple of years.

35
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:17,024
So, Chad and myself went over to the house, figuring that the gentleman was looking for a ramp.

36
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:22,228
Soon after we got there, we find out the guy's not looking for a ramp, but he needs

37
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,542
an elevator lift to get up and down out of his house.

38
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:29,264
His house is a raised ranch, and he's probably about 10 or 15 feet off the ground.

39
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:36,065
And guy hadn't been out of the house in a couple of years, and every time he goes out, it costs about $385 to go out by ambulance.

40
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:49,548
So we go in there, we explain to the guy that, you know, this is really not what we do, you know, it's kind of a little bit over our head, you know, funds and everything, but we'd look into it and maybe see if we can find him, you know, something or another agency to go to.

41
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:51,609
So we left, and Chad,

42
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,823
said he maybe knew of a friend that had one.

43
00:02:55,804 --> 00:03:06,129
I myself, I made a couple of calls, and one of the calls I made to was my favorite veteran, Dominic Marcellino, and within two hours, Dominic calls me up.

44
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,251
He says, I found you a lift on the House on Gordy Road.

45
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:15,094
He said a friend of his they knew was over there had passed away and the house had been sold.

46
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:20,237
I went over there and I met the people, nice people, the Morris's.

47
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:25,018
And I asked them if they would be kind enough to donate the lift to them.

48
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:26,679
And they said yes.

49
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,419
I called Chad.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,780
He came down.

51
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,280
We looked at it.

52
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,001
We thought we could do it.

53
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,043
And the next week we picked it up and he brought it over there with his friends.

54
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:42,789
And I think soon after we got it over there, what we thought was going to be a simple, you know, put it in the ground and put it up and down, got a little crazy.

55
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,690
Before you know it, they're cutting down trees.

56
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,371
He had to extend the deck.

57
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,413
The power had to be brought into the house.

58
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,334
So again,

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,631
I don't know if anybody saw the story on Channel 5 that ran this week, 5 for Good.

60
00:03:55,311 --> 00:04:05,235
A citizen called up, commending us for our work, and I want to thank the citizen who did that, and they made it sound like we had it done in four hours, if you watched the show there.

61
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:19,700
But again, this was a good thing, and if you saw the story, and you saw Mr. Bloomer's face when he was down in his driveway by himself for the first time, you see the smile on his face, you'll say, this is why we do the job we do,

62
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,171
And that's what it's all about.

63
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:28,778
And at this point, if Chad can come up here.

64
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,684
Mr. Messenger, why don't you let him into the council?

65
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:40,468
Thank you.

66
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,921
Unfortunately, the Morrison's won't be here this evening.

67
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:50,923
They had a work commitment, and I will deliver the certificate to them.

68
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:56,085
But Chad's here, and all his friends have helped out on this massive project.

69
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:57,506
Chad, if you want to say a few words.

70
00:04:57,526 --> 00:05:02,048
I really don't, but.

71
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,109
I thank you, Rick Caviello, for all your help.

72
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:05,909
He's really willing to put it all together.

73
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,271
We do this, my brothers and I, a club that we have out of Medford.

74
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,372
We raise some money every year.

75
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,573
We try to find a local hero that needs a little bit of help.

76
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:15,456
And we're more than willing to do it.

77
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:19,981
I think the thanks goes to Mr. Blumenth, who devoted his life to serve for this country.

78
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:24,506
So we're happy to do what we can for as long as we can.

79
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:59,907
The Memphis City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Chad Murphy and Associates in recognition and appreciation to Chad and Associates for their volunteer work on the home of Francis Bloomer, the World War II veteran.

80
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:08,033
Chad and Associates installed an elevator lift ramp up the electrical service at Mr. Bloomer's home with the funds they raised for our veterans in our community.

81
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,294
Chad, thank you.

82
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:09,775
Thank you.

83
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:16,040
And on Friday, when we finish the project, the first thing Chad said to me, let me know what's next, what do you need to do?

84
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,772
So again, I can't thank these guys enough.

85
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,032
Thank you.

86
00:06:56,537 --> 00:07:01,879
Yes, yes, I know, I know, I know.

87
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:19,748
Southern New Memphis.

88
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:21,489
Can you get any smaller guys going?

89
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:21,990
Thank you guys.

90
00:07:55,355 --> 00:08:18,203
While we're on to suspension, we'll take 16-309 communications from the mayor to President Frederick N. Del Rosso Jr.

91
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:19,944
and honorable members of the Medford City Council.

92
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:28,882
Mayor Stephanie M. Burke, amendment to Article 8 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Outdoor Dining Licenses.

93
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:42,968
Dear President De La Russo and honorable members of Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the attached amendment to Article 8 of the revised ordinances of the City of Medford entitled Outdoor Dining Licenses.

94
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:48,270
This amendment clarifies and codifies the original purpose of the Outdoor Dining License ordinance

95
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:58,133
which is to allow for a process to review and approve the use of sidewalks and other property which is under jurisdiction of the city to be used by an appropriate entity for outdoor dining.

96
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:04,457
In addition, it makes clear that the provisions of the ordinance do not apply to property which is privately owned.

97
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,098
Of course, any rules and regulations, e.g.

98
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:14,903
zoning, building, liquor, and health that apply to outdoor dining use on private property will remain in effect and not be altered by this amendment.

99
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:17,444
The following is a text of the proposed amendment

100
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,411
respectfully submitted yours, Stephanie Yenberg, Mayor.

101
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:23,772
And then we have the ordinance before us.

102
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:31,254
Before us to present tonight on the matter is the right honorable city solicitor, Mark Rumley.

103
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,915
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

104
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,015
My name is Mark Rumley.

105
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,255
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

106
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,716
I'm the city solicitor.

107
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,196
This is very simple.

108
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:47,558
This amendment to this ordinance is to make clear in our outdoor dining ordinance that

109
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:56,442
entities would have to come before the city council for their approvals if it were on city or municipal property like sidewalks.

110
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,863
And that's really the only purpose here.

111
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:12,550
Those of you who were on the council when this was initiated know that that was the tenor of our early discussions, but for whatever reason, and they're really not that important, it's been interpreted to apply even to private property.

112
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:17,473
And so this would make it clear that private property would still have to comply

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,686
with zoning, health, et cetera, all those rules and regulations, but they would not have to come before the council for an outdoor dining license.

114
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,228
So it's a matter of streamlining the process.

115
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:38,917
And I've spoken to all my colleagues in particular, Mr. Finn and others, and we all think that this would be an appropriate improvement to the ordinances and would ask your approval.

116
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:41,859
Councillor Knight.

117
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:51,371
Mr. President, in review of the ordinance and in my discussions with Councilor Rumley when I received this in my packet, I see no problem with the proposed language and I would move for approval.

118
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,671
If my fellow colleagues have anything to say, I'd certainly welcome the opportunity.

119
00:10:54,711 --> 00:11:01,513
But as far as I can see, this looks like the paper just clarifies a problem that was discussed and identified by the council in previous sessions and terms.

120
00:11:01,653 --> 00:11:07,414
And right now, it's our opportunity to correct the inaccuracies of the prior ordinance, Mr. President.

121
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,803
Uh, the motion for approval by council night, seconded by counselor, uh, counselor Scott Kelly, counselor Max.

122
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,444
Mr. President, thank you.

123
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:19,885
And I appreciate the city solicitor coming tonight.

124
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:35,471
And, uh, I remember we had a few outdoor dining licenses, uh, one being Wendy's that came before us, uh, with, uh, a need to approve the outdoor dining that was on their own property and, uh, some clarification in the language.

125
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:36,856
is needed.

126
00:11:37,197 --> 00:12:03,609
However, I would recommend, even though this may seem minor in nature, where this is a change in city ordinance, that it be sent to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee just for a quick perusal and see where it fits within the zoning laws and rules and regulations, and then move from that committee, Mr. President, with the recommendation, rather than just approve it here tonight.

127
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,570
So I would ask that it just receive

128
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,743
the ample opportunity for review in subcommittee first.

129
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,144
Well, we have a motion before us.

130
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:12,925
Councillor Knight.

131
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:16,568
I certainly have no problem with reviewing the matter in subcommittee.

132
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:22,852
However, I feel as though where it's a zoning issue, that the zoning and ordinance subcommittee would be the appropriate place to look at it, if in fact that's the approach we're going to take.

133
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:24,913
Does Councillor feel amenable to that?

134
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,713
I'm amenable to that.

135
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:30,156
I withdraw my motion for approval, Mr. President, and make a motion to refer to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee.

136
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:34,659
I move the motion to refer to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee, seconded.

137
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,058
All those in favor?

138
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:37,739
All those opposed?

139
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Motion carries.

140
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:43,845
Mr. President, I'd like to ask the clerk of the city council to post a meeting for next Tuesday at 6 p.m.

141
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:47,368
for the zoning and ordinance subcommittee meeting for the purpose of taking up this paper.

142
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,771
Does the clerk have that?

143
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:53,834
Yes.

144
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:59,780
Also, Mr. Clerk, if you would mark Councilor Mungo Kern as present.

145
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,301
While we're under suspension.

146
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:08,662
While we're under suspension.

147
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:09,482
We have Ms.

148
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,603
Miller here from the mayor's office.

149
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:18,789
I'd like to move to take a paper 15-736 off the table, the loan order for the Winthrop Street drainage project.

150
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,332
On motion, Councilor Knight to take a loan order 15- 736.

151
00:13:23,932 --> 00:13:23,332
736.

152
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:28,095
All those in favor?

153
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:30,056
All those opposed?

154
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:31,057
Motion carries.

155
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:31,637
Councilor Knight.

156
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:32,938
Yes, Mr. President.

157
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,300
This paper was laid on the table at the close of last session.

158
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,625
It's been on the table now for over 90 days.

159
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:38,386
Ms.

160
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,687
Mill is here before us this evening.

161
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:52,095
I would wonder if she'd be willing to give us a brief rundown as to where we are in the process of the subrogation between the vendor that we have taken to court and the situation with the Winthrop street rain project.

162
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,077
We have not filed a lawsuit at this time.

163
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:59,019
We are scheduled for mediation on May 5th.

164
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,703
We have retained counsel and the contractor has retained counsel as well.

165
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:10,827
We're actually very optimistic that we will reach a good settlement for the city.

166
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:16,190
Madam Vice President.

167
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,051
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

168
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:18,991
On that, Ms.

169
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:22,393
Miller, can you remind us how much is being held from the contract?

170
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,114
There is no amount that's being held from the contractor.

171
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:29,897
It is the engineering firm that the city has a claim against, not the contractor.

172
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,301
for the contract between the engineering firm and the city.

173
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:36,643
Wasn't there a portion of money that's being held, which is why you're going to mediation?

174
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,226
No, there is no amount of the engineering funds that is being held.

175
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:43,208
So how much are we requesting?

176
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:45,189
We were looking for $350,000.

177
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:51,634
Were we withholding it at one point, and then did we end up paying?

178
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:51,694
No.

179
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,715
Or was that a different, because I know we had two issues.

180
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:55,477
So I'm thinking of the other one.

181
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:56,938
Yes, it's the other issue.

182
00:14:56,978 --> 00:15:00,300
On this one, we simply stopped using the engineering firm.

183
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:06,234
And is it a, it's mediation, so no high or low?

184
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,635
No, we have an attorney.

185
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:09,715
You have an attorney.

186
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:13,916
Any figures discussed with regards to high, low mediation?

187
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,818
There were, but these are in anticipation of litigation.

188
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:19,098
I'm not sure that they are.

189
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:21,927
figures that we would discuss publicly at this time.

190
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:26,110
Uh, no, we prefer not to discuss opposition publicly with the mediation coming up.

191
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:33,615
Uh, we have met with, uh, uh, our attorney who is a, uh, specialist in construction law, especially this, this kind.

192
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:35,196
We've had meetings with the other side.

193
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,777
We've made our demand.

194
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,338
We're preparing our evidence.

195
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:41,280
We're going forward with the hearing and we're not going to show our hand tonight.

196
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,140
Tonight.

197
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,181
Okay.

198
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:43,521
Thank you.

199
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,123
Madam vice president.

200
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:48,644
Thank you.

201
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:48,985
Thank you.

202
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:49,585
Councilor Knight.

203
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:50,553
And Ms.

204
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:58,177
Miller, if I remember correctly, the engineering firm that was hired gave us some engineering plans relative to the replacement of the drains on Winthrop Street.

205
00:15:58,778 --> 00:15:59,838
Those plans were inaccurate.

206
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:03,840
Public utilities had to be moved, which resulted in a cost overrun on this project, if I remember correctly.

207
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,321
Yeah, there were two issues.

208
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:18,488
One issue was a failure to identify some rock, basically, on the road so that the work had to be done by hand rather than other methods, which would have been less expensive.

209
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,880
And then there was an unmarked duck bank that was an electrical and a gas duck bank.

210
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:32,147
And we had to move part of the water main in order to accommodate the duck bank that was unmarked.

211
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:37,931
And this $350,000 is owed to the people that actually did the work as opposed to the engineering firm, correct?

212
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:45,037
No, this is the money that we feel that we would not have had to spend

213
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:54,117
had the engineering firm done its due diligence at the time of the design, so that when we went out to bid, the water main would have been in the right location.

214
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:58,539
We wouldn't have had to spend money to move it basically in the middle of construction.

215
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:09,707
And different means of removing the rock would have been used by the contractor, had we known that there was the amount of rock there where the drain pipe was going.

216
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,967
And it was a large drain pipe.

217
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:14,730
It was a 48-inch pipe that had to be dug down.

218
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:20,608
very deep for her.

219
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:23,569
So this $350,000 is to make the city whole.

220
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:37,177
Right now, we're basically short $350,000 that we paid out to the contractor that would have to be covered by the water operating budget if we do not get this loan authorization.

221
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,350
Mr. Councilor.

222
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,511
I move for approval, Mr. President.

223
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:58,732
On motion for approval by Councilor Knight, second by Councilor Caviello.

224
00:17:59,212 --> 00:17:59,852
Councilor Max.

225
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,732
Thank you, Mr. President.

226
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,973
So Louise, has the engineering firm been paid?

227
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,733
I guess I'm not sure about that.

228
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:16,035
They were paid for all the work that they performed up to the time that we discovered that the work was not adequate, at which point in time the firm, we stopped using the firm, the city did.

229
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:21,506
So we had paid them up to the point at which we stopped using them.

230
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:22,207
Right.

231
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,770
So is any portion of this 350,000 going to the engineering company?

232
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,132
No, it is going back to the city.

233
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:32,555
It is going to the city.

234
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:42,064
If we do not authorize this loan order, the $350,000 is going to have to be made up out of a fund of the seated that additional $350,000.

235
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:51,277
So either we're going to have to make it up with water, most likely enterprise funds, or some other source of funding.

236
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,438
But it's going back to the city with the purpose of what?

237
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:56,579
Replenishing our own funds.

238
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,860
And not to pay the engineering firm?

239
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,340
No.

240
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,501
We are not paying them another dollar.

241
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:02,322
OK.

242
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,702
Thank you, Mr. President.

243
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,223
Thank you, Councilor Nightson.

244
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:09,005
A motion for approval by Councilor Nightson, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

245
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,105
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

246
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:11,826
Councilor Caviello.

247
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:12,026
Yes.

248
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:22,117
Yes.

249
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:25,059
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

250
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,060
Thank you.

251
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,241
There's another loan order.

252
00:19:31,222 --> 00:19:41,267
While we're under suspension, Councilor Knight, I move to take paper 15-734, loan order additional DPW facility project funds in the amount of $300,000 off the table.

253
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,129
Motion to take item number 15-734 from the table.

254
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:45,729
Thank goodness.

255
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:49,063
by Councilor Knight.

256
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:49,884
All those in favor?

257
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:51,244
All those opposed?

258
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,425
As before us, law and order.

259
00:19:54,146 --> 00:19:58,728
Addition to the DPW facility project funds of $300,000.

260
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,589
In council, November 10th, tabled.

261
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:04,570
In council, November 17th, tabled.

262
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,832
In council, December 1st, referred to committee.

263
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:15,675
In committee, December 8th, reported out, December 8th, tabled, December 8th.

264
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:17,116
Now before us.

265
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,761
for a first reading.

266
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:38,776
Mr. President, looking through the breakdown of the legislative history of this piece of legislation, this paper was brought before the council due to underestimation of contaminants at a DPW site, and as such, there was some cost overruns related to the removal of contamination.

267
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:45,601
Because of that, we had to add to the project scope, and that cost about $300,000 is my understanding, but I think Ms.

268
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:47,803
Miller will be able to give us a better breakdown than I.

269
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,301
No, that is entirely correct.

270
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:54,102
Chair awaits a motion.

271
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,444
Chair recognizes Vice President Juan Gocart.

272
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,125
Thank you, President De La Russo.

273
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:06,166
With regards to the loan order portion of it, is there going to be any combined?

274
00:21:06,407 --> 00:21:13,349
Are we just going to go out to bond for $300,000, or is there anything else that the city is looking at grouping this with?

275
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,710
Well, we would combine it with the $350,000 from the Winthrop Street.

276
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:19,594
So those will be the only two, so it'll be a $650,000 bond?

277
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:22,216
At this time, yes.

278
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:23,297
That's all we have.

279
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:31,965
And the mayor has asked for a few different expenditures from the free cash.

280
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:35,088
Has free cash been discussed with regards to these two projects?

281
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,932
We did discuss it with the council.

282
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,294
I don't remember at which other meeting we talked about it.

283
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:42,095
Committee of the whole meeting.

284
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,218
At the Committee of the Whole meeting, yes.

285
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,744
And my own recommendation to the council is that we bond this.

286
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,946
The two projects were originally bonded and we should continue to bond them.

287
00:21:54,747 --> 00:22:10,319
My recommendation is to continue doing what we started doing last week, which was using the free cash to fund studies and smaller items of capital that come up before council and that we bond larger construction costs and construction projects.

288
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,051
And after last week's vote, you had mentioned the figure.

289
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,512
Are we still at $9 million?

290
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,634
After last week, we're at about $9.3 million.

291
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:27,019
That's $9,300,000.

292
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:28,259
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,820
$9,300,000, yes.

294
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,801
Thank you so very much.

295
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:33,923
Madam Vice President?

296
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:39,466
I guess since the last bond, since those

297
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,777
new certified cash just came in from last year.

298
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,097
Was it discussed further?

299
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:49,578
I know we, cause we had our subcommittee meeting back December 8th.

300
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:54,339
Has it been discussed further to take anything out of free cash for this particular item?

301
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:55,579
No.

302
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:58,179
And I really would not recommend that right now.

303
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:06,021
We're going to start the budget process and we're going to try to put together a capital plan over the, that's going to be a longer term capital plan over five years.

304
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:10,982
And we're going to, um, propose different funding methods.

305
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,139
depending upon the type of capital.

306
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:22,982
And I think it will be a much more comprehensive capital plan that includes vehicles, smaller capital items, sidewalks, roads, and building projects as well.

307
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:28,484
So until we have that capital plan, I would not recommend that for these two projects right now.

308
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:32,765
What is the, I know it's been three, four months.

309
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,046
So what is the interest rate as of today if we went out to bond for 650,000?

310
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,146
I still think it's just under 3%.

311
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,323
And can you remind us, because it has been a while, how many years are we going to take out the loan for?

312
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,084
20 years.

313
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:57,310
That's all the questions I have right now.

314
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,810
Thank you.

315
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,051
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

316
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,412
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

317
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:01,774
Move approval.

318
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,716
On a motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Martins.

319
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:06,237
Thank you.

320
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:12,382
Just where this has been several months now, can you refresh my memory on the consultant firm that was hired by the city?

321
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:21,775
what their actual report back to the city was regarding the cost for the contaminants to be removed, and ultimately, what did it end up costing us?

322
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:31,317
So basically, in rough numbers, they had estimated approximately $1 million to remove the contaminants from the site, and it was approximately $1.5 million.

323
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:32,218
We were $500,000 over the total estimate.

324
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:37,619
And will any portion of this $300,000 go to this particular consultant?

325
00:24:42,268 --> 00:24:43,028
No, it will not.

326
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:44,809
Have they been paid in full?

327
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:45,890
They were.

328
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,410
Yes.

329
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:52,033
And I know we had discussions with the city solicitor regarding trying to recoup some of our money.

330
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,016
Is that futile right now or is that ongoing?

331
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:10,443
That was part of the discussion that we had with our construction experts and the, just to put it in the briefest way possible, no matter how you look at it, we would have had to expend those dollars to remove that contamination.

332
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:11,644
Therefore,

333
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:17,654
the prospects of recovery on this matter would not be more probable than not.

334
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:26,101
We're focusing in on the other part of the case that deals with the ledge and the other, the vault, which was subsurface that caused us so much delay.

335
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:39,152
But on this one, no matter how they estimated the soil, the amount of money would require to remove that soil, we would have had to have done some under any circumstances because we're the owner of the property.

336
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:41,105
Right.

337
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,846
That, that is one way of looking at it.

338
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:54,050
And then another way is if there were other options on how to treat this, it could have been a plan a plan B plan C. And based on the dollar amount, we could have opted for a different plan.

339
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:56,552
So I hear what you're saying.

340
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:59,713
And you know, if it had to be removed, it was going to cost us that.

341
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:04,855
But I have a tough time paying a consultant company that comes in and this is their expertise.

342
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,367
and for them to go over $500,000.

343
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:12,128
We're talking originally a million, and they said, oh, we're off by $500,000.

344
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,169
Why pay this consultant company?

345
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:16,429
I mean, why are we paying them?

346
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:25,410
Of course, there's a — respectfully, I'd say there's a bit of hindsight involved in why pay them, because at the time, we didn't know that their estimates were so — were so low.

347
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:34,712
And the fact that they were doesn't change the fact that all cases against a third party for negligence, which we use one standard,

348
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:43,900
always requires an element of damages, and the damages would be that we spent more money than we should have because of their negligence.

349
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:50,726
In this case, we spent the amount of money that we're required to spend to get rid of that contaminated soil.

350
00:26:51,207 --> 00:27:00,174
I know that it sounds a little bit vague and maybe even esoteric, but that's the conclusions that I think are warranted under the law, and that's the way we've decided to proceed.

351
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:10,082
And we had a discussion some time back regarding what the protocol is with these particular companies.

352
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:23,230
And I was under the impression that choosing anywhere from 5 to 10 percent, the margin of error, and to have the margin of error that's 50 percent, to me, would lend itself to some type of action.

353
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:27,533
And I just see it on a number of fronts that

354
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,416
Yeah, I could have gave him that estimate.

355
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:31,216
It's a million dollars.

356
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:33,158
I mean, and I have no background in it.

357
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,200
Here's a company that we bring in.

358
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,381
What do we pay this company?

359
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:37,762
I don't know.

360
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:40,845
I don't recall off the top of my head.

361
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:43,727
I would guess approximately $200,000.

362
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:43,727
$200,000.

363
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,709
That would be my guess.

364
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:47,631
But I do not know for certain.

365
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:49,953
We were better off just doing it off the cuff.

366
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:54,135
could have saved the $200,000 and just estimated ourselves.

367
00:27:54,195 --> 00:28:06,904
I mean, really, when you think about it, to be off $500,000, you know, I know we have to pay the bill, but it just really troubles me that, you know, they're allowed to get away with this.

368
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,465
And, you know.

369
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:10,066
I am not going to.

370
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:14,809
There's no dispute that I would raise with the logic that you've just applied.

371
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:19,452
So, I'd say to you that it's simply common sense what you've just said.

372
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,849
If the margin of error is 5 to 10 percent, well, how could they possibly have been so high?

373
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:33,195
But the element of damages which is required in any claim, in this case, would be zero.

374
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:40,261
Damages in terms of measured by how much we had to take out of the ground and what it cost to take it out of the ground.

375
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:46,486
So I think that I understand your position, and I hope that you understand mine.

376
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:51,816
But I think it's time to say that on this issue, that horse has left the barn.

377
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:52,916
Right.

378
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,337
Are we going to use this company again?

379
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:58,318
No, we do not have a contract with them currently.

380
00:28:58,378 --> 00:28:59,518
What's the name of the company?

381
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,119
Brown and Caldwell.

382
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,940
Brown and Caldwell.

383
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,041
We've used them in the past on a number of things.

384
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,241
We have used them in the past.

385
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:07,501
Yes.

386
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:11,022
They no longer are our engineering on call.

387
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:11,563
Right.

388
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,844
And you're saying the city stance right now is that we're not going to use them going forward?

389
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:15,644
That is correct.

390
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:17,249
Thank you.

391
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:21,630
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Chair awaits a second.

392
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:22,470

Yes.

405
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:36,814
Councilor Scott-Bell?

406
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:37,074
Yes.

407
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:38,494
President De La Rufa?

408
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:38,974
Yes.

409
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:43,175
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the matter passes the first reading.

410
00:29:45,628 --> 00:29:47,069
Uh, one piece of clarification.

411
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:52,350
Am I to understand that a item number 16 dash three 10 is a withdrawn.

412
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,190
Oh, yes.

413
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,290
Thank you.

414
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:55,530
Yes.

415
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:04,953
Mr. President, members of the council respectfully, uh, on behalf of the mayor, we withdraw this request and I would say that it is unlikely that you will see it again.

416
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:06,113
Thank you.

417
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:11,074
Item number 16 dash three one zero is withdrawn.

418
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:14,149
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules.

419
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:18,973
Mr. President, can you read the items so people at home and people here that maybe came for it know what's happening?

420
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:24,797
Into the record, 16-310, March 10th, 2016.

421
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,380
To President Frederick M. Del Rosso, Jr.

422
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,003
and honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke.

00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:35,285
Deed restrictions, 15 Maple Park Avenue, Medford.

424
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,442
property commonly known as the Hegner Center.

425
00:30:39,823 --> 00:30:55,832
Dear President DelaRusso and honorable members of Medford City Council, in 1991, following the procurement process set forth in General Laws Chapter 30B, the city of Medford transferred the property located at 15 Maple Park Avenue to Hegner Center Incorporated for $1.

426
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:02,136
The Hegner Center, a Massachusetts non-profit corporation, served individuals with intellectual disabilities.

427
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:03,657
The deed from the city

428
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:16,741
to the Heckner Center contained the provisions that, in the event the premises shall no longer be used for non-profit educational purposes, premises shall revert to the city of Medford.

429
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:23,268
On October 31st, 2007, the Heckner Center merged with Bridgewell Incorporated as Heckner

430
00:31:23,642 --> 00:31:26,242
had done before, Bridgewell also works with individuals.

431
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:29,903
Mr. President, I move the waiving of the remainder of the reading.

432
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:37,604
That was just to give anyone that's in the audience here or anyone at home to know that that issue has been withdrawn by the mayor.

433
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,185
With pleasure, councillor.

434
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,866
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight for suspension of the rules.

435
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:44,386

to invest in our city.

Right.

479
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:20,395
Mr. President, the papers appear to be in order and a motion for approval.

480
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:22,136
A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

481
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:23,177
Councilor Marks.

482
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:31,022
I'd like to be recorded in opposition based on my stance regarding the need to update the current ordinance dealing with tax caps.

483
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:33,544
I've had the pleasure.

484
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,685
A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

485
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:36,846
All those in favor?

486
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,229
All those opposed, Councillor Marks.

487
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,650
One in opposition, the motion passes.

488
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:44,571
Congratulations.

489
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:45,872
See the clerk tomorrow.

490
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:56,097
We have also before us item number 16-311, petition by Sal Zagarella, which has been withdrawn.

491
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:03,841
On motion of Councillor Knight to resort back to the regular order of business, if there is any left.

492
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,021
All those in favour?

493
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:05,721
All right.

494
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:06,802
All those opposed?

495
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:31,108
16-305 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the Medford City Council, Medford School Committee, and many various boards and commissions meet on a regular basis to discuss city issues, whereas each meeting has an agenda that is required to be posted by the city clerk to comply with open meeting law, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

496
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:47,732
schedule a committee of the whole meeting to meet with vendors to explore various software slash technology options to help streamline meetings, engage citizens, make the meeting process more transparent and efficient.

497
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:48,993
Councilor Falco.

498
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:50,354
Thank you, Mr. President.

499
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:57,518
This resolution tonight is to bring additional transparency and to our current process through technology.

500
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:59,799
Legislative software is becoming more popular

501
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:03,277
It's used in many communities throughout the state of Massachusetts.

502
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:06,838
And there are many benefits to this type of software.

503
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:11,461
And I know that the city clerk is probably somewhat familiar with the software that's being used.

504
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:16,563
It simplifies meeting management, saves time and reduced costs.

505
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,505
It keeps staff and citizens informed, and it promotes accountability.

506
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:25,668
It truly makes the city clerk's office more efficient,

507
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:28,839
As soon as you post the agenda, it goes out online right away.

508
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:35,065
The whole community can see it and they can see all the background documents that the public currently doesn't see today.

509
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:39,188
So any type of background material to the agenda, uh, they would receive that online.

510
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,972
And, uh, there's also the options to add cameras to this as well.

511
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:48,276
So we could, if we wanted to, we could, uh, uh, put a camera in the city council, uh, meeting room.

512
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:53,681
I know, uh, council Lungo had mentioned last week about, uh, filming community committee, the whole meetings.

513
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:57,254
This would also go for a board and commission meetings as well.

514
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:02,378
Uh, they could be filmed and immediately loaded right onto the, uh, city website.

515
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:08,102
So everyone could actually view and see what's going on, uh, if they can't make it to the meeting.

516
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:16,789
Um, so I think it's worth it to, um, schedule committee, the hall and bring in a number of vendors to actually just show us what options are out there.

517
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:23,634
Like I said, I think it makes the process more efficient, but more, uh, important, it makes the process transparent.

518
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,304
And it promotes civic and community engagement, and it just makes government more accessible to the people.

519
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:39,250
I actually did sit down with a vendor and did a half-hour demo over the phone, and they walked me through the process.

520
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,111
It's pretty impressive.

521
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:44,814
So I think it's, you know, worth an hour to sit down with a vendor and just see how we can improve the process even more.

522
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:47,556
And I'd ask that if you could please schedule a committee of the whole.

523
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:49,277
Thank you, Mr. President.

524
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:51,999
The President Thank you.

525
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:52,439
Citizen — please.

526
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:59,432
Just to, there are a number of towns, surrounding towns that actually use this.

527
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:04,735
Melrose uses it, Somerville uses it, Cambridge, Westwood, and I think Framingham, just to name a few.

528
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:06,376
Some cutting edge places.

529
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:07,217
Absolutely.

530
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:09,599
So I just think it's something that we should definitely look into.

531
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,840
Thank you.

532
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,062
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

533
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,183
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

534
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:21,706
I know we're going to discuss it in the committee of the whole meeting, but what is the price tag on something like this?

535
00:38:23,174 --> 00:38:24,634
It depends what option you go with.

536
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:27,975
And I only talked to one vendor, so I would imagine there's some flexibility to it.

537
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:33,436
So I think if you want, it's, I think, up to maybe like $1,000 a month.

538
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:37,397
But if you add cameras to it, of course, that's more expensive.

539
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:41,018
But that was just one vendor, so I'm sure that's negotiable.

540
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:45,759
But what it does is, I mean, if you want, everything's on camera.

541
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,421
So if you came up from work tonight just saying you wanted to watch the meeting, you get to your house and it's 8 o'clock,

542
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,516
You can actually go back and watch it from the beginning.

543
00:38:55,656 --> 00:38:57,197
You can just watch a slice of the meeting.

544
00:38:57,757 --> 00:38:59,518
You can research through the tool.

545
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:07,262
If you wanted to see all of the resolutions that Councilor Caviello has made since he became a councilor, you can go back and look at all that.

546
00:39:07,702 --> 00:39:10,784
You can search for anything.

547
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:17,127
If you wanted to look at public safety, you could look at every resolution on public safety, and it would pull up all the documents.

548
00:39:17,227 --> 00:39:19,988
So it's a good way for the citizens to be involved.

549
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:24,304
It just provides a lot of transparency to what we do.

550
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:32,526
So if, say, somebody wanted to watch a school committee meeting on a Wednesday, they could just live stream it from their computer at the Monday meeting?

551
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,306
Yeah, absolutely.

552
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:35,326
Oh, that's great.

553
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:36,007
So it's nice.

554
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:37,167
It's all easily accessible.

555
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:40,188
And that's really the big bonus to it all.

556
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:46,009
We don't have to rely on, I know we have some private citizens right now that actually film some of the meetings.

557
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,910
Or actually, they get a disc and put them on YouTube or Facebook.

558
00:39:50,381 --> 00:40:01,034
So we can actually do this, the city should be doing this, and this is something that, this service that we can provide to the community, and it definitely, I think, would help the city clerk as well.

559
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:09,425
So there's a lot of benefits to it, but I think having a vendor come in and actually describe the process of what they do would be beneficial to all of us.

560
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:13,781
Yeah, I mean, we have our meetings only on Tuesday, and then it's replayed once.

561
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:22,587
So you have people in our audience, either committee of the whole meetings or school committee meetings, different board and commission meetings that are actually like typing down, posting on Facebook, everything that's said.

562
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:28,291
So if somebody isn't available on a Tuesday or Thursday to watch a council meeting, they have to rely on Facebook or the paper.

563
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:31,374
So this would be, people always ask, when are the replays?

564
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,235
And if they can't get it, they can't watch a meeting.

565
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:34,636
So this would definitely be.

566
00:40:35,137 --> 00:40:36,578
something I'd be interested in discussing.

567
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:37,498
Absolutely.

568
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:38,479
It's it's real time.

569
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:39,359
It's at your fingertips.

570
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:41,441
So it's a, it's very easily accessible.

571
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,082
Madam vice president.

572
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:55,568
I second the motion on motion for approval by council Falco seconded by vice president Longo current citizen wishes to address us.

573
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:56,489
Good evening.

574
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:57,109
Good evening.

575
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,390
Counsel, please state your name and address for the record.

576
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:03,773
Joe Filione, 59 Garfield Ave and through the chair, I want to thank,

577
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:11,012
Councilor Falco for really one of the best presentations in a long while.

578
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:12,853
This is something that's very much needed.

579
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,615
The Chevalier Theater, when they have board meetings, I'd like to know when.

580
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:23,698
So I go to the clerk's office and there are tons of papers up there.

581
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:31,461
It is very difficult for a citizen who's busy during the day to stop in a city hall and just see the plethora of paperwork up there.

582
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,162
So this is a great thing because

583
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:41,892
It's very important for every citizen to be up to speed on the Chevalier, or on sports, or on any of these things.

584
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:48,736
And I hope, I pray that this honorable council considers the public access issue to go hand-in-hand with this.

585
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:52,898
But again, Councilor Facco, this is a great, great thing, and thank you very much.

586
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:56,680
And thank you, Council Vice President, for your contribution to this.

587
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,484
Good evening.

588
00:42:00,524 --> 00:42:00,885
Welcome.

589
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:02,866
Please state your name and address for the record.

590
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:03,367
Good evening.

591
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:04,668
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

592
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:05,809
I live on Canal Street.

593
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,272
As some people may know, I've done this.

594
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:12,094
I've attempted this previously, and I've not had much success.

595
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:16,617
But as far as if anybody doesn't know, I put all the meetings online on YouTube.

596
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:19,540
But there are a lot of times I miss them, and I have difficulty.

597
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,303
But I'm not really even coming here to argue for or against.

598
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:29,588
I just want to really thank everybody that's kind of taken the initiative, especially when Ed started talking to me about this a few weeks ago on YouTube, John.

599
00:42:30,052 --> 00:42:35,354
Everybody who understands it's incredibly important that we have all these meetings accessible so everybody can know what's going on.

600
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:36,734
Thank you so much, everybody.

601
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:45,437
Oh, and by the way, as somebody who has Irish ancestry, and my beard grows in a little red, I want to say that you all look very well with these shamrocks.

602
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:48,137
Thank you.

603
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:53,179
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Longo Kern.

604
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:54,819
All those in favor?

605
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,360
Aye.

606
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,540
All those opposed?

607
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,020
Congratulations.

608
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,841
The motion is carried.

609
00:42:59,121 --> 00:42:59,461
Very good.

610
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,742
Very good, are the papers in the hand of the clerk on the motion for Councilor Knight?

611
00:43:05,822 --> 00:43:06,603
All those in favor?

612
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:07,623
All those opposed?

613
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:25,632
Offered by Councilor Caviello, 16-315, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate George Turot of Modern Hardware as the recipient of the Chamber of Commerce 2016 Executive Directors Award.

614
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:26,712
Councilor Caviello.

615
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:27,773
Thank you, Mr. President.

616
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,131
I think everybody in this community knows George, a hard-working guy.

617
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:34,312
He's the spokesman for Haynes Square.

618
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,894
And since he's joined our chamber, he's been nothing but a workhorse.

619
00:43:37,934 --> 00:43:46,297
And I want to commend him for being the recipient of the Chamber of Commerce 2016 Executive Director's Award.

620
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,558
And we have a couple of members of the chamber here to support George.

621
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,259
A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

622
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,059
All those in favor?

623
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:54,180
All those opposed?

624
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,840
Motion carries.

625
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,581
16-012, offered by Councilor Caviello.

626
00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:11,697
Be resolved that the Medford City Council have Chief Sacco contact the state police regarding the two pickup trucks, one with a plow and a snowblower that has been parked in the Route 16 lot for over two weeks and have not been moved.

627
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:12,678
Councilor Caviello.

628
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:13,578
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:44:13,598 --> 00:44:21,163
Mr. President, I drive by this lot every day, and these two trucks have been parked there, I may even be lying, over two weeks.

630
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:24,925
I mean, there's a snowblower in the back, one of them, and the other one sits there with a flat tire on there.

631
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:33,316
It isn't just this lot, but other lots we have in the city are now becoming commercial parking lots for a lot of the businesses.

632
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:36,077
But on this one here, these two trucks have been sitting there.

633
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:37,559
They belong to some company.

634
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,302
I don't know when, I don't know what gives them the right just to leave their trucks there for two, three weeks.

635
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:44,944
Say they got a plow on it and just park there.

636
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:52,449
If we can get them out of there, it would be greatly appreciated because many of our businesses in the square are now parking their lot.

637
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:54,850
A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

638
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:55,530
All those in favor?

639
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:56,611
Opposed?

640
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:58,052
Motion carries.

641
00:44:58,072 --> 00:44:59,853
16-313 offered by Councilor Caviello.

642
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:10,980
Be it resolved that the Metro City Council commend and congratulate State Representative Paul J. Donato for being selected as the Democrat of the Year by the Malden Ward and City Committee.

643
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,940
Councilor Caviello.

644
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:12,941
Thank you again, Mr. President.

645
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:22,567
On Saturday, our Representative Donato was honored by the Malden Ward and City Committee as their Democrat of the Year.

646
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:27,203
And I want to commend him for all his good work that he does for both the City of Medford and the City of Malden.

647
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:34,106
On the motion of approval of congratulation of the Right Honorable Paul J. Donato, all those in favor?

648
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:35,346
All those opposed?

649
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:37,347
Motion carries.

650
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,608
16-314, offered by Councilor Caviello.

651
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:48,392
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Pat Thurbridge as the Chamber of Commerce 2016 Citizen of the Year.

652
00:45:48,452 --> 00:45:49,313
Councilor Caviello.

653
00:45:49,353 --> 00:45:50,533
Again, thank you again, Mr. President.

654
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:52,354
I just want to commend Pat

655
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,621
To Burge, he's a hard-working member of the community.

656
00:45:56,661 --> 00:46:08,668
He's a veteran, and I want to thank him, congratulate him on his selection by the other members of the committee for being the 2016 Citizen of the Year.

657
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:11,189
And we hope to see everybody at the banquet.

658
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:12,210
Awesome.

659
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,391
Motion for approval by Councilor Campbell.

660
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:15,071
All those in favor?

661
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:16,432
All those opposed?

662
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:17,153
Motion carries.

663
00:46:17,753 --> 00:46:21,515
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Building Commission provide recommendations

664
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:28,408
to section 94-191 of the city of Medford zoning ordinances for council review.

665
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:29,369
Councillor Knight.

666
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,190
Mr. President, thank you very much.

667
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:40,495
Last week, a gentleman named Mr. Serino from Bradshaw street came before this council and he spoke about a problem that he had relative to adding an additional parking spot at his house.

668
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:44,117
And, um, I did a little bit of research on the subject and if we look at our,

669
00:46:44,891 --> 00:46:46,372
Zoning ordinances, Mr. President.

670
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:52,195
In division three, we have parking and loading, section 94-191, general parking and loading requirements.

671
00:46:53,075 --> 00:47:03,141
It is the intent of this division to reduce congestion in the streets and to contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for standing and storing of off-street motor vehicles associated with any use of land.

672
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:14,347
Continue on, Mr. President, through that division, and what we'll find is that under section three, parking spaces not enclosed in a structure may be provided anywhere on the lot except in an inner court

673
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:20,698
except that no parking may be provided within the required front yards in sf1, sf2, and gr districts.

674
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:30,145
Sf1, sf2, and gr districts, Mr. President, require maybe 15 feet of footage, frontage, at each home, Mr. President.

675
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:40,053
So in my discussions with Mr. Bavuso and Mr. Moki, they said that this has been one of the most voluminous requests that they've received in their office.

676
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:43,896
More often than not, people are coming down that say they'd like to add a parking spot, but they're not able to.

677
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,441
because the local zoning ordinance is prohibited.

678
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:59,005
So in an effort to see if we can alleviate some of the congestion in our city streets and provide more off-street parking, I'd suggest that the building department provide us with recommendations to amend our zoning ordinance in this regard, Mr. President.

679
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:00,486
So they're the experts.

680
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:06,668
They understand what would be best in terms of frontage and rearage and so on and so forth.

681
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:12,850
But I think this is a step in the right direction to ensure that residents in the community have ample parking on their streets.

682
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:15,518
and in their, on their properties.

683
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:17,079
And I would move for approval.

684
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,421
On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight.

685
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:20,982
All those in favor?

686
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:22,643
All those opposed?

687
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:23,444
Motion carries.

688
00:48:23,764 --> 00:48:29,128
By Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the sidewalk across from, is it Panera?

689
00:48:29,828 --> 00:48:36,353
Panera on Middlesex Avenue be, that's Riverside Avenue, no?

690
00:48:37,613 --> 00:48:38,074
Riverside.

691
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:41,216
Riverside Avenue.

692
00:48:42,413 --> 00:48:43,073
be discussed.

693
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:43,874
Council Mars.

694
00:48:44,734 --> 00:48:45,675
Thank you, Mr. President.

695
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:55,020
Um, uh, a few years back, we were approached by the owners of, uh, Panera and smash burger and noodles, uh, regarding a common vigilance license.

696
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,603
And at the time, uh, we put some stipulations on, uh, their particular permit.

697
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:05,466
And one of them, uh, we put one on the drive through and a number of other things.

698
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:11,069
Um, but one of them was that they were going to improve the sidewalks across from

699
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,460
their business.

700
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:32,048
And they agreed to do the sidewalk across from their establishment on the opposite side of Riverside Ave from, I believe, the length of the Christie's Market on down to the gas station and also the crosswalk to have that repainted.

701
00:49:32,688 --> 00:49:35,609
And to date, we haven't seen any action on that sidewalk.

702
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:37,249
It's in very poor condition.

703
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,251
A lot of people catch the bus up by the gas station

704
00:49:42,079 --> 00:50:03,798
And now that that area is highly traveled, I would ask that they keep up with their commitment to the city and based on the Community Development Board and also the council vote that they be asked if and when, not if, when the work on the sidewalk will take place across from Panera, Mr. President.

705
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:05,960
So I put in a request before.

706
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,021
I don't think we got an answer.

707
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:08,943
So this is a second request.

708
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:25,188
They were also supposed to do, if I remember correctly, Councillor, some cleanup of the paving in that whole quadrant there, up to the Felsway, to clean up that roadway, because it's awful uneven.

709
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:39,073
And also, if I remember correctly, there was attached to all the approvals, we had a provision that there was supposed to be painted in there, one of those big Xs, so that the

710
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:46,817
grid isn't, gridlock isn't created at the entrance and egress of that parking lot.

711
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:47,777
I'm not sure.

712
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,837
Was the city going to do that or were they going to do that?

713
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:55,999
I thought the city was going to undertake that, but we can also ask that as a secondary, because you're right.

714
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:58,359
Cars are now stopping.

715
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:02,841
The people that are gracious enough are stopping and allowing traffic to come in and out.

716
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:08,222
But someone that lives in the area, I can tell you that's gridlock around the clock in that particular area.

717
00:51:09,293 --> 00:51:10,434
go in and out of that entrance.

718
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,757
So I would ask that be added, Mr. President.

719
00:51:13,817 --> 00:51:14,178
Very good.

720
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,840
So on the motion approved by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

721
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:18,381
All those opposed?

722
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:20,744
Carries.

723
00:51:21,765 --> 00:51:22,585
We've done everything.

724
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:27,450
The records of the meeting of March 18th, 2016 will pass to Councilor Knight.

725
00:51:28,511 --> 00:51:30,893
Councilor, Madam Vice President.

726
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:32,374
If I could just ask,

727
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:40,438
the council could vote to approve just a request of the mayor to work with waste management for a spring cleanup.

728
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:58,387
Residents have been asking if there's a day where they can put out extra rubbish, spring cleaning from their homes, just a one day pickup where they won't have to call bulk mail if it's a large item and waste management can come and collect everything for the entire city.

729
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:00,188
On the motion of approval,

730
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:23,153
for under suspension offered by Vice President Longo Kern that the mayor reach out to waste management to request a scheduled spring cleanup day so people can clean out their houses, get rid of all their junk, and also we begin our yard waste effort in that period of time.

731
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:27,434
So on the motion for approval by Vice President Longo Kern, all those in favor?

732
00:52:28,035 --> 00:52:28,175
Aye.

733
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,175
All those opposed?

734
00:52:30,066 --> 00:52:31,487
One more thing while we're under suspension.

735
00:52:31,587 --> 00:52:34,248
One more thing while we're under suspension, Madam Vice President.

736
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:35,128
Just an announcement.

737
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:39,590
There is a road race in Medford at the Elks on Sunday the 20th.

738
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,750
It's the leprechaun run.

739
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:42,791
It's at 11 AM.

740
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:46,432
All are welcome, and all proceeds benefit the Children's Hospital.

741
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:47,993
So I just wanted to make that announcement.

742
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:48,673
It's a great event.

743
00:52:50,274 --> 00:52:54,175
500, 600, 700 people attend and run, whether it's raining or snowing.

744
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:54,535
It's a 5K.

745
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,985
Mr. President, I'll be driving the lead car.

746
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,306
Councillor Caviello will be driving.

747
00:53:02,386 --> 00:53:04,487
I'll be driving the little green car to lead the pack.

748
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,969
Councillor Scott Pelley will be observing.

749
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:08,709
Mr. Scott Pelley, he can drive with me.

750
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,850
Yeah, it's a great event.

751
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:10,790
Great event.

752
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:12,971
Stew and a green beer after.

753
00:53:14,352 --> 00:53:14,672
Thank you.

754
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:15,693
Awesome.

755
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:18,034
Councillor Falco.

756
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,354
Thank you, Mr. President.

757
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:24,437
If I just may announce really quick that Method Italy registration for this year is

758
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:32,266
Let's see, it's open for children born between May 1st, 2003 and August 31st, 2012.

759
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:46,915
Let's see, tryouts and dates will run between March 19th and 27th at Tufts University and for players born between 4th, 30th, 2007 who are interested in playing in the majors in minor leagues.

760
00:53:49,237 --> 00:53:51,298

Sunday, March 20th, tryouts 8 to 10 for double A and triple A players.

765
00:54:05,864 --> 00:54:08,566

Who was that?

776
00:54:38,122 --> 00:54:38,622
Bill who?

777
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:40,942
Bill O'Keefe.

778
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,143
There he is.

779
00:54:42,983 --> 00:54:43,383
Thank you.

780
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:48,585
Records of the meeting of March 8th, 2016 were passed to Councilor Knight.

781
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:50,245
Mr. Councilor, how did you find them?

782
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,908
Mr. President, I've had the opportunity to review the records.

783
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:54,429
I find them in order and move for approval.

784
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:58,691
On the motion for approval of the records of last week's meeting, all those in favor?

785
00:54:59,091 --> 00:54:59,811
All those opposed?

786
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:00,452
Motion carries.

787
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:01,392
Counsel, Kaviello.

788
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:06,074
Mr. President, if I could wish everybody in the audience and at home, happy St.

789
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:06,575
Patrick's Day.

790
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:07,495
Aaron, go brown.

791
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:11,597
And I want to thank Mr. Rumley for our incarnations this evening.

792
