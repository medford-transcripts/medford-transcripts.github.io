Okay, so the first item tonight is a public hearing for 200 Mr. Gabb, special permit to establish a motor vehicle wash. The applicant is requesting a continuous October 30, 2024 meeting because this is a public hearing.

I need to open the public hearing and read the public hearing notice before it can be continued. The Memphis Community Development Board shall conduct the public hearing on October 9th, 2024, after 6.30 p.m. via Zoom relative to an application by New York Capital Investment Group, LLC, for a special permit for a motor vehicle wash with an enclosed structure located in the commercial two zone at 200 Mystic Avenue, Medford Mass, 02155.

00:02:46,064 --> 00:03:12,862
Now that I've read the public hearing, I am going to ask for a roll call vote to do a motion. Actually, I will ask for the motion first. It continues on October 30th, and then we'll do it by roll call vote. Anyone want to give a motion? I have a motion to continue the 30th. A second? I second that motion. Awesome.
