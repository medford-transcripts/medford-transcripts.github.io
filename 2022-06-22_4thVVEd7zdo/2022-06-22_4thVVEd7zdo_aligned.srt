1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:09,189
I'd be happy to go over the, you know, the Department of Ed's superintendent review process that we follow.

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,652
Sure, that'd be great.

3
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:11,353
Thank you, Member Russo.

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:34,761
Okay, so the school all school committees are required to perform an annual review of the superintendent which is our sole employee as a school committee, and the state has over the last four years has changed, three times now, the evaluation system, the original system when I first joined was a.

5
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:41,867
shockingly long and tedious system that, frankly, I can't believe it was ever allowed to go.

6
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:51,115
But anyway, so they revamped it considerably in the second year I was in office, which was four years ago, three years ago, whatever it was.

7
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:52,696
And then again, last

8
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:59,499
year or the year before at the end of the year, they may get another major update.

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,243
So we have changed our form that we use to match the state.

10
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:15,910
They provide a long list of, well, a less awfully long list of categories that we have to evaluate the superintendent.

11
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,332
Generally, at the highest level, there's really four measures.

12
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,933
There's the instructional leadership,

13
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:26,974
There's five subcategories within that.

14
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:30,796
There's management and operations, and there are five categories within that.

15
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:39,041
There's engagement, which used to be called family engagement, and frankly is, I think, mostly still, that's what it means.

16
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,662
There are four categories within that.

17
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:45,965
And then the fourth item is professional culture, which has six items.

18
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:51,227
In the last update, this will be the first time we're doing this part of the evaluation.

19
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,430
They also added the superintendent performance goals and while we've had those I think for four years.

20
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:03,013
They were not included in the actual review until about a year and a half ago.

21
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:07,999
Unfortunately, the state also doesn't seem to think it's important to tell us when they make updates.

22
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:17,823
So that was a bit of a surprise this year that there was some updates that caused us to have to kind of run around and what caused me to have to run around and update all of our forms.

23
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:22,945
So that's the high level, what the evaluation system looks like.

24
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:28,647
There are very long documents that the state provides as well as our professional association on

25
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:39,897
But on the evaluation system recommendations on how to proceed there's procedural steps as to when things happen and who does them, etc.

26
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,460
Many, they're all recommendations.

27
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:46,724
And because school committees very dramatically in.

28
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:53,928
size as well as, you know, there's regional school committees with a lot of members.

29
00:02:54,428 --> 00:03:00,230
There are smaller towns that have, I believe, as small as three school committee members, but I only know of those that have five.

30
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,612
So that there's just an enormous amount of variation in what a school committee looks like.

31
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,473
So the guidance is rather broad.

32
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:16,737
The other thing that is important to note is that each school committee member provides their own evaluation to

33
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:38,533
a third party, which, you know, sometimes it's the secretary for the school committee, if there's a, I'm the secretary for the school committee, but in like, for instance, in Cambridge, the school committee has an actual administrative assistant, I forget their exact title, who's an employee of the school committee in addition to the superintendent and does not work for the superintendent.

34
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:44,875
So in that case, the individual members send their evaluations to their executive assistant.

35
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:57,184
Most school committees appear to choose a member of the school committee to serve in the role of taking evaluations because individual members do not evaluate the school committee.

36
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:00,227
We actually sit and do it, but that's not the evaluation.

37
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:07,893
The evaluation, just like all other work products that come out of the school committee, are based on a four vote majority or it didn't happen.

38
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:35,749
So we each do our own personal evaluations and we put them in a pile and somebody, and in this case it's for Medford, it's the secretary of the school committee, compiles them, averages the numbers, takes the language feedback and actually tries to make it not sound too much like Melanie wrote it or Paul wrote it or try to make it sound like it's the voice of the school committee as well as to remove any duplication.

39
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,190
Sometimes

40
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,831
you know, all the members will say the exact same statement.

41
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,432
Well, nobody wants to see seven of the same statements written into a review.

42
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:47,713
So because the review is the review of the school committee, not the individual members.

43
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:51,213
So is there more that I should say?

44
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:51,774
I don't know.

45
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:52,574
I said a lot.

46
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:56,875
I think that's good.

47
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:57,735
Member McLaughlin.

48
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,476
Yes, thank you.

49
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,197
That was really helpful.

50
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:06,820
I don't know if that's what Member Russo was thinking of from the macro perspective.

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,442
I think that's super helpful for the process perspective.

52
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:18,407
From the macro perspective, what I was thinking about was more specific to the superintendent and to the last year that we've all been through.

53
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:24,870
So I just wanted to say it's been four years now that the superintendent's been with us.

54
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:29,003
I was actually on the superintendent hiring committee.

55
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:34,085
So I got to meet Dr. Edward Vincent back then during the interviews.

56
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,906
So that was interesting to see the process and now being able to work together and collaborate.

57
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:52,531
But I guess I just also want, or, and I guess I just also want to point out that it's been four years that Dr. Evey's been with us and two and a half of those years have been a global pandemic and a racial reckoning in our country.

58
00:05:53,276 --> 00:06:08,877
And so these have been really trying and very difficult times for everyone, and I want to make sure that we really appreciate that from the, from the start, because in addition to that, I want to point out, as I'm sure we know, but I wonder if the community knows,

59
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:25,242
that Dr. Edward Vincent came in four years ago to a system that had been primarily a patriarchal system, frankly, and had been run for 30 years for the most part by another administrator.

60
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:33,287
So all of that, I mean, imagine coming into any system as a new person taking over a position that had been filled for 30 years

61
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:35,569
and run a certain way.

62
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,332
And again, during a pandemic and a racial reckoning.

63
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:45,097
So I would just like to start that macro macro view for the for myself and for the community.

64
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:58,687
And then I would just welcome my colleagues to sort of offer a macro comment if they have any, just sort of big picture idea of like what this past year encompassed and coming back to school from a pandemic, you know, from remote, those sorts of things.

65
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,349
So that's all I wanted to say.

66
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:00,729
Thank you.

67
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:02,702
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

68
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:24,406
I think just to piggyback on that a bit too, from what we experienced as parents, as elected officials, prior to Dr. Edward Vincent coming on, I think was, and I'm gonna actually spin to the positive.

69
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:28,527
I think the last four, especially the last two and a half years,

70
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:33,888
the communication and the transparency have just been pretty great.

71
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:53,814
Having a superintendent that emails all parents every week with updates in multiple languages is just really such an amazing thing to have as a parent and something I just want to acknowledge as a school committee member.

72
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:17,122
Because I don't ever remember that that happening before and I think it trickles down I think that some of our principals have learned and grown from that and I know like specifically I will, you know, throw some of the administrators, some of my daughter goes to the glen some of Mr two G's updates and messaging on certain things and.

73
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:32,746
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent is always not only doing the same but she's very responsive when I'll say hey this is great messaging I wish all the principal would would deliver a message like this, what happens like hours later, it just gets done.

74
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:37,307
It speaks to the transparency and the communication, which I believe is great.

75
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:48,572
And I also think, you know, whenever I have emails or questions for the superintendent, very responsive, always willing to give a phone call to, I'm sure, every member.

76
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:52,334
And I just think that's also a great quality.

77
00:08:52,394 --> 00:09:00,398
So just on the higher level, I wanted to piggyback on what you said, Member McLaughlin, to give a brief statement of some great things that are being done.

78
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:04,765
and Democrats.

79
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,972
Yes, I'll make a macro statement.

80
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,575
I wanna thank Dr. Edward-Vincent for her leadership.

81
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:21,720
She supports all students, teachers, reading her goals and evaluation that her pre-evaluation.

82
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:29,726
She's been to school events, community events, many, many meetings.

83
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:33,388
She's, you know, she provides the, you know,

84
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:43,740
you know, the weekly bulletin update every week, sharing the news, and, you know, just piggyback on what the mayor said and what Melanie said.

85
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:53,952
It's, you know, she spends all of her time dedicated to the Medford Public Schools, the needs of the students, the community, the families,

86
00:09:54,712 --> 00:10:09,027
And she's responsive to the school committee members and our requests and our needs and at all hours of the day and she just she works tirelessly and so I just wanted to, you know, share that and I've, you know, was on the.

87
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:23,018
I was on the superintendent search as well, you know, as a school committee member, and we, you know, got to meet superintendent Dr. Robinson at that time and just got to know her very, very well.

88
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:28,880
And it's like we're a close family, everybody, the committee, the administration, the superintendent.

89
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,562
And I just want to thank her for her dedication and her leadership.

90
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,498
Thank you, member Kratz.

91
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:54,664
Do we want to go through the four categories and instructional leadership?

92
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:55,924
Member Hayes has her hand up, ma'am.

93
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:56,264
Oh, I'm sorry.

94
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:56,844
Member Hayes.

95
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,545
Hi, thanks.

96
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:03,387
I just wanted to say, too, given this is my first time going through the evaluation,

97
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:21,900
It was difficult, I have to say, because there are, even though I understand from Member Rousseau that it's been actually streamlined by DESE, there still were 20 indicators that we needed to give an evaluation on or give some kind of feedback on.

98
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:30,563
And looking back at some of the information from DESE, I think as we move forward, I know Member Graham has kind of started us on the path

99
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:37,064
updating this process to more closely match what DESE has.

100
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:51,718
According to DESE, we should be choosing like six to eight of focus indicators that we would really be doing our evaluation on, which I think makes a lot more sense in terms of helping us as a school committee and also helping

101
00:11:52,072 --> 00:12:00,439
the superintendent kind of focus on what our main goals are, even though, of course, she's always and we're always looking at the whole picture.

102
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:16,892
You know, I think, I think as as member McLaughlin said, I think that when the new superintendent came in, I think there was hope for or expectation and possibly unrealistic, definitely unrealistic expectation of

103
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:25,668
instant change and we're excited, we're going to make all these changes and kind of update a lot of policies, update a lot of curriculum, just everything.

104
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:43,756
And not only I think was it probably the timeline that people were hoping for, unrealistic anyway, but then you throw in the pandemic and you know, the focus shifted and it had to shift and we're really still coming out of that.

105
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:44,657
So,

106
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,163
I wanted to make that point.

107
00:12:47,183 --> 00:13:02,975
And also just to make the point that I think anytime you do an evaluation of anyone, unfortunately, I think often you go towards the, I don't want to say negative, but you go to where there could be improvement.

108
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:13,283
And it's also, you know, there's a lot of, I went through and made a list for myself of just all the things that have happened just this year, all the things that Superintendent has done.

109
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,944
And there's a lot.

110
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:15,914
a lot.

111
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:32,322
And so I want to make sure that at least I want to make clear from my point of view, when I talk about areas where I see improvement, that we can make improvement or make growth, I don't see that as deficiencies so much as we're always going to have areas of growth.

112
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,304
I mean, hopefully we're always striving for more.

113
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:43,208
So I, you know, when we start talking about where we see areas that we could improve, it's, you know, a district improvement, it's certainly

114
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:47,045
Also because the superintendent represents the district.

115
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:57,749
It's improvements that we see are asking her to implement, but I just wanna, again, like I said, that idea of areas of growth and improvement versus deficiencies.

116
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:06,151
So that's where my head is at in terms of the evaluation and the comments I made, and just wanted to say that.

117
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:06,732
Thank you.

118
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:11,053
Thank you, member Hayes.

119
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:15,982
And member herself.

120
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:23,690
Do you want me to get to read the review descriptions and all that stuff right now?

121
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:24,591
That'd be great.

122
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:24,932
Thank you.

123
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:25,893
Sure.

124
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:26,493
So,

125
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:37,156
The being that is from DESE, they of course have more than one scoring system within a single review, because why not?

126
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:50,766
So in the first top section, which is superintendent performance goals, which is on a scale of one to five, there is one is did not meet, two is some progress, three is significant progress, four is met and five is exceeded.

127
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:52,227
And

128
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:58,912
There's some wiggle room as to how many performance goals Superintendent can have.

129
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,099
I think there's a minimum of three.

130
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,351
I think, I can't remember the full description.

131
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:07,912
Superintendent had four.

132
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:21,600
The first one was elementary literacy, which is assessing early literacy skills and implementing interventions in literacy to improve outcomes by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of early literacy skills.

133
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,502
This is considered the student learning goal.

134
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:26,363
There's three categories.

135
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:30,226
And the two focus indicators for this goal

136
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:40,012
were elementary literacy and elementary mathematics, and the score, the average score was 3.69, which is

137
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,351
3.69, right?

138
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,653
You know, that's what it is out of five.

139
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:57,060
And Mayor, I'm not sure if we, do we want to read all of the, you've seen how many comments there are.

140
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,584
I don't think there's so many that we couldn't read them, but I also don't want to just make the meeting longer than it needs to be.

141
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,525
So it's up to you.

142
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:11,412
I don't know how many comments there are, so I'll take your lead.

143
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:24,041
Okay, well, why don't I read them at least for the superintendent performance goals, and then we'll see where we are in time and move into the... Member McLaughlin.

144
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:25,102
Thank you.

145
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:35,872
I was just going to ask maybe if we, I want to ask my colleagues, I don't know, do you want to read the performance goals first, and then we can comment if we want to after the performance goals, or did you want to do that?

146
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:44,147
one by one in comment, or I'm wondering sort of what, again, back to process, what my colleagues are thinking.

147
00:16:44,707 --> 00:17:00,315
I'm fine with doing the four performance goals and then an opportunity for comments or questions, if that's okay with you, Mayor and colleagues, I don't know, or did people wanna stop on each one?

148
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:02,016
That's what I'm trying to figure out, thank you.

149
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:09,966
I think we can either ask questions as you have them or stop after each larger section.

150
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,987
Member Rizzo?

151
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:20,771
Yeah, I mean, I certainly think... I mean, the opportunity for the school community to provide their feedback was what we've just completed.

152
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:22,091
So, I mean, I...

153
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:33,609
We don't have, in my mind, we don't have anywhere near enough time for us to each be providing our feedback on each of the 20 something items here.

154
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:42,295
That was, I mean, and we received lots of feedback, which was integrated into the document.

155
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,477
So we have one hour.

156
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:51,221
We're not gonna get even into the performance standards if we each speak on our feedback on each of these.

157
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:51,962
I think that's why.

158
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:57,165
we're supposed to put it into the form and submit it ahead of time.

159
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,366
Yeah, just a point of clarification.

160
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:01,147
That's not what I'm asking, through the chair.

161
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:02,367
So that's not what I'm asking.

162
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:07,230
I'm just asking if we have questions when you want them, or comments when you want them.

163
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,912
So if you want to do it after each segment, that's fine, but not on our individual comments.

164
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:12,973
Thank you.

165
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:13,233
Sure.

166
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:16,494
Yeah, after each segment, after each five, set of five.

167
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:17,795
Thank you.

168
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:29,750
So the first one, which was the elementary literacy, the comments from the committee were as follows, multiple families continue to express concerns regarding interventions and literacy, especially related to dyslexia.

169
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,751
They feel disenfranchised by principals and teachers.

170
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:39,693
They also feel they are, there are not enough reading specialists nor enough certified specialists.

171
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,240
to meet any of their children, to meet many of their children's needs.

172
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,926
Multiple families have shared concerns at the administrative level regarding this matter, but continue to feel concerns have not been adequately addressed.

173
00:18:53,147 --> 00:19:03,275
Additionally, we have under Dr. Edwards' instance leadership, the district has implemented continuing in-depth professional development and literacy for teachers K-2, assessments, NWEA map,

174
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:13,683
and programs at Cree and K-2 to improve and enhance our students' literacy skills and our district's literacy outcomes, all while still dealing with ongoing impacts of the COVID pandemic.

175
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:17,666
This has been a tremendous endeavor for teachers, principals, and administrators.

176
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:29,895
At this time, data regarding the impact of these initiatives on learning outcomes and how teachers are using assessment results to inform their teaching has not yet been presented.

177
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:52,174
I'm wondering if we also do we want to hear from the superintendent as we go I don't know how the superintendent feels about that, but it's just real I just realized we're doing a lot of talking, I'm especially doing a lot of talking you are not hearing from the superintendent at all, which I just keep.

178
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:56,379
Yeah, why don't you keep keep reading and definitely have superintendent

179
00:19:56,892 --> 00:20:00,893
speak anytime she feels necessary or anytime a question is addressed.

180
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:02,554
May I make a suggestion?

181
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,154
Yes.

182
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:09,476
Also, just, you know, again, so we're not hearing the same, but it also feels more collaborative.

183
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:13,137
Perhaps we could take sections or take turns reading the comments so that

184
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:19,551
It's not just all coming from one member in terms of the comments.

185
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,913
So I just put that out there as well.

186
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:30,720
I'm happy to do some of the reading or if any of the other colleagues want to, but I think that would make it feel a little less monotonous perhaps.

187
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,722
So I would just make that recommendation.

188
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:33,662
Okay.

189
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:40,628
So we'll just, member McLaughlin, maybe you can take the second section for us and then whoever else wants to volunteer.

190
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,530
members.

191
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:50,772
Oh, I'll finish the performance goals.

192
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:51,832
Okay.

193
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,033
Second performance goal is the professional practice goal.

194
00:20:56,093 --> 00:21:06,236
And that is to develop skills in strategy development, data analysis and instructional leadership by completing the fourth extension year of the new superintendent induction program.

195
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,857
There were two focus indicators the new

196
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,978
There was one, it's just a crap, sorry.

197
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:15,180
New Superintendent Induction Program is the focus indicator.

198
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,343
And the score for that was 3.96, and the comments on that.

199
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:25,284
I'm glad to see the induction program is complete.

200
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:31,227
More information about data analysis and how this is being used for strategic development and instructional leadership would be welcomed.

201
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:36,450
Dr. Edward Vincent demonstrates a substantial commitment to continued professional development

202
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,305
and continued improvement in her role as superintendent.

203
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:53,470
I hope to hear more about her learning in the induction program, about how the learning in the induction program has impacted her understanding of her role and actions she has taken in the areas of strategy development, data analysis and instructional leadership as a result.

204
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:58,332
Would somebody like to take the district wide focus on instruction and assessment?

205
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:00,633
I can breathe.

206
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:02,374
I can do it.

207
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:09,714
Developing a district wide focus on instruction and assessment.

208
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:22,918
So the overall score was a 3.69 and comments were would like to see more on differentiated instruction and universal design for learning to include all learners.

209
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:30,983
We could benefit from the expertise of special educators working with general educators to create a library of sorts of differentiated material instruction.

210
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:36,166
Don't feel the learning walks are as inclusive of all communities as they could be.

211
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:42,629
Also wondering how the curriculum frameworks are being met in classrooms like access classrooms and out of district programs.

212
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:48,672
The superintendent evaluation primarily mentioned professional development as a means of achieving this goal.

213
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:50,833
However, professional development

214
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,154
is a short duration activity.

215
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:58,037
We need to see data and accountability on how these professional development topics are actually put into practice.

216
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:04,541
Mention of the monthly coherent practice with principals, but not of how those leaders that incorporated that learning into their schools.

217
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:07,903
If there's data on this, the school committee would welcome it.

218
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,347
I can read the next one if you want.

219
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:19,430
Thank you, Member Grasshofer.

220
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:20,396
Okay.

221
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:26,181
Maintaining a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity, and consistency.

222
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:27,482
The score was 3.77.

223
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:31,906
There has been some progress and we have much work to do.

224
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:34,769
Equity is perhaps our biggest need to address.

225
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:39,232
Creating a strategic plan or goal around just this issue would be helpful.

226
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,955
Defining equity would be a good start.

227
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,914
Members, oh, sorry.

228
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,435
Dr. Maurice, Dr. Edward-Vincent?

229
00:23:54,316 --> 00:24:06,726
Yes, I wanted to ask for a little more clarification on the feedback for developing a district-wide focus on instruction and assessment.

230
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,450
I was just hoping that the committee could tell me more about that.

231
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:15,533
And like, what would it look like?

232
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:23,746
Member McLaughlin?

233
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,128
Sure, thank you.

234
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:46,528
I think that in some of this, it would look like general education collaborating with special education and others, so that I know that there's some levels where there's co-teaching happening in some of the classrooms, but not across the district as a whole substantially.

235
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,569
And for example, I know

236
00:24:48,385 --> 00:25:08,240
Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen had worked collaboratively with other teachers on differentiated programming and creating a library that's available on our website for some lesson planning that's differentiated, but I'm not sure or it's unclear what's been done in terms of PD for universal design for learning and how that's actually being incorporated into the classrooms.

237
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,222
And then in the learning walk, sort of, you know, looking at

238
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:17,348
the curriculum frameworks and how they're being used across the district and also in other districts.

239
00:25:17,388 --> 00:25:32,855
So for example, we know we have certain curriculum at certain levels, so elementary, middle school, high school sort of curriculums, but is it the same curriculum that is being used in the special education classrooms?

240
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:34,996
If so, how are they being differentiated?

241
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:38,598
If not, what is the curriculum and how does the superintendent know what the curriculum is?

242
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:50,221
whether we're having high standards for all children, even children that potentially are taking MCAS ALT and don't affect our data scoring.

243
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:58,608
Personally, I think that that could look like curriculum meetings with special education and looking at as a whole.

244
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:01,411
We also have as a responsibility as a district, I understand,

245
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:14,061
Or I've recently understood that we are required to look at curriculum, particularly for our collaborative, and seeing what our collaborative partnerships are in terms of curriculum.

246
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:19,746
That's part of the school committee's responsibility with DESE, from what I understand, but also the superintendent.

247
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:28,473
So I guess I would venture to say, can the superintendent say clearly what curriculum, if any, is being used in these other classrooms?

248
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,731
how curriculum is being differentiated for all learners.

249
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:41,374
Again, students with learning differences, but also, you know, students at all different levels, project based learning, what have you, and what that looks like in a variety of programming.

250
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:45,235
So, you know, from the access classroom to the connections to the EL classrooms to

251
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:46,935
to our out of district programs?

252
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:52,557
Do we know what the curriculum is and how are we sort of trying to make sure that we have high standards for all?

253
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:54,438
So again, what would that look like?

254
00:26:54,478 --> 00:27:01,420
I think it would be, again, learning walks through those environments and also working with your directors in those examples.

255
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:13,403
So your directors of our collaborative, your directors of our special education, your directors of our EL and looking at how is the curriculum really manifesting across those different strands in terms of really embedding equity.

256
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,845
and those in having high expectations for everyone.

257
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:17,446
So I hope that was helpful.

258
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:19,288
Thank you.

259
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:20,649
It was helpful.

260
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:22,991
Mayor?

261
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,472
Member Graham?

262
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:26,233
Can you hear me okay?

263
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:27,194
Yes.

264
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:28,575
Okay.

265
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:31,898
I am having some internet

266
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:35,590
challenges today, which is why I'm on multiple devices here.

267
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:49,625
I wanted to comment on the comments about PD and how that fits in in terms of, and I think sometimes the question is like, how can we observe

268
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:51,768
that this is happening.

269
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:54,049
And I think PD is a good example.

270
00:27:54,189 --> 00:28:03,251
So, you know, we get a laundry list essentially when PD is conducted of, you know, oodles of topics being offered.

271
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:08,732
What we don't ever see is how many people attended each topic.

272
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:15,754
If there were ones that were mandatory, like what was our compliance percentage?

273
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:20,375
And as importantly, like, I think we've seen at times information about like,

274
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:31,578
what did the smile sheet say essentially, which is like, what did the learner say immediately after class about whether they liked it or not, which is why it's called a smile sheet.

275
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:43,341
But I think from an outcomes perspective, like what we don't see is based on the PD, what are we expecting to happen?

276
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,601
And how can we,

277
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,142
see that actually happening.

278
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:59,631
So, and I think, you know, we hear criticisms from the teachers all the time about meaningful PD and wanting more meaningful PD.

279
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:07,258
And I think one facet of that question is like, what is the application

280
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:15,025
immediately in a month, in two months, in three months that we're expecting.

281
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:17,787
And then can we measure that?

282
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,307
Are we seeing that happen?

283
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:33,453
That to me is information that I think would help the school committee and certainly the community understand like we're having these PD days and this is what's happening in them, which is good.

284
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:37,935
That's like good reporting and accounting of the facts, but then how did,

285
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:40,408
How was that investment

286
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:42,853
realized in practice.

287
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:46,574
So what is it that we're expecting to see?

288
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:51,216
And more importantly, did we see it when we expected to see it?

289
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:57,818
And I think, you know, when you talk about evaluating adult learning programs, those are the kinds of measures you wanna be talking about.

290
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:09,061
I'm not a huge fan of going all the way to the like level five ROI extreme, because I think that's like requires a level of,

291
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:12,462
uh, machinery that we don't have.

292
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:33,510
And honestly, um, it has limited use, but I think there are like, is this being integrated into the job kinds of measures, outcomes, expectations, et cetera, that would help us understand beyond like the fact that we offered 40 things on the professional development day.

293
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,612
What, what did we see in the aftermath of those 40 things?

294
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:47,975
Thank you member Graham.

295
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,759
So, I just wanted to ask member Graham.

296
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,925
So where you were talking about.

297
00:30:55,747 --> 00:31:12,798
Would you recommend, are you, are you saying that you're recommending that we reduce the number of professional development opportunities because we do the smiley sheets we do try to get feedback in real time, but also sometimes I think it depends on

298
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:17,661
the content of what they're receiving professional development in.

299
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:30,148
So, for example, this year, when we launched the new math program, the teachers will be receiving professional development in how to use

300
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:32,153
this math programming.

301
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:37,415
So over the course of the year, we'll be able to see, you know, their level of comfort.

302
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:46,537
It's going to take time because it's completely new content, but all elementary teachers will be participating in that professional development.

303
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:50,639
So I just wish, just as I'm jotting some notes, I'm just trying to

304
00:31:52,239 --> 00:32:12,252
find out if you're suggesting that as we do the professional development and have teachers provide feedback on the quality of professional development, the accountability piece of seeing whether or not the professional development is actually taking place.

305
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:19,659
that would have to happen based on classroom observations and how the students are performing.

306
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,862
Are they grasping the content or not?

307
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,826
And so I don't know if it's something like that.

308
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:30,990
So I just was going to ask you for a little more specificity if possible.

309
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,331
Sure.

310
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:36,415
So I'm not in any way suggesting less professional development.

311
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,613
quite, quite the opposite, actually.

312
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:49,236
But what I am suggesting is that, you know, we can't, like, we can't, we don't know, like, if you offered 40 things, right?

313
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:49,316
Yes.

314
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:57,379
On a professional development day, like, is there something that is mandatory?

315
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,959
I think usually the answer is yes.

316
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,020
And if it's mandatory, like, what was the compliance rate?

317
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,841
Like, how many people participated in the class?

318
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:07,282
And are we like,

319
00:33:08,597 --> 00:33:11,781
Are we making mandatory the things that we truly believe are mandatory.

320
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:27,539
But, and I, and I think then there's like the more elective side of the house right with which I love because it gives all our teachers an opportunity to say, this is the thing that I'm dealing with in my specific classroom and so I'm going to go to that I love that idea.

321
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:36,379
which I think makes, because we have such a broad offering, it does make it harder to quantify our outcomes everywhere.

322
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:46,189
But I do think quantifying our outcomes somewhere in the process for some portions of the PD would be really valuable.

323
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:50,933
And I would honestly start with the things that we think of as requirements.

324
00:33:52,562 --> 00:34:07,768
Are they effective and and finding out if they're effective could be about classroom observations, it could be about querying staff 30 1690 days out like there's a variety of ways to be able to check in and say.

325
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:27,072
like this was in fact a good investment because the last thing we want is for to bring in a facilitator who is going to like help with the new math curriculum that basically 30 days out all the teachers say you know what that did not prepare me for what I did in the last 30 days.

326
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:38,455
I think we want to know that because we wouldn't want to do that again and I don't feel I feel like right now that information sort of anecdotal at best and certainly not information that comes to the school committee.

327
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:40,374
Okay.

328
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:41,635
Thank you for that.

329
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:45,539
Thank you.

330
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,400
Member Russo?

331
00:34:55,407 --> 00:34:56,167
You're muted, Paul.

332
00:34:58,649 --> 00:34:59,390
Whatever I was saying.

333
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,504
Thank you.

334
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:08,607
Whether or not there's less PD or not, it's not the size of the pile, it's what's in the pile that matters.

335
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:13,591
We have the same conversation around the testing we do of students.

336
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:21,596
We want to get rid of testing that's duplicative or not serving to do anything other than take up more days of

337
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:25,346
taking away instruction to sit and do testing.

338
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:27,247
For me, it's the same idea.

339
00:35:28,288 --> 00:35:42,616
And we did put into our policy last year on annual reports and presentations that we would get an annual report that includes, I think, all the items that Member Graham just said, whether it was mandatory or optional.

340
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:52,654
spending data, like what did it actually cost, and whether it was in-house or external provider, and participation rates.

341
00:35:54,175 --> 00:36:05,107
So, I mean, I feel like when we hear that there is not enough professional development, and then we see the list,

342
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:10,646
It's these two things do not, they just don't make sense together.

343
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:18,327
And what I think is going on is the teachers are saying that the professional development they get isn't what they need or want.

344
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:22,888
And so I may have just beat this to the death, so I'll stop talking.

345
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:23,628
Sorry.

346
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,009
Mayor, I was going to say, point of order.

347
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,009
Can we get back to order?

348
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,409
Thank you.

349
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,930
Not anything on any members, but I agree if it's for 42.

350
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,521
and we have to get through the rest of them.

351
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,743
I'm happy to read the next one if you like, or if someone else wants to.

352
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:38,343
Yes, that'd be great.

353
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:39,143
Thank you.

354
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,526
Okay.

355
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:46,708
So now we're moving on to the superintendent performance on standards.

356
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,390
So there are a number of standards with subcategories.

357
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,511
So standard one is instructional leadership.

358
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:56,894
And under that, there's a 1.1 curriculum, 1.2 instruction, 1.3 assessment,

359
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:01,656
evaluation and data informed decision making.

360
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:07,881
So those items are sort of the subsets of the larger instructional leadership items.

361
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:16,387
So if it's okay, I'll just read standard one with those items and then maybe another colleague can raise their hand for standard two and we can hopefully cruise along.

362
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,710
So standard one instructional leadership, the overall score was 3.01.

363
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,130
They were

364
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:24,743
three paragraphs of comments.

365
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:35,538
Basically, again, wondering if this is happening with special education and programming curriculum out of district placements, whether all students are in a proximal zone of learning.

366
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:43,943
Are they getting age appropriate grade level instruction through curriculum throughout, of high standard curriculum throughout our schools?

367
00:37:44,183 --> 00:37:48,026
Dr. Edward Vincent's commitment to improving curriculum and instruction at MPS is clear.

368
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:49,687
There's much work to be done.

369
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:53,590
The work happening at the elementary level is evident across literacy, science, and math.

370
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,312
Commitment to math excellence at all levels is clear.

371
00:37:56,712 --> 00:38:03,497
There remains opportunity at the secondary level to focus on remediation of students in literacy and math in particular.

372
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:07,156
where elementary experience was not the same as today's standards.

373
00:38:08,196 --> 00:38:17,138
There's more action needed to bridge gaps because of the pandemic that existed both before the pandemic and certainly were exacerbated through the pandemic.

374
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:21,099
The K-12 health curriculum needs to be a significant focus in the next year.

375
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,100
It's not implemented consistently.

376
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,335
and pandemic-related gaps are not closed.

377
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:34,363
The elementary curriculum is not up to par, and the current curriculum does not adequately reflect focus on all the aspects of health expected from a modern, comprehensive health curriculum.

378
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:43,711
I would also add, if I could just add the ring here a little bit, maybe we can add it in, is that there's nothing for special education in terms of the health curriculum as well, differentiated health curriculum.

379
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:50,617
A focus on instructional leadership needs to branch out from just the core curriculum areas that are covered by MCAS testing.

380
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:56,999
So again, not just focusing on the MCAS testing curriculum levels, but across all instructional levels.

381
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:07,183
A health curriculum that's taught by appropriately certified professionals that covers all areas of health, inclusive of sexual and reproductive education needs to be a focus in the coming year.

382
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:12,645
Sexual and gender minorities do not appear to be receiving appropriate health curriculums that is inclusive of their needs.

383
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:17,427
And again, I would add the same for disability and perhaps EL, I'm not sure.

384
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:26,068
This topic has been brought up many times, but continues to not receive attention it deserves for the health, safety, and happiness of our students, not covered by the heteronormative health curriculum.

385
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,971
I'll also add DESE just modified their health curriculum frameworks.

386
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,352
It was something like from 1999.

387
00:39:33,212 --> 00:39:38,435
So it's something that's a state level issue as well, but definitely needs to be looked at.

388
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:42,277
And then under curriculum, the score is 3.07.

389
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:46,539
So the score for instructional leadership as a whole was 3.01, curriculum was 3.07,

390
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:58,054
instruction 2.96, assessment 3.11, evaluation 2.94, and then data-informed decision-making 2.97 with a comment.

391
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:06,319
This is happening as it's published on the DESE site, et cetera, but growth data, student learning, et cetera, is not something that's shared with school committee or public.

392
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:13,543
The SE and public would appreciate more reporting on our data, even if it's merely included in our meeting packets as informational.

393
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:16,104
So if someone wants to take standard two,

394
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:19,848
I can take standard two.

395
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:25,391
Okay, I'll wait for you to go through all of them and then ask the questions at the end.

396
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:29,732
Can I may or actually can I ask if it's okay for Maurice to ask the question.

397
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:36,955
Because I'm afraid I'll forget as if we move on to the next one so if we could just stay in that at least a subset with all those categories.

398
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:42,858
Yep, Dr. Edward Vincent, then we'll have in the member credits is offered to read management and operations.

399
00:40:43,689 --> 00:41:09,314
Okay, just, I wanted to say, as I read the feedback under instructional leadership that I did agree with the feedback that I know that there is work that needs to continue to be done where it was talking about the secondary level remediation for students in literacy and in math, especially trying to close the gaps from the pandemic.

400
00:41:10,274 --> 00:41:38,674
And so I definitely, in agreement with the feedback that's being shared, I just wanted to offer that as we think about layering the different programs, K-12, one of the things that I'm always trying to balance is like the caseload, the workload on the teachers, because if in fact we end up

401
00:41:39,753 --> 00:41:55,236
I'm introducing too many different topics at the same exact time, then you don't have time to really go deep and fully understand like we when I got here we adopted the fast science and now we just adopted the math and

402
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:59,222
We're looking at the literacy as the third program.

403
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:11,258
And so I just wanted to share that I am trying to balance how much is a reasonable amount of new content new programs to be able to present.

404
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:12,680
to the teacher.

405
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:21,005
So that is part of why there isn't this let's go whole hog and change everything all at once, because it's overwhelming.

406
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:26,989
The teachers need to have time to learn the new programs and then to be able to teach it.

407
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:33,794
So I just wanted to say that I did agree with that feedback, but I just wanted to provide

408
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:46,409
a little context as to why I wasn't trying to go faster at a faster rate because I truly don't want people to

409
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:54,435
feel stressed or overwhelmed that it's too many programs happening all at the same time that they're not able to fully process it.

410
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,197
And for the data informed decision making.

411
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:06,382
My hope is now that we have NWEA and where you were talking about growth data.

412
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:10,023
Yes, this was the first year.

413
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:13,504
And so we never had a data system in place.

414
00:43:14,104 --> 00:43:35,429
So my hope is to continue to show the growth, which is what I had presented a few weeks back, that we want to see where students are starting, whatever their starting point is, whether they're a student with disabilities, whether they're an English learner, where they start and where they end the school year, are they showing growth?

415
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,930
And so as a district,

416
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:46,894
we were showing growth, that we were hitting at least 50% at almost every single grade level.

417
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:49,616
We were above the 50th percentile.

418
00:43:50,176 --> 00:44:03,723
So I'm hoping next year as we have our second year of using an additional assessment system, because the MCAS again, you have to wait a year to get that, that that's gonna help.

419
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:05,464
So those are just my only two comments.

420
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:06,384
Thank you.

421
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:08,726
Thank you.

422
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:14,111
Okay, so I'll start on standard two, management and operations.

423
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:18,314
The score was 3.15.

424
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:22,818
There is feedback under several of the sections under standard two.

425
00:44:23,258 --> 00:44:31,085
So I'll read the feedback for standard two, and then I'll, you know, continue on with the score for each other.

426
00:44:31,764 --> 00:44:33,704
subset and read the comments for that.

427
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,285
So standard two management operations 3.15.

428
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,306
The changes to the budget this year were effective and efficient.

429
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:47,187
The committee was able to get a comprehensive view of the priorities and discuss in a positive and productive manner.

430
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,687
The state of the district system is poor.

431
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:58,269
By systems, I'm referring to processes, technology, and people that comprise the foundation and infrastructure on which the district runs.

432
00:44:58,889 --> 00:44:59,889
There needs to be people

433
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:01,570
There needs to be.

434
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,973
I'm sorry I'm just missing my spot.

435
00:45:04,474 --> 00:45:16,228
There needs to be considerable focus, moving forward and prioritize a well run set of administrative functions without improvements on the administrative side of the house, the districts continued improvement in curriculum,

436
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:20,850
and instruction will be limited compliance with school committee policy is low.

437
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,932
And in the case of out of out of school suspension policy inadequate.

438
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:36,118
The committee proactively provided an extensive amount of planning time as the administration to come back to us with any changes that they felt would be needed to operate operationalize the policy.

439
00:45:36,598 --> 00:45:39,279
and to articulate what financial supports are needed.

440
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,700
None of this occurred.

441
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,623
Students appear to be regularly suspended this year, which is complete conflict with the policy set forward by the committee.

442
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:56,227
As another example, the committee also adopted policy that outlines regular reports, and went throughout the school year, we expect to receive them.

443
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:01,370
There has been no acknowledgement of or accounting for those reports this academic year.

444
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:06,405
2.1 environment the score was 2.97.

445
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:11,769
We are beginning to evaluate operational systems in a district that has long been without.

446
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:32,041
The next one was 2.2 2.2 human resources management and development score was 3.24 a standard report of other school committee committees receives is the personnel report continuing hires termination leaves of absence workers conversation and other positions.

447
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:36,663
This report is invaluable for understanding the state of the organization.

448
00:46:37,203 --> 00:46:44,868
This report is received monthly, or more often other districts, while it is understood that due to disconnected software systems.

449
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:48,730
This report cannot be generated without substantial work effort.

450
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:51,192
And that's we have not pressed for this report.

451
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:58,957
There does not seem to be a plan to replace this disconnect software system, so that the administration can begin providing this critical report.

452
00:46:59,677 --> 00:47:01,578
This report is more than nice to have.

453
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:06,919
It is considered mandatory and members of other school committees are shocked we don't get this report.

454
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:17,202
Identifying a path forward to replace the software systems or connect them or merely to fund some kind of a project to make these reports easily generated is something we would like to see.

455
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:24,204
So this is critical report can be generated and supplied to the committee is something we hope we can start in the coming year or two.

456
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,812
Then we have 2.3 scheduling and management information systems.

457
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:31,874
The score was 2.84.

458
00:47:33,867 --> 00:47:37,109
There are still multiple calendars throughout the member public school system.

459
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:44,695
These multiple calendaring systems, which do not speak to each other result in predictable failures, such as double booking of spaces.

460
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:48,298
This issue has risen to the forefront numerous times.

461
00:47:48,658 --> 00:48:03,089
The committee has made clear our desire for a single calendaring system, or at least some of the operationalized method to ensure the problems of the multiple sources of truth is resolved and to improve transparency about who was using our space

462
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:07,402
and for non-NPS affiliated groups, what they are paying for the space.

463
00:48:09,183 --> 00:48:15,185
And law ethics, 2.4, law ethics and policies, the score was 3.11.

464
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:20,146
2.5 fiscal systems, the score was 3.56.

465
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:29,309
And the overall score overall was 3.15 for standard two management and operations.

466
00:48:33,365 --> 00:48:34,085
Thank you, Member Kratz.

467
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:38,868
We have standard three engagement.

468
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:46,733
A little small on my computer, but I guess I could try.

469
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:51,376
2.66, family and community engagement needs improvement across NPS.

470
00:48:51,756 --> 00:49:00,642
While we made gains early in the pandemic, those efforts of collecting feedback, hosting Q&As and roundtables, and providing substantive updates have not

471
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:03,603
Continued in general, our public relations efforts are low.

472
00:49:03,964 --> 00:49:13,288
For example, the website redesign is being undertaken with no stakeholder involvement, which is likely to mean that it will miss the mark of expectations for students and families.

473
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:20,452
Going forward, I'd like to see Superintendent focus on creating a district-wide culture of communication and engagement at every level of the organization.

474
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:23,169
engagement 2.54.

475
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,670
We have a lot of work to do.

476
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,510
Yes, Member Roussell?

477
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:34,693
Sorry, the updated version that I sent later in the day had more comments, and I see that you don't have them right there.

478
00:49:34,753 --> 00:49:37,455
Let me just, want me to just read the rest of the comments for that item?

479
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:38,075
Sure.

480
00:49:38,095 --> 00:49:41,536
Because I know you don't have them in front of you.

481
00:49:41,556 --> 00:49:45,718
Dr. Ed Robinson is actively engaged in both the school community and the wider Medford community.

482
00:49:46,178 --> 00:49:47,359
She attends many school

483
00:49:48,592 --> 00:49:54,276
sports and cultural events, as well as many city-sponsored events, often during after-school hours and on weekends.

484
00:49:54,777 --> 00:50:03,543
This involvement in student and community activities is valuable in helping families and students and their families feel supported and welcomed by MPS and MPS administration.

485
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:08,627
This year saw the hiring of re-engagement specialists, a position newly created on June 20, 2021.

486
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:32,663
These initiatives to foster relationships with MPS students and families who have less engaged with the schools, increased opportunities for two way communication with students and families has needed communication that is focused on district learning initiatives, as well as community building students and families need more consistent

487
00:50:33,323 --> 00:50:37,706
opportunities to provide feedback, ideas, and concerns both in person and through surveys.

488
00:50:38,086 --> 00:50:47,251
I also hope to see the superintendent's Friday update email, which has been a consistent and important method of communication with the community, evolved both in format and content.

489
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:54,416
I did send all the members during this meeting the update, which I realized I only had sent to Suzy, so my apologies.

490
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,918
Yep, I have the update version up now.

491
00:50:58,418 --> 00:50:58,658
Thank you.

492
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:05,853
We can continue. 3.1.

493
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:14,623
3.1 engagement, we have a lot of work to do in effective family and community engagement.

494
00:51:14,663 --> 00:51:19,706
The district has an FCE audit done through a state run process in 2020, 2021.

495
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:27,450
The outcome of the audit was that there was not commitment to the time it takes to build FCE throughout the district.

496
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:37,795
When I've offered the opportunity to continue with the outside FCE consultant at no cost, the district somewhat ironically declined due to lack of time and resources.

497
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:40,089
Sharing responsibility, 2.56.

498
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:42,170
Communication, 2.79.

499
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:48,593
Good to see the weekly communication, but this is a one-way communication.

500
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:54,616
You need two-way communication culturally proficient that goes beyond a curriculum night or weekly newsletter.

501
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:56,857
Family concerns, 2.76.

502
00:51:56,937 --> 00:52:02,140
We have work to do in responding effectively, equitably, and efficiently to families and community.

503
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,222
As the audit indicated, we do not appear to have any

504
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,780
provide feedback care system in place.

505
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:16,802
This results in email being the sole method, which is both highly time consuming, but also a method that allows for any analysis of what is received.

506
00:52:17,862 --> 00:52:26,825
Surveys repeated over time can yield valuable information about trends and highlight changes in how well we are doing and in the needs of families over time.

507
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:31,666
Does somebody want to take over as standard for professional culture?

508
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:34,387
I was wondering if we can comment on

509
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:36,739
If I can raise my left one.

510
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:37,460
Thank you.

511
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,402
I just wanted to comment and I'm happy to read the professional culture.

512
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:48,605
Next, but I just wanted to sort of comment on the family engagement piece because I think it's an important one that.

513
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:55,184
sort of was one of the lower scores, needs improvement sort of score.

514
00:52:55,204 --> 00:52:58,705
It was in between the, a little bit more than a two point, it was a 2.66.

515
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,766
So not quite there yet with a three.

516
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:18,790
And I just think that that's something that, you know, while we have a new department and, you know, that department's growing and frankly, you know, from member Hayes' perspective at the beginning of the meeting as well, there's just been so much that has been done compared to the previous administration around this, just like thinking about,

517
00:53:19,273 --> 00:53:28,776
materials being translated that hadn't before, and a family and community engagement, you know, liaison that we didn't have before, just so many things that have been done.

518
00:53:29,217 --> 00:53:30,377
So I do want to say that as well.

519
00:53:30,397 --> 00:53:32,918
But I do think that this is a huge area for improvement.

520
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,039
And there's lots of opportunity here.

521
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:41,301
And we have so much expertise in the community, both families and community organizations.

522
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:50,502
community organizations where we could really build community-based schools and be able to leverage a lot of the resources that are there.

523
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:53,204
So I just sort of wanted to expand on that a little bit.

524
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:57,926
And also just in terms of communication with other more marginalized communities.

525
00:53:58,487 --> 00:54:03,810
For example, I know that Talking Tools is a software program that I believe

526
00:54:05,832 --> 00:54:11,336
that Paul, Director Paul Teixeira uses, and that the district has access to that.

527
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:26,205
And it was something that I was speaking with him about, even in terms of having the superintendent and school committee members have access to that, talking points, so that we could actually talk to people who are not English speakers in their native language, that we could text with them, and that it could be translated.

528
00:54:26,682 --> 00:54:27,883
and vice versa.

529
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:33,105
And so I know that they've been using the Talking Points app, and it's been super successful with the EL teachers.

530
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:45,892
And I would say, why could that not be expanded to, again, the superintendent and potentially school committee members, so that we're thinking about how we're engaging our more marginalized communities, because it does seem all too often the emails are from the same people.

531
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:49,635
the same people are at the table, the same people come to the meetings.

532
00:54:50,135 --> 00:54:52,216
And I would really like to see that disrupted.

533
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:58,359
I'd really like to be able to work collaboratively in figuring out how we can really engage families.

534
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:01,040
So that was just the feedback I wanted to offer.

535
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,702
And I was wondering if Dr. Edward Vincent has anything to say on that.

536
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:05,282
Thank you.

537
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:09,104
Mayor.

538
00:55:11,185 --> 00:55:12,686
Dr. Edward Vincent, thank you.

539
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:27,319
As I was looking at the feedback, I think I was surprised and a little taken aback at the engagement rating.

540
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:39,603
And so I guess one of the things that I am, when I have the opportunity to be with families and I talk with them,

541
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:56,689
Many, many times families have said to me how appreciative they are of the weekly communication and realizing, feeling like they are aware of what's happening within the district globally.

542
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:06,313
And in our weekly communications that go out to the entire school community, when appropriate, we do include

543
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:26,073
whether it's CPAC announcements or other types of things that are happening on the community or city side, we do try to include those events to broaden the stakeholders who may be looking at it.

544
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:33,459
So I guess I was just gonna ask for, I looked at the feedback, and I know where

545
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:50,762
On bullet 3.3 about one way communication we do translate all of the communication that we send out, we have invested in talking points as a district.

546
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:52,123
So I do know.

547
00:56:54,717 --> 00:57:03,562
there are opportunities for teachers to communicate as well with some of our families that are ELs, where English is not their first language.

548
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:18,931
So I do feel like we have tried to be consistent at least and having one format or a way of communicating with families.

549
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:23,274
And so I don't know, you know,

550
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:30,633
specifically, but if other members wanted to just speak to some of the pieces under engagement.

551
00:57:30,773 --> 00:57:52,921
And as a district, we made significant investment in our engagement specialists, which again, are another layer that didn't exist before, but we added that whole department to really try to meet the needs of some of our most vulnerable students that may in other situations be falling through the cracks.

552
00:57:53,741 --> 00:58:01,345
So I just was hoping to get a little more feedback or clarification on that overall rating.

553
00:58:04,187 --> 00:58:04,647
Thank you.

554
00:58:06,928 --> 00:58:08,149
Member Rousseau?

555
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:09,469
Thank you.

556
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:15,533
I mean, so, you know, this review is

557
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:23,478
superintendent review, but it's a review of the school system, because we don't get to review principals and assistant superintendents.

558
00:58:24,118 --> 00:58:31,783
So, I mean, I think that your personal communications that are going on on Friday are in fact, excellent.

559
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:42,851
And, you know, I remember early on in the pandemic, I think, when I provided some feedback on the formatting, and you took it and you improved it.

560
00:58:43,011 --> 00:58:44,412
And that I think is

561
00:58:45,493 --> 00:59:12,067
not in my mind this is not what this relatively low score is about it's that you know you're one person um and frankly I think your communication that's going out on Fridays is great and it couldn't be better everything could be better but um but you are not all of the other people that should be communicating out and that's where I feel like I see weaknesses in um

562
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:22,596
consistency, which is a huge, you know, is one of your principle, I forget the word I'm looking for, but consistency is critical and important.

563
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:32,082
And at this point in time, it seems like to the large extent, principles and other people who are communicating out to families are on their own.

564
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:37,565
And I recognize that there's not a public relations or marketing office to

565
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:49,850
draft templates for everybody to use and find out what all the various communications that go out in a year are and make sure that they're consistent and using the right language and translated ahead of time, frankly.

566
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,772
I mean, a lot of the communications the district sends out are not unique.

567
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:59,656
Like every year they're the same communications with tweaking dates and places and names.

568
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:06,361
And yet, is there a giant folder in somebody's computer or office that everybody's pulling from?

569
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:09,476
My sense is the answer is no.

570
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:23,642
And so for me, that's why this score is, I mean, obviously this is not just my score, it's everybody's scores average together, but having a consistency all the way from the top to the bottom,

571
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:26,909
is creates cohesiveness.

572
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:30,229
It ensures that we are all using the right language.

573
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:38,212
And that's for me why I think that this area has an enormous area for improvement.

574
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:43,873
Member Graham.

575
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:45,894
Thank you.

576
01:00:45,914 --> 01:00:54,376
I think the other, a couple of, I'll say sort of small examples of

577
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:57,650
what we're talking about here come to mind.

578
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,362
Member Graham, I can't hear her anymore.

579
01:01:11,522 --> 01:01:14,024
I believe member Graham froze.

580
01:01:14,044 --> 01:01:23,652
Do you guys want me to read the next one and when member Graham comes back on she can comment?

581
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,261
or not, ma'am.

582
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:26,523
I'm sorry, can you hear me?

583
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:27,885
Now we can.

584
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:33,113
Can you all hear me now?

585
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:35,458
just now.

586
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:37,279
Okay.

587
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:37,939
Sorry about that.

588
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,964
I do not know what's happening with my internet today, but it's like flaking in and out on different devices at different times.

589
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:48,126
So that's why you see me keep popping in and out of the meeting.

590
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:50,968
So I can give you a couple of examples.

591
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:56,732
So on the same day, I got several things home from Lucas's class.

592
01:01:57,212 --> 01:02:00,595
And one of them was a permission slip about,

593
01:02:01,455 --> 01:02:07,603
had the Procter and Gamble video that we use as our health curriculum for fifth graders.

594
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:13,510
And it said, you need to return this to us.

595
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:16,794
And there were options to opt in or opt out.

596
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:33,611
I explicitly had a conversation about aligning our strategies and prostheses there to what Desi says, which is we can, and frankly should, provide opt-out language for parents who want to opt out.

597
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:38,155
But I was left with the question of, what if I don't send this back?

598
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:41,679
Did all of those kids also miss the

599
01:02:42,754 --> 01:02:46,997
the tiny little sliver of health curriculum that we've got for them.

600
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:53,703
The second piece of paper was a permission slip for Junior Olympics, I believe.

601
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,165
It had the wrong dates.

602
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,890
It asked for volunteers, although

603
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:07,851
Most of like, we never actually got any communication about what that meant.

604
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:19,065
And then I forget what the third piece of paper was on the same day, but there was like another similar communication issue.

605
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:27,010
And I just look across like all of those things, and they're all very small, but the small stuff really matters.

606
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:40,678
And I want to point out that we do have a public information officer, I would like to see us think about the culture of communication in the district in total, and really think about

607
01:03:41,558 --> 01:04:03,685
how do we improve, much along the lines of what Member Rousseau said, how do we improve not just how the superintendent communicates, because that is unequivocally better than under our past superintendent, but all the ways that we communicate from small to tall,

608
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:16,667
There's wild inconsistency and the barrage of forms that come home at the beginning of the year that ask for the same information in triplicate.

609
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:27,995
The fact that a week before school starts, there will be a litany of repeatable questions about buses that will appear on social media.

610
01:04:28,935 --> 01:04:31,437
Those are all indicators that we have work to do.

611
01:04:37,062 --> 01:04:37,422
Thank you.

612
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,185
So we have professional culture.

613
01:04:40,205 --> 01:04:40,245
OK.

614
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:45,069
Sorry, hold on one second.

615
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,191
Make sure I'm having on.

616
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:49,773
Professional culture.

617
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:51,855
I don't make sure I'm on the right before we go to professional culture.

618
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:57,900
These these were merged, so they're not specific comments for every now.

619
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,681
These are emerged, correct?

620
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:05,306
Yes, because I did put some positive things in there and I

621
01:05:06,563 --> 01:05:07,463
I just don't see much.

622
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:09,404
Let me go look at your review.

623
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:10,545
I'm sorry if I missed them.

624
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:12,345
I did miss a number of days earlier.

625
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:13,106
No, that's OK.

626
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:16,007
I just feel like we should be pointing out the good things, too.

627
01:05:17,887 --> 01:05:18,268
Agreed.

628
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,069
Do you want me to reach standard four, Mayor?

629
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:21,889
Please.

630
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,590
Standard four, professional culture.

631
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:26,091
This is 2.88 overall.

632
01:05:26,511 --> 01:05:27,711
And then we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 subcategories.

633
01:05:35,622 --> 01:05:41,085
But interestingly, one, two, three, four of the six subcategories don't have any comments.

634
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:45,807
So I actually have some questions on them because I wasn't sure from colleagues.

635
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:54,931
But professional culture 2.88, the superintendent should focus on relationships building in order to further her objectives around curriculum and instruction.

636
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,493
I'd like to see her build strong relationship with teachers and staff and

637
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,681
begin to reverse decades of mistrust and non-collaboration that have been present in MPS.

638
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:15,703
Concern about the climate and culture of high school and would like to see action to address the structural ways our organization hinders progress on achieving a positive climate and culture.

639
01:06:16,123 --> 01:06:24,325
The organizational structure is not optimal and needs to be significantly overhauled in order to see alignment with student achievement goals that will close gaps and serve children.

640
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:28,909
School committee is available to collaborate, support, and provide resources.

641
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,490
This work is difficult.

642
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:36,693
We'd like to see more effective collaboration with the school committee and other stakeholders to move the strategic vision forward.

643
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:43,557
There's been examples of cultural proficiency issues at various places in the district this year.

644
01:06:44,257 --> 01:06:51,841
For example, a dress code at the high school that indicate there's more work to do to create the kind of environment that we all wish to see for our children.

645
01:06:53,162 --> 01:07:00,208
Through her own continued professional development and the many professional development opportunities she's implemented for administrators, teachers, and other staff.

646
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:06,212
Dr. Edward Vincent demonstrates a strong commitment to continuous learning and high standards in the area of communication.

647
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:14,679
Dr. Edward Vincent has implemented, continued some valuable systems of communication with families, Friday emails, and staff learning walks and listening tours.

648
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:25,030
While these are a good foundation, there's not enough evidence that they are being consistently and fully utilized as a means to inform and involve these groups in order to advance the work of the district.

649
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:34,758
Commitment to high standards 3.37 high standards are only high standards if they're consistently applied work to be done to ensure high standards are universally applied throughout the district.

650
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:47,527
The places where our standards need improvement are mostly known and therefore it's the willingness to act on those challenges across the district that appear to be the difficulty.

651
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:51,592
For cultural proficiency 2.87, communications 2.69, continuous learning 2.87,

652
01:07:57,337 --> 01:08:11,428
shared vision 2.84 managing conflict 2.64 perhaps it's the pandemic and the ongoing disagreement and dissent but the superintendent could be more direct and a stronger leader when it comes to this standard managing conflict.

653
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:19,554
And then mayor if I can ask a question on the professional culture or sort of if I could raise my hand if

654
01:08:22,362 --> 01:08:23,182
Yes, yes.

655
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:24,083
Thank you.

656
01:08:24,844 --> 01:08:37,034
So for professional culture sort of as an overall standard, the way I just sort of want to explain the way that I saw the standard for professional culture was more about the again, because we're evaluating the superintendent and not the whole district.

657
01:08:37,494 --> 01:08:45,100
It was more about how the district and teachers and staff and others are all interacted in communicating with each other.

658
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,381
And I do think that we have a

659
01:08:49,764 --> 01:08:55,150
some professional culture concerns around, what's the word I'm looking for?

660
01:08:58,947 --> 01:09:01,848
sort of a, I guess there's sort of a negative environment right now.

661
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:14,112
And I don't know if that's an artifact of, you know, sort of whatever this post pandemic phases or pre post pandemic phases or what have you, but we definitely have, you know, a low mood at the schools, if you will.

662
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:24,316
And so that's one of the things that I saw this particularly as, and I just want to be really clear around the cultural proficiency piece, which is under the professional cultural

663
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:26,497
culture, which was a 2.87.

664
01:09:26,937 --> 01:09:40,383
I just want to just make a point here for me that that is not, in my opinion, what some might view as cultural proficiency as a whole in that professional culture.

665
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:48,066
So in other words, I think Dr. Edward Vincent has done a tremendous job bringing diversity to our district in terms of reminding

666
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:54,949
us all, why diversity is so important in our district, why equity and inclusion is so important in our district.

667
01:09:55,549 --> 01:10:06,273
And that cannot be easy for a woman superintendent, who also happens to be a person of color, coming into a district that's been very traditional to have to do.

668
01:10:06,693 --> 01:10:11,415
So lifting that weight all this time, I'm sure, has got to be really difficult.

669
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:14,456
And I just want to say that from the Haitian Flag Day to the

670
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:31,247
The weekly, I mean, the school committee updates when the superintendent is very inclusive of different events, not only in the community, but nationally, the need for hiring diverse staff, all of those things I think have been exceptional.

671
01:10:31,307 --> 01:10:38,772
So I just wanted to sort of make a point here that I feel like there was some, again, and this is an artifact of DESE, I think there's some embedded

672
01:10:40,774 --> 01:10:46,997
names in here that I'm not sure necessarily go with culture and proficiency under professional culture.

673
01:10:47,057 --> 01:10:51,199
And again, I think that might be an artifact of a privileged system, frankly.

674
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:58,303
So I just wanted to put that piece out there that I think Dr. Edward Vincent has done a lot, and it can't be easy in that realm.

675
01:10:58,363 --> 01:11:01,785
And I just want to let her know how much I appreciate her for that.

676
01:11:01,805 --> 01:11:02,785
Thank you.

677
01:11:03,246 --> 01:11:04,226
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

678
01:11:04,266 --> 01:11:09,109
If I could, from the chair, my comments, I guess, didn't go through or

679
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:17,662
So I just want to point out disagreement and dissent where, you know, I'm talking about managing conflict.

680
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:36,698
I gave the example in my review on something that I thought brought, you know, a lot of disruption and conflict to the city, but how the superintendent and her team handled it with such grace and did a fabulous job.

681
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:38,319
And, you know, it is a touchy subject.

682
01:11:38,379 --> 01:11:39,240
We didn't renew.

683
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:43,272
a contract, but, and people were very upset.

684
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:48,095
They had questions, they had concerns, yet it was a matter that really couldn't be discussed.

685
01:11:48,995 --> 01:12:07,107
Um, so what the superintendent did was make sure she brought in, um, families at a meeting and she, you know, with, along with her team brought in families to really listen to, um, get their concerns and ideas and questions out on the table.

686
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:22,002
And then at the same evening or the night after, you know, brought in faculty and staff to really talk through it and to work together, put a, I know a good hiring team together to make sure everybody had a seat at the table.

687
01:12:22,082 --> 01:12:27,626
And I just think the plan that was put in place and how it was executed was pretty amazing.

688
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:30,528
And I just want to point that out because that's how, you know,

689
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:33,523
we got through such a tough situation.

690
01:12:33,643 --> 01:12:39,765
It could have been a lot more on our backs and our shoulders, but it was handled the best way it could, in my opinion.

691
01:12:39,885 --> 01:12:42,507
And I just think that should be added to the comments.

692
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:54,271
That's where I, when I saw managing conflict, that's the first thing that came to my mind, because I feel like 2.64 is just extremely low.

693
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:56,552
You know, there is conflict in our community.

694
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,833
There's conflict in the,

695
01:12:58,862 --> 01:13:07,046
United States conflict in the world, but that's not the superintendent's, you know, complete responsibility to solve.

696
01:13:07,086 --> 01:13:16,751
I think when you talk about managing conflict within the school atmosphere, that was something that probably was the biggest thing I can remember in the last two years, other than, you know, dealing with the pandemic.

697
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,232
And I just feel like

698
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:27,916
Tempers were calmed down and everybody had a seat at the table and was heard and involved however much or little they wanted to be.

699
01:13:27,996 --> 01:13:29,998
And I just want to commend the superintendent for that.

700
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:40,745
Member Rousseau.

701
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:42,227
Thank you.

702
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,108
I'd like to make a motion to amend

703
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:59,262
4.6 conflict management, the feedback to include the feedback that the mayor just provided and asked that the mayor just send me the language that she just said, or previously says she had in her review.

704
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:03,464
It did not come across to me, I did go and look, but I don't doubt that she wrote it, so.

705
01:14:04,185 --> 01:14:13,470
And may I ask member, through the chair, that any other, obviously, I think it's obvious, but just wanted to be sure that any other comment

706
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:15,768
is included.

707
01:14:15,828 --> 01:14:19,170
And thank you for putting this all together through the chair, member Russo.

708
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:23,172
I did it last year and it's time consuming and tedious.

709
01:14:23,412 --> 01:14:25,273
And so thanks for putting it together.

710
01:14:25,293 --> 01:14:35,419
But if any other comments could be added, and then if it's okay to just rename the evaluation as updated or final or something like that.

711
01:14:35,479 --> 01:14:41,722
So when we're deleting the other ones, we're not getting confused about what we have and what we don't, that would be super helpful.

712
01:14:42,502 --> 01:14:43,262
So I second that.

713
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:45,543
Yes, a motion for rules.

714
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:47,063
Go ahead members.

715
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,824
I'm not sure that I don't have other feedback to include.

716
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:54,745
So I'm not sure what's being suggested by others.

717
01:14:58,106 --> 01:15:08,809
Motion by members so seconded by member McLaughlin that I will send you the language either tonight when I get home at 830 or tomorrow morning and that will be this document will be amended.

718
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:12,548
I'm sorry, I thought that, Mayor, may I?

719
01:15:13,028 --> 01:15:13,228
Yes.

720
01:15:13,869 --> 01:15:18,951
I thought there were other comments or from earlier too that had not been or had been overlooked.

721
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:21,152
So if there wasn't, I apologize.

722
01:15:21,192 --> 01:15:24,633
But if there is, I would just ask that obviously that they can be included.

723
01:15:24,693 --> 01:15:25,053
Thank you.

724
01:15:25,133 --> 01:15:29,035
Yes, there was, I think I had one on communication and engagement.

725
01:15:29,115 --> 01:15:32,577
So I can try to find my document if I saved it.

726
01:15:32,657 --> 01:15:39,600
If not, I will put some thoughts together and send those to member Russo by midday tomorrow.

727
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:45,656
So there's a motion on the floor to amend because for some reason my comments were left out.

728
01:15:46,256 --> 01:15:46,896
Roll call, please.

729
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:48,737
Member Graham.

730
01:15:51,519 --> 01:15:51,759
Yes.

731
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,740
Member Hayes.

732
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:54,840
Yes.

733
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:56,201
Member Katz.

734
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:57,202
Yes.

735
01:15:58,422 --> 01:15:59,103
Member McLaughlin.

736
01:15:59,563 --> 01:15:59,843
Yes.

737
01:16:00,543 --> 01:16:01,144
Member McDonnell.

738
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:01,824
Yes.

739
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:02,945
Member Rossell.

740
01:16:02,985 --> 01:16:03,185
Yes.

741
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:03,845
Mayor Landau.

742
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:04,946
Yes.

743
01:16:05,226 --> 01:16:06,667
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

744
01:16:06,707 --> 01:16:08,187
Motion is approved.

745
01:16:11,019 --> 01:16:13,560
Is there a motion to finalize this so we can move on to?

746
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,161
Mayor, the superintendent has her hand up.

747
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:17,281
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

748
01:16:18,142 --> 01:16:23,584
Yes, Mayor, I just wanted to, and I welcome the feedback.

749
01:16:24,104 --> 01:16:39,970
I wanted to talk a little bit about the cultural proficiency rating, and I guess I would love to hear a little more, but when I went back to look at

750
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:56,721
What's in the standard ensures that policies and practices enable staff and students to interact effectively in a culturally diverse environment in which students backgrounds identities strengths and challenges are respected.

751
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:14,609
As evidenced by the sufficient sufficient provision of guidance supports and resources to all schools to promote culturally responsive learning environments in school cultures that affirm individual differences of both students and staff, and I do feel that.

752
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:19,720
That is something that is happening in Medford.

753
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:24,763
If you go to the schools, I was at the, you know, Missittuck and the Roberts today.

754
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:43,652
And I do feel when I'm in the schools, any of them, that the students are valued, whether it's showing flags from the diverse representation, but the students and families, whether it's their background, their identity, their strengths, their challenges,

755
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:49,460
Medford really does a very good job trying to welcome all.

756
01:17:50,242 --> 01:17:55,611
And so I just was again because I don't I don't know what went into the.

757
01:17:57,784 --> 01:18:17,418
you know, that rating, but I just was wondering, in addition to all of the DEI work that we're trying to do with professional development, I was just hoping to get a little more feedback just to help me understand what I need to do more of.

758
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:18,839
Thank you.

759
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:44,286
Maybe we can all think through that and provide some feedback through phone calls to Dr. Edward Vincent or email if nobody has any comments right this minute.

760
01:18:44,506 --> 01:18:45,106
Member Rousseau?

761
01:18:49,107 --> 01:18:50,807
It's hard to talk about this particular one.

762
01:18:56,675 --> 01:18:59,797
What the superintendent said, I don't think is incorrect.

763
01:18:59,977 --> 01:19:02,798
I think it's, however, the adult view of the situation.

764
01:19:02,818 --> 01:19:04,439
That's how I'll put it.

765
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,901
I don't think it's the student view of the situation.

766
01:19:09,422 --> 01:19:17,666
So, I don't have any, I can't be more specific than that, other than to say that, you know,

767
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:23,252
that it just, this just feels like this is an adult assessment.

768
01:19:23,872 --> 01:19:38,654
The number is not an adult, is not an assessment of how the adults in the building perhaps feel about the places, but students and certainly some staff, I think, do not feel that we are particularly culturally proficient.

769
01:19:39,014 --> 01:19:45,996
We are incredibly diverse, which gives us a great opportunity to become culturally proficient.

770
01:19:47,176 --> 01:19:47,976
You know, if it was like,

771
01:19:49,513 --> 01:19:58,341
a, you know, someplace in New Hampshire where everybody's white and everybody's, you know, Christian or Protestant or whatever.

772
01:19:58,942 --> 01:20:02,385
Everybody's, you know, effectively the same to a large extent.

773
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:05,733
it's harder, I think, to become culturally proficient.

774
01:20:05,933 --> 01:20:09,094
There's just no opportunities to exercise that muscle.

775
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:20,016
But Medford has, frankly, has the opportunity that many communities could dream of to really become culturally proficient.

776
01:20:21,477 --> 01:20:22,397
I don't think we're there.

777
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:32,500
And I don't so much feel like it's a reflection of the superintendent, because I think we've heard very clearly that the superintendent,

778
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:38,315
is, you know, is a rock star in this arena.

779
01:20:39,996 --> 01:20:44,921
But the superintendent is not all the employees and

780
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:50,896
the superintendent, we evaluate the superintendent and really re-evaluate the school system in this process.

781
01:20:50,956 --> 01:21:06,392
So I certainly would agree it's not a reflection on the superintendent on her specific cultural proficiencies, but making that come down and be part of all of the schools and all of the staff and not just be a

782
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:10,035
I mean, I'm just saying, don't be a two hour PD.

783
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:20,523
I have no idea how that even works out, but I'm just, that's my feedback, because I know you wanted feedback and it's a hard one for me to really kind of come up with on the spot.

784
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,004
Thank you.

785
01:21:22,024 --> 01:21:25,187
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

786
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:31,032
Yeah, I just wanted to add, yeah, the school system as a whole, the community as a whole.

787
01:21:31,092 --> 01:21:40,536
That's one thing, the superintendent individually, and I felt like particularly for an evaluation of the superintendent that, you know, this number was a little bit off.

788
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:47,979
So I appreciate member Rousseau sort of looking, you know, mentioning the district as a whole and some things that need to be worked on.

789
01:21:48,019 --> 01:21:50,780
But I think that that's a community effort and a collaborative effort.

790
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,901
both from the school committee, from our families, from our teachers, from our staff, for everybody.

791
01:21:55,961 --> 01:21:58,602
It's not one person that can direct any of that work.

792
01:21:58,642 --> 01:22:01,943
This is very difficult discussion and conversation.

793
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:04,004
That's why they call them courageous conversations.

794
01:22:04,784 --> 01:22:06,984
But I think that this is work that we all have to do.

795
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:12,686
And so I appreciate that the superintendent is leading the way in this.

796
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:19,608
And I hope that we can support her and that our schools and our community will support the work as well.

797
01:22:19,828 --> 01:22:20,168
Thank you.

798
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:23,058
Thank you.

799
01:22:23,078 --> 01:22:23,959
Member McLaughlin.

800
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:30,505
Member Stone.

801
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:31,726
Hi, thank you.

802
01:22:31,886 --> 01:22:33,547
I think we're probably wrapping up since it's 528.

803
01:22:34,448 --> 01:22:38,512
But two points, which I wasn't sure if other people are going to touch upon them before.

804
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:41,354
I didn't want to repeat my colleagues sentiment.

805
01:22:42,255 --> 01:22:44,617
For communication, I know teachers have

806
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:49,171
spoke to me about just more communication directly with the teachers.

807
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:54,416
We do all appreciate the newsletter for the families, but maybe there could be a separate newsletter.

808
01:22:54,456 --> 01:22:59,261
It doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly, just for the teachers to know what's happened academically.

809
01:23:00,622 --> 01:23:08,110
Schedule-wise for the different grade levels, or maybe some points of information that are coming down from DESE.

810
01:23:08,473 --> 01:23:23,665
So, teachers on across the board know where you are coming with with your vision or your goals I think that would be helpful so they all know why things are getting implemented because this is what you're hoping to do to benefit public schools to make them better for every child which I know.

811
01:23:24,693 --> 01:23:27,875
I know without a doubt that you are thinking of every child every day.

812
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:40,005
And the second part is now that COVID is subsiding and that we can, I know you love to do the data stuff and that we have science that is rolled out.

813
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:42,366
We have math that is mid rolled out.

814
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:47,630
And now also, now it's time to look at the English for,

815
01:23:49,438 --> 01:23:56,722
ELA for all grades and for social studies slash history slash civics.

816
01:23:57,082 --> 01:24:17,753
But I think now that we have more time because you have less responsibility with COVID decisions, which you had to make those on a daily basis, that I think parents, those are my two things that parents have said to me recently, is now talk about English, social studies, and teaches more communication directly with the teachers

817
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:24,602
And that's, I think other than that, I know you are on the clock 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

818
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:30,723
And I think most of the community understands that and appreciates that.

819
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:46,067
So I just look forward to now, you know, I guess going back to when you were hired and your goals then, now, you know, you were slowed down with COVID, but now you can kick it back into gear and it's exciting to see what Memphis Public Schools are gonna go.

820
01:24:46,287 --> 01:24:47,407
So thank you, Dr. Maurice.

821
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:48,871
Thank you.

822
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:50,832
I'm sorry.

823
01:24:52,393 --> 01:24:52,713
Sorry.

824
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:57,836
I just wanted to say that with the teacher communications, one of the things that.

825
01:25:00,586 --> 01:25:04,747
is currently happening is between both Ms.

826
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,547
Galussi and Dr. Cushing.

827
01:25:06,807 --> 01:25:15,049
They were sending direct communications to teachers talking about grade level teams and scheduling and meetings.

828
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:23,131
So I can work on trying to revamp that, but there is a communication mechanism in place for teachers directly.

829
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:28,292
It was just being managed by the both of them to the respective teams.

830
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,093
So I just wanted to comment that there is

831
01:25:31,253 --> 01:25:37,837
there is communication, but we can work on letting them know that I agree with what's being sent out.

832
01:25:37,957 --> 01:25:39,698
But thank you for all the feedback.

833
01:25:39,878 --> 01:25:40,158
Thank you.

834
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:45,261
We're all on the same team.

835
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:45,561
Thank you.

836
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:46,281
Motion on the floor?

837
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:47,662
Motion to approve?

838
01:25:48,342 --> 01:25:50,863
Motion to approve as amended.

839
01:25:50,883 --> 01:25:52,484
Member Roussell?

840
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:59,368
I just... Member Huston said something that also reminded me that, you know,

841
01:26:00,338 --> 01:26:07,142
When we're doing this review, the hardest part for us is that we are not walking the halls and sitting in every classroom in the district.

842
01:26:07,722 --> 01:26:11,824
And a lot of these questions, frankly, are things, especially the old version of the evaluation.

843
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,346
It was as if we were everywhere all the time and could know everything.

844
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:16,167
It was bizarre.

845
01:26:16,587 --> 01:26:24,832
This one's better, but it still has a lot of that, that we are expected to just mind meld with the entire staff of the district and all families.

846
01:26:26,393 --> 01:26:37,297
So, what something number of us don't said though, I'm sorry that Dr Edward Vincent said about you know that communications about becoming principals and assistant superintendent Lucy, and I'm just like,

847
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:53,948
blind CCing us on things that, you know, aren't for us, we're not the target audience, but blind CCing us throughout the year on things that you're like, you know, this was in the evaluation and let's blind CC the school committee.

848
01:26:53,968 --> 01:27:06,495
So they see that it's happening because when we come back a year from now, a lot of us will look at the last review, our last comments, and we will be like, I don't feel like I know anything more about this than I did last year.

849
01:27:06,715 --> 01:27:07,816
That doesn't mean it didn't happen.

850
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:13,314
And the time to try and convince us that this stuff happened is not when we sit down to do our review.

851
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,496
So that's just a suggestion I had.

852
01:27:15,516 --> 01:27:17,777
And I see my case.

853
01:27:19,218 --> 01:27:19,598
Thank you.

854
01:27:19,998 --> 01:27:20,478
Member Hayes.

855
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:29,823
Thanks, I just I wanted to add to that in terms of I think that's, that's part of what we can improve on with the evaluation process.

856
01:27:29,903 --> 01:27:34,706
Also, I looked at some other cities and towns just to see how it's done in other places.

857
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:34,826
And

858
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:47,778
And I think they also said this in my orientation, that part of the process when we create the goals is to really talk about what evidence we would need to see to be able to evaluate you clearly and accurately and fully.

859
01:27:48,118 --> 01:28:02,748
So I think that as we move forward and start to really try to update this process and make it mirror more, I think what Desi intends, that's a piece that we really should be doing is really being clear about what evidence we want to see so that you know what to expect from us because

860
01:28:03,437 --> 01:28:11,822
You know, if it's open-ended and you don't know, you may feel like you're providing us what we need and we're looking at it and going, but I don't know if that quite meets what I was thinking.

861
01:28:12,302 --> 01:28:23,930
So I think if we can all be on the same page about what evidence would give us, you know, would help us to be able to evaluate you, I think that it will go a long way to making this process easier also and fairer.

862
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:25,631
Thank you.

863
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:28,512
Second, sir.

864
01:28:28,532 --> 01:28:29,433
Approved.

865
01:28:38,197 --> 01:28:38,537
Mayor.

866
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:44,362
I think the mayor.

867
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:47,625
She said she had to leave at 530 I wonder, but she's still on.

868
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:53,330
Is the vice chair available.

869
01:28:59,132 --> 01:29:10,096
So we have a motion to approve the superintendent's evaluation as amended by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin, is that right?

870
01:29:10,796 --> 01:29:11,417
Vice versa.

871
01:29:12,117 --> 01:29:13,737
Oh.

872
01:29:13,777 --> 01:29:17,519
Yes, sorry.

873
01:29:17,779 --> 01:29:19,479
So let's call the roll.

874
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,440
Member Graham.

875
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:23,541
Yes.

876
01:29:24,321 --> 01:29:25,841
Member Hayes.

877
01:29:25,921 --> 01:29:26,122
Yes.

878
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:27,182
Member Betz.

879
01:29:27,938 --> 01:29:28,178
Yes.

880
01:29:29,419 --> 01:29:30,460
Member McLaughlin.

881
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,261
Yes.

882
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:32,402
Member Bissette.

883
01:29:32,862 --> 01:29:33,122
Yes.

884
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:34,323
Member Rossell.

885
01:29:34,403 --> 01:29:34,863
Yes.

886
01:29:34,984 --> 01:29:35,744
Mayor Lococo.

887
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:36,865
Yes.

888
01:29:36,885 --> 01:29:41,369
70 affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

889
01:29:45,692 --> 01:29:50,636
We have, I think it's labeled, I'm sorry, I had to switch to my phone.

890
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:52,540
because I only have till 5.30.

891
01:29:54,620 --> 01:30:03,744
Number three was listed as motion to motion to calendar, which we already approved.

892
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:11,428
Can we back up?

893
01:30:11,788 --> 01:30:17,170
We have the school committee dates, which we need to vote on today.

894
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:21,032
We should not be taking a vote on the calendar because it was already approved.

895
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:24,413
Correct.

896
01:30:24,573 --> 01:30:28,415
Is the motion to approve the school committee dates?

897
01:30:28,435 --> 01:30:28,715
2-2023.

898
01:30:28,755 --> 01:30:33,578
Through the chair, it was member Russo who motioned, and I seconded.

899
01:30:35,799 --> 01:30:36,599
Roll call, please.

900
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:45,184
I think, excuse me, point of information, I think member Graham was asking for clarification that the motion was to approve the school committee calendar.

901
01:30:47,305 --> 01:30:48,626
The school committee meeting calendar.

902

Yes, the motion is to approve the school committee meeting calendar, which is the dates that we will hold regular school committee meetings in the 2022-2023 school year.

909
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:18,412

Some of the affirmatives there in the negative motion passes.

01:31:36,986 --> 01:31:40,528
