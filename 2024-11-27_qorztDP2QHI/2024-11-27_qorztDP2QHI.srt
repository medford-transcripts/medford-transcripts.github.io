1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:05,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on Tuesday, May 28th, sorry, May, I'm looking at the wrong one.

2
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:08,272
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on May 28th, something is not quite right.

3
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:09,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on a second.

4
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny?

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:20,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The website description, there's actually three underlying links in that description.

7
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:25,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Look to the words strategic and you'll get to the right place.

8
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:30,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I did send an email to have that fixed.

9
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:33,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

10
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:39,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had the right one pulled up because I went through your email to find the right link.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I still had the wrong one.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So OK, here we go.

13
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:51,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be advised that on Tuesday, November 26, at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

21
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right, generally speaking?

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, okay.

23
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So member Rheinfeld.

24
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:52,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

25
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rousseau.

26
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:55,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

27
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And member Graham, I'm here.

28
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So three present, zero absent.

29
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:10,704
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, this is a continuation of our first subcommittee meeting that we held back on 10-15.

30
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:16,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goal of these two meetings is to sort of put together and formalize

31
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:31,014
[SPEAKER_03]: a view of our capital plan for the schools and think about what kind of recommendations we want to make to the broader school committee, which will happen at a meeting in December.

32
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the 11th.

33
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that we have a couple of guests joining us.

34
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:43,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Alicia Hunt from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and we have Paul Riggi from the City's Facility Team.

35
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome.

36
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:45,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us.

37
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm actually hopeful this meeting will not take an hour and a half.

38
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we, this is the first time we've done this process.

39
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:59,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tried to make sure that we had enough space in the schedule to do all the things that we needed to do.

40
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:12,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm going to bring up, um, the capital plan that we worked through last time and just provide a little bit of context for those of you who are, um, newer to,

41
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,489
[SPEAKER_03]: the conversation just as soon as I can find the plan.

42
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

43
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:37,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And this capital plan, the way that we created this is we started with last year's capital plan, which was created in a meeting as like a starting point back in like May or June.

44
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there,

45
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:58,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter did solicit input from the building principals to say what other capital needs exist in the district that we may or may not have on our radar in terms of things that we see.

46
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,784
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how this list has come to pass.

47
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:07,329
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things we talked a lot about in the last meeting was,

48
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:16,939
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of this intersection of a whole bunch of work happening at McGlynn and Andrews that this committee is aware of and apprised of.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of how does that play into the overall capital plan?

50
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:35,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually met yesterday with Director Hunt and Dr. Cushing and the OPM for the project to try to get some clarity around

51
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:50,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the work that's going on and just sort of having some discussion and we, we sort of did this when we met last time there was some question about like what's included in that project and what is excluded from that project.

52
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:58,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of that has come into focus a little bit more, or at least we have sort of a directional focus that can help.

53
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:07,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that we talked about with the OPM was sort of the timeline to prepare to keep the project on track.

54
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked the OPM also to be available to join us at our committee of the whole meeting, which actually will become a special school committee meeting.

55
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:37,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to give us an update on the project itself, but I can I'm happy to relay sort of what we talked about yesterday in terms of, like, you know, sort of things that are lumped into this and things that are excluded from this so that we can revise this capital plan.

56
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:42,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's, like, the biggest block of things that are in process right now.

57
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So in scope is the.

58
00:05:47,623 --> 00:06:11,876
[SPEAKER_03]: the piece that we think about as HVAC right for both schools McGlynn and Andrews so that's in scope there's not been a question about that but a couple of other things that we talked about and confirmed yesterday as directionally sort of where we're going

59
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: To include includes both the roof rebuild in some fashion at the McGlynn and the network splits and the many splits that are in the network closets in those two buildings.

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what these two rows are.

61
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:42,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to move them up here because this is up here is stuff that we're saying is in progress and funded.

62
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:49,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of these things sort of are bundled into the...

63
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:54,565
[SPEAKER_03]: project at this time.

64
00:06:55,385 --> 00:07:05,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that is going to allow is for the OPM to actually, because we have sort of like a chicken and egg situation going on, where we say, how are we going to pay for this?

65
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on how much it costs.

66
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on what's included.

67
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on how much it costs, which is sort of very typical at this point in these kinds of projects.

68
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we talked about yesterday was that,

69
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We are proceeding as though a bond will need to be issued by the city for this project and that it will include these components and solar for the roof.

70
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:51,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will enable the OPM to actually go put that package together with pricing so that then we can look at that comprehensively and say, okay, yes, that is the go forward plan.

71
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that is the funding mechanism.

72
00:07:55,518 --> 00:08:13,843
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to, the other thing we talked a little bit about as a group was in order to keep this project on track so that it can be completed before the next school year, there is a tiny window that we've got to get exactly right between now and February.

73
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:23,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you all recall, at the last school committee meeting, we took a vote to authorize the mayor to enter into a CM at risk contract.

74
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul and Alicia, feel free to jump in if I get this wrong, but what that allows us to do is bring the construction manager into the project sooner than we might otherwise do.

75
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:40,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows them to do things like.

76
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the equipment purchased that we are going to need that has long wait times while we wait for like the final design to be completed.

77
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:58,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So the timeline that we talked about yesterday was that really in order to keep on track, we need to be in a position to fund.

78
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:19,400
[SPEAKER_03]: the CM contract startup costs and the equipment costs in the month of January, which does mean that all of this question about funding and bonding has to make its way through the process between now and then, which does include an appearance at the council meeting, then an advertisement, and then a second appearance.

79
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right, Alicia?

80
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:24,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

81
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:25,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

82
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:26,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

83
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:32,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's many more steps than that.

84
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,468
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a grossly simplified version of what's happening.

85
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:55,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we did ask the OPM to do was to be prepared to come to our special meeting on the 11th to give us an update on the project, and particularly that timeline of what needs to happen, what do they need from us, do they need from the city side, et cetera, to make sure that the project stays on track.

86
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the McGlynn project in a nutshell.

87
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions about that one, Erica?

88
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:21,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, just to refresh, the funding source for that, some of it is allocated.

89
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's that coming from?

90
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,051
[SPEAKER_13]: How much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed?

91
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:31,972
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we didn't have the final number until recently.

92
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the OPM is under contract and being paid for.

93
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:40,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that is coming out of ARPA money.

94
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?

95
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

96
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of the rest of the costs, we have to bond in order to have the money to do that.

97
00:10:49,255 --> 00:11:00,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the bonding process is so important timeline-wise, because if we can't get those things in place in January, it's going to push the whole project.

98
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

99
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: back and then we're going to be, you know, back at, you know, in impeding on the start of school.

100
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:07,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

101
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:07,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

102
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:11,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I know we had designated some things for HVAC, but it's all bonded.

103
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

104
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, also includes roof.

105
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll go back to the end network.

106
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so in terms of in.

107
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Progress process.

108
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Activities those are that's sort of 1 big block.

109
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Of activity does that make sense?

110
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:57,802
[SPEAKER_03]: and we would consider all of those together.

111
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:09,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm putting that above the funding line, although obviously there's still a lot of work to do to secure all the right approvals, et cetera, for the bond, but that's sort of where we're at with that.

112
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense so far?

113
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:15,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee.

114
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:21,390
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.

115
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:31,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the school committee, actually, we won't vote on the funding piece of it because it is bonded.

116
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city is the only authority that can take out the bond.

117
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:35,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

118
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:40,057
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.

119
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:41,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

120
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:43,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

121
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

122
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other,

123
00:12:50,305 --> 00:13:14,581
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we did talk about that I think is really important, um, is we talked with the OPM about these, um, recommissioning assessments and that that's like another place where, um, broadly speaking, the OPM is on board to do those things, but funding has been such that, um,

124
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:22,358
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not clarity about when we wanted to do that because we didn't tell them and we didn't tell them because we didn't have money.

125
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 1 thing that I think we can sort of start to clear up what.

126
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about yesterday in addition is that is opening up an accelerated repair window, like, usually between usually, like, between January and.

127
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe April, March, April, and that accelerated repairs for things like roofs.

128
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Boilers HVAC, et cetera.

129
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:57,417
[SPEAKER_03]: MSP has adopted a new process where they'll open up a window this coming year.

130
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:03,421
[SPEAKER_03]: January to June or January to April, and then they will do it every other year.

131
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:09,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you hop into the window this year in January, you would learn if you.

132
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: were able to

133
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,030
[SPEAKER_03]: be funded sometime like around now.

134
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,853
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a long process to get the notification to start.

135
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:35,538
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we are interested in doing that, we have to either get in this year or it's two more years.

136
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:41,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be January 2027 before we would have another

137
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:49,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Go at it, I did talk to last week and they did confirm that.

138
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, districts who are in the core program can apply for accelerated repair projects.

139
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:03,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think, um, what probably makes sense is for this.

140
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, re, commissioning assessment line to sort of split into.

141
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:14,486
[SPEAKER_03]: To maybe 2 lines 1 is a mini assessment that would enable us to.

142
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:43,653
[SPEAKER_03]: if we need to take advantage of that accelerated repair program so that assessment could get us ready to submit for brooks roberts and missittuck if we find that the needs there are pressing and urgent when we talk about roofs and hvac um so what we may want to consider recommending to the committee is that we pursue a mini assessment that

143
00:15:44,341 --> 00:16:05,387
[SPEAKER_03]: looks at those pieces that are eligible for accelerated repair in an effort to put forward an application in that program this year if we qualify but we don't know yet so the thought the thought that we batted around yesterday was let's try to

144
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,631
[SPEAKER_03]: do some sort of mini assessment.

145
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,592
[SPEAKER_03]: The OPM is going to figure out what the cost of that is.

146
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:18,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on that mini assessment, it will inform our ability to go into this accelerated repair program.

147
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:31,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we have clarity on that, then we can circle back around to the sort of like regular routine recommissioning projects into the future.

148
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:35,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would get us sort of on track.

149
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

150
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:42,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions about that?

151
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:02,538
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to give us the price.

152
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:08,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I get that, I will fill that in.

153
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:18,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, um, one thing we may want to do is identify this as like a thing that we are recommending that we take up urgently.

154
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:27,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so in the project status, there may be some things where we say, we're recommending that we do this in FY 25.

155
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:33,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we can have that discussion with the committee and make sure that they agree with us.

156
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you all think about that.

157
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good to me.

158
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:53,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming.

159
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,613
[SPEAKER_13]: And are those, do you know, are those typically funded at the full cost?

160
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:17,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?

161
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's usually a portion.

162
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:22,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't think it's full funding, but it is a piece of it.

163
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:32,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then the other idea that.

164
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:49,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I had is that we at some point talk about, um, with the OPM, this idea of a district wide electrification enablement assessment and where that might fit and whether that is in the scope of their work.

165
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:57,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we did not do that yesterday because we had sort of a full plate, but, um, I don't

166
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:03,504
[SPEAKER_03]: think we necessarily need to recommend that we proceed with that in FY 25.

167
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: But that could be something that we circle back to with the OPM, who obviously is getting to know our buildings intimately and would be in probably a decent position to be able to do that.

168
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:27,969
[SPEAKER_13]: This was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with similar efforts parallel efforts in other city buildings.

169
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:33,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.

170
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, good evening.

171
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:41,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, there will be.

172
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,587
[SPEAKER_07]: We are applying.

173
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:52,636
[SPEAKER_07]: We're basically doing the certification to be a particular kind of green communities, a green communities leadership program.

174
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And through that program, there's going to be technical assistance.

175
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:09,445
[SPEAKER_07]: to help with some of this evaluation of buildings and we always include our school buildings in that so that that would be in what we say we own for something like that.

176
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:25,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Brenda Pike in my office is working through that process and is keeping an eye out for those timelines and she I could get I wasn't anticipating that question this evening but I could easily get her to give you guys some information on that.

177
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:35,694
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we could look at the technical assistance because there's a lot of incentives from the state to move forward with electrification.

178
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:42,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole make a plan, figure it out and then help with the actual doing is stuff they're looking to do.

179
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're putting ourselves into that program.

180
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I would love to that timeline.

181
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,042
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fantastic.

182
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:55,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?

183
00:20:56,031 --> 00:21:00,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, I'll shoot her a note asking her if she could put something together.

184
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:05,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I suspected if she was sitting here right now, she could have just given it to you off the top of her head.

185
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:09,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I can't that's why I have good staff.

186
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:10,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

187
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:13,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

188
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:21,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I think the other question, um.

189
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Is around.

190
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:39,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just move this down here.

191
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:49,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of these other projects that we are suggesting that we are recommending proceeding with in FY25.

192
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:53,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time we met, we talked about

193
00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:25,640
[SPEAKER_03]: the five-pump control in the McGlynn, the failed flashing behind the brick facade, and the freight motor elevator as being like, and the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation being urgent types of projects that we should consider recommending that the school committee look for funding for.

194
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know if you all have any thoughts about that in terms of, like, which ones we should be recommending.

195
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:35,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I certainly, um.

196
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many years we've been talking about bike racks.

197
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:43,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of tired of talking about bike racks.

198
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:49,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, um, well, it's.

199
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot compared to a lot of the other things it still surprises me how much bike racks will cost us.

200
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:55,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

201
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:12,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we lose you?

202
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:15,794
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I apologize.

203
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a baby in the background, so I do apologize for that as well.

204
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:22,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not apologize for the baby, but she's a little distraught.

205
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:24,921
[SPEAKER_10]: The bike racks are in the process of being ordered.

206
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:39,592
[SPEAKER_10]: We received $20,000 from Community Preservation to install modern up-to-date bike racks and bike repair stations for the McGlynn, Andrews, and the high school.

207
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,794
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are in the process of being ordered.

208
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:49,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Surprisingly, there are delays in that supply chain.

209
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, I apologize, can you hear me?

210
00:23:54,153 --> 00:24:21,605
[SPEAKER_10]: yes but so there's two pieces there's one that is above the line and it says it's grant funded by the cpc um and there's one that's below the line that's for brooks mistletoe and roberts and i think that's the one paul is referring to if you're uh yep i mean we could definitely do that or wait until the next round of cpc funding in the summertime uh to uh request of that and demonstrate the project that's completed

211
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:32,035
[SPEAKER_10]: or just take it out of the local capital budget?

212
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:34,877
[SPEAKER_03]: If the CPC has been amenable to that,

213
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: project and we think that that's a good thing to at least try to leverage the CPC funding for.

214
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what we recommend to the school committee.

215
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions, thoughts, Erica, Paul?

216
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:54,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

217
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

218
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:04,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, member Graham, I also it appears I updated the wrong capital planning spreadsheet with numbers.

219
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:09,649
[SPEAKER_10]: for McGlynn and Andrews parking.

220
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,551
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in the neighborhood of $1.3 million.

221
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:16,792
[SPEAKER_10]: To do granite curbs is $125 per linear foot, comes out to about $600,000.

222
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,393
[SPEAKER_10]: The pavement is about $400,000 to do the bus loops and the

223
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,594
[SPEAKER_10]: the bus loops and the parking lots at those two schools.

224
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:45,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in speaking to the city engineer, Owen Wartella, he suggested because of the price fluctuations in asphalt to do a 30% contingency, which is $300,000.

225
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:46,589
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be $1.3 million on that.

226
00:25:50,347 --> 00:26:03,460
[SPEAKER_10]: The, the re the Plaza, the ADA compliance of that I believe I forwarded it, this email on on on October 22, but that is a ballpark.

227
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:07,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And unfortunately it's it's one of those things, another chicken and an egg.

228
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know it until you're necessarily into it.

229
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:20,850
[SPEAKER_10]: in the neighborhood of $300,000 to $600,000 to fix that plaza, the entry plazas for the McGlynn and the Andrews.

230
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,791
[SPEAKER_10]: The drainage at the Brooks to do the curbing is about $7,500.

231
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:30,192
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two French drains that, number one, seem a bit undersized.

232
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:47,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And number two, and once again, I apologize, definitely need to be cleaned out, but they seem undersized for the water that they might be required to handle.

233
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:56,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would probably be in the neighborhood of an additional $15,000 for 22,500 in that ballpark.

234
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will go on mute and I'm here if you need me.

235
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just ask you a question about that one?

236
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that assuming DPW has the capacity to do the work?

237
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:10,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that somebody else is doing it.

238
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:12,974
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be somebody else doing it.

239
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:16,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think if we want to like.

240
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:24,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I think has a lot on their plate and if we want to get the project done, we may have to get the project done.

241
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the front Plaza, we had.

242
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:35,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere between 300,000 and 550,000 between design and construction, is that correct?

243
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think the higher number came in at 600.

244
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:37,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

245
00:27:55,891 --> 00:28:00,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC?

246
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:02,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Did we get an answer on that?

247
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:08,617
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.

248
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,378
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no real connection.

249
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

250
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:31,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt, while we have you here, the issue is both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, the front plaza is settling and causing an ADA issue.

251
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:33,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there

252
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:51,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Other funding sources besides just city cash that we should be considering here from a grant perspective or particularly because of the ADA aspects of that.

253
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:57,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen any.

254
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,145
[SPEAKER_07]: good funding sources for ADA compliance.

255
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:09,287
[SPEAKER_07]: There tends to be an attitude of, it's your responsibility, and so you should fund it.

256
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:15,128
[SPEAKER_07]: When we've seen things, they've been so small that, you know, a couple of thousand dollars here or there.

257
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:15,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

258
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,989
[SPEAKER_07]: The paperwork usually.

259
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

260
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And former member McLaughlin had mentioned

261
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:31,218
[SPEAKER_13]: a grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for.

262
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,902
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it.

263
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:38,264
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if that's something that we can revisit.

264
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:43,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje.

265
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:49,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Cushing, are you there?

266
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:52,229
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

267
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:53,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you quickly restate the question?

268
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,651
[SPEAKER_13]: I was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned.

269
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:05,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we couldn't get the application in one year, and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.

270
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:09,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if that's true.

271
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:09,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

272
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:13,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So Director Nwaloje worked on that this past year.

273
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:21,039
[SPEAKER_10]: She encountered the same frustrations and issues with that online submission.

274
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:37,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, uh, like, uh, frustration to the point of not being able, uh, in similar to what we went through, um, of, um, it, it, it is the most archaic submission system I've ever seen.

275
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:47,053
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, it has caused, uh, you know, we're going to have to work at it this year, but to figure it out, but that was taken on the city side this year.

276
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:53,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was taken on the city side, but ultimately not successful.

277
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:54,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

278
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:55,836
[SPEAKER_03]: In submission.

279
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:56,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

280
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:01,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you say we're gonna have to do it again this year, who do you mean is going to do it?

281
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:14,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we're gonna have to figure out, we're gonna reach out to the state partners on it to try to figure out how the best way to actually submit this is because we have proven in two years unsuccessful.

282
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:16,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And who's we?

283
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:23,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to submit it twice in... No, but who's reaching out, I think is my question.

284
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this something Francis is doing?

285
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something we are doing?

286
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:31,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, who's doing this reaching out part?

287
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:37,457
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll either be myself or Francis to do that work, to reach out to them and to figure it out.

288
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: If something's fall crashing my house, not sure what it is.

289
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Then let me ask a clarifying question about these items.

290
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:05,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we out of compliance or are we in danger of being out of compliance?

291
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:26,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that right now the buildings are not accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act for entry into the buildings by the main entrance and the doors affected.

292
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:38,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And are the fixes that are costed out here, I know the range is big,

293
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:46,769
[SPEAKER_13]: will those have sufficient longevity that we won't need to be looking at this again in the immediate future?

294
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:47,210
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a real fix.

295
00:32:51,303 --> 00:33:05,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, in speaking to the people at Weston and Sampson, they're gonna if I remember correctly from the October 22nd email there, they think that this will be a permanent fix because they think that the settling has occurred.

296
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:09,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And, but once they get into it, they'll be able to, they'll be able to test.

297
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,101
[SPEAKER_10]: and to see, to make sure.

298
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:15,944
[SPEAKER_10]: But the idea is that we're not doing this once every 20 years.

299
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:23,328
[SPEAKER_10]: The idea is to fix it, to maintain it, and to make sure that it is still accessible.

300
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:29,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Cushing, when you say we need to work with the state partners, who are they?

301
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:35,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm forgetting the exact name of the office that runs that grant.

302
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:36,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it

303
00:33:37,719 --> 00:34:03,021
[SPEAKER_03]: a commonwealth office or is it yes it is a common nope it's commonwealth office um do you think it would be helpful to reach out to our state delegation to ask for their assistance or alicia do you have thoughts on how to navigate this i know we haven't given you really any information so

304
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:18,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to get a clarifying if you don't mind was is the problem that you're talking about is the system combines and is it literally the application, or is the problem, getting the right materials together to qualify.

305
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:27,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, we've had all the materials together to qualify we've had all the appropriate plans requirements, all those types of things.

306
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:35,348
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a form that times out in an exceptionally short amount of time it does not save.

307
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:42,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We have on numerous occasions entered and re-entered and tried.

308
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:56,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We were told not this past year, but the previous year when I did the submissions that they would accept it, that it was in, but then I don't think we qualified, but it is the tool itself

309
00:34:57,122 --> 00:35:10,144
[SPEAKER_10]: to go online and to enter it is an exceedingly archaic submission tool to work with.

310
00:35:10,924 --> 00:35:13,905
[SPEAKER_10]: On the school side, we've moved to a system called GEMS.

311
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:25,807
[SPEAKER_10]: It is unlike any other grant submission software or program that I've seen in having done this now with both state and federal agencies.

312
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:42,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I ask because we've run into technical problems with grant applications in the past, and usually when we reach out to the granting agency, they are aware that their system is a problem and they have a workaround.

313
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's surprising to me that they haven't just said to you, just email us the forms.

314
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:54,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that has not been said, and there have been no workarounds offered.

315
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:55,741
[SPEAKER_10]: At least when I did it.

316
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:03,355
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can interject, it's the Massachusetts Office on Disability that is providing these grants.

317
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

318
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,656
[SPEAKER_05]: The Disability Commission?

319
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:14,598
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Massachusetts Office on Disability, unless they've renamed themselves.

320
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:15,178
OK.

321
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,765
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have renamed themselves to this, but I know I spoke this week to Frances about this.

322
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:31,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said she submitted it, and then the application disappeared from the system.

323
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,693
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't understand why.

324
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:37,975
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a problematic system.

325
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:45,321
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually, when you start the application, you have to complete it.

326
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:54,443
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're doing it, there's no way on their site to save it and then come back later if they ask you for information.

327
00:36:55,703 --> 00:37:02,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very cumbersome and doesn't operate like any other website that's out there.

328
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:14,771
[SPEAKER_10]: And just so the committee, the subcommittee is aware, you know, 18 months ago or so, or 13 months ago, whenever it was that I was working on it,

329
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:19,689
[SPEAKER_10]: We were looking to do curb cuts at Medford High School.

330
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:32,656
[SPEAKER_10]: We were looking to do wayfinding signs within Medford High School and in other places in the district for accessibility as those were the two primary fixes that we were looking for.

331
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:42,581
[SPEAKER_10]: We were looking for 19 curb cuts, I believe it was, at Medford High School, as well as to do the parking improvements for

332
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,083
[SPEAKER_10]: ADA accessible spaces.

333
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:54,667
[SPEAKER_10]: That work has been completed on the local budget, but we did that work at the end of last year, April of last year.

334
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to suggest that

335
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:10,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Our recommendation to the committee is that we successfully, for the first time, submit this grant.

336
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:24,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And that meanwhile, I'm going to send a note to our state delegation asking for their assistance in how they can help get this moving in the right direction.

337
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:29,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Edward Benson?

338
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:41,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, at the time, when we encountered all of the technical difficulties, I was in communication with Representative Sean Garberly.

339
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was aware.

340
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,662
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point in time, everything had been lost.

341
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:48,742
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought it was in there.

342
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:50,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got lost.

343
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:55,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was aware of all of the technical difficulty that we had.

344
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So he may be a good starting point.

345
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:57,784
[SPEAKER_00]: When we

346
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,208
[SPEAKER_00]: start the process again to keep him looped in from the beginning.

347
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

348
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:15,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I will send a note to reach out to him if the, if this group and then ultimately the committee is agreeable that the recommendation is we should submit a grant this year.

349
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:19,738
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should.

350
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:25,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think we can't be dependent on this grant coming through to get in compliance for accessibility.

351
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:30,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this has to be a priority with or without the grant.

352
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see if we can't move that along grant-wise.

353
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:45,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, that may need to be a request.

354
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:59,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you asked what else here in the shaded portion is a priority.

355
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:03,773
[SPEAKER_13]: When you say the flashing failed, the word failed is always worrisome.

356
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:06,975
[SPEAKER_13]: What does that mean for those of us who are not stonemasons?

357
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:12,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It means it rains inside the kindergarten when there's a driving sideways wind.

358
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:16,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and we're fixing that for the roofs on other buildings.

359
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,963
[SPEAKER_13]: That also feels like a... Mend.

360
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:41,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and so my question, sorry to interrupt, my question on this is, all right, you know, we could move this project forward now with, you know, with funds that are becoming available, or, you know, like, I mean, this is a long standing problem.

361
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to get it fixed.

362
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:50,954
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could also see a realm where it's rolled into the roof replacement slash roof repair restoration.

363
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,098
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also don't necessarily want to wait on it.

364
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,786
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the flashing on the brick related to the roof?

365
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:09,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all where that section of the building connects back in.

366
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:22,142
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, while that work is done on the roof and building envelope, I would make sure that it is written into the scope that that has to be addressed.

367
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:27,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The flashing issue behind the brick is not at the roof line, is it?

368
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It appears to be.

369
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:36,719
[SPEAKER_08]: It appears to be.

370
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, have you all talked about that piece of that at all?

371
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:54,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should we ask Tom about potential integration of that into the bigger project?

372
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know there are some flashing issues on the roof.

373
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:05,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I hadn't heard that there was a problem down the side, like behind the bricks and all.

374
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: If it is in fact that the water's getting in at the roof level, that makes sense as opposed to, you know, coming really straight through the wall, which sounds odd to me, but I don't know, it could be.

375
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:23,250
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get a full quote

376
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:25,953
[SPEAKER_07]: an assessment for the roof.

377
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:35,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that if we mentioned this problem to the people looking at that, they could tell us if they believe that it's a problem.

378
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We already know that.

379
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:43,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a water infiltration test.

380
00:42:43,946 --> 00:42:48,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we did a water infiltration test that I've circulated around.

381
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:51,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, I apologize that I didn't circulate it to you.

382
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,991
[SPEAKER_10]: But, and there's again, once again, the topic of the night, chicken and egg.

383
00:42:57,011 --> 00:43:09,115
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in order to repair this and build a scope of work, we needed a scope of work to build the scope of work and another circular issue.

384
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:21,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's in any way related to the flashing on the roof, then it clearly makes sense that it should be at least.

385
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:32,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I wonder, I don't know, maybe Peter knows, is there work that needs to be done literally on the bricks and behind the bricks, or if it's just roof-level work?

386
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:38,846
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's roof-level work, then do it with rebuilding the roof or even the roof wall connection.

387
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:52,792
[SPEAKER_10]: It appears that it may be the roof wall connection, as well as removing three courses of bricks along a section of the rear of the building.

388
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Will that come out in this mini recommissioning assessment that we've just split off?

389
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we already have done that for this problem.

390
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We just haven't funded it to actually fix it.

391
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a known problem that requires funding.

392
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:14,815
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about $80,000.

393
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:22,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I spoke with a community member who has extensive construction background about this because he was surprised at how much it would cost.

394
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:28,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we looked at what was in the high level assessment.

395
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,748
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like, oh, well.

396
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:33,009
[SPEAKER_10]: that seems actually appropriate.

397
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:42,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it would generally speaking be about $20,000 in construction management costs to manage the project and make sure it's done right, and then $80,000 in actual equipment time materials.

398
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:50,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

399
00:44:50,138 --> 00:45:01,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So one thing is that I see is that if we already have people mobilized to be doing work on the building and to oversee construction, et cetera, then there's some cost savings, right?

400
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:06,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there is this idea of mobilization, getting the contractors and stuff out to the site.

401
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:12,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And then every time you do that, that's an added cost, um, because of all their overheads.

402
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:17,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it is an option to do it together, then there is some,

403
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:27,635
[SPEAKER_07]: economies of savings, there is, you know, it's certainly that's, and I do question, can you actually fix it without doing the roof?

404
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:41,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are those two integrally, like, if you were to fix the area behind the bricks, but not the part on the roof, which is the flashing, does that defeat the purpose and the problem reoccurs?

405
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:43,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So you actually need to do them together.

406
00:45:51,865 --> 00:46:01,631
[SPEAKER_10]: And then another idea would be to just replace this section of the roof now and the course of bricks and all that.

407
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:09,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know what that would do to increase that $100,000 cost when adding in the roof or roof reconditioning.

408
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:19,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is one we definitely get called on every time it happens, because it's not like a little water streaming down.

409
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:20,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot.

410
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:36,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not it is we're still talking about the McGlynn right yeah yes it doesn't make any sense to do part of the roof and not the whole like if you're going to do the whole roof within the next six months.

411
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:49,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Director Hunt, the this roof is a lower portion of the building that juts out the classrooms in that area jut out probably about 30 or 40 feet.

412
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:53,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it has it's they have their own separate lower roof.

413
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:55,530
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a one story roof.

414
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:56,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

415
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:05,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I would normally agree with you 100%, however, it is almost a separate roof from the main larger roof.

416
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:07,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Not almost, it is.

417
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:14,959
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies, I'm looking at the overview and I never realized that that existed as a separate little roof.

418
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, it's a fun architectural thing that I wish didn't exist.

419
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:24,615
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, member Russo is 100% right.

420
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:25,756
[SPEAKER_10]: We get called on it.

421
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:32,178
[SPEAKER_10]: It is definitely something that was brought to the committee's attention, I believe, in November or October of 2021.

422
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:42,763
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another thing I was going to add, but hopefully it'll come back to me.

423
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:43,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

424
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I can get a note to the, we can get a note to the about.

425
00:47:55,737 --> 00:48:03,063
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece, so that there's at least an opportunity to talk about whether inclusion in the project is an economy of scale or not.

426
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:05,665
[SPEAKER_03]: But also.

427
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:10,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk to them about.

428
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:19,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether there's an opportunity to advance this work ahead of the rest of the work, because it is its own separate little roof.

429
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:23,340
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not the same as, like.

430
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:32,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger roof project, so we can get that information and integrate it before the special meeting that we have.

431
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:38,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And member Graham, I do have one other number that I think I forgot to mention earlier.

432
00:48:38,276 --> 00:48:44,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Our roofing inspector conducted an infrared scan of the roof.

433
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, and Director Riggi can jump on this.

434
00:48:50,384 --> 00:49:00,406
[SPEAKER_10]: The initial thoughts on a visual inspection of the roof, a few weeks ago, the thought was that it was about maybe 10% wet, that that could be fixed.

435
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,287
[SPEAKER_10]: The infrared scan revealed 20 to 25%.

436
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:09,924
[SPEAKER_10]: water saturation, water infiltration, the right terms.

437
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:18,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not doing right now, but he then changed his recommendation and said that it should either be a reconditioning

438
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:30,016
[SPEAKER_10]: which would be similar to what was done at the Andrews, or a roof replacement which would increase the insulation.

439
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:39,000
[SPEAKER_10]: The number I'm recollecting on the roof reconditioning slash restoration is $1.4 to $1.6 million.

440
00:49:42,685 --> 00:49:59,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas the roof replacement, which includes all new insulation, but both products are guaranteed or are listed at a 20 year roof so the white night slash film that goes over the roof.

441
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:03,960
[SPEAKER_10]: similar to the Andrews is 20 years, a new roof, 20 years.

442
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,463
[SPEAKER_10]: The price on the second option for full roof replacement with the added insulation is at $2.8 to $3.0 million.

443
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:12,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

444
00:50:12,683 --> 00:50:12,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

445
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

446
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:31,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did you also get a price for the dump the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation?

447
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:35,922
[SPEAKER_10]: So the door sweeps are nowhere near as expensive as we thought.

448
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:38,344
[SPEAKER_10]: That can be covered in the local budget and will be.

449
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:47,793
[SPEAKER_10]: The dumpsters, I'm awaiting emails back from waste management on what the cost would be to move from.

450
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:53,658
[SPEAKER_10]: We currently own our dumpsters and own our equipment to move towards a lease option on those.

451
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not have that number at this time.

452
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:03,507
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get those numbers, can we, can you let me know and I'll update this?

453
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:04,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

454
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:06,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

455
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:18,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we have some items here, the network closet mini splits for Brooks, Ms.

456
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck-Roberts and Medford High.

457
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:28,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We were, Dr. Cushing, you were in the process of

458
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:33,172
[SPEAKER_03]: parsing out that estimate of like McGlynn Andrews versus everybody else.

459
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:33,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?

460
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:35,013
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

461
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:37,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not finished that and we'll get that to you as well.

462
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you help us understand like how, um, urgent is this need at Brooks Roberts, Mississauga, Medford High?

463
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:53,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, it's beyond urgent.

464
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:56,100
[SPEAKER_10]: The systems have essentially, the systems have failed.

465
00:51:57,602 --> 00:52:06,627
[SPEAKER_10]: They're 20 years old, many of them original to the building, and they have either all failed or in their last stages of failing.

466
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:15,992
[SPEAKER_10]: As Member Rousseau can definitely back me up and attest, network infrastructure requires climate controlled.

467
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:21,415
[SPEAKER_10]: They generate a tremendous amount of heat, and especially in those small closets,

468
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:37,265
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to be climate controlled or quite literally they will cook themselves as we are seeing one other project that I'm working on is rebuilding our network infrastructure we have a significant amount of E rate funding available to us.

469
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:43,585
[SPEAKER_10]: that we have not accessed, the lion's share of it.

470
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:52,732
[SPEAKER_10]: But in order to access those funds, we would have to put up in the neighborhood of $150,000 to $200,000 because basically the government does a 60% match.

471
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:02,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're right now building a proposal with our E-rate consultant on this.

472
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:09,941
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the E-rate money does not, it only supports networking and direct network infrastructure.

473
00:53:10,441 --> 00:53:17,783
[SPEAKER_10]: It does not consider these mini splits and cooling systems as part of that infrastructure.

474
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:21,404
[SPEAKER_10]: It is ancillary to, although really required.

475
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So those systems have failed.

476
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:27,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have a report.

477
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:41,607
[SPEAKER_10]: on that that I can share with everybody from Royal Air, met with them and went through every single system in the district and what would be needed to replace them.

478
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:52,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And then B2Q has done the designing of it, which, you know, it's basically figuring out the best system of the mini splits to put in.

479
00:53:52,994 --> 00:54:04,517
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a few various options, but they are, right now, the refrigeration and HVAC world seems to be going through a lot of shifts with various refrigerants.

480
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:11,018
[SPEAKER_10]: The equipment we'd need to replace them really would not be available until Q2 of next year.

481
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:19,957
[SPEAKER_10]: April, May, June timeframe.

482
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:31,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you suggesting that we need to prioritize this in FY25 or that we should prioritize this for FY26?

483
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:38,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it needs to be prioritized across the district as an urgent need.

484
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:48,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be unwise to replace the network infrastructure in an environment that is simply going to cause it to fail.

485
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:58,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So 25, does that recommend proceeding in FY 25 is the recommendation?

486
00:54:59,351 --> 00:54:59,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

487
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have the fire pump control at the McGlynn Elementary.

488
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:09,921
[SPEAKER_10]: That can be removed.

489
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:10,961
[SPEAKER_10]: That has been replaced.

490
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it's complete then.

491
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

492
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:23,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

493
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we even have a section for complete?

494
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:32,245
[SPEAKER_08]: First time for everything.

495
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

496
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:35,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it at the top.

497
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,081
[SPEAKER_14]: And the 1st thing in a new tab is what that is.

498
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:50,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, project status complete.

499
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of in progress excellent news.

500
00:55:56,495 --> 00:56:00,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have the freight elevator motor at Medford high.

501
00:56:02,595 --> 00:56:04,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got an update on this today.

502
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Riggi was with me when we got it.

503
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:24,168
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to figure out the actual pricing, but it has been recommended that when this motor is either rebuilt or replaced, that the controls for the freight elevator already should be replaced because it will

504
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:29,274
[SPEAKER_10]: They will need to be replaced shortly thereafter if we don't do it at the same time.

505
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:37,778
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're trying to get, we're going to get some clarity on pricing to make sure that it was fully inclusive of everything I need.

506
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,781
[SPEAKER_10]: But Paul, if you have, Paul Riggi, if you have anything to add on that, please feel free.

507
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,186
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Dr. Cushing, you're exactly right.

508
00:56:51,706 --> 00:57:14,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The elevator company that I used when they looked at it said based on the age of not only the motor, but the controls for the motor, that it would not be in our best interest to do one without the other because then we're guaranteed that they would work properly going forward.

509
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:24,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And is this member and member so a recommendation for twenty five.

510
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, I think so this isn't on the verge of failing or this isn't already failed.

511
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:38,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It failed due to the flood last year.

512
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:42,520
[SPEAKER_01]: The motor is not even in the building anymore.

513
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with one of the elevator companies.

514
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it has failed.

515
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

516
00:57:52,247 --> 00:58:04,356
[SPEAKER_03]: And the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation, are we putting that in a recommend proceeding in 25?

517
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:06,402
[SPEAKER_03]: category?

518
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:13,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if I can offer a suggestion, I think both of those should be.

519
00:58:15,227 --> 00:58:21,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get not just cost, but a real understanding of the dumpsters.

520
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe, yep.

521
00:58:24,511 --> 00:58:29,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to make sure I get a comprehensive understanding of the dumpsters and what needs to be done.

522
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to ask if you could remind us.

523
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:33,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

524
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:35,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, members.

525
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:38,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you remind us what the dumpster situation is?

526
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:45,284
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're essentially, they appear to be, all of the dumpsters have been previously repaired.

527
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:47,766
[SPEAKER_10]: They've rusted previously.

528
00:58:47,786 --> 00:58:49,988
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been sent back to waste management.

529
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:51,208
[SPEAKER_10]: We've paid for repairs.

530
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:59,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And what director McLaughlin has told me is that, you know, there's no more opportunity to really repair them.

531
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:04,110
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't see why we would want to purchase dumpsters again.

532
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Seems like if we have a problem with a dumpster in the future, we're leasing it.

533
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:17,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Waste management, please come take the dumpster and replace it with something that's going to be preventing rodents and leaking trash and things like that.

534
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:27,757
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that we've talked a little bit with waste management about as part of our new waste program for the city.

535
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have some pricing with them, we have a direct contact with them.

536
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:38,985
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be clear, what you have at all the schools are compactors with dumpsters in them that have rotted out.

537
00:59:41,727 --> 01:00:01,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to have a consultant, a waste consultant, just come and take a look because it might be that the, and we have somebody who I believe who could do that for free, who might, it might make sense to have regular dumpsters that are emptied weekly might be cheaper than replacing the compactors.

538
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:09,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little unclear to me if you can just, like if you rent a dumpster from waste management that you put inside the compactor that actually

539
01:00:10,696 --> 01:00:11,376
[SPEAKER_07]: possible.

540
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we may be looking at replacing the compactors with dumpsters emptied weekly and that might be cheaper than purchasing new compactors.

541
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:31,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's something that let me hook you up if Director Cushing is the right, sorry I'm

542
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:41,378
[SPEAKER_07]: is the right contact to get you in touch with the people at Waste Management who we've been talking with a little bit about this.

543
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:45,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It fell off my radar, but we were thinking about it about a year ago.

544
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:50,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I emailed those individuals that we were speaking with a year ago.

545
01:00:50,886 --> 01:00:52,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just awaiting a reply.

546
01:00:52,167 --> 01:01:00,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to ask what the timeline for the assessment is, but it sounds like we don't have that number either.

547
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:19,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I also don't know if that would necessarily need to fall under capital, if it becomes part of the annual, if we're not making a large purchase of dumpsters and instead we're moving to a lease option, whatever it may be, whatever it may be, but.

548
01:01:21,376 --> 01:01:24,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what I wrote was recommend proceeding in FY 26 potential

549
01:01:31,664 --> 01:01:37,367
[SPEAKER_03]: From the operating budget, because I think realistically.

550
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:42,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the end of the year and that's why 25 ends in June.

551
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:46,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going to boil the ocean between now and then, like.

552
01:01:48,024 --> 01:01:55,545
[SPEAKER_03]: realistically, we're not going to get to doing a replacement of something like this until summer, which is already FY 26.

553
01:01:55,725 --> 01:02:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the goal is like between now and then we like figure out what the right go forward plan is and whether that's capital or, or budget or whatever, it's, I think what I'm hearing is it's FY 26.

554
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:14,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys agree with that?

555
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:16,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

556
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:17,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

557
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:20,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

558
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:24,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And then drainage at the field for the Brooks.

559
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:27,294
[SPEAKER_12]: This year.

560
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:31,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

561
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:35,019
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very long time coming.

562
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,101
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids are going to graduate before it gets fixed.

563
01:02:38,442 --> 01:02:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And it happened.

564
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:42,004
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in elementary school when we started this conversation.

565
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have what we need to do that?

566
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't it's up.

567
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it sounds like we have a quote.

568
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:53,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a funding issue.

569
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And is it going to affect?

570
01:02:57,036 --> 01:02:58,077
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how long it takes.

571
01:02:58,157 --> 01:02:58,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it?

572
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:02,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Are people using the field now?

573
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so is.

574
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:07,884
[SPEAKER_13]: How long does it take?

575
01:03:07,904 --> 01:03:14,609
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember when the Roberts playground drainage issue was happening and kids couldn't play on the playground and I won't mention that.

576
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:20,011
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be able to... This isn't under the field.

577
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:22,772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the hill.

578
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:23,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

579
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:27,895
[SPEAKER_03]: That, like, essentially dumps runoff onto the field.

580
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:36,819
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's because the hill is not properly drained, so the field shouldn't be impacted by the work, I would think.

581
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so this isn't going to disrupt essential recess activities.

582
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:44,303
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

583
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:45,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so, right, Peter?

584
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:50,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, I mean, if anything, maybe a few days, but not nowhere near.

585
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:53,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Any type of a lengthy disruption.

586
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:57,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and then yeah.

587
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:00,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, got it.

588
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:06,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these items, the other things on the list here.

589
01:04:08,536 --> 01:04:14,099
[SPEAKER_03]: are all, uh, this whole group, I think I would suggest that we leave them as not committed.

590
01:04:14,179 --> 01:04:24,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are things we have to plan for in the future, but the mini assessment is going to tell us what that means.

591
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:37,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so ready to support taking any like urgent, immediate action in terms of funding, but we should leave them on the plan because they are upcoming needs that we know we're going to need to think about.

592
01:04:39,148 --> 01:04:42,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the other remaining items on the list.

593
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:46,957
[SPEAKER_03]: With district wide security upgrades.

594
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:52,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have playground renovations also that are, um.

595
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:54,185
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess.

596
01:04:55,629 --> 01:04:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like urgent things are falling apart.

597
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were also noted in our last meeting as things we could possibly talk to the CPC about.

598
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing is the parking lot paving.

599
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:13,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I interject on the playground?

600
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:13,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

601
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:14,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

602
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,721
[SPEAKER_10]: But happy memory.

603
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:17,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So go ahead.

604
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:18,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, my apologies.

605
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:23,203
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I just wanted to talk about the district wide security upgrades.

606
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there can we parse that a bit?

607
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:34,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a portion of that that I think we should do sooner or consider doing sooner.

608
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:36,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the

609
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:44,766
[SPEAKER_06]: the key lists, the IDs to get in, the FOBs or whatever they're called, Peter, you have to fill me in on that.

610
01:05:45,586 --> 01:06:06,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Key FOBs, and I actually have reached out to the first of the three companies I've worked with previously to update the quotes on that, but to also include, well, our telephone project has been great in all honesty, and I would consider it a very successful deployment.

611
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,632
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the problems that we're facing is with the door phones.

612
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you walk up to any of the five schools, all right, not the high school, but any of the other five schools and not the Curtis Tufts, what you're actually pushing is a telephone that is set to ring someplace.

613
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:28,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are 20 years old.

614
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:32,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And just, we didn't have the money to put in the scope to do that work.

615
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:37,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're, they're having issues, some of them, not all of them.

616
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:50,971
[SPEAKER_10]: But what would be nice is to also have an integrated doorbell that has a camera so that security or secretarial or building leadership can see who is at the door clearly.

617
01:06:52,016 --> 01:07:04,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I've had them price out, um, putting those in at, um, the elementary schools, which is two, because they basically all have two entrances, um, and then the loading docks.

618
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:13,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So three at those schools, um, two at the Andrews, and I think either two or three at the McGlynn.

619
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:14,975
[SPEAKER_10]: The McGlynn, while a bigger campus,

620
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:22,959
[SPEAKER_10]: has an interesting setup that there's really no need for one on the back door if we go to key fobs but one on the main door and one on the loading dock.

621
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:26,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe we just went with two there for the quote.

622
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do have those quotes updated.

623
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:35,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe that that I would highly recommend it as work that we should do.

624
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:47,574
[SPEAKER_10]: because it gives you a clear and accurate record of who's entering your building when and provides you with really enhanced security.

625
01:07:48,014 --> 01:07:52,916
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I will say that I realize my limitations.

626
01:07:53,756 --> 01:08:09,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would recommend that as part of this, we either use the house doctors that the city has set up for architectural firms or some other security management firm to manage the deployment so that it's successful.

627
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a number on that if you so desire.

628
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So, members, so are there 3 parts keyless locks intercom.

629
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:35,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And the doors right Peter.

630
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:41,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, 1 of them was very expensive and that's is that the doors that are the well, no, it's.

631
01:08:41,988 --> 01:08:46,552
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's the camera is the camera upgrading the cameras across the district.

632
01:08:47,173 --> 01:09:02,523
[SPEAKER_10]: was going to be the more expensive, um, to do the, to do key fob access at the schools, um, which is between three and five, between three and five doors at each school, a few more at Medford high school.

633
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:15,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and the integrated, uh, like the cameras on the doorbells, uh, is, is, you know, approximately $260,000.

634
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:32,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it's $260,000 for three to five doors and employee fobs, or it's $260,000 for all of that plus the camera intercom buzzer system.

635
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:39,410
[SPEAKER_10]: All of that at every school, by the way, just so you know, at every school, I apologize, I'm breaking up.

636
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:52,835
[SPEAKER_10]: At every school, three to five doors, a few more at Medford High School, key fobs and the integrated camera doorbells at the schools, yes, 260.

637
01:09:54,536 --> 01:09:55,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Total for all of them.

638
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Total for all of them.

639
01:09:58,797 --> 01:10:00,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make sure I have this right.

640
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:05,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyless locks and employee bobs, three to five doors at most schools.

641
01:10:06,642 --> 01:10:06,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

642
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:07,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

643
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:11,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the camera intercom system.

644
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:11,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

645
01:10:16,987 --> 01:10:18,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Included in that for the neighborhood.

646
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: For select entry points

647
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:30,044
[SPEAKER_03]: including three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Mistituck, three at the McGlynn, two at the Andrews.

648
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Two at the McGlynn, two at the McGlynn.

649
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, three at Andrews, two at McGlynn?

650
01:10:40,628 --> 01:10:50,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Two at Andrews, two at McGlynn, three at Brooks, Roberts, Mistituck, and three at Medford High School.

651
01:10:53,897 --> 01:10:55,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Loading dock, main door, door 31.

652
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:10,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And member Graham, if it were a new school, I would do more there, but I am trying to be responsible fiscally.

653
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:13,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

654
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And so all of that is 260.

655
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:20,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, which is electrification of doors,

656
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:33,058
[SPEAKER_10]: network wiring, cabling, hardware, and all on the same system that we have field tested with our vape sensors.

657
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:38,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're starting to move towards an integrated approach.

658
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what is the remainder of the 1.9?

659
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:57,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that is, um, either upgrading or, um, adding cameras so that essentially every square inch of the metaphor public schools is covered.

660
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:58,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, right.

661
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:04,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to go into the details publicly right now, but so that every square inch is covered.

662
01:12:06,343 --> 01:12:22,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And also that vape sensors are deployed in all middle school bathrooms, as well as some added, I'll term them added security enhancements at points of entry.

663
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:28,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the one, really 1.7.

664
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:35,548
[SPEAKER_10]: In that, well, let's call that 1.9, the high first quote.

665
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:40,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I did get a quote in the neighborhood of 1.3, 1.4 for all that was just mentioned.

666
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:53,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that was in this before was network phone availability in Medford High classrooms.

667
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, we can definitely- Where does that fall?

668
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:08,835
[SPEAKER_10]: We can, I believe we can move forward with that in the coming months with existing resources and infrastructure.

669
01:13:18,177 --> 01:13:19,817
[SPEAKER_13]: So that goes into in progress?

670
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:22,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say yes.

671
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:28,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no capital dollars needed?

672
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:37,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we can do it with existing infrastructure and resources.

673
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:42,456
[SPEAKER_14]: That's amazing.

674
01:13:43,316 --> 01:13:43,696
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

675
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:45,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hold on.

676
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:47,117
[SPEAKER_10]: When it's done, it'll be amazing.

677
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:49,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair.

678
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:54,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

679
01:13:56,005 --> 01:14:15,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But the district security updates, if I leave that at 1.7 and then the key lock, the locks and the fobs and the camera buzzer systems as a separate line item for 260, does that sound right?

680
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:18,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it does.

681
01:14:18,477 --> 01:14:19,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd say the 1.7,

682
01:14:21,514 --> 01:14:24,817
[SPEAKER_10]: you could pull that down more in the 1.4 range.

683
01:14:26,138 --> 01:14:37,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to get those quotes updated but you know I think more in the 1.4 range by separating out that 260 ish.

684
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:44,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay and so oh remember so thank you um so the

685
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is already just about December, but the, and I had to remember July one is the new fiscal year.

686
01:14:53,858 --> 01:14:55,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really do anything in June.

687
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:09,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do a lot, but, so do we want the Keyless FOB stuff to be next year or is this year, is it just too late for that?

688
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:13,169
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think my recommendation would be

689
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:39,242
[SPEAKER_10]: um that uh this might be a good use of available now i should say now available funding um but again um yeah i defer to the group but i i believe this is something we might be able to do this year i do want to say though um it's one of those things that i would need assistance with

690
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:45,657
[SPEAKER_10]: recognizing my own limitations and the amount of projects that I'm currently managing.

691
01:15:46,337 --> 01:15:49,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just need to look at that piece of the deployment.

692
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

693
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like a good summer project.

694
01:15:55,481 --> 01:16:01,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I just from a spending money kind of question, I wasn't sure if we should do it sooner.

695
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:06,825
[SPEAKER_10]: But well, and I think that's I think that's like I would agree it is a great summer project.

696
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:24,129
[SPEAKER_10]: However, in order to spend down perhaps resources and get high value, I think this is a high value project that allows us to very visibly show security enhancements.

697
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:32,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what I'm thinking about when I say recommend proceeding in FY 25 is that

698
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:58,225
[SPEAKER_03]: What I am thinking about as we are talking is that in December, when we take a vote, the vote is really for the administration to consider these projects as part of the supplemental budget requests they're going to bring forward in January.

699
01:16:59,146 --> 01:17:04,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there is something that can't be funded that we said,

700
01:17:04,838 --> 01:17:15,144
[SPEAKER_03]: doing 25 and it can't be funded through the supplemental budget, then that has to go before the council for additional funding.

701
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:29,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the first step is like this should give some clarity to our budget director to say these are the projects that we are thinking are very important and we want to see you weigh in on when you bring the supplemental budget forward.

702
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense to everybody?

703
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,420
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense to me.

704
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do think that's a very high value project, the FOB stuff.

705
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also going into negotiations.

706
01:17:42,362 --> 01:17:49,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, I don't want to talk about keys in our negotiations.

707
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:56,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that it would be good to just get this over with.

708
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, from a what's the supplemental going to look like, this can wait.

709
01:18:07,304 --> 01:18:15,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if there ends up being room in the supplemental, then this number here is already too big, isn't it?

710
01:18:15,749 --> 01:18:16,229
Yeah.

711
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:17,010
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

712
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the things that we still have as not committed are the district wide security updates for 1.5.

713
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:36,079
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have those like, but that's.

714
01:18:41,607 --> 01:18:44,969
[SPEAKER_03]: saying anything more than that just yet about that.

715
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's a good conversation for the school committee.

716
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,034
[SPEAKER_03]: The other question I had was around playground renovation.

717
01:18:54,154 --> 01:19:00,838
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are mostly done with the playground renovation at the McGlynn.

718
01:19:00,878 --> 01:19:04,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's stunning and spectacular and gorgeous.

719
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:09,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a very long process.

720
01:19:10,222 --> 01:19:15,384
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the design work to make it such a special project in the end.

721
01:19:16,104 --> 01:19:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'm curious, we sort of have on the radar that all of our playgrounds are going to need to be replaced at some point in time.

722
01:19:25,187 --> 01:19:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a timing of when we might seek CPC funding for another playground?

723
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that

724
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:48,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the reason we are having this conversation right now is because the CPC window opens after this.

725
01:19:49,030 --> 01:20:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we were going to recommend that we put forward a project for this upcoming cycle, we would have to identify which project that would be.

726
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:07,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and the two that I would say in

727
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:15,167
[SPEAKER_10]: The two that are probably most pressing equally are the Misituk and the Roberts.

728
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:29,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, after discussing with Shanine, our playground specialist, we actually came to the conclusion that based on population served,

729
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:34,328
[SPEAKER_10]: that the miss attack might be the better option.

730
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:44,154
[SPEAKER_10]: However, we also know that the Roberts is a very full school and could use playground options as well.

731
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:45,495
[SPEAKER_10]: But

732
01:20:46,255 --> 01:21:02,938
[SPEAKER_10]: funding really won't allow, and I don't believe that these projects would be anywhere near the cost that the McGlynn was in the neighborhood of $2.9 million, including the about $140,000 or $150,000 we spent on the design study with the design work with Copley-Wolf.

733
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I don't believe that it would cost that much.

734
01:21:06,802 --> 01:21:08,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe the design would cost that much.

735
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:13,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, our community member donated time previously.

736
01:21:13,108 --> 01:21:16,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so we need to really think about that.

737
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:23,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, I'm definitely willing and able to apply for, um, CPC funds.

738
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:32,975
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that window is more in the summer, but it would give us time to make sure that we're ready to go.

739
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:52,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the committee could say, we want to fund the design, not go to CPC for funding the design, which would mean that we start the design process as part of the supplemental budget in February instead of waiting until, say, September or October.

740
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:01,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to weigh in between the two schools.

741
01:22:02,086 --> 01:22:13,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely advocate more strongly for the Roberts because the Roberts is our only elementary school that is really landlocked.

742
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:21,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one major distinction between the Missittuck and the Roberts is that the Missittuck does have the benefit of

743
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:28,569
[SPEAKER_00]: the Columbus Field Park that is, you know, it's, they use both spaces.

744
01:22:29,089 --> 01:22:42,923
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students actually, although the playgrounds do need to be renovated, the students at the Missittuck are able to go up the stairs and use the additional field space at the Missittuck location.

745
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:46,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the Roberts, they really, you know,

746
01:22:47,367 --> 01:23:00,952
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so crammed over there, they're landlocked, the students don't have that same option to have a park, a green space, which abuts their campus, immediately abuts their campus, that they could use on a daily basis.

747
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:06,595
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be one of the things that I would just say if

748
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:10,952
[SPEAKER_00]: a decision had to be made between the two schools.

749
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:14,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel the Roberts has gotten the short end of the stick.

750
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:26,739
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using practically part of the parking lot for space because it's just so crammed and they have slightly over 600 students.

751
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:35,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So being the largest elementary school with the smallest footprint, I would prioritize the Roberts.

752
01:23:35,582 --> 01:23:37,123
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I wanted to share.

753
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:41,192
[SPEAKER_00]: if it came down to those two schools?

754
01:23:48,694 --> 01:23:49,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

755
01:23:50,814 --> 01:23:51,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

756
01:23:52,115 --> 01:24:01,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do think that there's an uncomfortable conversation that has to be had about the Roberts Playground.

757
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:22,624
[SPEAKER_06]: and the situation there, whether that conversation involves finding an alternative space to park, whether that involves taking of land through eminent domain, there is no solution to that area.

758
01:24:24,264 --> 01:24:43,321
[SPEAKER_06]: whether we do their park, whether we do their playground first, and then we do the others, in the end, when all of these are beautiful playgrounds, one is going to be very distinct, and that's going to be the Roberts, for being utterly incomparable to the others.

759
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:49,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I think it's important, you know,

760
01:24:50,203 --> 01:24:52,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that the staff should have to park a half a mile away.

761
01:24:54,331 --> 01:25:02,827
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if a piece of property comes available, a street over by it and turn it into a parking lot.

762
01:25:04,076 --> 01:25:10,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And then make the whole parking lot into an actual playground that's the appropriate size for that size student population.

763
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just spitballing.

764
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:20,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't even know that area very well other than having, you know, been to the school a number of times, but my point is just, I don't.

765
01:25:22,528 --> 01:25:24,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go small on the Roberts playground.

766
01:25:26,431 --> 01:25:28,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can always get fancier.

767
01:25:28,973 --> 01:25:37,521
[SPEAKER_06]: But the truth is, is there's just as everybody literally here knows there isn't enough room is an understatement, it's just such an understatement and.

768
01:25:38,982 --> 01:25:52,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my children went to the Misatoch, and I have all these fantasies about how we could make all that area dramatically better, and I'm sure a design study would come up with some great ways to change that area.

769
01:25:53,016 --> 01:25:57,020
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, the truth is, as Dr. Robinson said,

770
01:25:57,961 --> 01:25:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the field.

771
01:25:58,942 --> 01:26:06,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's really kind of an ideal situation, very similar to the McGlynn situation in that there's a lot more space.

772
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:20,800
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm okay with us putting the Roberts first, but I also want us to not put it first and not have the hard conversation about we can't make it work if the footprint is the same.

773
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:24,285
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's just not one of our options.

774
01:26:24,765 --> 01:26:34,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to spend a million and a half dollars to make a playground where the kids can't even all be out at recess at the same time because there isn't physically the space.

775
01:26:34,813 --> 01:26:35,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's absurd.

776
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:49,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's not, if the Roberts ends up being a dramatically more expensive endeavor because we have to buy another piece of land or whatever, I'm all in.

777
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:53,434
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my thoughts on that.

778
01:26:54,535 --> 01:27:08,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just jump in and say, I do spend a lot of time at the Roberts, given that, well, I only have one kid there now, but there have been residential properties that have now been converted.

779
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:18,132
[SPEAKER_13]: The available land, whether that was even an option to take for the schools, to purchase for the schools, is a question to me.

780
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:36,230
[SPEAKER_13]: There aren't a lot of properties it's it's very residential it's houses and we put up the, there's a new, there are new condos and then there's an ambiguous construction going on on Park Street and Hickey Park is the closest park and that ends up being

781
01:27:37,694 --> 01:27:39,575
[SPEAKER_13]: It shouldn't be a 10 minute walk, but it is.

782
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:45,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a 15 minute walk with kindergartners and have to do field trip forms to go to the park.

783
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:46,599
[SPEAKER_13]: They do field day there.

784
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:51,743
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be nice to get some kind of connection with Hickey, but it is a few blocks away.

785
01:27:52,343 --> 01:27:53,884
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do think space is at a premium.

786
01:27:56,354 --> 01:28:08,643
[SPEAKER_03]: What Alicia, since you're here, have there been discussions about this that this group is not privy to or aware of on the city side?

787
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:13,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I go there, I'm like, what is that building across the street?

788
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:14,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

789
01:28:15,068 --> 01:28:18,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't know what it is, but I wonder about it all the time.

790
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,562
[SPEAKER_03]: For many reasons, I dream about an after school center and a parking lot.

791
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:29,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly, I don't, I have no, I have no sense of what happens in that building or.

792
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:38,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who owns it, but I just didn't know if there had been any conversations about what a space problem we do have at at that building.

793
01:28:40,426 --> 01:28:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: That building is busting at the seams and, like, we cannot go on.

794
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:45,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we, we have, so that's.

795
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,979
[SPEAKER_03]: a separate but related problem.

796
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:58,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But the signs are that there's continued high demand for elementary school students in that space.

797
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:05,663
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would agree that I think the Roberts does need to be first on the list.

798
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:12,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need a double-decker playground or something.

799
01:29:12,884 --> 01:29:14,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Something has to give there.

800
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not exactly sure what it is or where to put that in the conversation.

801
01:29:20,345 --> 01:29:31,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I assume you mean the existing building across the street, which it I've looked it up before and it is this.

802
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:46,987
[SPEAKER_07]: A construction company component assembly systems, but we don't really we've never really had any contact with them or what they do in that facility.

803
01:29:48,108 --> 01:29:51,312
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very really fly under the radar.

804
01:29:53,334 --> 01:30:00,538
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's, I mean, if you look at it from Google, they even got solar on the roof, like it's inactive, it's well maintained, it's not abandoned.

805
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:01,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

806
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:14,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I just looked at their website, and it looks like they were involved in the Apple project, you know, the giant round thing and National Museum of African American History and Culture.

807
01:30:14,987 --> 01:30:15,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're

808
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:22,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to me they play into the radio, but yeah, but they do some serious stuff reach out.

809
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:31,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I did just, I hadn't looked before but I just found a contact for that location off of their website.

810
01:30:31,303 --> 01:30:39,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to me that it wouldn't be inappropriate for somebody from the school system school committee I don't know to contact them.

811
01:30:41,511 --> 01:30:44,732
[SPEAKER_07]: and just have a conversation about like, we're here, what do you do?

812
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:46,492
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really curious across the street.

813
01:30:47,753 --> 01:30:50,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That said, I don't know that it'll pan out the way you want.

814
01:30:51,854 --> 01:30:59,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume you meant that as opposed to the hole in the ground, which I can tell you has gone through the city's

815
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:05,506
[SPEAKER_07]: commission's process, they don't have a building permit yet.

816
01:31:06,066 --> 01:31:17,610
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually they do they've been through the full building permit process to do a building that would have ground floor commercial probably a coffee shop, and I can't remember if it's seven or nine units of housing above.

817
01:31:19,798 --> 01:31:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: that property is actually on the market with all its permits.

818
01:31:24,123 --> 01:31:29,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So the person who permitted it and owns it is looking to now sell all those permits and everything.

819
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:35,356
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very expensive because it's a whole permitted project.

820
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the city would be the

821
01:31:39,309 --> 01:31:56,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I myself have dreamed of like, could we purchase or put, how would we indicate that there are properties the city would be interested in buying in terms of houses and stuff for various locations I think it's something we should look into.

822
01:31:57,707 --> 01:31:58,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to.

823
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:12,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm gonna ask the economic development director, like how would we make a list of properties the city would like to acquire and then keep an eye on them because we would like to expand some of our footprints.

824
01:32:12,931 --> 01:32:14,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And this isn't the only one, but.

825
01:32:15,732 --> 01:32:18,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, you said it's for sale.

826
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:27,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an easy way to, I mean, it's not gonna be on Zillow, I'm sure, but is there an easy way to find out what that actually sale price is?

827
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:32,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask Sal, our economic development director.

828
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:39,057
[SPEAKER_07]: He has access to a commercial listing system, which is where I have confirmed.

829
01:32:39,217 --> 01:32:44,783
[SPEAKER_07]: We had heard that it was for sale because people were confirming its permit status.

830
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:48,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we looked it up, but I'll ask him for the pricing.

831
01:32:48,347 --> 01:32:49,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

832
01:32:51,877 --> 01:32:52,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

833
01:32:53,197 --> 01:33:00,079
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question on the table is, are we prioritizing any of these schools for a CPC application this year?

834
01:33:00,099 --> 01:33:01,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

835
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that is the question.

836
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I don't know if it's an age thing or just too much going in, but when we do the application,

837
01:33:16,397 --> 01:33:17,739
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do we have to say?

838
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:27,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess is my question, because to say we want to do the playground over is one thing, to say we want to do the playground over and

839
01:33:28,832 --> 01:33:58,236
[SPEAKER_06]: we plan to buy a property and we are going to move to like those aren't even things we can say at this point because we I mean we're just spitballing in this meeting not that many of us haven't already thought about these things a number of times but that's not a plan so how much do we have to tell the cpc to actually do an application we have to ask for a specific amount of money what's the limit well so

840
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:03,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the limit is contingent on a couple of things.

841
01:34:03,557 --> 01:34:06,059
[SPEAKER_10]: What other projects do they have in the pipeline?

842
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,760
[SPEAKER_10]: What are their projects?

843
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:16,464
[SPEAKER_10]: We've received a significant amount of funding with that weigh into their decision as to trying to spread the money around.

844
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:22,087
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we've shown with the McGlynn Playground that we provide

845
01:34:22,472 --> 01:34:27,513
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been able to provide significant value to the overall community as well as the Metro public schools.

846
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:35,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if we can replicate that, and I guess I would consider the Roberts and Alicia, you know, better than better than I do.

847
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:48,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I would consider the Roberts to be a significantly more landlocked area, um, and more dense, um, even though he is down the street, but it is a significantly dense area.

848
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:50,619
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, you know,

849
01:34:51,444 --> 01:35:20,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean I think we would need to understand the long term plans of both the school committee and the municipality on what we can do to expand the footprint of that school because there is there's no other way around that footprint for the number of students there is not adequate and the hard conversations that have been you know initiated here tonight need to be had

850
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:24,643
[SPEAKER_09]: for the greater benefit of those 605 or 600 plus students.

851
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:38,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if we are going to have those conversations, you know, that'll help inform what type of a playground or what type of parking or what is done to make it a better environment for our students.

852
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:46,769
[SPEAKER_10]: There really is no limit to the funding except annually how much they bring in.

853
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:50,961
[SPEAKER_10]: They funded us $900,000 in one fiscal year.

854
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:55,965
[SPEAKER_10]: They funded us $900,000 in another fiscal year for a total of $1.8 million in that ask.

855
01:35:56,065 --> 01:36:02,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they had given us, I remember, Graham, I think it ended up being like an initial $40,000 for the design study.

856
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:05,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we found out that that was pretty inadequate.

857
01:36:06,313 --> 01:36:08,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it went up to in the neighborhood of $150,000, $160,000.

858
01:36:10,116 --> 01:36:13,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm forgetting those numbers as they've kind of blurred together.

859
01:36:17,562 --> 01:36:42,422
[SPEAKER_13]: The other hard conversation, which is not the scope of this meeting, but is how are we managing the unevenness in population in schools across the district, whether that's looking at reorganizing the grade levels, whether it's just redistricting, whether it's somebody come up to me and say, we should just open a new school, which I suppose that's on the table too.

860
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,382
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another hard conversation that informs what type of playground we need.

861
01:36:49,462 --> 01:36:55,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if we move to a different model, we may have a different student population in that building.

862
01:36:56,206 --> 01:37:07,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what I'm hearing is what we would recommend is that we prioritize a solution at the Roberts.

863
01:37:10,902 --> 01:37:30,989
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not ready necessarily to ask the CPC for money because we don't actually know the solution could possibly be at this moment, but that what we do recommend is that there are some continuing conversations about what those possibilities are.

864
01:37:31,009 --> 01:37:37,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know, do we like every time I go there, I'm shocked that the staff park each other in.

865
01:37:39,114 --> 01:37:42,696
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a choice, but they park each other and it's super unsafe.

866
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

867
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's a necessity.

868
01:37:45,638 --> 01:37:52,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's no other there's nothing else to do, but there's not enough parking for the number of staff that have to work in that building.

869
01:37:55,223 --> 01:37:57,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not enough playground space, like.

870
01:37:59,636 --> 01:38:07,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need literally a parking deck or something that would double the parking capacity and create some space?

871
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:08,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

872
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:19,107
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's a question we'd need to talk to some people about in terms of what even the options are and maybe have a conversation with the folks across the street.

873
01:38:22,884 --> 01:38:42,361
[SPEAKER_03]: before we could proceed with the CPC application, but perhaps the, the recommendation from this group to the committee is that is our short range priority is like figuring something out for that building that leads to our ability to address the playground.

874
01:38:44,663 --> 01:38:45,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with that recommendation.

875
01:38:49,326 --> 01:39:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I also was remembering it when we were visiting high schools, Watertown, at least Suffolk University, and I can't remember where else, has done something that I would never have thought made any sense until I saw it, but they put the

876
01:39:06,638 --> 01:39:28,274
[SPEAKER_06]: well, they're not playgrounds, they're fields there, but they put fields above parking so that there's so much parking, they don't even need to assign spots or care, because essentially the entire ground level becomes parking, and then elevated above it is what would become a very large amount of playground space.

877
01:39:29,215 --> 01:39:32,578
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference, of course, for those places and this is that

878
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:34,813
[SPEAKER_06]: this is in a neighborhood.

879
01:39:36,594 --> 01:39:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But while it ends up sort of becoming two stories, it's barely higher than a roof on a one story.

880
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:45,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

881
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:47,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this isn't the time for the solutions.

882
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:58,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's $2 million to buy a lot that would, in many regards, not be enough to fully solve the problem,

883
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: do we have to consider something much, I mean, no concept of what those elevated fields actually cost.

884
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:13,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think we should definitely make this a priority though.

885
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:21,089
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the elementary schools in my hometown did that, but they actually had the whole school underground as well.

886
01:40:22,911 --> 01:40:23,571
[SPEAKER_13]: It was very cool.

887
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:24,913
[SPEAKER_13]: They had it elevated.

888
01:40:24,953 --> 01:40:25,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It was very cool.

889
01:40:27,645 --> 01:40:30,386
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the 60s and 70s that that happened.

890
01:40:31,446 --> 01:40:34,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Weird architectural world.

891
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:41,630
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

892
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently I lied about how long this meeting was going to take.

893
01:40:46,572 --> 01:40:47,792
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sorry for that.

894
01:40:48,972 --> 01:40:52,214
[SPEAKER_13]: We ended the last one early, so this was due.

895
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:53,654
[SPEAKER_04]: This was inevitable.

896
01:40:58,402 --> 01:41:13,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot.

897
01:41:13,285 --> 01:41:16,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where we've landed.

898
01:41:16,886 --> 01:41:21,087
[SPEAKER_03]: So for recommendations in 25,

899
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:46,123
[SPEAKER_03]: The mini reconditioning assessment, the network closets, the freight elevator, the drainage at the Brooksfield, the key fobs, the dumpster mitigation potentially in 26, and getting this grant addressed for the ADA issue at McGlynn and Andrews.

900
01:41:48,523 --> 01:41:51,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying district-wide security updates of 1.5,

901
01:41:55,393 --> 01:42:00,197
[SPEAKER_03]: are not committed at this time, but from a planning perspective, we should be looking at it for FY 26.

902
01:42:02,919 --> 01:42:06,702
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts is our priority playground or recommended priority playground.

903
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:15,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Parking lot paving also not committed.

904
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:22,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Then these items are all contingent on the mini-commissioning study and what might come from there.

905
01:42:25,489 --> 01:42:30,712
[SPEAKER_13]: You might want to, picky details, flip Missituck and Brooks, because it sounds like that's the priority order.

906
01:42:50,425 --> 01:42:52,807
[SPEAKER_14]: There aren't as many students at the Brooks,

907
01:42:57,401 --> 01:43:00,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the conversation for after we've solved all the rest.

908
01:43:05,143 --> 01:43:08,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was just going off the conversation that happened before, but you're right.

909
01:43:08,184 --> 01:43:09,484
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't have that conversation.

910
01:43:10,044 --> 01:43:11,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

911
01:43:11,745 --> 01:43:18,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think there's lots of change to this before we get to that place on the list.

912
01:43:18,646 --> 01:43:24,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything else that you think we should change?

913
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:35,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Have we identified all of the, right, this meeting was timed so that we could say this is, I see the potential open space CPC.

914
01:43:35,649 --> 01:43:38,391
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see any of that for the current projects.

915
01:43:39,892 --> 01:43:42,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, some things had been committed up at the top.

916
01:43:42,353 --> 01:43:45,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and then we have an application pending for Curtis Tufts, yep.

917
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:51,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're recommending this one, so.

918
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:53,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I see that.

919
01:43:58,666 --> 01:44:12,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think the question is what we're asking school committee to, I guess, is this the work of the district to say what if this is going into a supplemental budget request?

920
01:44:12,392 --> 01:44:24,277
[SPEAKER_13]: What is coming out of funds that have already been allocated and what is a new request to city council or from capital stabilization, right?

921
01:44:24,297 --> 01:44:27,238
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the mitigation is potentially a stabilization

922
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:30,161
[SPEAKER_13]: fund.

923
01:44:45,674 --> 01:44:56,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also trying to do the math on what the grand total here is, but I don't know that a grand total is what's important so much as the total for each of these buckets.

924
01:45:00,314 --> 01:45:03,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm just going to put a little legend at the top.

925
01:45:03,396 --> 01:45:04,537
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it means.

926
01:45:04,597 --> 01:45:08,239
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we're saying if we say recommend proceeding in FY26.

927
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:28,210
[SPEAKER_14]: If we say recommend CPC funding request, MPS directs the administration to apply for CPC funding.

928
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:38,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, not needed.

929
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:49,608
[SPEAKER_14]: No, immediate.

930
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:52,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Action required.

931
01:46:04,926 --> 01:46:06,149
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this one.

932
01:46:30,919 --> 01:46:38,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other element of this process was net school spending, but that's covered under the recommend proceeding in fiscal year 25.

933
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:49,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did talk to Jerry about that and he gave me the dollar thresholds.

934
01:46:51,175 --> 01:46:53,277
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been filling that in as we've been talking.

935
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:02,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm down somewhere.

936
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:16,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's $150,000.

937
01:47:16,192 --> 01:47:17,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's $150,000.

938
01:47:18,393 --> 01:47:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it's under $150,000, it can be included in that school spending.

939
01:47:22,054 --> 01:47:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's over, it cannot be.

940
01:47:23,555 --> 01:47:30,538
[SPEAKER_13]: And what does that mean for something like LED lighting replacement, which ends up being $180,000 across the three schools?

941
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:34,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Each school, $150,000 per each school.

942
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:34,760
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

943
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Or per project, not.

944
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:39,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's per year.

945
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It's per project, I believe.

946
01:47:42,894 --> 01:47:44,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

947
01:47:44,877 --> 01:47:46,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these would be a no.

948
01:47:46,539 --> 01:47:54,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because it's one project.

949
01:48:09,463 --> 01:48:10,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yep, there's that column.

950
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:22,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I've zoomed in and I'm scrolling back and forth, so apologies for that.

951
01:48:32,947 --> 01:48:38,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the other one we had that we need to describe and then

952
01:48:52,304 --> 01:48:52,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

953
01:49:21,127 --> 01:49:26,413
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's like a little key for us for like what those project status.

954
01:49:39,428 --> 01:49:40,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have that we need to.

955
01:49:50,572 --> 01:49:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that covers all of our.

956
01:49:52,773 --> 01:50:16,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're done.

957
01:50:18,228 --> 01:50:20,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions, thoughts, things we missed?

958
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:29,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to put it in progress for the bike rack modernization line 28?

959
01:50:32,491 --> 01:50:32,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

960
01:50:36,592 --> 01:50:38,472
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't have to answer that question, which will come up.

961
01:50:45,033 --> 01:50:45,553
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

962
01:50:46,574 --> 01:50:47,874
[SPEAKER_06]: First year's the hardest doing this.

963
01:50:51,590 --> 01:51:07,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have a couple of costs to include between now and the meeting, but I will probably put together a slide that says, here's what we did, and here's how we did it, and this is the result.

964
01:51:12,569 --> 01:51:13,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need a deadline?

965
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:18,794
[SPEAKER_13]: I know a couple people took action items to confirm quotes or points of contact.

966
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:24,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there, do you, in preparing that slide, do you need, is there a deadline you want that information by?

967
01:51:24,939 --> 01:51:30,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously we want it as soon as we can get it, but reasonable demands on people's time.

968
01:51:31,165 --> 01:51:33,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, by December 6th would be great.

969
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:37,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Till end of next week.

970
01:51:42,065 --> 01:51:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, it's two weeks away, but it's not.

971
01:51:46,087 --> 01:51:49,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, nobody's working Thursday, Friday.

972
01:51:50,489 --> 01:51:53,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

973
01:51:54,030 --> 01:52:04,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what we need tonight is just a recommendation to send this to the full committee for their review.

974
01:52:07,293 --> 01:52:19,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that, uh, we will need to do as a full committee is like, make a recommendation to approve this or approve it as amended, which will happen at the special meeting.

975
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:23,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

976
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:34,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion to, um, approve, approve this recommendation to send to the entire school committee by member.

977
01:52:34,274 --> 01:52:35,875
[SPEAKER_03]: So seconded by member Reinfeld.

978
01:52:36,513 --> 01:52:37,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll do a roll call.

979
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:37,894

980
01:52:38,554 --> 01:52:38,754

1000
01:53:09,602 --> 01:53:12,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, I don't know your title, or I would have called you by your proper title.

1001
01:53:12,985 --> 01:53:15,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you both.
