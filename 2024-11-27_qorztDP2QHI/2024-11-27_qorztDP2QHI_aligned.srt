1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:05,931
Then on Tuesday, May 28th, sorry, May, I'm looking at the wrong one.

2
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:08,272
That's on May 28th, something is not quite right.

3
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:09,993
Hold on a second.

4
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:12,314
Jenny?

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,255
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:20,197
The website description, there's actually three underlying links in that description.

7
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:25,539
Look to the words strategic and you'll get to the right place.

8
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:30,368
I did send an email to have that fixed.

9
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:33,655
Thank you.

10
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:39,520
I thought I had the right one pulled up because I went through your email to find the right link.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
And then I still had the wrong one.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,921
So OK, here we go.

13
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:51,902
Please be advised that on Tuesday, November 26, at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

14
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:53,623
This meeting is being recorded.

15
00:00:54,163 --> 00:01:01,304
The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast.

Those submitting must include the following, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

20
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,408
This is a continuation of a meeting, so I'm still going to take the roll.

21
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,189
Is that right, generally speaking?

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,771
Yeah, yeah, okay.

23
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,692
So member Rheinfeld.

24
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:52,873
Present.

25
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,174
Member Rousseau.

26
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:55,235
Present.

27
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,296
And member Graham, I'm here.

28
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,477
So three present, zero absent.

29
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:10,704
So as I mentioned, this is a continuation of our first subcommittee meeting that we held back on 10-15.

30
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:16,868
And the goal of these two meetings is to sort of put together and formalize

31
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:31,014
a view of our capital plan for the schools and think about what kind of recommendations we want to make to the broader school committee, which will happen at a meeting in December.

32
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,296
I think it's the 11th.

33
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,058
And I see that we have a couple of guests joining us.

34
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:43,864
So we have Alicia Hunt from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and we have Paul Riggi from the City's Facility Team.

35
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,705
So welcome.

36
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:45,946
Thank you for joining us.

37
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,874
Um, I'm actually hopeful this meeting will not take an hour and a half.

38
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,776
Um, but we, this is the first time we've done this process.

39
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:59,739
So we tried to make sure that we had enough space in the schedule to do all the things that we needed to do.

40
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:12,625
Um, so I'm going to bring up, um, the capital plan that we worked through last time and just provide a little bit of context for those of you who are, um, newer to,

41
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,489
the conversation just as soon as I can find the plan.

42
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,489
Here it is.

43
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:37,715
And this capital plan, the way that we created this is we started with last year's capital plan, which was created in a meeting as like a starting point back in like May or June.

44
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,696
And then from there,

45
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:58,140
Peter did solicit input from the building principals to say what other capital needs exist in the district that we may or may not have on our radar in terms of things that we see.

46
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,784
That's how this list has come to pass.

47
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:07,329
One of the things we talked a lot about in the last meeting was,

48
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:16,939
sort of this intersection of a whole bunch of work happening at McGlynn and Andrews that this committee is aware of and apprised of.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,682
And sort of how does that play into the overall capital plan?

50
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:35,390
And I actually met yesterday with Director Hunt and Dr. Cushing and the OPM for the project to try to get some clarity around

51
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:50,801
Some of the work that's going on and just sort of having some discussion and we, we sort of did this when we met last time there was some question about like what's included in that project and what is excluded from that project.

52
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:58,548
I think some of that has come into focus a little bit more, or at least we have sort of a directional focus that can help.

53
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:07,906
And the other thing that we talked about with the OPM was sort of the timeline to prepare to keep the project on track.

54
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:21,130
And we asked the OPM also to be available to join us at our committee of the whole meeting, which actually will become a special school committee meeting.

55
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:37,418
Just to give us an update on the project itself, but I can I'm happy to relay sort of what we talked about yesterday in terms of, like, you know, sort of things that are lumped into this and things that are excluded from this so that we can revise this capital plan.

56
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:42,720
Because that's, like, the biggest block of things that are in process right now.

57
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,102
So in scope is the.

58
00:05:47,623 --> 00:06:11,876
the piece that we think about as HVAC right for both schools McGlynn and Andrews so that's in scope there's not been a question about that but a couple of other things that we talked about and confirmed yesterday as directionally sort of where we're going

59
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:33,000
To include includes both the roof rebuild in some fashion at the McGlynn and the network splits and the many splits that are in the network closets in those two buildings.

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,261
So that's what these two rows are.

61
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:42,585
And I'm just going to move them up here because this is up here is stuff that we're saying is in progress and funded.

62
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:49,996
And all of these things sort of are bundled into the...

63
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:54,565
project at this time.

64
00:06:55,385 --> 00:07:05,350
And what that is going to allow is for the OPM to actually, because we have sort of like a chicken and egg situation going on, where we say, how are we going to pay for this?

65
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,571
Well, it depends on how much it costs.

66
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,871
Well, it depends on what's included.

67
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:15,535
Well, it depends on how much it costs, which is sort of very typical at this point in these kinds of projects.

68
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,156
But what we talked about yesterday was that,

69
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:32,843
We are proceeding as though a bond will need to be issued by the city for this project and that it will include these components and solar for the roof.

70
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:51,083
And that will enable the OPM to actually go put that package together with pricing so that then we can look at that comprehensively and say, okay, yes, that is the go forward plan.

71
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,404
And yes, that is the funding mechanism.

72
00:07:55,518 --> 00:08:13,843
In order to, the other thing we talked a little bit about as a group was in order to keep this project on track so that it can be completed before the next school year, there is a tiny window that we've got to get exactly right between now and February.

73
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:23,586
So if you all recall, at the last school committee meeting, we took a vote to authorize the mayor to enter into a CM at risk contract.

74
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:36,792
And Paul and Alicia, feel free to jump in if I get this wrong, but what that allows us to do is bring the construction manager into the project sooner than we might otherwise do.

75
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:40,014
And that allows them to do things like.

76
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:48,537
Get the equipment purchased that we are going to need that has long wait times while we wait for like the final design to be completed.

77
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:58,162
So the timeline that we talked about yesterday was that really in order to keep on track, we need to be in a position to fund.

78
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:19,400
the CM contract startup costs and the equipment costs in the month of January, which does mean that all of this question about funding and bonding has to make its way through the process between now and then, which does include an appearance at the council meeting, then an advertisement, and then a second appearance.

79
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,961
Is that right, Alicia?

80
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:24,504
Yes.

81
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:25,345
Okay.

82
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:26,486
Yes.

83
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:32,065
And there's many more steps than that.

84
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,468
That's like a grossly simplified version of what's happening.

85
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:55,784
But what we did ask the OPM to do was to be prepared to come to our special meeting on the 11th to give us an update on the project, and particularly that timeline of what needs to happen, what do they need from us, do they need from the city side, et cetera, to make sure that the project stays on track.

86
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:09,748
And that's the McGlynn project in a nutshell.

87
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,787
Any questions about that one, Erica?

88
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:21,189
Yep, just to refresh, the funding source for that, some of it is allocated.

89
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,749
Where's that coming from?

90
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,051
How much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed?

91
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:31,972
I know we didn't have the final number until recently.

92
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:36,792
Yeah, the OPM is under contract and being paid for.

93
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:40,873
And I believe that is coming out of ARPA money.

94
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:42,193
Is that right?

95
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,274
Yeah.

96
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:49,155
And then all of the rest of the costs, we have to bond in order to have the money to do that.

97
00:10:49,255 --> 00:11:00,138
So that's why the bonding process is so important timeline-wise, because if we can't get those things in place in January, it's going to push the whole project.

98
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:01,198
Right.

99
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:06,466
back and then we're going to be, you know, back at, you know, in impeding on the start of school.

100
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:07,566
Okay.

101
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:07,806
Yeah.

102
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:11,447
Cause I know we had designated some things for HVAC, but it's all bonded.

103
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,807
Thank you.

104
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:23,889
Um, also includes roof.

105
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,790
So we'll go back to the end network.

106
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,894
Okay, so in terms of in.

107
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,857
Progress process.

108
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,803
Activities those are that's sort of 1 big block.

109
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,385
Of activity does that make sense?

110
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:57,802
and we would consider all of those together.

111
00:11:57,902 --> 00:12:09,406
So I'm putting that above the funding line, although obviously there's still a lot of work to do to secure all the right approvals, et cetera, for the bond, but that's sort of where we're at with that.

112
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:11,306
Does that make sense so far?

113
00:12:11,326 --> 00:12:15,728
Yes, I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee.

114
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:21,390
We don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.

115
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:31,350
Yeah, and the school committee, actually, we won't vote on the funding piece of it because it is bonded.

116
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,673
So the city is the only authority that can take out the bond.

117
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:35,813
Right.

118
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:40,057
I just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.

119
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:41,618
Yeah.

120
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:43,239
Got it.

121
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay.

122
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,223
So the other,

123
00:12:50,305 --> 00:13:14,581
The other thing that we did talk about that I think is really important, um, is we talked with the OPM about these, um, recommissioning assessments and that that's like another place where, um, broadly speaking, the OPM is on board to do those things, but funding has been such that, um,

124
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:22,358
There's not clarity about when we wanted to do that because we didn't tell them and we didn't tell them because we didn't have money.

125
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,441
So that's 1 thing that I think we can sort of start to clear up what.

126
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:40,525
We talked about yesterday in addition is that is opening up an accelerated repair window, like, usually between usually, like, between January and.

127
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:47,089
Maybe April, March, April, and that accelerated repairs for things like roofs.

128
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,152
Boilers HVAC, et cetera.

129
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:57,417
MSP has adopted a new process where they'll open up a window this coming year.

130
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:03,421
January to June or January to April, and then they will do it every other year.

131
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:09,466
And so if you hop into the window this year in January, you would learn if you.

132
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:11,850
were able to

133
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,030
be funded sometime like around now.

134
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,853
So it is a long process to get the notification to start.

135
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:35,538
But if we are interested in doing that, we have to either get in this year or it's two more years.

136
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:41,000
So it would be January 2027 before we would have another

137
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:49,688
Go at it, I did talk to last week and they did confirm that.

138
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:57,176
Yes, districts who are in the core program can apply for accelerated repair projects.

139
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:03,640
Um, so I think, um, what probably makes sense is for this.

140
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,583
Um, re, commissioning assessment line to sort of split into.

141
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:14,486
To maybe 2 lines 1 is a mini assessment that would enable us to.

142
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:43,653
if we need to take advantage of that accelerated repair program so that assessment could get us ready to submit for brooks roberts and missittuck if we find that the needs there are pressing and urgent when we talk about roofs and hvac um so what we may want to consider recommending to the committee is that we pursue a mini assessment that

143
00:15:44,341 --> 00:16:05,387
looks at those pieces that are eligible for accelerated repair in an effort to put forward an application in that program this year if we qualify but we don't know yet so the thought the thought that we batted around yesterday was let's try to

144
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,631
do some sort of mini assessment.

145
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,592
The OPM is going to figure out what the cost of that is.

146
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:18,713
And based on that mini assessment, it will inform our ability to go into this accelerated repair program.

147
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:31,576
And then once we have clarity on that, then we can circle back around to the sort of like regular routine recommissioning projects into the future.

148
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:35,617
But that would get us sort of on track.

149
00:16:35,977 --> 00:16:36,717
Does that make sense?

150
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:42,909
Any questions about that?

151
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:02,538
He was going to give us the price.

152
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:08,321
So once I get that, I will fill that in.

153
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:18,794
But I think, um, one thing we may want to do is identify this as like a thing that we are recommending that we take up urgently.

154
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:27,901
Um, so in the project status, there may be some things where we say, we're recommending that we do this in FY 25.

155
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:33,706
Um, and then we can have that discussion with the committee and make sure that they agree with us.

156
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,688
I don't know what you all think about that.

157
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,081
Sounds good to me.

158
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:53,319
Yeah, I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming.

159
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,613
And are those, do you know, are those typically funded at the full cost?

160
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:17,036
Is it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?

161
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,598
Yeah, I think it's usually a portion.

162
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:22,820
I don't, I don't think it's full funding, but it is a piece of it.

163
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:32,648
Okay, and then the other idea that.

164
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:49,121
I had is that we at some point talk about, um, with the OPM, this idea of a district wide electrification enablement assessment and where that might fit and whether that is in the scope of their work.

165
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:57,065
Um, and we did not do that yesterday because we had sort of a full plate, but, um, I don't

166
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:03,504
think we necessarily need to recommend that we proceed with that in FY 25.

167
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:16,119
But that could be something that we circle back to with the OPM, who obviously is getting to know our buildings intimately and would be in probably a decent position to be able to do that.

168
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:27,969
This was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with similar efforts parallel efforts in other city buildings.

169
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:33,673
That's a great question.

170
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,020
Hi, good evening.

171
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:41,684
So, yes, there will be.

172
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,587
We are applying.

173
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:52,636
We're basically doing the certification to be a particular kind of green communities, a green communities leadership program.

174
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:56,440
And through that program, there's going to be technical assistance.

175
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:09,445
to help with some of this evaluation of buildings and we always include our school buildings in that so that that would be in what we say we own for something like that.

176
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:25,792
Brenda Pike in my office is working through that process and is keeping an eye out for those timelines and she I could get I wasn't anticipating that question this evening but I could easily get her to give you guys some information on that.

177
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:35,694
so that we could look at the technical assistance because there's a lot of incentives from the state to move forward with electrification.

178
00:20:35,754 --> 00:20:42,658
So the whole make a plan, figure it out and then help with the actual doing is stuff they're looking to do.

179
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,939
And so we're putting ourselves into that program.

180
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,201
Yeah, I would love to that timeline.

181
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,042
That's fantastic.

182
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:55,105
And do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?

183
00:20:56,031 --> 00:21:00,532
Uh, yeah, I'll shoot her a note asking her if she could put something together.

184
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:05,974
Um, I, I suspected if she was sitting here right now, she could have just given it to you off the top of her head.

185
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:09,955
Um, but I can't that's why I have good staff.

186
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:10,696
Thank you.

187
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:13,336
Thank you.

188
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:21,439
Okay, so I think the other question, um.

189
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,480
Is around.

190
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:39,110
Let me just move this down here.

191
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:49,933
Any of these other projects that we are suggesting that we are recommending proceeding with in FY25.

192
00:21:50,013 --> 00:21:53,793
Last time we met, we talked about

193
00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:25,640
the five-pump control in the McGlynn, the failed flashing behind the brick facade, and the freight motor elevator as being like, and the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation being urgent types of projects that we should consider recommending that the school committee look for funding for.

194
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:31,737
Um, I don't know if you all have any thoughts about that in terms of, like, which ones we should be recommending.

195
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:35,719
I, I certainly, um.

196
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,522
I don't know how many years we've been talking about bike racks.

197
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:43,524
I'm kind of tired of talking about bike racks.

198
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:49,387
Um, and, um, well, it's.

199
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,610
Not a lot compared to a lot of the other things it still surprises me how much bike racks will cost us.

200
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:55,651
Um.

201
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:12,536
Did we lose you?

202
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:15,794
No, I apologize.

203
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,376
And I have a baby in the background, so I do apologize for that as well.

204
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:22,899
Well, not apologize for the baby, but she's a little distraught.

205
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:24,921
The bike racks are in the process of being ordered.

206
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:39,592
We received $20,000 from Community Preservation to install modern up-to-date bike racks and bike repair stations for the McGlynn, Andrews, and the high school.

207
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,794
So those are in the process of being ordered.

208
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:49,839
Surprisingly, there are delays in that supply chain.

209
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,301
I also, I apologize, can you hear me?

210
00:23:54,153 --> 00:24:21,605
yes but so there's two pieces there's one that is above the line and it says it's grant funded by the cpc um and there's one that's below the line that's for brooks mistletoe and roberts and i think that's the one paul is referring to if you're uh yep i mean we could definitely do that or wait until the next round of cpc funding in the summertime uh to uh request of that and demonstrate the project that's completed

211
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:32,035
or just take it out of the local capital budget?

212
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:34,877
If the CPC has been amenable to that,

213
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:45,272
project and we think that that's a good thing to at least try to leverage the CPC funding for.

214
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:49,535
Maybe that's what we recommend to the school committee.

215
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,317
Questions, thoughts, Erica, Paul?

216
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:54,238
I agree.

217
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,920
Okay, cool.

218
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:04,566
I also, member Graham, I also it appears I updated the wrong capital planning spreadsheet with numbers.

219
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:09,649
for McGlynn and Andrews parking.

220
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,551
That's in the neighborhood of $1.3 million.

221
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:16,792
To do granite curbs is $125 per linear foot, comes out to about $600,000.

222
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,393
The pavement is about $400,000 to do the bus loops and the

223
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,594
the bus loops and the parking lots at those two schools.

224
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:45,428
And then in speaking to the city engineer, Owen Wartella, he suggested because of the price fluctuations in asphalt to do a 30% contingency, which is $300,000.

225
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:46,589
So that would be $1.3 million on that.

226
00:25:50,347 --> 00:26:03,460
The, the re the Plaza, the ADA compliance of that I believe I forwarded it, this email on on on October 22, but that is a ballpark.

227
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:07,744
And unfortunately it's it's one of those things, another chicken and an egg.

228
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:10,547
You don't know it until you're necessarily into it.

229
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:20,850
in the neighborhood of $300,000 to $600,000 to fix that plaza, the entry plazas for the McGlynn and the Andrews.

230
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,791
The drainage at the Brooks to do the curbing is about $7,500.

231
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:30,192
There are two French drains that, number one, seem a bit undersized.

232
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:47,083
And number two, and once again, I apologize, definitely need to be cleaned out, but they seem undersized for the water that they might be required to handle.

233
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:56,667
So that would probably be in the neighborhood of an additional $15,000 for 22,500 in that ballpark.

234
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,428
And I will go on mute and I'm here if you need me.

235
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,969
Can I just ask you a question about that one?

236
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,471
Is that assuming DPW has the capacity to do the work?

237
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:10,913
Or that somebody else is doing it.

238
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:12,974
That would be somebody else doing it.

239
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:16,256
I don't think if we want to like.

240
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:24,599
I think has a lot on their plate and if we want to get the project done, we may have to get the project done.

241
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,962
And so the front Plaza, we had.

242
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:35,431
Somewhere between 300,000 and 550,000 between design and construction, is that correct?

243
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,832
Yes, I think the higher number came in at 600.

244
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:37,312
Okay.

245
00:27:55,891 --> 00:28:00,073
And that was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC?

246
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:02,374
Did we get an answer on that?

247
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:08,617
It's not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.

248
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,378
There is no real connection.

249
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,499
Okay.

250
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:31,475
Director Hunt, while we have you here, the issue is both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, the front plaza is settling and causing an ADA issue.

251
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:33,118
Are there

252
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:51,001
Other funding sources besides just city cash that we should be considering here from a grant perspective or particularly because of the ADA aspects of that.

253
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:57,465
I haven't seen any.

254
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,145
good funding sources for ADA compliance.

255
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:09,287
There tends to be an attitude of, it's your responsibility, and so you should fund it.

256
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:15,128
When we've seen things, they've been so small that, you know, a couple of thousand dollars here or there.

257
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:15,228
Sure.

258
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,989
The paperwork usually.

259
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,190
Yeah.

260
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,271
And former member McLaughlin had mentioned

261
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:31,218
a grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for.

262
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,902
And then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it.

263
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:38,264
I don't know if that's something that we can revisit.

264
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:43,869
I think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje.

265
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:49,434
Dr. Cushing, are you there?

266
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:52,229
I am.

267
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:53,870
Could you quickly restate the question?

268
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,651
I was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned.

269
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:05,414
I know we couldn't get the application in one year, and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.

270
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:09,775
I'm wondering if that's true.

271
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:09,855
Yes.

272
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:13,296
So Director Nwaloje worked on that this past year.

273
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:21,039
She encountered the same frustrations and issues with that online submission.

274
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:37,269
Um, uh, like, uh, frustration to the point of not being able, uh, in similar to what we went through, um, of, um, it, it, it is the most archaic submission system I've ever seen.

275
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:47,053
And, uh, it has caused, uh, you know, we're going to have to work at it this year, but to figure it out, but that was taken on the city side this year.

276
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:53,536
So it was taken on the city side, but ultimately not successful.

277
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:54,656
Yes.

278
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:55,836
In submission.

279
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:56,937
Correct.

280
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:01,798
And so when you say we're gonna have to do it again this year, who do you mean is going to do it?

281
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:14,360
Oh, we're gonna have to figure out, we're gonna reach out to the state partners on it to try to figure out how the best way to actually submit this is because we have proven in two years unsuccessful.

282
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:16,361
And who's we?

283
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:23,509
I tried to submit it twice in... No, but who's reaching out, I think is my question.

284
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,970
Like, is this something Francis is doing?

285
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,131
Is this something we are doing?

286
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:31,333
Like, who's doing this reaching out part?

287
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:37,457
So it'll either be myself or Francis to do that work, to reach out to them and to figure it out.

288
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:54,560
If something's fall crashing my house, not sure what it is.

289
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,384
Then let me ask a clarifying question about these items.

290
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:05,147
Are we out of compliance or are we in danger of being out of compliance?

291
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:26,761
I would say that right now the buildings are not accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act for entry into the buildings by the main entrance and the doors affected.

292
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:38,584
And are the fixes that are costed out here, I know the range is big,

293
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:46,769
will those have sufficient longevity that we won't need to be looking at this again in the immediate future?

294
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:47,210
It's a real fix.

295
00:32:51,303 --> 00:33:05,356
Yeah, in speaking to the people at Weston and Sampson, they're gonna if I remember correctly from the October 22nd email there, they think that this will be a permanent fix because they think that the settling has occurred.

296
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:09,640
And, but once they get into it, they'll be able to, they'll be able to test.

297
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,101
and to see, to make sure.

298
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:15,944
But the idea is that we're not doing this once every 20 years.

299
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:23,328
The idea is to fix it, to maintain it, and to make sure that it is still accessible.

300
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:29,972
And Dr. Cushing, when you say we need to work with the state partners, who are they?

301
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:35,475
I'm forgetting the exact name of the office that runs that grant.

302
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:36,976
Is it

303
00:33:37,719 --> 00:34:03,021
a commonwealth office or is it yes it is a common nope it's commonwealth office um do you think it would be helpful to reach out to our state delegation to ask for their assistance or alicia do you have thoughts on how to navigate this i know we haven't given you really any information so

304
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:18,838
I wanted to get a clarifying if you don't mind was is the problem that you're talking about is the system combines and is it literally the application, or is the problem, getting the right materials together to qualify.

305
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:27,504
Nope, we've had all the materials together to qualify we've had all the appropriate plans requirements, all those types of things.

306
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:35,348
It is a form that times out in an exceptionally short amount of time it does not save.

307
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:42,534
We have on numerous occasions entered and re-entered and tried.

308
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:56,347
We were told not this past year, but the previous year when I did the submissions that they would accept it, that it was in, but then I don't think we qualified, but it is the tool itself

309
00:34:57,122 --> 00:35:10,144
to go online and to enter it is an exceedingly archaic submission tool to work with.

310
00:35:10,924 --> 00:35:13,905
On the school side, we've moved to a system called GEMS.

311
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:25,807
It is unlike any other grant submission software or program that I've seen in having done this now with both state and federal agencies.

312
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:42,476
I ask because we've run into technical problems with grant applications in the past, and usually when we reach out to the granting agency, they are aware that their system is a problem and they have a workaround.

313
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:49,499
So it's surprising to me that they haven't just said to you, just email us the forms.

314
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:54,821
Yeah, that has not been said, and there have been no workarounds offered.

315
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:55,741
At least when I did it.

316
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:03,355
If I can interject, it's the Massachusetts Office on Disability that is providing these grants.

317
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,296
Thank you.

318
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,656
The Disability Commission?

319
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:14,598
No, the Massachusetts Office on Disability, unless they've renamed themselves.

320
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:15,178
OK.

321
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,765
They may have renamed themselves to this, but I know I spoke this week to Frances about this.

322
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:31,150
And she said she submitted it, and then the application disappeared from the system.

323
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,693
And they don't understand why.

324
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:37,975
It is a problematic system.

325
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:45,321
You actually, when you start the application, you have to complete it.

326
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:54,443
when you're doing it, there's no way on their site to save it and then come back later if they ask you for information.

327
00:36:55,703 --> 00:37:02,106
So it's very cumbersome and doesn't operate like any other website that's out there.

328
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:14,771
And just so the committee, the subcommittee is aware, you know, 18 months ago or so, or 13 months ago, whenever it was that I was working on it,

329
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:19,689
We were looking to do curb cuts at Medford High School.

330
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:32,656
We were looking to do wayfinding signs within Medford High School and in other places in the district for accessibility as those were the two primary fixes that we were looking for.

331
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:42,581
We were looking for 19 curb cuts, I believe it was, at Medford High School, as well as to do the parking improvements for

332
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,083
ADA accessible spaces.

333
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:54,667
That work has been completed on the local budget, but we did that work at the end of last year, April of last year.

334
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,030
I'm going to suggest that

335
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:10,779
Our recommendation to the committee is that we successfully, for the first time, submit this grant.

336
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:24,786
And that meanwhile, I'm going to send a note to our state delegation asking for their assistance in how they can help get this moving in the right direction.

337
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:29,308
Dr. Edward Benson?

338
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:41,340
Yes, at the time, when we encountered all of the technical difficulties, I was in communication with Representative Sean Garberly.

339
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,861
So he was aware.

340
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,662
But at that point in time, everything had been lost.

341
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:48,742
We thought it was in there.

342
00:38:49,322 --> 00:38:50,042
And it got lost.

343
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:55,003
So he was aware of all of the technical difficulty that we had.

344
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,884
So he may be a good starting point.

345
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:57,784
When we

346
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:03,208
start the process again to keep him looped in from the beginning.

347
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,449
Okay.

348
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:15,576
Um, I will send a note to reach out to him if the, if this group and then ultimately the committee is agreeable that the recommendation is we should submit a grant this year.

349
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:19,738
I think we should.

350
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:25,563
I also think we can't be dependent on this grant coming through to get in compliance for accessibility.

351
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:30,066
I think this has to be a priority with or without the grant.

352
00:39:35,911 --> 00:39:42,297
So let's see if we can't move that along grant-wise.

353
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:45,239
And if not, that may need to be a request.

354
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:59,991
And then you asked what else here in the shaded portion is a priority.

355
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:03,773
When you say the flashing failed, the word failed is always worrisome.

356
00:40:04,274 --> 00:40:06,975
What does that mean for those of us who are not stonemasons?

357
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:12,478
It means it rains inside the kindergarten when there's a driving sideways wind.

358
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:16,440
Yeah, and we're fixing that for the roofs on other buildings.

359
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,963
That also feels like a... Mend.

360
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:41,203
Well, and so my question, sorry to interrupt, my question on this is, all right, you know, we could move this project forward now with, you know, with funds that are becoming available, or, you know, like, I mean, this is a long standing problem.

361
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,365
So I'd like to get it fixed.

362
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:50,954
But I could also see a realm where it's rolled into the roof replacement slash roof repair restoration.

363
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,098
But I also don't necessarily want to wait on it.

364
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:59,786
How is the flashing on the brick related to the roof?

365
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:09,493
It's all where that section of the building connects back in.

366
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:22,142
So basically, while that work is done on the roof and building envelope, I would make sure that it is written into the scope that that has to be addressed.

367
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:27,826
The flashing issue behind the brick is not at the roof line, is it?

368
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,934
It appears to be.

369
00:41:35,938 --> 00:41:36,719
It appears to be.

370
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:46,067
Alicia, have you all talked about that piece of that at all?

371
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:54,395
Or should we ask Tom about potential integration of that into the bigger project?

372
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,721
Yeah, I know there are some flashing issues on the roof.

373
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:05,863
I hadn't heard that there was a problem down the side, like behind the bricks and all.

374
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:19,949
If it is in fact that the water's getting in at the roof level, that makes sense as opposed to, you know, coming really straight through the wall, which sounds odd to me, but I don't know, it could be.

375
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:23,250
We need to get a full quote

376
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:25,953
an assessment for the roof.

377
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:35,959
But I think that if we mentioned this problem to the people looking at that, they could tell us if they believe that it's a problem.

378
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,081
We already know that.

379
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:43,264
We did a water infiltration test.

380
00:42:43,946 --> 00:42:48,268
Yes, we did a water infiltration test that I've circulated around.

381
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:51,109
Alicia, I apologize that I didn't circulate it to you.

382
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,991
But, and there's again, once again, the topic of the night, chicken and egg.

383
00:42:57,011 --> 00:43:09,115
You know, in order to repair this and build a scope of work, we needed a scope of work to build the scope of work and another circular issue.

384
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:21,834
I mean, if it's in any way related to the flashing on the roof, then it clearly makes sense that it should be at least.

385
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:32,481
Because I wonder, I don't know, maybe Peter knows, is there work that needs to be done literally on the bricks and behind the bricks, or if it's just roof-level work?

386
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:38,846
If it's roof-level work, then do it with rebuilding the roof or even the roof wall connection.

387
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:52,792
It appears that it may be the roof wall connection, as well as removing three courses of bricks along a section of the rear of the building.

388
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,194
Will that come out in this mini recommissioning assessment that we've just split off?

389
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,814
Well, we already have done that for this problem.

390
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,375
We just haven't funded it to actually fix it.

391
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,315
So I think it's a known problem that requires funding.

392
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:14,815
It's about $80,000.

393
00:44:15,015 --> 00:44:22,802
I spoke with a community member who has extensive construction background about this because he was surprised at how much it would cost.

394
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:28,547
And then we looked at what was in the high level assessment.

395
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,748
He was like, oh, well.

396
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:33,009
that seems actually appropriate.

397
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:42,992
And so it would generally speaking be about $20,000 in construction management costs to manage the project and make sure it's done right, and then $80,000 in actual equipment time materials.

398
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:50,018
Right.

399
00:44:50,138 --> 00:45:01,426
So one thing is that I see is that if we already have people mobilized to be doing work on the building and to oversee construction, et cetera, then there's some cost savings, right?

400
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:06,269
Like there is this idea of mobilization, getting the contractors and stuff out to the site.

401
00:45:06,649 --> 00:45:12,253
And then every time you do that, that's an added cost, um, because of all their overheads.

402
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:17,036
So if it is an option to do it together, then there is some,

403
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:27,635
economies of savings, there is, you know, it's certainly that's, and I do question, can you actually fix it without doing the roof?

404
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:41,824
Like, are those two integrally, like, if you were to fix the area behind the bricks, but not the part on the roof, which is the flashing, does that defeat the purpose and the problem reoccurs?

405
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:43,845
So you actually need to do them together.

406
00:45:51,865 --> 00:46:01,631
And then another idea would be to just replace this section of the roof now and the course of bricks and all that.

407
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:09,356
But I don't know what that would do to increase that $100,000 cost when adding in the roof or roof reconditioning.

408
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:19,081
Yeah, but this is one we definitely get called on every time it happens, because it's not like a little water streaming down.

409
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:20,042
It's a lot.

410
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:36,043
And it's not it is we're still talking about the McGlynn right yeah yes it doesn't make any sense to do part of the roof and not the whole like if you're going to do the whole roof within the next six months.

411
00:46:37,638 --> 00:46:49,666
Sorry, Director Hunt, the this roof is a lower portion of the building that juts out the classrooms in that area jut out probably about 30 or 40 feet.

412
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:53,668
And so it has it's they have their own separate lower roof.

413
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:55,530
It's a one story roof.

414
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:56,971
So,

415
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:05,494
I would normally agree with you 100%, however, it is almost a separate roof from the main larger roof.

416
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:07,135
Not almost, it is.

417
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:14,959
My apologies, I'm looking at the overview and I never realized that that existed as a separate little roof.

418
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,121
Yep, it's a fun architectural thing that I wish didn't exist.

419
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:24,615
And I mean, member Russo is 100% right.

420
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:25,756
We get called on it.

421
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:32,178
It is definitely something that was brought to the committee's attention, I believe, in November or October of 2021.

422
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:42,763
There was another thing I was going to add, but hopefully it'll come back to me.

423
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:43,543
I apologize.

424
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:54,837
Okay, so I can get a note to the, we can get a note to the about.

425
00:47:55,737 --> 00:48:03,063
This piece, so that there's at least an opportunity to talk about whether inclusion in the project is an economy of scale or not.

426
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:05,665
But also.

427
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:10,149
We can talk to them about.

428
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:19,477
Whether there's an opportunity to advance this work ahead of the rest of the work, because it is its own separate little roof.

429
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:23,340
That is not the same as, like.

430
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:32,547
The bigger roof project, so we can get that information and integrate it before the special meeting that we have.

431
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:38,256
And member Graham, I do have one other number that I think I forgot to mention earlier.

432
00:48:38,276 --> 00:48:44,524
Our roofing inspector conducted an infrared scan of the roof.

433
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,403
I believe, and Director Riggi can jump on this.

434
00:48:50,384 --> 00:49:00,406
The initial thoughts on a visual inspection of the roof, a few weeks ago, the thought was that it was about maybe 10% wet, that that could be fixed.

435
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:02,287
The infrared scan revealed 20 to 25%.

436
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:09,924
water saturation, water infiltration, the right terms.

437
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:18,639
I'm not doing right now, but he then changed his recommendation and said that it should either be a reconditioning

438
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:30,016
which would be similar to what was done at the Andrews, or a roof replacement which would increase the insulation.

439
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:39,000
The number I'm recollecting on the roof reconditioning slash restoration is $1.4 to $1.6 million.

440
00:49:42,685 --> 00:49:59,860
Whereas the roof replacement, which includes all new insulation, but both products are guaranteed or are listed at a 20 year roof so the white night slash film that goes over the roof.

441
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:03,960
similar to the Andrews is 20 years, a new roof, 20 years.

442
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,463
The price on the second option for full roof replacement with the added insulation is at $2.8 to $3.0 million.

443
00:50:12,503 --> 00:50:12,663
Okay.

444
00:50:12,683 --> 00:50:12,803
Got it.

445
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,204
Thank you.

446
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:31,428
Um, did you also get a price for the dump the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation?

447
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:35,922
So the door sweeps are nowhere near as expensive as we thought.

448
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:38,344
That can be covered in the local budget and will be.

449
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:47,793
The dumpsters, I'm awaiting emails back from waste management on what the cost would be to move from.

450
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:53,658
We currently own our dumpsters and own our equipment to move towards a lease option on those.

451
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,040
I do not have that number at this time.

452
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:03,507
When you get those numbers, can we, can you let me know and I'll update this?

453
00:51:04,248 --> 00:51:04,788
Absolutely.

454
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:06,470
Okay.

455
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:18,579
Okay, so we have some items here, the network closet mini splits for Brooks, Ms.

456
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,041
Duck-Roberts and Medford High.

457
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:28,187
We were, Dr. Cushing, you were in the process of

458
00:51:28,991 --> 00:51:33,172
parsing out that estimate of like McGlynn Andrews versus everybody else.

459
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:33,833
Is that right?

460
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:35,013
It is.

461
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:37,794
I have not finished that and we'll get that to you as well.

462
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:49,198
And can you help us understand like how, um, urgent is this need at Brooks Roberts, Mississauga, Medford High?

463
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:53,179
So, um, it's beyond urgent.

464
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:56,100
The systems have essentially, the systems have failed.

465
00:51:57,602 --> 00:52:06,627
They're 20 years old, many of them original to the building, and they have either all failed or in their last stages of failing.

466
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:15,992
As Member Rousseau can definitely back me up and attest, network infrastructure requires climate controlled.

467
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:21,415
They generate a tremendous amount of heat, and especially in those small closets,

468
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:37,265
They need to be climate controlled or quite literally they will cook themselves as we are seeing one other project that I'm working on is rebuilding our network infrastructure we have a significant amount of E rate funding available to us.

469
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:43,585
that we have not accessed, the lion's share of it.

470
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:52,732
But in order to access those funds, we would have to put up in the neighborhood of $150,000 to $200,000 because basically the government does a 60% match.

471
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:02,739
So we're right now building a proposal with our E-rate consultant on this.

472
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:09,941
However, the E-rate money does not, it only supports networking and direct network infrastructure.

473
00:53:10,441 --> 00:53:17,783
It does not consider these mini splits and cooling systems as part of that infrastructure.

474
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:21,404
It is ancillary to, although really required.

475
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,705
So those systems have failed.

476
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:27,385
I do have a report.

477
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:41,607
on that that I can share with everybody from Royal Air, met with them and went through every single system in the district and what would be needed to replace them.

478
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:52,854
And then B2Q has done the designing of it, which, you know, it's basically figuring out the best system of the mini splits to put in.

479
00:53:52,994 --> 00:54:04,517
There are a few various options, but they are, right now, the refrigeration and HVAC world seems to be going through a lot of shifts with various refrigerants.

480
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:11,018
The equipment we'd need to replace them really would not be available until Q2 of next year.

481
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:19,957
April, May, June timeframe.

482
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:31,185
And are you suggesting that we need to prioritize this in FY25 or that we should prioritize this for FY26?

483
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:38,751
I think it needs to be prioritized across the district as an urgent need.

484
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:48,221
It would be unwise to replace the network infrastructure in an environment that is simply going to cause it to fail.

485
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:58,030
So 25, does that recommend proceeding in FY 25 is the recommendation?

486
00:54:59,351 --> 00:54:59,611
Yes.

487
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:07,578
Then we have the fire pump control at the McGlynn Elementary.

488
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:09,921
That can be removed.

489
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:10,961
That has been replaced.

490
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,343
I'm going to say it's complete then.

491
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:18,943
Perfect.

492
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:23,724
Okay.

493
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,145
Do we even have a section for complete?

494
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:32,245
First time for everything.

495
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:33,626
Great.

496
00:55:34,386 --> 00:55:35,306
Put it at the top.

497
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,081
And the 1st thing in a new tab is what that is.

498
00:55:49,368 --> 00:55:50,990
Yeah, project status complete.

499
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,593
Instead of in progress excellent news.

500
00:55:56,495 --> 00:56:00,059
Okay, we have the freight elevator motor at Medford high.

501
00:56:02,595 --> 00:56:04,496
I just got an update on this today.

502
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:06,918
Director Riggi was with me when we got it.

503
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:24,168
We're trying to figure out the actual pricing, but it has been recommended that when this motor is either rebuilt or replaced, that the controls for the freight elevator already should be replaced because it will

504
00:56:24,972 --> 00:56:29,274
They will need to be replaced shortly thereafter if we don't do it at the same time.

505
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:37,778
So we're trying to get, we're going to get some clarity on pricing to make sure that it was fully inclusive of everything I need.

506
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,781
But Paul, if you have, Paul Riggi, if you have anything to add on that, please feel free.

507
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,186
No, Dr. Cushing, you're exactly right.

508
00:56:51,706 --> 00:57:14,837
The elevator company that I used when they looked at it said based on the age of not only the motor, but the controls for the motor, that it would not be in our best interest to do one without the other because then we're guaranteed that they would work properly going forward.

509
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:24,277
And is this member and member so a recommendation for twenty five.

510
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,945
Oh, yeah, I think so this isn't on the verge of failing or this isn't already failed.

511
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:38,738
It failed due to the flood last year.

512
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:42,520
The motor is not even in the building anymore.

513
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,982
It's with one of the elevator companies.

514
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,805
So yeah, it has failed.

515
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:51,026
Got it.

516
00:57:52,247 --> 00:58:04,356
And the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation, are we putting that in a recommend proceeding in 25?

517
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:06,402
category?

518
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:13,906
I think if I can offer a suggestion, I think both of those should be.

519
00:58:15,227 --> 00:58:21,550
I want to get not just cost, but a real understanding of the dumpsters.

520
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,271
I can't believe, yep.

521
00:58:24,511 --> 00:58:29,274
So I would like to make sure I get a comprehensive understanding of the dumpsters and what needs to be done.

522
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,516
I'm going to ask if you could remind us.

523
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:33,256
Sorry.

524
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:35,718
Go ahead, members.

525
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:38,580
Can you remind us what the dumpster situation is?

526
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:45,284
So they're essentially, they appear to be, all of the dumpsters have been previously repaired.

527
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:47,766
They've rusted previously.

528
00:58:47,786 --> 00:58:49,988
They've been sent back to waste management.

529
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:51,208
We've paid for repairs.

530
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:59,094
And what director McLaughlin has told me is that, you know, there's no more opportunity to really repair them.

531
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:04,110
So I don't see why we would want to purchase dumpsters again.

532
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,913
Seems like if we have a problem with a dumpster in the future, we're leasing it.

533
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:17,939
Waste management, please come take the dumpster and replace it with something that's going to be preventing rodents and leaking trash and things like that.

534
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:27,757
This is something that we've talked a little bit with waste management about as part of our new waste program for the city.

535
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:32,521
So we do have some pricing with them, we have a direct contact with them.

536
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:38,985
But to be clear, what you have at all the schools are compactors with dumpsters in them that have rotted out.

537
00:59:41,727 --> 01:00:01,273
I would like to have a consultant, a waste consultant, just come and take a look because it might be that the, and we have somebody who I believe who could do that for free, who might, it might make sense to have regular dumpsters that are emptied weekly might be cheaper than replacing the compactors.

538
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:09,676
It's a little unclear to me if you can just, like if you rent a dumpster from waste management that you put inside the compactor that actually

539
01:00:10,696 --> 01:00:11,376
possible.

540
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:20,560
I think we may be looking at replacing the compactors with dumpsters emptied weekly and that might be cheaper than purchasing new compactors.

541
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:31,505
But it's something that let me hook you up if Director Cushing is the right, sorry I'm

542
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:41,378
is the right contact to get you in touch with the people at Waste Management who we've been talking with a little bit about this.

543
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:45,301
It fell off my radar, but we were thinking about it about a year ago.

544
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:50,366
Yeah, and I emailed those individuals that we were speaking with a year ago.

545
01:00:50,886 --> 01:00:52,147
I'm just awaiting a reply.

546
01:00:52,167 --> 01:01:00,594
I was going to ask what the timeline for the assessment is, but it sounds like we don't have that number either.

547
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:19,575
I also don't know if that would necessarily need to fall under capital, if it becomes part of the annual, if we're not making a large purchase of dumpsters and instead we're moving to a lease option, whatever it may be, whatever it may be, but.

548
01:01:21,376 --> 01:01:24,877
Oh, what I wrote was recommend proceeding in FY 26 potential

549
01:01:31,664 --> 01:01:37,367
From the operating budget, because I think realistically.

550
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:42,330
It's the end of the year and that's why 25 ends in June.

551
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:46,813
And if we're going to boil the ocean between now and then, like.

552
01:01:48,024 --> 01:01:55,545
realistically, we're not going to get to doing a replacement of something like this until summer, which is already FY 26.

553
01:01:55,725 --> 01:02:12,268
So if the goal is like between now and then we like figure out what the right go forward plan is and whether that's capital or, or budget or whatever, it's, I think what I'm hearing is it's FY 26.

554
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:14,569
Do you guys agree with that?

555
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:16,749
Yes, I do.

556
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:17,409
Okay.

557
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:20,289
Got it.

558
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:24,652
And then drainage at the field for the Brooks.

559
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:27,294
This year.

560
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:31,097
Thank you.

561
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:35,019
That's a very long time coming.

562
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,101
My kids are going to graduate before it gets fixed.

563
01:02:38,442 --> 01:02:39,382
And it happened.

564
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:42,004
We were in elementary school when we started this conversation.

565
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,946
Do we have what we need to do that?

566
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,310
I can't it's up.

567
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,591
Yeah, it sounds like we have a quote.

568
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:53,914
So it's just a funding issue.

569
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,536
And is it going to affect?

570
01:02:57,036 --> 01:02:58,077
I don't know how long it takes.

571
01:02:58,157 --> 01:02:58,357
Is it?

572
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:02,120
Are people using the field now?

573
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:05,322
Yeah, so is.

574
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:07,884
How long does it take?

575
01:03:07,904 --> 01:03:14,609
I remember when the Roberts playground drainage issue was happening and kids couldn't play on the playground and I won't mention that.

576
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:20,011
We should be able to... This isn't under the field.

577
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:22,772
It's on the hill.

578
01:03:23,372 --> 01:03:23,753
Okay.

579
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:27,895
That, like, essentially dumps runoff onto the field.

580
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:36,819
But it's because the hill is not properly drained, so the field shouldn't be impacted by the work, I would think.

581
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,202
Okay, so this isn't going to disrupt essential recess activities.

582
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:44,303
No.

583
01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:45,844
I think so, right, Peter?

584
01:03:46,621 --> 01:03:50,944
Right now, I mean, if anything, maybe a few days, but not nowhere near.

585
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:53,766
Any type of a lengthy disruption.

586
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:57,128
Okay, and then yeah.

587
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:00,650
Yeah, got it.

588
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:06,514
And then these items, the other things on the list here.

589
01:04:08,536 --> 01:04:14,099
are all, uh, this whole group, I think I would suggest that we leave them as not committed.

590
01:04:14,179 --> 01:04:24,665
So there are things we have to plan for in the future, but the mini assessment is going to tell us what that means.

591
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:37,352
Um, so ready to support taking any like urgent, immediate action in terms of funding, but we should leave them on the plan because they are upcoming needs that we know we're going to need to think about.

592
01:04:39,148 --> 01:04:42,672
Um, the other remaining items on the list.

593
01:04:43,693 --> 01:04:46,957
With district wide security upgrades.

594
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:52,162
And then we have playground renovations also that are, um.

595
01:04:53,704 --> 01:04:54,185
You know, I guess.

596
01:04:55,629 --> 01:04:58,051
They're not like urgent things are falling apart.

597
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:04,277
But they were also noted in our last meeting as things we could possibly talk to the CPC about.

598
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:08,982
And then the last thing is the parking lot paving.

599
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:13,406
So can I interject on the playground?

600
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:13,626
Yeah.

601
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:14,427
Sorry.

602
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,721
But happy memory.

603
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:17,221
So go ahead.

604
01:05:17,241 --> 01:05:18,141
Sorry, my apologies.

605
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:23,203
No, no, I just wanted to talk about the district wide security upgrades.

606
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,764
Is there can we parse that a bit?

607
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:34,347
Because there's a portion of that that I think we should do sooner or consider doing sooner.

608
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:36,668
And that's the

609
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:44,766
the key lists, the IDs to get in, the FOBs or whatever they're called, Peter, you have to fill me in on that.

610
01:05:45,586 --> 01:06:06,770
Key FOBs, and I actually have reached out to the first of the three companies I've worked with previously to update the quotes on that, but to also include, well, our telephone project has been great in all honesty, and I would consider it a very successful deployment.

611
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,632
One of the problems that we're facing is with the door phones.

612
01:06:12,272 --> 01:06:26,522
So when you walk up to any of the five schools, all right, not the high school, but any of the other five schools and not the Curtis Tufts, what you're actually pushing is a telephone that is set to ring someplace.

613
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:28,604
Those are 20 years old.

614
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:32,767
And just, we didn't have the money to put in the scope to do that work.

615
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:37,884
And they're, they're having issues, some of them, not all of them.

616
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:50,971
But what would be nice is to also have an integrated doorbell that has a camera so that security or secretarial or building leadership can see who is at the door clearly.

617
01:06:52,016 --> 01:07:04,386
Um, so I've had them price out, um, putting those in at, um, the elementary schools, which is two, because they basically all have two entrances, um, and then the loading docks.

618
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:13,253
So three at those schools, um, two at the Andrews, and I think either two or three at the McGlynn.

619
01:07:13,453 --> 01:07:14,975
The McGlynn, while a bigger campus,

620
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:22,959
has an interesting setup that there's really no need for one on the back door if we go to key fobs but one on the main door and one on the loading dock.

621
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:26,140
So I believe we just went with two there for the quote.

622
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,921
So I do have those quotes updated.

623
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:35,865
I do believe that that I would highly recommend it as work that we should do.

624
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:47,574
because it gives you a clear and accurate record of who's entering your building when and provides you with really enhanced security.

625
01:07:48,014 --> 01:07:52,916
However, I will say that I realize my limitations.

626
01:07:53,756 --> 01:08:09,844
And I would recommend that as part of this, we either use the house doctors that the city has set up for architectural firms or some other security management firm to manage the deployment so that it's successful.

627
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,488
I have a number on that if you so desire.

628
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:29,698
So, members, so are there 3 parts keyless locks intercom.

629
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:35,042
And the doors right Peter.

630
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:41,227
Yes, 1 of them was very expensive and that's is that the doors that are the well, no, it's.

631
01:08:41,988 --> 01:08:46,552
It's it's the camera is the camera upgrading the cameras across the district.

632
01:08:47,173 --> 01:09:02,523
was going to be the more expensive, um, to do the, to do key fob access at the schools, um, which is between three and five, between three and five doors at each school, a few more at Medford high school.

633
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:15,212
Um, and the integrated, uh, like the cameras on the doorbells, uh, is, is, you know, approximately $260,000.

634
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:32,174
I'm sorry, it's $260,000 for three to five doors and employee fobs, or it's $260,000 for all of that plus the camera intercom buzzer system.

635
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:39,410
All of that at every school, by the way, just so you know, at every school, I apologize, I'm breaking up.

636
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:52,835
At every school, three to five doors, a few more at Medford High School, key fobs and the integrated camera doorbells at the schools, yes, 260.

637
01:09:54,536 --> 01:09:55,516
Total for all of them.

638
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,397
Total for all of them.

639
01:09:58,797 --> 01:10:00,018
Let me make sure I have this right.

640
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:05,781
Keyless locks and employee bobs, three to five doors at most schools.

641
01:10:06,642 --> 01:10:06,862
Yep.

642
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:07,902
Okay.

643
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:11,824
And then the camera intercom system.

644
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:11,905
Yep.

645
01:10:16,987 --> 01:10:18,808
Included in that for the neighborhood.

646
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:22,891
For select entry points

647
01:10:24,642 --> 01:10:30,044
including three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Mistituck, three at the McGlynn, two at the Andrews.

648
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,566
Two at the McGlynn, two at the McGlynn.

649
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,548
Oh, three at Andrews, two at McGlynn?

650
01:10:40,628 --> 01:10:50,392
Two at Andrews, two at McGlynn, three at Brooks, Roberts, Mistituck, and three at Medford High School.

651
01:10:53,897 --> 01:10:55,717
Loading dock, main door, door 31.

652
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:10,680
And member Graham, if it were a new school, I would do more there, but I am trying to be responsible fiscally.

653
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:13,321
Got it.

654
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,041
And so all of that is 260.

655
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:20,402
Yeah, which is electrification of doors,

656
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:33,058
network wiring, cabling, hardware, and all on the same system that we have field tested with our vape sensors.

657
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:38,040
So we're starting to move towards an integrated approach.

658
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,801
And so what is the remainder of the 1.9?

659
01:11:44,919 --> 01:11:57,646
Uh, that is, um, either upgrading or, um, adding cameras so that essentially every square inch of the metaphor public schools is covered.

660
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:58,887
Uh, right.

661
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:04,342
I'm not going to go into the details publicly right now, but so that every square inch is covered.

662
01:12:06,343 --> 01:12:22,131
And also that vape sensors are deployed in all middle school bathrooms, as well as some added, I'll term them added security enhancements at points of entry.

663
01:12:27,234 --> 01:12:28,335
And that's the one, really 1.7.

664
01:12:30,444 --> 01:12:35,548
In that, well, let's call that 1.9, the high first quote.

665
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:40,872
I did get a quote in the neighborhood of 1.3, 1.4 for all that was just mentioned.

666
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:53,001
And the other thing that was in this before was network phone availability in Medford High classrooms.

667
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,084
Yep, we can definitely- Where does that fall?

668
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:08,835
We can, I believe we can move forward with that in the coming months with existing resources and infrastructure.

669
01:13:18,177 --> 01:13:19,817
So that goes into in progress?

670
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:22,038
I would say yes.

671
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:28,192
And there's no capital dollars needed?

672
01:13:34,274 --> 01:13:37,914
I believe we can do it with existing infrastructure and resources.

673
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:42,456
That's amazing.

674
01:13:43,316 --> 01:13:43,696
OK.

675
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:45,716
Well, hold on.

676
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:47,117
When it's done, it'll be amazing.

677
01:13:47,137 --> 01:13:49,017
Fair.

678
01:13:53,584 --> 01:13:54,204
Okay.

679
01:13:56,005 --> 01:14:15,855
But the district security updates, if I leave that at 1.7 and then the key lock, the locks and the fobs and the camera buzzer systems as a separate line item for 260, does that sound right?

680
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:18,317
Yeah, it does.

681
01:14:18,477 --> 01:14:19,937
I mean, I'd say the 1.7,

682
01:14:21,514 --> 01:14:24,817
you could pull that down more in the 1.4 range.

683
01:14:26,138 --> 01:14:37,466
I'd have to get those quotes updated but you know I think more in the 1.4 range by separating out that 260 ish.

684
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:44,912
Okay and so oh remember so thank you um so the

685
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:53,718
I mean, it is already just about December, but the, and I had to remember July one is the new fiscal year.

686
01:14:53,858 --> 01:14:55,199
We don't really do anything in June.

687
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:09,147
Well, we do a lot, but, so do we want the Keyless FOB stuff to be next year or is this year, is it just too late for that?

688
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:13,169
So I think my recommendation would be

689
01:15:14,256 --> 01:15:39,242
um that uh this might be a good use of available now i should say now available funding um but again um yeah i defer to the group but i i believe this is something we might be able to do this year i do want to say though um it's one of those things that i would need assistance with

690
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:45,657
recognizing my own limitations and the amount of projects that I'm currently managing.

691
01:15:46,337 --> 01:15:49,799
So we just need to look at that piece of the deployment.

692
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,040
Got it.

693
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,201
It does seem like a good summer project.

694
01:15:55,481 --> 01:16:01,523
I just from a spending money kind of question, I wasn't sure if we should do it sooner.

695
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:06,825
But well, and I think that's I think that's like I would agree it is a great summer project.

696
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:24,129
However, in order to spend down perhaps resources and get high value, I think this is a high value project that allows us to very visibly show security enhancements.

697
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:32,772
So I guess what I'm thinking about when I say recommend proceeding in FY 25 is that

698
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:58,225
What I am thinking about as we are talking is that in December, when we take a vote, the vote is really for the administration to consider these projects as part of the supplemental budget requests they're going to bring forward in January.

699
01:16:59,146 --> 01:17:04,068
And then if there is something that can't be funded that we said,

700
01:17:04,838 --> 01:17:15,144
doing 25 and it can't be funded through the supplemental budget, then that has to go before the council for additional funding.

701
01:17:16,304 --> 01:17:29,712
But I think the first step is like this should give some clarity to our budget director to say these are the projects that we are thinking are very important and we want to see you weigh in on when you bring the supplemental budget forward.

702
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,233
Does that make sense to everybody?

703
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:33,420
It makes sense to me.

704
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,401
And I do think that's a very high value project, the FOB stuff.

705
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,262
We are also going into negotiations.

706
01:17:42,362 --> 01:17:49,623
And frankly, I don't want to talk about keys in our negotiations.

707
01:17:50,984 --> 01:17:56,225
So I think that it would be good to just get this over with.

708
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:07,084
Again, from a what's the supplemental going to look like, this can wait.

709
01:18:07,304 --> 01:18:15,409
I mean, if there ends up being room in the supplemental, then this number here is already too big, isn't it?

710
01:18:15,749 --> 01:18:16,229
Yeah.

711
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:17,010
OK.

712
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:31,316
So, the things that we still have as not committed are the district wide security updates for 1.5.

713
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:36,079
We did have those like, but that's.

714
01:18:41,607 --> 01:18:44,969
saying anything more than that just yet about that.

715
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:49,151
And maybe that's a good conversation for the school committee.

716
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,034
The other question I had was around playground renovation.

717
01:18:54,154 --> 01:19:00,838
So we are mostly done with the playground renovation at the McGlynn.

718
01:19:00,878 --> 01:19:04,200
And it's stunning and spectacular and gorgeous.

719
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:09,223
And it was a very long process.

720
01:19:10,222 --> 01:19:15,384
to do the design work to make it such a special project in the end.

721
01:19:16,104 --> 01:19:25,167
So I guess I'm curious, we sort of have on the radar that all of our playgrounds are going to need to be replaced at some point in time.

722
01:19:25,187 --> 01:19:36,031
Is there a timing of when we might seek CPC funding for another playground?

723
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,052
And I believe that

724
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:48,750
Part of the reason we are having this conversation right now is because the CPC window opens after this.

725
01:19:49,030 --> 01:20:02,334
So if we were going to recommend that we put forward a project for this upcoming cycle, we would have to identify which project that would be.

726
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:07,656
Yeah, and the two that I would say in

727
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:15,167
The two that are probably most pressing equally are the Misituk and the Roberts.

728
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:29,678
And, you know, after discussing with Shanine, our playground specialist, we actually came to the conclusion that based on population served,

729
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:34,328
that the miss attack might be the better option.

730
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:44,154
However, we also know that the Roberts is a very full school and could use playground options as well.

731
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:45,495
But

732
01:20:46,255 --> 01:21:02,938
funding really won't allow, and I don't believe that these projects would be anywhere near the cost that the McGlynn was in the neighborhood of $2.9 million, including the about $140,000 or $150,000 we spent on the design study with the design work with Copley-Wolf.

733
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,742
Um, so I don't believe that it would cost that much.

734
01:21:06,802 --> 01:21:08,644
I do believe the design would cost that much.

735
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:13,088
And, um, our community member donated time previously.

736
01:21:13,108 --> 01:21:16,431
Um, so we need to really think about that.

737
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:23,517
So, um, I'm definitely willing and able to apply for, um, CPC funds.

738
01:21:26,094 --> 01:21:32,975
I think that window is more in the summer, but it would give us time to make sure that we're ready to go.

739
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:52,039
Or the committee could say, we want to fund the design, not go to CPC for funding the design, which would mean that we start the design process as part of the supplemental budget in February instead of waiting until, say, September or October.

740
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:01,605
So I just wanted to weigh in between the two schools.

741
01:22:02,086 --> 01:22:13,114
I would definitely advocate more strongly for the Roberts because the Roberts is our only elementary school that is really landlocked.

742
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:21,440
And the one major distinction between the Missittuck and the Roberts is that the Missittuck does have the benefit of

743
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:28,569
the Columbus Field Park that is, you know, it's, they use both spaces.

744
01:22:29,089 --> 01:22:42,923
So the students actually, although the playgrounds do need to be renovated, the students at the Missittuck are able to go up the stairs and use the additional field space at the Missittuck location.

745
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:46,406
Whereas the Roberts, they really, you know,

746
01:22:47,367 --> 01:23:00,952
it's so crammed over there, they're landlocked, the students don't have that same option to have a park, a green space, which abuts their campus, immediately abuts their campus, that they could use on a daily basis.

747
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:06,595
And so that would be one of the things that I would just say if

748
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:10,952
a decision had to be made between the two schools.

749
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:14,474
I do feel the Roberts has gotten the short end of the stick.

750
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:26,739
They're using practically part of the parking lot for space because it's just so crammed and they have slightly over 600 students.

751
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:35,002
So being the largest elementary school with the smallest footprint, I would prioritize the Roberts.

752
01:23:35,582 --> 01:23:37,123
That's all I wanted to share.

753
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:41,192
if it came down to those two schools?

754
01:23:48,694 --> 01:23:49,594
Thank you.

755
01:23:50,814 --> 01:23:51,335
I agree.

756
01:23:52,115 --> 01:24:01,718
And I do think that there's an uncomfortable conversation that has to be had about the Roberts Playground.

757
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:22,624
and the situation there, whether that conversation involves finding an alternative space to park, whether that involves taking of land through eminent domain, there is no solution to that area.

758
01:24:24,264 --> 01:24:43,321
whether we do their park, whether we do their playground first, and then we do the others, in the end, when all of these are beautiful playgrounds, one is going to be very distinct, and that's going to be the Roberts, for being utterly incomparable to the others.

759
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:49,086
And I mean, I think it's important, you know,

760
01:24:50,203 --> 01:24:52,968
I don't think that the staff should have to park a half a mile away.

761
01:24:54,331 --> 01:25:02,827
But, you know, if a piece of property comes available, a street over by it and turn it into a parking lot.

762
01:25:04,076 --> 01:25:10,380
And then make the whole parking lot into an actual playground that's the appropriate size for that size student population.

763
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,781
And I'm just spitballing.

764
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:20,606
I don't, I don't even know that area very well other than having, you know, been to the school a number of times, but my point is just, I don't.

765
01:25:22,528 --> 01:25:24,770
I don't want to go small on the Roberts playground.

766
01:25:26,431 --> 01:25:28,393
And we can always get fancier.

767
01:25:28,973 --> 01:25:37,521
But the truth is, is there's just as everybody literally here knows there isn't enough room is an understatement, it's just such an understatement and.

768
01:25:38,982 --> 01:25:52,556
You know, my children went to the Misatoch, and I have all these fantasies about how we could make all that area dramatically better, and I'm sure a design study would come up with some great ways to change that area.

769
01:25:53,016 --> 01:25:57,020
But of course, the truth is, as Dr. Robinson said,

770
01:25:57,961 --> 01:25:58,842
There's the field.

771
01:25:58,942 --> 01:26:06,408
I mean, it's really kind of an ideal situation, very similar to the McGlynn situation in that there's a lot more space.

772
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:20,800
So I'm okay with us putting the Roberts first, but I also want us to not put it first and not have the hard conversation about we can't make it work if the footprint is the same.

773
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:24,285
that it's just not one of our options.

774
01:26:24,765 --> 01:26:34,333
And I don't want to spend a million and a half dollars to make a playground where the kids can't even all be out at recess at the same time because there isn't physically the space.

775
01:26:34,813 --> 01:26:35,514
That's absurd.

776
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:49,784
So if it's not, if the Roberts ends up being a dramatically more expensive endeavor because we have to buy another piece of land or whatever, I'm all in.

777
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:53,434
That's just my thoughts on that.

778
01:26:54,535 --> 01:27:08,004
I'll just jump in and say, I do spend a lot of time at the Roberts, given that, well, I only have one kid there now, but there have been residential properties that have now been converted.

779
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:18,132
The available land, whether that was even an option to take for the schools, to purchase for the schools, is a question to me.

780
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:36,230
There aren't a lot of properties it's it's very residential it's houses and we put up the, there's a new, there are new condos and then there's an ambiguous construction going on on Park Street and Hickey Park is the closest park and that ends up being

781
01:27:37,694 --> 01:27:39,575
It shouldn't be a 10 minute walk, but it is.

782
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:45,439
And it's a 15 minute walk with kindergartners and have to do field trip forms to go to the park.

783
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:46,599
They do field day there.

784
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:51,743
It would be nice to get some kind of connection with Hickey, but it is a few blocks away.

785
01:27:52,343 --> 01:27:53,884
So I do think space is at a premium.

786
01:27:56,354 --> 01:28:08,643
What Alicia, since you're here, have there been discussions about this that this group is not privy to or aware of on the city side?

787
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:13,547
Every time I go there, I'm like, what is that building across the street?

788
01:28:13,567 --> 01:28:14,808
I don't know.

789
01:28:15,068 --> 01:28:18,531
I actually don't know what it is, but I wonder about it all the time.

790
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,562
For many reasons, I dream about an after school center and a parking lot.

791
01:28:24,782 --> 01:28:29,203
Mostly, I don't, I have no, I have no sense of what happens in that building or.

792
01:28:29,723 --> 01:28:38,226
Or who owns it, but I just didn't know if there had been any conversations about what a space problem we do have at at that building.

793
01:28:40,426 --> 01:28:43,447
That building is busting at the seams and, like, we cannot go on.

794
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:45,988
Like, we, we have, so that's.

795
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,979
a separate but related problem.

796
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:58,301
But the signs are that there's continued high demand for elementary school students in that space.

797
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:05,663
So I would agree that I think the Roberts does need to be first on the list.

798
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:12,564
But we need a double-decker playground or something.

799
01:29:12,884 --> 01:29:14,225
Something has to give there.

800
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,325
And I'm not exactly sure what it is or where to put that in the conversation.

801
01:29:20,345 --> 01:29:31,500
Yeah, I assume you mean the existing building across the street, which it I've looked it up before and it is this.

802
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:46,987
A construction company component assembly systems, but we don't really we've never really had any contact with them or what they do in that facility.

803
01:29:48,108 --> 01:29:51,312
They're very really fly under the radar.

804
01:29:53,334 --> 01:30:00,538
But it's, I mean, if you look at it from Google, they even got solar on the roof, like it's inactive, it's well maintained, it's not abandoned.

805
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:01,919
Wow.

806
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:14,967
I just looked at their website, and it looks like they were involved in the Apple project, you know, the giant round thing and National Museum of African American History and Culture.

807
01:30:14,987 --> 01:30:15,988
So they're

808
01:30:17,393 --> 01:30:22,277
It seems to me they play into the radio, but yeah, but they do some serious stuff reach out.

809
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:31,143
I did just, I hadn't looked before but I just found a contact for that location off of their website.

810
01:30:31,303 --> 01:30:39,950
It seems to me that it wouldn't be inappropriate for somebody from the school system school committee I don't know to contact them.

811
01:30:41,511 --> 01:30:44,732
and just have a conversation about like, we're here, what do you do?

812
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:46,492
We're really curious across the street.

813
01:30:47,753 --> 01:30:50,533
That said, I don't know that it'll pan out the way you want.

814
01:30:51,854 --> 01:30:59,496
I assume you meant that as opposed to the hole in the ground, which I can tell you has gone through the city's

815
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:05,506
commission's process, they don't have a building permit yet.

816
01:31:06,066 --> 01:31:17,610
No, actually they do they've been through the full building permit process to do a building that would have ground floor commercial probably a coffee shop, and I can't remember if it's seven or nine units of housing above.

817
01:31:19,798 --> 01:31:23,983
that property is actually on the market with all its permits.

818
01:31:24,123 --> 01:31:29,789
So the person who permitted it and owns it is looking to now sell all those permits and everything.

819
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:35,356
But it's very expensive because it's a whole permitted project.

820
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,279
I think the city would be the

821
01:31:39,309 --> 01:31:56,586
I myself have dreamed of like, could we purchase or put, how would we indicate that there are properties the city would be interested in buying in terms of houses and stuff for various locations I think it's something we should look into.

822
01:31:57,707 --> 01:31:58,347
I'm happy to.

823
01:31:59,306 --> 01:32:12,331
Actually, I'm gonna ask the economic development director, like how would we make a list of properties the city would like to acquire and then keep an eye on them because we would like to expand some of our footprints.

824
01:32:12,931 --> 01:32:14,532
And this isn't the only one, but.

825
01:32:15,732 --> 01:32:18,553
Alicia, you said it's for sale.

826
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:27,797
Is there an easy way to, I mean, it's not gonna be on Zillow, I'm sure, but is there an easy way to find out what that actually sale price is?

827
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:32,670
I'll ask Sal, our economic development director.

828
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:39,057
He has access to a commercial listing system, which is where I have confirmed.

829
01:32:39,217 --> 01:32:44,783
We had heard that it was for sale because people were confirming its permit status.

830
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:48,327
And so we looked it up, but I'll ask him for the pricing.

831
01:32:48,347 --> 01:32:49,508
Thank you.

832
01:32:51,877 --> 01:32:52,037
Right.

833
01:32:53,197 --> 01:33:00,079
So the question on the table is, are we prioritizing any of these schools for a CPC application this year?

834
01:33:00,099 --> 01:33:01,379
Right.

835
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,760
Yeah, that is the question.

836
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,722
Since I don't know if it's an age thing or just too much going in, but when we do the application,

837
01:33:16,397 --> 01:33:17,739
How much do we have to say?

838
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:27,894
I guess is my question, because to say we want to do the playground over is one thing, to say we want to do the playground over and

839
01:33:28,832 --> 01:33:58,236
we plan to buy a property and we are going to move to like those aren't even things we can say at this point because we I mean we're just spitballing in this meeting not that many of us haven't already thought about these things a number of times but that's not a plan so how much do we have to tell the cpc to actually do an application we have to ask for a specific amount of money what's the limit well so

840
01:33:59,315 --> 01:34:03,477
I would say the limit is contingent on a couple of things.

841
01:34:03,557 --> 01:34:06,059
What other projects do they have in the pipeline?

842
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,760
What are their projects?

843
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:16,464
We've received a significant amount of funding with that weigh into their decision as to trying to spread the money around.

844
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:22,087
But I think we've shown with the McGlynn Playground that we provide

845
01:34:22,472 --> 01:34:27,513
we've been able to provide significant value to the overall community as well as the Metro public schools.

846
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:35,195
And so if we can replicate that, and I guess I would consider the Roberts and Alicia, you know, better than better than I do.

847
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:48,058
I would consider the Roberts to be a significantly more landlocked area, um, and more dense, um, even though he is down the street, but it is a significantly dense area.

848
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:50,619
So, um, you know,

849
01:34:51,444 --> 01:35:20,267
I mean I think we would need to understand the long term plans of both the school committee and the municipality on what we can do to expand the footprint of that school because there is there's no other way around that footprint for the number of students there is not adequate and the hard conversations that have been you know initiated here tonight need to be had

850
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:24,643
for the greater benefit of those 605 or 600 plus students.

851
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:38,907
And, you know, if we are going to have those conversations, you know, that'll help inform what type of a playground or what type of parking or what is done to make it a better environment for our students.

852
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:46,769
There really is no limit to the funding except annually how much they bring in.

853
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:50,961
They funded us $900,000 in one fiscal year.

854
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:55,965
They funded us $900,000 in another fiscal year for a total of $1.8 million in that ask.

855
01:35:56,065 --> 01:36:02,850
And then they had given us, I remember, Graham, I think it ended up being like an initial $40,000 for the design study.

856
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:05,132
And then we found out that that was pretty inadequate.

857
01:36:06,313 --> 01:36:08,795
And I think it went up to in the neighborhood of $150,000, $160,000.

858
01:36:10,116 --> 01:36:13,698
I'm forgetting those numbers as they've kind of blurred together.

859
01:36:17,562 --> 01:36:42,422
The other hard conversation, which is not the scope of this meeting, but is how are we managing the unevenness in population in schools across the district, whether that's looking at reorganizing the grade levels, whether it's just redistricting, whether it's somebody come up to me and say, we should just open a new school, which I suppose that's on the table too.

860
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,382
So that's another hard conversation that informs what type of playground we need.

861
01:36:49,462 --> 01:36:55,145
Because if we move to a different model, we may have a different student population in that building.

862
01:36:56,206 --> 01:37:07,072
So I think what I'm hearing is what we would recommend is that we prioritize a solution at the Roberts.

863
01:37:10,902 --> 01:37:30,989
We're not ready necessarily to ask the CPC for money because we don't actually know the solution could possibly be at this moment, but that what we do recommend is that there are some continuing conversations about what those possibilities are.

864
01:37:31,009 --> 01:37:37,812
I mean, I don't know, do we like every time I go there, I'm shocked that the staff park each other in.

865
01:37:39,114 --> 01:37:42,696
They don't have a choice, but they park each other and it's super unsafe.

866
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:43,116
Right?

867
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:45,598
Like, it's a necessity.

868
01:37:45,638 --> 01:37:52,762
Like, there's no other there's nothing else to do, but there's not enough parking for the number of staff that have to work in that building.

869
01:37:55,223 --> 01:37:57,144
And there's not enough playground space, like.

870
01:37:59,636 --> 01:38:07,841
Do we need literally a parking deck or something that would double the parking capacity and create some space?

871
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:08,861
I don't know.

872
01:38:08,981 --> 01:38:19,107
But I think that's a question we'd need to talk to some people about in terms of what even the options are and maybe have a conversation with the folks across the street.

873
01:38:22,884 --> 01:38:42,361
before we could proceed with the CPC application, but perhaps the, the recommendation from this group to the committee is that is our short range priority is like figuring something out for that building that leads to our ability to address the playground.

874
01:38:44,663 --> 01:38:45,964
I would agree with that recommendation.

875
01:38:49,326 --> 01:39:04,912
And, you know, I also was remembering it when we were visiting high schools, Watertown, at least Suffolk University, and I can't remember where else, has done something that I would never have thought made any sense until I saw it, but they put the

876
01:39:06,638 --> 01:39:28,274
well, they're not playgrounds, they're fields there, but they put fields above parking so that there's so much parking, they don't even need to assign spots or care, because essentially the entire ground level becomes parking, and then elevated above it is what would become a very large amount of playground space.

877
01:39:29,215 --> 01:39:32,578
The difference, of course, for those places and this is that

878
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:34,813
this is in a neighborhood.

879
01:39:36,594 --> 01:39:43,698
But while it ends up sort of becoming two stories, it's barely higher than a roof on a one story.

880
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:45,279
So I don't know.

881
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:47,880
I mean, this isn't the time for the solutions.

882
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:58,166
But if it's $2 million to buy a lot that would, in many regards, not be enough to fully solve the problem,

883
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:09,337
do we have to consider something much, I mean, no concept of what those elevated fields actually cost.

884
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:13,642
So yeah, I think we should definitely make this a priority though.

885
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:21,089
One of the elementary schools in my hometown did that, but they actually had the whole school underground as well.

886
01:40:22,911 --> 01:40:23,571
It was very cool.

887
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:24,913
They had it elevated.

888
01:40:24,953 --> 01:40:25,533
It was very cool.

889
01:40:27,645 --> 01:40:30,386
That was the 60s and 70s that that happened.

890
01:40:31,446 --> 01:40:34,007
Weird architectural world.

891
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:41,630
OK.

892
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,991
So apparently I lied about how long this meeting was going to take.

893
01:40:46,572 --> 01:40:47,792
So I'm sorry for that.

894
01:40:48,972 --> 01:40:52,214
We ended the last one early, so this was due.

895
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:53,654
This was inevitable.

896
01:40:58,402 --> 01:41:13,265
Shoot.

897
01:41:13,285 --> 01:41:16,866
So this is where we've landed.

898
01:41:16,886 --> 01:41:21,087
So for recommendations in 25,

899
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:46,123
The mini reconditioning assessment, the network closets, the freight elevator, the drainage at the Brooksfield, the key fobs, the dumpster mitigation potentially in 26, and getting this grant addressed for the ADA issue at McGlynn and Andrews.

900
01:41:48,523 --> 01:41:51,584
We're saying district-wide security updates of 1.5,

901
01:41:55,393 --> 01:42:00,197
are not committed at this time, but from a planning perspective, we should be looking at it for FY 26.

902
01:42:02,919 --> 01:42:06,702
The Roberts is our priority playground or recommended priority playground.

903
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:15,449
Parking lot paving also not committed.

904
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:22,815
Then these items are all contingent on the mini-commissioning study and what might come from there.

905
01:42:25,489 --> 01:42:30,712
You might want to, picky details, flip Missituck and Brooks, because it sounds like that's the priority order.

906
01:42:50,425 --> 01:42:52,807
There aren't as many students at the Brooks,

907
01:42:57,401 --> 01:43:00,762
I think that's the conversation for after we've solved all the rest.

908
01:43:05,143 --> 01:43:08,164
Yeah, I was just going off the conversation that happened before, but you're right.

909
01:43:08,184 --> 01:43:09,484
We didn't have that conversation.

910
01:43:10,044 --> 01:43:11,685
Yeah.

911
01:43:11,745 --> 01:43:18,526
Again, I think there's lots of change to this before we get to that place on the list.

912
01:43:18,646 --> 01:43:24,748
So is there anything else that you think we should change?

913
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:35,569
Have we identified all of the, right, this meeting was timed so that we could say this is, I see the potential open space CPC.

914
01:43:35,649 --> 01:43:38,391
I don't see any of that for the current projects.

915
01:43:39,892 --> 01:43:42,053
Actually, some things had been committed up at the top.

916
01:43:42,353 --> 01:43:45,675
Yeah, and then we have an application pending for Curtis Tufts, yep.

917
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:51,578
And we're recommending this one, so.

918
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:53,859
Yes, I see that.

919
01:43:58,666 --> 01:44:12,352
Yeah, I think the question is what we're asking school committee to, I guess, is this the work of the district to say what if this is going into a supplemental budget request?

920
01:44:12,392 --> 01:44:24,277
What is coming out of funds that have already been allocated and what is a new request to city council or from capital stabilization, right?

921
01:44:24,297 --> 01:44:27,238
Some of the mitigation is potentially a stabilization

922
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:30,161
fund.

923
01:44:45,674 --> 01:44:56,944
I'm also trying to do the math on what the grand total here is, but I don't know that a grand total is what's important so much as the total for each of these buckets.

924
01:45:00,314 --> 01:45:03,196
Okay, so I'm just going to put a little legend at the top.

925
01:45:03,396 --> 01:45:04,537
This is what it means.

926
01:45:04,597 --> 01:45:08,239
This is what we're saying if we say recommend proceeding in FY26.

927
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:28,210
If we say recommend CPC funding request, MPS directs the administration to apply for CPC funding.

928
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:38,200
Um, not needed.

929
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:49,608
No, immediate.

930
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:52,930
Action required.

931
01:46:04,926 --> 01:46:06,149
We've got this one.

932
01:46:30,919 --> 01:46:38,525
And then the other element of this process was net school spending, but that's covered under the recommend proceeding in fiscal year 25.

933
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:49,093
Yes, I did talk to Jerry about that and he gave me the dollar thresholds.

934
01:46:51,175 --> 01:46:53,277
And so I've been filling that in as we've been talking.

935
01:47:01,552 --> 01:47:02,563
I'm down somewhere.

936
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:16,112
I don't know, it's $150,000.

937
01:47:16,192 --> 01:47:17,733
I think it's $150,000.

938
01:47:18,393 --> 01:47:21,954
And so if it's under $150,000, it can be included in that school spending.

939
01:47:22,054 --> 01:47:23,535
If it's over, it cannot be.

940
01:47:23,555 --> 01:47:30,538
And what does that mean for something like LED lighting replacement, which ends up being $180,000 across the three schools?

941
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:34,099
Each school, $150,000 per each school.

942
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:34,760
All right.

943
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,521
Or per project, not.

944
01:47:38,609 --> 01:47:39,410
It's per year.

945
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:42,874
It's per project, I believe.

946
01:47:42,894 --> 01:47:44,436
Yeah, I think so.

947
01:47:44,877 --> 01:47:46,519
I think these would be a no.

948
01:47:46,539 --> 01:47:54,629
Oh, because it's one project.

949
01:48:09,463 --> 01:48:10,643
Oh, yep, there's that column.

950
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:22,365
Sorry, I've zoomed in and I'm scrolling back and forth, so apologies for that.

951
01:48:32,947 --> 01:48:38,008
So that's the other one we had that we need to describe and then

952
01:48:52,304 --> 01:48:52,384
Okay.

953
01:49:21,127 --> 01:49:26,413
So that's like a little key for us for like what those project status.

954
01:49:39,428 --> 01:49:40,650
Do we have that we need to.

955
01:49:50,572 --> 01:49:52,753
I think that covers all of our.

956
01:49:52,773 --> 01:50:16,223
I think we're done.

957
01:50:18,228 --> 01:50:20,769
Any other questions, thoughts, things we missed?

958
01:50:24,749 --> 01:50:29,790
Do you want to put it in progress for the bike rack modernization line 28?

959
01:50:32,491 --> 01:50:32,751
Yes.

960
01:50:36,592 --> 01:50:38,472
And we don't have to answer that question, which will come up.

961
01:50:45,033 --> 01:50:45,553
That's great.

962
01:50:46,574 --> 01:50:47,874
First year's the hardest doing this.

963
01:50:51,590 --> 01:51:07,444
So I think we have a couple of costs to include between now and the meeting, but I will probably put together a slide that says, here's what we did, and here's how we did it, and this is the result.

964
01:51:12,569 --> 01:51:13,870
Do we need a deadline?

965
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:18,794
I know a couple people took action items to confirm quotes or points of contact.

966
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:24,859
Is there, do you, in preparing that slide, do you need, is there a deadline you want that information by?

967
01:51:24,939 --> 01:51:30,664
Obviously we want it as soon as we can get it, but reasonable demands on people's time.

968
01:51:31,165 --> 01:51:33,386
Yeah, by December 6th would be great.

969
01:51:36,869 --> 01:51:37,830
Till end of next week.

970
01:51:42,065 --> 01:51:45,787
In my mind, it's two weeks away, but it's not.

971
01:51:46,087 --> 01:51:49,748
Yeah, nobody's working Thursday, Friday.

972
01:51:50,489 --> 01:51:53,550
Yeah.

973
01:51:54,030 --> 01:52:04,795
So I think what we need tonight is just a recommendation to send this to the full committee for their review.

974
01:52:07,293 --> 01:52:19,182
And then the other thing that, uh, we will need to do as a full committee is like, make a recommendation to approve this or approve it as amended, which will happen at the special meeting.

975
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:23,806
Okay.

976
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:34,214
So we have a motion to, um, approve, approve this recommendation to send to the entire school committee by member.

977
01:52:34,274 --> 01:52:35,875
So seconded by member Reinfeld.

978
01:52:36,513 --> 01:52:37,213
So I'll do a roll call.

979
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:37,894
Member Rousseau?

980
01:52:38,554 --> 01:52:38,754
Yes.

981
01:52:39,675 --> 01:52:40,355
Member Reinfeldt?

982
01:52:40,655 --> 01:52:40,835
Yes.

983
01:52:41,335 --> 01:52:41,916
Member Graham?

984
01:52:41,996 --> 01:52:42,276
Yes.

985
01:52:42,856 --> 01:52:45,477
Three in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

986
01:52:45,657 --> 01:52:46,678
Is there a motion to adjourn?

987
01:52:48,058 --> 01:52:48,679
I'll do that one.

988
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,781
Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Rousseau.

989
01:52:52,801 --> 01:52:54,161
Second.

990
01:52:54,281 --> 01:52:55,002
Member Reinfeldt?

991
01:52:55,522 --> 01:52:55,762
Yes.

992
01:52:56,522 --> 01:52:57,083
Member Rousseau?

993
01:52:57,683 --> 01:52:57,943
Yes.

994
01:52:58,563 --> 01:52:59,144
Member Graham?

995
01:52:59,204 --> 01:52:59,504
Yes.

996
01:52:59,584 --> 01:53:01,365
Three in the affirmative, zero on the negative.

997
01:53:01,845 --> 01:53:05,187
Thank you, Director Hunt.

998
01:53:05,347 --> 01:53:05,747
Thank you.

999
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,462
Paul, Rigi, for joining us.

1000
01:53:09,602 --> 01:53:12,965
Paul, I don't know your title, or I would have called you by your proper title.

1001
01:53:12,985 --> 01:53:15,687
But thank you both.

1002
01:53:15,747 --> 01:53:18,328
Paul is fine.

1003
01:53:18,389 --> 01:53:19,569
Thank you both for joining us.

1004
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:21,271
It was super helpful.

1005
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:28,256
And I will follow up with you all if there are action items for you or questions that we have in the meantime.

1006
01:53:28,376 --> 01:53:29,897
But really appreciate your support.

1007
01:53:29,917 --> 01:53:32,079
Thank you.

1008
01:53:32,099 --> 01:53:32,899
The meeting is adjourned.
