    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=0.069s">Then</a>  on Tuesday, May 28th, sorry, May, I'm looking at the wrong one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5.991s">That's</a>  on May 28th, something is not quite right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=8.292s">Hold</a>  on a second.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=33.295s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=34.919s">I</a>  thought I had the right one pulled up because I went through your email to find the right link. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=39.68s">And</a>  then I still had the wrong one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=41.38s">So</a>  OK, here we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=43.961s">Please</a>  be advised that on Tuesday, November 26, at 5 PM, there'll be a strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=52.402s">This</a>  meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=54.163s">The</a>  meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, which is Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=62.97s">9,</a>  8 or 22 and Verizon channel 43, 45 or 47. since the meeting will be held remotely participants can log in or call by using the following link or call number. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=74.202s">The</a>  meeting ID is 917-9449-2754. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=81.943s">Questions</a>  or concerns can be submitted during the meeting by emailing jennygram at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=88.505s">Those</a>  submitting must include the following, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=99.827s">This</a>  is a continuation of a meeting, so I'm still going to take the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=104.428s">Is</a>  that right, generally speaking? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=107.95s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=109.991s">So</a>  member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=112.493s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=113.553s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=114.874s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=115.855s">And</a>  member Graham, I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=117.376s">So</a>  three present, zero absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=121.498s">So</a>  as I mentioned, this is a continuation of our first subcommittee meeting that we held back on 10-15. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=131.645s">And</a>  the goal of these two meetings is to sort of put together and formalize <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=138.364s">a</a>  view of our capital plan for the schools and think about what kind of recommendations we want to make to the broader school committee, which will happen at a meeting in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=151.034s">I</a>  think it's the 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=153.957s">And</a>  I see that we have a couple of guests joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=156.118s">So</a>  we have Alicia Hunt from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and we have Paul Riggi from the City's Facility Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=163.964s">So</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=164.805s">Thank</a>  you for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=166.813s">Um,</a>  I'm actually hopeful this meeting will not take an hour and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=170.335s">Um,</a>  but we, this is the first time we've done this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=173.816s">So</a>  we tried to make sure that we had enough space in the schedule to do all the things that we needed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=180.879s">Um,</a>  so I'm going to bring up, um, the capital plan that we worked through last time and just provide a little bit of context for those of you who are, um, newer to, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=194.308s">the</a>  conversation just as soon as I can find the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=196.509s">Here</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=199.93s">And</a>  this capital plan, the way that we created this is we started with last year's capital plan, which was created in a meeting as like a starting point back in like May or June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=219.255s">And</a>  then from there, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=223.106s">Peter</a>  did solicit input from the building principals to say what other capital needs exist in the district that we may or may not have on our radar in terms of things that we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=239.702s">That's</a>  how this list has come to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=243.245s">One</a>  of the things we talked a lot about in the last meeting was, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=248.433s">sort</a>  of this intersection of a whole bunch of work happening at McGlynn and Andrews that this committee is aware of and apprised of. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=259.16s">And</a>  sort of how does that play into the overall capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=264.864s">And</a>  I actually met yesterday with Director Hunt and Dr. Cushing and the OPM for the project to try to get some clarity around <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=277.048s">Some</a>  of the work that's going on and just sort of having some discussion and we, we sort of did this when we met last time there was some question about like what's included in that project and what is excluded from that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=291.802s">I</a>  think some of that has come into focus a little bit more, or at least we have sort of a directional focus that can help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=299.623s">And</a>  the other thing that we talked about with the OPM was sort of the timeline to prepare to keep the project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=309.046s">And</a>  we asked the OPM also to be available to join us at our committee of the whole meeting, which actually will become a special school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=323.41s">Just</a>  to give us an update on the project itself, but I can I'm happy to relay sort of what we talked about yesterday in terms of, like, you know, sort of things that are lumped into this and things that are excluded from this so that we can revise this capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=339.359s">Because</a>  that's, like, the biggest block of things that are in process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=342.74s">So</a>  in scope is the. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=347.623s">the</a>  piece that we think about as HVAC right for both schools McGlynn and Andrews so that's in scope there's not been a question about that but a couple of other things that we talked about and confirmed yesterday as directionally sort of where we're going <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=373.55s">To</a>  include includes both the roof rebuild in some fashion at the McGlynn and the network splits and the many splits that are in the network closets in those two buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=394.24s">So</a>  that's what these two rows are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=396.342s">And</a>  I'm just going to move them up here because this is up here is stuff that we're saying is in progress and funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=403.863s">And</a>  all of these things sort of are bundled into the... <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=413.424s">project</a>  at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=415.385s">And</a>  what that is going to allow is for the OPM to actually, because we have sort of like a chicken and egg situation going on, where we say, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=425.39s">Well,</a>  it depends on how much it costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=426.591s">Well,</a>  it depends on what's included. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=428.331s">Well,</a>  it depends on how much it costs, which is sort of very typical at this point in these kinds of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=435.595s">But</a>  what we talked about yesterday was that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=440.345s">We</a>  are proceeding as though a bond will need to be issued by the city for this project and that it will include these components and solar for the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=455.057s">And</a>  that will enable the OPM to actually go put that package together with pricing so that then we can look at that comprehensively and say, okay, yes, that is the go forward plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=471.164s">And</a>  yes, that is the funding mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=475.518s">In</a>  order to, the other thing we talked a little bit about as a group was in order to keep this project on track so that it can be completed before the next school year, there is a tiny window that we've got to get exactly right between now and February. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=495.103s">So</a>  if you all recall, at the last school committee meeting, we took a vote to authorize the mayor to enter into a CM at risk contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=504.926s">And</a>  Paul and Alicia, feel free to jump in if I get this wrong, but what that allows us to do is bring the construction manager into the project sooner than we might otherwise do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=516.812s">And</a>  that allows them to do things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=521.014s">Get</a>  the equipment purchased that we are going to need that has long wait times while we wait for like the final design to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=528.718s">So</a>  the timeline that we talked about yesterday was that really in order to keep on track, we need to be in a position to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=539.242s">the</a>  CM contract startup costs and the equipment costs in the month of January, which does mean that all of this question about funding and bonding has to make its way through the process between now and then, which does include an appearance at the council meeting, then an advertisement, and then a second appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=559.48s">Is</a>  that right, Alicia? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=564.224s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=565.105s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=566.326s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=568.862s">And</a>  there's many more steps than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=573.406s">That's</a>  like a grossly simplified version of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=576.549s">But</a>  what we did ask the OPM to do was to be prepared to come to our special meeting on the 11th to give us an update on the project, and particularly that timeline of what needs to happen, what do they need from us, do they need from the city side, et cetera, to make sure that the project stays on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=597.956s">And</a>  that's the McGlynn project in a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=613.086s">Any</a>  questions about that one, Erica?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=615.207s">Yep,</a>  just to refresh, the funding source for that, some of it is allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=621.829s">Where's</a>  that coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=623.589s">How</a>  much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=628.071s">I</a>  know we didn't have the final number until recently.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=632.731s">Yeah,</a>  the OPM is under contract and being paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=636.812s">And</a>  I believe that is coming out of ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=640.893s">Is</a>  that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=642.253s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=643.734s">And</a>  then all of the rest of the costs, we have to bond in order to have the money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=649.255s">So</a>  that's why the bonding process is so important timeline-wise, because if we can't get those things in place in January, it's going to push the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=661.038s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=662.165s">back</a>  and then we're going to be, you know, back at, you know, in impeding on the start of school.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.286s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.626s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.826s">Cause</a>  I know we had designated some things for HVAC, but it's all bonded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=671.487s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=680.448s">Um,</a>  also includes roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=688.63s">So</a>  we'll go back to the end network. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=698.01s">Okay,</a>  so in terms of in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=703.475s">Progress</a>  process. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=709.16s">Activities</a>  those are that's sort of 1 big block. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=713.044s">Of</a>  activity does that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=716.281s">and</a>  we would consider all of those together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=717.902s">So</a>  I'm putting that above the funding line, although obviously there's still a lot of work to do to secure all the right approvals, et cetera, for the bond, but that's sort of where we're at with that.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=729.426s">Does</a>  that make sense so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=731.326s">Yes,</a>  I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=736.588s">We</a>  don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=742.523s">Yeah,</a>  and the school committee, actually, we won't vote on the funding piece of it because it is bonded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=751.81s">So</a>  the city is the only authority that can take out the bond.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.633s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.914s">I</a>  just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=761.458s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Campbell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=762.999s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=764.46s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=766.522s">So</a>  the other, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=770.305s">The</a>  other thing that we did talk about that I think is really important, um, is we talked with the OPM about these, um, recommissioning assessments and that that's like another place where, um, broadly speaking, the OPM is on board to do those things, but funding has been such that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=796.596s">There's</a>  not clarity about when we wanted to do that because we didn't tell them and we didn't tell them because we didn't have money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=803.639s">So</a>  that's 1 thing that I think we can sort of start to clear up what. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=809.921s">We</a>  talked about yesterday in addition is that is opening up an accelerated repair window, like, usually between usually, like, between January and. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=821.485s">Maybe</a>  April, March, April, and that accelerated repairs for things like roofs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=827.63s">Boilers</a>  HVAC, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=832.453s">MSP</a>  has adopted a new process where they'll open up a window this coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=838.057s">January</a>  to June or January to April, and then they will do it every other year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=843.862s">And</a>  so if you hop into the window this year in January, you would learn if you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=850.461s">were</a>  able to <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=854.229s">be</a>  funded sometime like around now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=857.53s">So</a>  it is a long process to get the notification to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=864.233s">But</a>  if we are interested in doing that, we have to either get in this year or it's two more years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=875.738s">So</a>  it would be January 2027 before we would have another <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=883.781s">Go</a>  at it, I did talk to last week and they did confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=890.068s">Yes,</a>  districts who are in the core program can apply for accelerated repair projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=898.277s">Um,</a>  so I think, um, what probably makes sense is for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=903.66s">Um,</a>  re, commissioning assessment line to sort of split into. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=909.223s">To</a>  maybe 2 lines 1 is a mini assessment that would enable us to. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=915.567s">if</a>  we need to take advantage of that accelerated repair program so that assessment could get us ready to submit for brooks roberts and missittuck if we find that the needs there are pressing and urgent when we talk about roofs and hvac um so what we may want to consider recommending to the committee is that we pursue a mini assessment that <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=944.341s">looks</a>  at those pieces that are eligible for accelerated repair in an effort to put forward an application in that program this year if we qualify but we don't know yet so the thought the thought that we batted around yesterday was let's try to <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=967.611s">do</a>  some sort of mini assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=970.072s">The</a>  OPM is going to figure out what the cost of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=973.532s">And</a>  based on that mini assessment, it will inform our ability to go into this accelerated repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=979.213s">And</a>  then once we have clarity on that, then we can circle back around to the sort of like regular routine recommissioning projects into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=991.676s">But</a>  that would get us sort of on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=995.977s">Does</a>  that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1001.889s">Any</a>  questions about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1021.058s">He</a>  was going to give us the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1022.578s">So</a>  once I get that, I will fill that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1029.966s">But</a>  I think, um, one thing we may want to do is identify this as like a thing that we are recommending that we take up urgently. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1038.814s">Um,</a>  so in the project status, there may be some things where we say, we're recommending that we do this in FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1048.462s">Um,</a>  and then we can have that discussion with the committee and make sure that they agree with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1054.287s">I</a>  don't know what you all think about that.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1064.5s">Sounds</a>  good to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1065.502s">Yeah,</a>  I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1088.53s">And</a>  are those, do you know, are those typically funded at the full cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1092.693s">Is</a>  it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1097.937s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's usually a portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1099.618s">I</a>  don't, I don't think it's full funding, but it is a piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1102.84s">Okay,</a>  and then the other idea that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1113.513s">I</a>  had is that we at some point talk about, um, with the OPM, this idea of a district wide electrification enablement assessment and where that might fit and whether that is in the scope of their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1130.181s">Um,</a>  and we did not do that yesterday because we had sort of a full plate, but, um, I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1137.998s">think</a>  we necessarily need to recommend that we proceed with that in FY 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1144.786s">But</a>  that could be something that we circle back to with the OPM, who obviously is getting to know our buildings intimately and would be in probably a decent position to be able to do that.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1159.582s">This</a>  was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with similar efforts parallel efforts in other city buildings.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1172.752s">That's</a>  a great question.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1177.079s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1178.601s">So,</a>  yes, there will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1182.805s">We</a>  are applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1185.348s">We're</a>  basically doing the certification to be a particular kind of green communities, a green communities leadership program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1193.256s">And</a>  through that program, there's going to be technical assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1196.94s">to</a>  help with some of this evaluation of buildings and we always include our school buildings in that so that that would be in what we say we own for something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1210.486s">Brenda</a>  Pike in my office is working through that process and is keeping an eye out for those timelines and she I could get I wasn't anticipating that question this evening but I could easily get her to give you guys some information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1226.269s">so</a>  that we could look at the technical assistance because there's a lot of incentives from the state to move forward with electrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1235.754s">So</a>  the whole make a plan, figure it out and then help with the actual doing is stuff they're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1242.718s">And</a>  so we're putting ourselves into that program.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1246.1s">Yeah,</a>  I would love to that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1248.221s">That's</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1249.242s">And</a>  do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1256.031s">Uh,</a>  yeah, I'll shoot her a note asking her if she could put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1260.552s">Um,</a>  I, I suspected if she was sitting here right now, she could have just given it to you off the top of her head. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1266.754s">Um,</a>  but I can't that's why I have good staff.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1270.315s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1272.976s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1273.356s">Okay,</a>  so I think the other question, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1283.239s">Is</a>  around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1288.888s">Let</a>  me just move this down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1299.711s">Any</a>  of these other projects that we are suggesting that we are recommending proceeding with in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1310.013s">Last</a>  time we met, we talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1317.489s">the</a>  five-pump control in the McGlynn, the failed flashing behind the brick facade, and the freight motor elevator as being like, and the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation being urgent types of projects that we should consider recommending that the school committee look for funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1346.994s">Um,</a>  I don't know if you all have any thoughts about that in terms of, like, which ones we should be recommending.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1351.757s">I,</a>  I certainly, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1356.42s">I</a>  don't know how many years we've been talking about bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1361.423s">I'm</a>  kind of tired of talking about bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1364.644s">Um,</a>  and, um, well, it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1370.328s">Not</a>  a lot compared to a lot of the other things it still surprises me how much bike racks will cost us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1375.511s">Um.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1391.235s">Did</a>  we lose you?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1394.853s">No,</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1396.694s">And</a>  I have a baby in the background, so I do apologize for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1400.257s">Well,</a>  not apologize for the baby, but she's a little distraught. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1402.939s">The</a>  bike racks are in the process of being ordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1404.961s">We</a>  received $20,000 from Community Preservation to install modern up-to-date bike racks and bike repair stations for the McGlynn, Andrews, and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1420.392s">So</a>  those are in the process of being ordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1423.534s">Surprisingly,</a>  there are delays in that supply chain. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1431.239s">I</a>  also, I apologize, can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1434.153s">yes</a>  but so there's two pieces there's one that is above the line and it says it's grant funded by the cpc um and there's one that's below the line that's for brooks mistletoe and roberts and i think that's the one paul is referring to if you're uh yep i mean we could definitely do that or wait until the next round of cpc funding in the summertime uh to uh request of that and demonstrate the project that's completed <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1462.806s">or</a>  just take it out of the local capital budget?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1472.195s">If</a>  the CPC has been amenable to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1476.345s">project</a>  and we think that that's a good thing to at least try to leverage the CPC funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1486.232s">Maybe</a>  that's what we recommend to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1490.035s">Questions,</a>  thoughts, Erica, Paul?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1493.838s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1494.258s">Okay,</a>  cool.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1497.821s">I</a>  also, member Graham, I also it appears I updated the wrong capital planning spreadsheet with numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1506.368s">for</a>  McGlynn and Andrews parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1511.49s">That's</a>  in the neighborhood of $1.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1513.571s">To</a>  do granite curbs is $125 per linear foot, comes out to about $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1516.832s">The</a>  pavement is about $400,000 to do the bus loops and the <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1530.33s">the</a>  bus loops and the parking lots at those two schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1534.595s">And</a>  then in speaking to the city engineer, Owen Wartella, he suggested because of the price fluctuations in asphalt to do a 30% contingency, which is $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1545.468s">So</a>  that would be $1.3 million on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1550.347s">The,</a>  the re the Plaza, the ADA compliance of that I believe I forwarded it, this email on on on October 22, but that is a ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1564.281s">And</a>  unfortunately it's it's one of those things, another chicken and an egg. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1568.184s">You</a>  don't know it until you're necessarily into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1571.647s">in</a>  the neighborhood of $300,000 to $600,000 to fix that plaza, the entry plazas for the McGlynn and the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1582.01s">The</a>  drainage at the Brooks to do the curbing is about $7,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1585.831s">There</a>  are two French drains that, number one, seem a bit undersized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1598.019s">And</a>  number two, and once again, I apologize, definitely need to be cleaned out, but they seem undersized for the water that they might be required to handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1607.583s">So</a>  that would probably be in the neighborhood of an additional $15,000 for 22,500 in that ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1617.227s">And</a>  I will go on mute and I'm here if you need me.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1620.788s">Can</a>  I just ask you a question about that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1623.689s">Is</a>  that assuming DPW has the capacity to do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1628.152s">Or</a>  that somebody else is doing it.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1631.774s">That</a>  would be somebody else doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1634.155s">I</a>  don't think if we want to like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1637.456s">I</a>  think has a lot on their plate and if we want to get the project done, we may have to get the project done.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1647.761s">And</a>  so the front Plaza, we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1651.889s">Somewhere</a>  between 300,000 and 550,000 between design and construction, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1655.531s">Yes,</a>  I think the higher number came in at 600. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1657.092s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1675.891s">And</a>  that was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1681.074s">Did</a>  we get an answer on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1683.875s">It's</a>  not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1689.478s">There</a>  is no real connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1691.398s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1700.256s">Director</a>  Hunt, while we have you here, the issue is both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, the front plaza is settling and causing an ADA issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1711.495s">Are</a>  there <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1717.29s">Other</a>  funding sources besides just city cash that we should be considering here from a grant perspective or particularly because of the ADA aspects of that.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1731.021s">I</a>  haven't seen any. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1739.284s">good</a>  funding sources for ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1743.145s">There</a>  tends to be an attitude of, it's your responsibility, and so you should fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1750.827s">When</a>  we've seen things, they've been so small that, you know, a couple of thousand dollars here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1755.148s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1756.589s">The</a>  paperwork usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1758.009s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1761.33s">And</a>  former member McLaughlin had mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1766.374s">a</a>  grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1771.278s">And</a>  then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1776.022s">I</a>  don't know if that's something that we can revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1778.284s">I</a>  think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1783.889s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, are you there?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1791.969s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1792.269s">Could</a>  you quickly restate the question?</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1794.19s">I</a>  was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1798.911s">I</a>  know we couldn't get the application in one year, and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1805.434s">I'm</a>  wondering if that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1809.795s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1810.715s">So</a>  Director Nwaloje worked on that this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1813.456s">She</a>  encountered the same frustrations and issues with that online submission. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1822.403s">Um,</a>  uh, like, uh, frustration to the point of not being able, uh, in similar to what we went through, um, of, um, it, it, it is the most archaic submission system I've ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1837.669s">And,</a>  uh, it has caused, uh, you know, we're going to have to work at it this year, but to figure it out, but that was taken on the city side this year.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1849.875s">So</a>  it was taken on the city side, but ultimately not successful.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1854.436s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1855.196s">In</a>  submission.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1856.597s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1857.717s">And</a>  so when you say we're gonna have to do it again this year, who do you mean is going to do it?</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1862.778s">Oh,</a>  we're gonna have to figure out, we're gonna reach out to the state partners on it to try to figure out how the best way to actually submit this is because we have proven in two years unsuccessful.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1875.881s">And</a>  who's we?</p>
