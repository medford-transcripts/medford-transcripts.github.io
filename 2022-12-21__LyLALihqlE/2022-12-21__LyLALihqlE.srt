26
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,350
[SPEAKER_28]: Just, okay, good...

27
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:12,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I think...

28
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:13,655
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, thank you.

29
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:22,663
[SPEAKER_28]: Being so resolved that the Medford City Council invite the Medford High School head football coach and the players to the next city council meeting in recognition of their outstanding community outreach.

30
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,684
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

31
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,767
[SPEAKER_28]: You wanna come up?

32
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:26,947
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

33
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,066
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam President.

34
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:57,507
[SPEAKER_27]: It's my privilege tonight.

35
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:13,094
[SPEAKER_27]: I know we've had a tough week here in Medford, and this is fitting and needed to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.

36
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:21,558
[SPEAKER_27]: And before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and Coach Offit come on up.

37
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,354
[SPEAKER_27]: I just called them up just because next to coach curly, I looked like a supermodel.

38
00:08:41,394 --> 00:09:02,790
[SPEAKER_27]: So, um, I wanted, I wanted to make sure he was next to me, but you guys, uh, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge, um, what the method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff, something that's always, always overlooked.

39
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:06,595
[SPEAKER_27]: is the impact that young people play in our community.

40
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,317
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's easy when it's something bad, right?

41
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:13,220
[SPEAKER_27]: When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.

42
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:24,688
[SPEAKER_27]: But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.

43
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:26,990
[SPEAKER_27]: I was noticing an amazing trend.

44
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:33,697
[SPEAKER_27]: that our football team is a special, special group of people.

45
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,758
[SPEAKER_27]: I coached at Medford High School for many years.

46
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:42,480
[SPEAKER_27]: I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.

47
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,522
[SPEAKER_27]: And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.

48
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,243
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.

49
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:58,405
[SPEAKER_27]: And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,

50
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:00,110
[SPEAKER_27]: We had some difficulties.

51
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,191
[SPEAKER_27]: Numbers were low.

52
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Kids were getting in trouble.

53
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:05,134
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we weren't winning games.

54
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,736
[SPEAKER_27]: Everybody thought that the world was ending.

55
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:10,218
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you saw the bigger picture.

56
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,979
[SPEAKER_27]: Coach Curly came in.

57
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,501
[SPEAKER_27]: You saw him active in the community.

58
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,085
[SPEAKER_27]: You saw him doing special things with his, his team.

59
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:23,268
[SPEAKER_27]: And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.

60
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And now the numbers have grown and

61
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,665
[SPEAKER_27]: positive things are in front of us.

62
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:33,747
[SPEAKER_27]: It's all right.

63
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,268
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my favorite song, by the way.

64
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,049
[SPEAKER_27]: It's okay.

65
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,951
[SPEAKER_27]: So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.

66
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:44,373
[SPEAKER_27]: What is a Mustang?

67
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,495
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a word.

68
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,317
[SPEAKER_27]: I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.

69
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:57,021
[SPEAKER_27]: What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent

70
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,862
[SPEAKER_27]: your community with pride and distinction.

71
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:03,983
[SPEAKER_27]: And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.

72
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,665
[SPEAKER_27]: One thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.

73
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,586
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.

74
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:22,587
[SPEAKER_27]: A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.

75
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:34,174
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.

76
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:39,398
[SPEAKER_27]: What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.

77
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:46,263
[SPEAKER_27]: You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.

78
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,827
[SPEAKER_27]: Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.

79
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,503
[SPEAKER_27]: A few things that this football team has done.

80
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:04,104
[SPEAKER_27]: You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.

81
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:08,645
[SPEAKER_27]: Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.

82
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:09,866
[SPEAKER_27]: You led that.

83
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:16,087
[SPEAKER_27]: In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.

84
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:20,388
[SPEAKER_27]: In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.

85
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,469
[SPEAKER_27]: The day before Thanksgiving,

86
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:30,315
[SPEAKER_27]: Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.

87
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:38,520
[SPEAKER_27]: Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.

88
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,924
[SPEAKER_27]: And now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.

89
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:46,826
[SPEAKER_27]: That's amazing.

90
00:12:49,144 --> 00:13:02,511
[SPEAKER_27]: And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.

91
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,415
[SPEAKER_27]: One thing is having the leader to show you the way.

92
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,978
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's an honor that I talk about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.

93
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:18,000
[SPEAKER_27]: What I love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher

94
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:20,692
[SPEAKER_27]: And they said, George, I saw this resolution.

95
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:21,873
[SPEAKER_27]: I need to share something with you.

96
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,933
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a problem with the football player.

97
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:25,833
[SPEAKER_27]: He was being a little wise.

98
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,334
[SPEAKER_27]: And I called Coach Curley.

99
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:35,675
[SPEAKER_27]: And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.

100
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:41,616
[SPEAKER_27]: And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.

101
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,337
[SPEAKER_27]: He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?

102
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:48,057
[SPEAKER_27]: To show him he cares.

103
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,631
[SPEAKER_27]: to make sure that he's doing the right thing.

104
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:54,513
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.

105
00:13:55,093 --> 00:14:03,555
[SPEAKER_27]: And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours, it's something we should as a city applaud.

106
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,496
[SPEAKER_27]: So I wanna publicly thank you guys.

107
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:12,758
[SPEAKER_27]: I know we put together a, do we have that at?

108
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:38,431
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together.

109
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:40,332
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the Muffet Mustang City Council.

110
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:46,815
[SPEAKER_27]: The Muffet City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name, a young lady's name in

111
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,363
[SPEAKER_27]: with the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service.

112
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,465
[SPEAKER_27]: Congratulations on your accomplishments.

113
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:56,266
[SPEAKER_27]: Go Mustangs.

114
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,049
[SPEAKER_27]: If we can, we'd love just to recognize you.

115
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,310
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to call your name up.

116
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,092
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offit are going to help out.

117
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:12,481
[SPEAKER_27]: If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to, I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.

118
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:15,304
[SPEAKER_27]: So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.

119
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:21,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say thank you for allowing us to show what community really is all about.

120
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:26,454
[SPEAKER_10]: These kids are not told to do this stuff.

121
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:27,615
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually want to do it.

122
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:28,235
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

123
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:35,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the leaf cleanup we did, I would go to one house and all of a sudden I would see six kids cleaning.

124
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'd go another house and all of a sudden I'd see like four kids cleaning.

125
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,123
[SPEAKER_10]: There's 10 kids at the house, but the other six are on the other side of the house just grouping each other together.

126
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,210
[SPEAKER_10]: The beautiful thing about our football team and our program is that we have parents involved.

127
00:15:49,450 --> 00:16:01,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you have parents right there here tonight, um, that are really, really involved by like cooking meals, helping us before games, after games, taking care of stuff that we don't know about other kids that we don't know about.

128
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:06,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a real big, uh, family aspect and that's, um, I'm very honored.

129
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,544
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, this is very, um, it's a really good moment for the community, not just the football team, but the community itself.

130
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:12,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um,

131
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:14,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do appreciate this a lot.

132
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:15,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

133
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,930
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to figure one person.

134
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,651
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.

135
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:33,793
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.

136
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,655
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, and we really appreciate it.

137
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:37,895
[SPEAKER_27]: You look fabulous by the way.

138
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:38,856
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

139
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:39,896
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, coach.

140
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:40,236
[SPEAKER_27]: You ready?

141
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:41,277
[SPEAKER_27]: All right.

142
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:43,821
[SPEAKER_36]: Zaheem Ali.

143
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:47,724
[SPEAKER_36]: Sam Alvarez.

144
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:50,645
[SPEAKER_36]: Louise Barbosa.

145
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,887
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, come on up if you're called.

146

[SPEAKER_17]: I think I took no exceptions is how I phrased it.

307
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,821
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other questions for the council?

308
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:38,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, and is this monitoring water quality or water table?

309
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Water quality, I believe.

310
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,188
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

311
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,409
[SPEAKER_12]: It would actually be both.

312
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,090
[SPEAKER_28]: It's both, okay.

313
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Water levels and water quality.

314
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:48,831
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:50,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

316
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Any others from the council at this time?

317
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,655
[SPEAKER_28]: As this is a public hearing, I do need to open the public hearing.

00:36:49,176 --> 00:36:52,297
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, I see everything in order, Madam President.

376
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:56,458
[SPEAKER_27]: I would move approval after questions from my fellow councilors, if they have any.

377
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:57,778
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

[SPEAKER_28]: And I also want to wish you good luck.

[SPEAKER_28]: I just know at my work, I work at university and they say, if you want the students to come anywhere, offer them boba tea.

388
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:28,221
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope you have great success.

00:37:28,502 --> 00:37:32,363
[SPEAKER_28]: So motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_28]: So going to 22-603.

402
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,091
[SPEAKER_28]: 22-603 offered by Vice President Bears.

403
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:18,875
[SPEAKER_28]: Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that the Prevention Outreach Manager present an update on the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Project and grant.

404
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:24,897
[SPEAKER_28]: Yep.

405
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:26,678
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you make Penny a co-host?

406
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everybody for having me here tonight.

407
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:42,803
[SPEAKER_28]: We have your name and...

408
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:44,885
[SPEAKER_28]: We know your name and address, but if you could just introduce yourself too.

409
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Penelope Fanioli, Prevention Outreach Manager for the City of Bedford.

410
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:54,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Kingsborough, Mass.

411
00:38:55,293 --> 00:39:05,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me here tonight.

412
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here to speak specifically about a program that we have, it's a grant that we've applied for.

413
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:21,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna first just get everybody grounded in what is the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

414
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:23,350
[SPEAKER_02]: The Office of Prevention and Outreach was established in 2015.

415
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:29,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the city council for moving that forward to address the opioid crisis.

416
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:32,573
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, they funded my position.

417
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:38,435
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2017, the city council and the mayor has funded a city recovery coach.

418
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:39,831
[SPEAKER_02]: position as well.

419
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:44,552
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2018, we established our Medford hub meeting.

420
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:54,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crisis specific group meeting with multiple service providers to help people at the highest risk get out of risk.

421
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to just point that out, but these are some of the things that we've had going on.

422
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:05,356
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2020, though, we were reassigned to work on the COVID-19 response.

423
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that,

424
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:09,296
[SPEAKER_02]: learned a lot of different things about our community.

425
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:19,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to say that prior to that, in the fall of 2019, we did apply for our first municipal vulnerability preparedness grant.

426
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:24,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to go in detail about all the work around this particular grant.

427
00:40:24,912 --> 00:40:32,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to point out that as I go through my presentation, there's a lot of things that we are doing that are feeding in to this project.

428
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:34,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to kind of highlight them a little bit here.

429
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:37,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So we developed and operated the RUOK program.

430
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: We use that program as a part of fact-finding for our 2020 Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant.

431
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to move to a social service navigation model.

432
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:55,042
[SPEAKER_02]: because we were really just coming up with a lot of people who needed support.

433
00:40:55,462 --> 00:41:00,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So our recovery coach at the time was also a master's in social work.

434
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: She took on the responsibility of doing a lot of that work throughout the pandemic and since has, we've built that position into the department.

435
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:15,302
[SPEAKER_02]: We also started the multilingual resource line and that has been a huge source of support for how we are,

436
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,984
[SPEAKER_02]: able to communicate with the community.

437
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:36,649
[SPEAKER_02]: We had it for both the largest flows that we were having come into the office, but also really to be a place where folks with language that is not English as their first language can come to this line and can leave a message to us, for us, with us in their own language.

438
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:42,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really a critical step in supporting our community members to trust that we're here to support them

439
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: is figuring out a way to let them be the lead of what they need and us to follow suit.

440
00:41:48,810 --> 00:42:01,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have, anyone can leave a message in any language, number one, but we have specifically Arabic, Spanish, Haitian, Creole, and then Portuguese, Brazilian, Portuguese specifically.

441
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,822
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we started Medford Connects.

442
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:14,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Connects was started in May 2020 in response to the fact that many of us were kind of stuck in our own spaces and not communicating with other departments or other agencies.

443
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:19,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started to come together and really start to think about what about youth mental health?

444
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:20,947
[SPEAKER_02]: What about health equity?

445
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:22,268
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we communicating?

446
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:23,809
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you hearing in the community?

447
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Medford Connects group really transformed.

448
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:31,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We met weekly throughout the pandemic to really support each other.

449
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And we learned a lot throughout that process.

450
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:38,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started to infuse the MVP project into it.

451
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:40,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So just laying down the foundation.

452
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:44,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I wanna make sure that I've said out loud is that we were funded through ARPA

453
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:57,562
[SPEAKER_02]: for a health equity coordinator who manages five community liaisons, one representing the English speaking BIPOC community, Arabic speaking community, Spanish speaking community, the Haitian community, and the Brazilian community.

454
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have, those are all here working every week, and they're helping us to translate materials.

455
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:12,007
[SPEAKER_02]: They're helping us to communicate with our committee members, manage this multilingual resource line, and they will begin in 2023

456
00:43:13,752 --> 00:43:33,024
[SPEAKER_02]: doing active outreach to support community members on things such as mass health applications and other applications in order to get support if they need it, in addition to just continuing to build community within these communities that haven't traditionally shown up at city hall to have their voices heard.

457
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:36,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and again, we have a social worker as well, which is Alicia Levin.

458
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,924
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2017, we started to really think about like, okay, so we've done a lot of this opioid crisis response.

459
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to set up systems.

460
00:43:46,565 --> 00:43:55,490
[SPEAKER_02]: We are operating those systems still today, but we also started to think a little bit bigger and broader about what we're doing in our work around prevention and outreach.

461
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And the social determinants of health is a really critical thing that we need to be working towards to address.

462
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:04,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see these health outcomes.

463
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,834
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that we know that we need to address.

464
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,515
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna prevent, right?

465
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:11,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are the behaviors that lead to these health outcomes?

466
00:44:11,337 --> 00:44:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also working on that, but what are we doing at this more deeper level around the social determinants of health, built environment, education, violence and trauma, employment, housing, social environment.

467
00:44:24,104 --> 00:44:31,208
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some key places where we should start doing our efforts, but even more importantly, let's take a step back and let's dig a little bit deeper down to the roots

468
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:39,080
[SPEAKER_02]: these health outcomes, and those are classism, poverty, racism, right, xenophobia, ageism, so on and so forth.

469
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at this in a comprehensive way, everything that we're doing.

470
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:56,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2020, when Alicia Hunt, our, at that time, Director of Sustainability, said, I think that this project would really fit well with the health department.

471
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, let's think about this.

472
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,945
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we understand it?

473
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really it was an assessment.

474
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,722
[SPEAKER_02]: find out and brainstorm what are the community's needs?

475
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:08,824
[SPEAKER_02]: What are their resiliency needs?

476
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is community?

477
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:16,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, what is climate vulnerability and climate resilience?

478
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: These are lingo terms from the environmental sustainability industry.

479
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,633
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make a lot of sense to me sometimes.

480
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:27,135
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably don't make a lot of sense to the general public.

481
00:45:27,615 --> 00:45:29,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's break it down, right?

482
00:45:29,932 --> 00:45:34,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am gonna read this because this is not my real house, so I'm gonna do that for myself.

483
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So climate vulnerability and resilience are measured by indicators related to exposure, sensitivity, climate hazards, coupled with the ability to get out of harm's way, to adjust to changes and rebuild after a climate event.

484
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:52,937
[SPEAKER_02]: We just actually experienced a major emergency event, right?

485
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:56,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And where were we when we started the pandemic?

486
00:45:56,537 --> 00:45:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And then where did we end up after?

487
00:45:58,378 --> 00:45:59,478
[SPEAKER_02]: How did we recover?

488
00:45:59,538 --> 00:46:04,220
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are very, they kind of apply that you can lay an overlay on it.

489
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:19,766
[SPEAKER_02]: But the folks that are in this harms way and how fast they can adjust to changes really is indicated by rather than seeing these communities as climate vulnerable,

490
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:27,761
[SPEAKER_02]: we see communities that have been marginalized to the point of vulnerability, which is why we focus on adaptive capacity, right?

491
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:35,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks that don't feel they can trust the government, they don't feel they can trust, you know, what we're saying.

492
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:38,806
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to figure out how to repair this and to work hard at it.

493
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:40,267
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're trying to do.

494
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:48,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can see though, in these sensitivity, exposure, adaptive capacity, all of these things really are within the wheelhouse.

495
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,767
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really what I just explained that we've been working towards.

496
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:56,932
[SPEAKER_02]: We did learn our adaptive capacity needs in that 2020 period.

497
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a grant, the big pie in the sky.

498
00:46:59,694 --> 00:47:05,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know there was gonna be a pandemic and we were gonna do all these things to really start reaching out and understanding what the needs are.

499
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually we were able to do that in the midst of the pandemic.

500
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm really thankful for the woman who was coordinating this grant throughout the pandemic, because while we were all down in the trenches, she was moving this department forward.

501
00:47:19,257 --> 00:47:23,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So Andrea is our, she's a wonderful, wonderful partner that we've been working with.

502
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We interviewed everyone that got an R U OK call, they got asked a series of questions about adaptive capacity.

503
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:43,103
[SPEAKER_02]: We built our database of knowledge there with that and with our elder population, our senior population, but we also did multiple rounds of listening sessions in multiple languages in 2020.

504
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:48,728
[SPEAKER_02]: With that came our hub report, which you can find on the city's website.

505
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:50,930
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what has established where we're going.

506
00:47:51,490 --> 00:48:01,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we decided, well, we know what we know now, and we know that we need to do better outreach and engagement.

507
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:03,529
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know that we need to work on health equity.

508
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:05,230
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to work on racial equity.

509
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand bias, right?

510
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:10,055
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a lot going on at this time in Med.

511
00:48:10,435 --> 00:48:26,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to reapply for this grant and put it into three different buckets, community engagement through a team of five liaisons, provider partnership engagement through Medford Connects, and then interdepartmental engagement

512
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:33,485
[SPEAKER_02]: where we did over the last two years bring in trainings and presentations to staff.

513
00:48:33,926 --> 00:48:36,668
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the nine dimensions of poverty.

514
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:44,054
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought in an excellent presenter this last June and into the summer who really talked about bias and racial bias.

515
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:47,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done a lot of this work as we've been going through our process.

516
00:48:49,778 --> 00:48:54,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the concept here is to build a resiliency hub.

517
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:55,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is a resiliency hub?

518
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:57,723
[SPEAKER_02]: The climate industry, right?

519
00:48:57,783 --> 00:49:11,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They believe that there's this idea that if we can have a building that's sustainable all by itself, not on the grid, that if there is an emergency, that in fact, we can go there as a community and address our needs in an emergency.

520
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, we need to support our communities before there's an emergency.

521
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know to go to this resiliency hub.

522
00:49:19,997 --> 00:49:23,299
[SPEAKER_02]: They can trust and they can predict that this is a viable place for them.

523
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:28,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to do this, we want to support communities before, during, and then after our climate emergency.

524
00:49:29,823 --> 00:49:34,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So Medford Connects will expand and strengthen our community support.

525
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:38,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've lost my picture.

526
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: To withstand, to support our marginalized groups, to withstand

527
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: the climate change recover from these climate crises.

528
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:54,971
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we hope that Medford's adaptive capacity climate change by supporting our community groups will help us in these as we continue.

529
00:49:55,531 --> 00:49:57,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that climate change is coming, right?

530
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:05,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It is happening now and the effects of climate change will put us in a position to have to respond and be prepared to respond.

531
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we are in understanding what we're doing.

532
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:09,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as I said,

533
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:13,087
[SPEAKER_02]: We piloted our community liaison model.

534
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:15,128
[SPEAKER_02]: We started reaching out to our communities.

535
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:25,375
[SPEAKER_02]: We started thinking to ourselves, okay, so where is this mythical building in the city of Method that we can make it energy efficient and independent?

536
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is, is we don't have that building.

537
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have it, it's not available right now.

538
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still need to do this work, right?

539
00:50:36,323 --> 00:50:39,285
[SPEAKER_02]: We got down to it and we thought, well, how can we do this differently?

540
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:57,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our outreach to our other communities, so we were able to form an Arabic task force, we were able to form a Haitian task force, and we are currently and still reaching out to the other communities to continue to build that partnership and that understanding.

541
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:02,433
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did a lot of needs assessment to understand what would it need to have?

542
00:51:02,513 --> 00:51:04,694
[SPEAKER_02]: What was this resiliency need to have?

543
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:07,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead we created a network.

544
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We came up with the concept of the Resiliency Hub Network.

545
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:12,961
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an operations plan.

546
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your folder.

547
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:24,747
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all working with our climate partners and consultants about what is needed in Resiliency Hub.

548
00:51:24,787 --> 00:51:25,888
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the research say?

549
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the industry say?

550
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to what does the community need and what do they say?

551
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:39,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to create spaces where Metro residents can build face-to-face connections, celebrate together, support each other, and access resources and services as they need them.

552
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:46,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideally, this location would be a place that you go and maybe you play cards, but you could also maybe pick up some food, right?

553
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:54,692
[SPEAKER_02]: You could also get the information to get navigated to a social service navigation like our Alicia, our social worker.

554
00:51:56,806 --> 00:51:59,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So where we are now, we did get that next round of funding.

555
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:09,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we also found out was really exciting is that the state thinks our model is so important that they are now requiring this model in their future proposals from other communities.

556
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:10,944
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very cool.

557
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:12,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very proud of that.

558
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:14,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are we doing?

559
00:52:14,977 --> 00:52:22,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to work with our Medford Connects group, folks that have been attending this group regularly and thinking it through, like how do we work better together?

560
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:24,122
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we work smoother together?

561
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:26,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is a social service desert.

562
00:52:26,704 --> 00:52:29,305
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have our providers living within the city.

563
00:52:29,805 --> 00:52:34,168
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Wayside and their wonderful YMCA moved in to support us.

564
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:37,890
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a youth center and they have Mystic Community Market.

565
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:40,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And West Metro Community Center, that's really it, right?

566
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Metro Family Network is also an agency, but they are also under the city's school system.

567
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:48,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a quasi-nonprofit as well.

568
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:51,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are our key supporters.

569
00:52:51,646 --> 00:53:00,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all collaborated together with a couple of departments as well to start thinking about how are we going to communicate better and how are we going to do this work?

570
00:53:00,646 --> 00:53:10,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So with this change in focus and this understanding that we don't have a physical location, we are moving to a virtual resiliency hub model, right?

571
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna centralize and localize services and information.

572
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:23,734
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna formalize a network of community providers, and we're going to set the foundation for resilient communication.

573
00:53:24,354 --> 00:53:24,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

574
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, these are all programs that there are programs that live within the city right but how are they all connected.

575
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:42,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple different things that we will do, but one of the key things we're going to be able to do with this funding is purchase a software called unite and unite us.

576
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:46,506
[SPEAKER_02]: is a system, it's a software program, right?

577
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:51,088
[SPEAKER_02]: With a lot of extra support from that company to help us build up a network.

578
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:57,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But effectively, our social worker can go in and say, this person needs housing, they need food, they need this.

579
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They can refer from that system all at once to three or four different agencies, all of course partnered into the system, right?

580
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't just, somebody has to receive it.

581
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:09,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to have that formal partnership.

582
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:11,572
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to work towards that and build that.

583
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:22,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope that that will help streamline our communications and just knowing that we have a hub for crisis, but not for prevention.

584
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:33,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And these efforts will help us to prevent evictions, they'll help us to prevent, you know, starvation or not being connected to services or waiting too long to get what we need.

585
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:39,431
[SPEAKER_02]: The project is going to do a number of different things.

586
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:51,039
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the key things that we're going to do though, is make sure that all of our partners within the hub, I mean, within the Medford Connects are going to be working on language access.

587
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,141
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to look at translation of key materials that they regularly put out.

588
00:54:55,922 --> 00:55:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will also be working with them to get more frequent communications as we,

589
00:55:02,762 --> 00:55:10,604
[SPEAKER_02]: more frequent communications out that are smaller, you know, flyers, different blurbs that they want to put out social media, stuff like that.

590
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the key things that we are also going to do are English for speakers of other languages.

591
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:28,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So ESOL, the library and Medford family network are going to partner together and they will have a staff member who will help to build up our ESOL courses in the city and coordinate with other agencies in the area that are doing them.

592
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:39,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna work with our council on aging to help them reach more diverse population and think through the communications that need to happen there.

593
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:49,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with the YMCA in partnership with the rec department to do youth work around social emotional skills to withstand future crises, right?

594
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:52,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And thinking about how that can apply throughout the community as well.

595
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:56,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be continuing to infuse more support into the Medford Family Network.

596
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

597
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:01,983
[SPEAKER_02]: to continue to enhance the work that she's doing.

598
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows Marie is the Medford, she is our heart soul.

599
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:07,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Medford Family Network, right?

600
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:09,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be working on that with them.

601
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:22,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are working with the West Medford Community Center to look at elevating by our black, indigenous and residents of color and locations of local positions of leadership and economic security.

602
00:56:23,178 --> 00:56:27,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a really great evidence-based model that they'll be utilizing called CIRCLES

603
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:34,012
[SPEAKER_02]: that takes mentorship from a professional that's doing, you know, really enjoys their career and wants to mentor others.

604
00:56:34,072 --> 00:56:37,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll mentor folks and they're going to match people up in that regard.

605
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are working very intensely with our Mystic Community Market.

606
00:56:49,715 --> 00:56:52,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mystic Community Market will be,

607
00:56:54,309 --> 00:57:05,439
[SPEAKER_02]: working on a food justice council to look at how we can shape local foodscapes and systems that are shaped by people who have experienced them and not people who haven't.

608
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be working with them on that as well as another of other communications ensuring that all of their materials are translated so on and so forth.

609
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our network here.

610
00:57:17,242 --> 00:57:21,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, as I said, I kind of went through it, but this is the visual of it.

611
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:28,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, all of the partners that I cited, we are also partnered with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

612
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:33,110
[SPEAKER_02]: They are our guru on environment and climate change.

613
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:44,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need their support overall, but they also, it's a great place for them to hear from our community, what's going on, hear from these partners and how they can build that into strategic planning for our community going forward.

614
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:57,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the communications department here at City Hall, who will be really looking at how they're going to be the center of disseminating how we get information out in multiple languages.

615
00:57:58,102 --> 00:58:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to sort of be the point person and we're going to make sure that everything's driving throughout the network and in concert with the city.

616
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:10,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Director Frances Noget is going to help us make sure that we are

617
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this to the fullest and the most equitable way, and we are most inclusive.

618
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:27,050
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, she has funding to provide more trainings for the community, for our partners, for the city employees.

619
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So the final piece of this project is that, and this is why I told you we have Medford community liaisons, we are also hiring more teams of community

620
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,753
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling them Medford Connectors because we don't want to confuse anyone.

621
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:49,739
[SPEAKER_02]: We have community liaisons that are attached to the health department doing health department work, and we have our community liaisons attached to this project.

622
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling them Medford Connectors.

623
00:58:51,440 --> 00:59:02,289
[SPEAKER_02]: They will support everyone in this network on language access, interpretation, and as well as, you know, just thinking through projects before we implement projects.

624
00:59:03,186 --> 00:59:03,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

625
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:04,968
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to really tell you.

626
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:06,709
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a part of the process.

627
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's letting you know what we're doing.

628
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:10,393
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working on our contracts.

629
00:59:10,453 --> 00:59:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be hiring up these Medford connectors and all of these support staff for our grant, but we are at the start of a new process.

630
00:59:19,881 --> 00:59:20,242
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's it.

631
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:23,365
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

632
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:25,406
[SPEAKER_28]: I know Councilor Scarpelli wants to speak.

633
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:25,947
[SPEAKER_28]: I just sent him...

634
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:28,457
[SPEAKER_28]: on an errand for Vice President Bears.

635
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:29,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

636
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:33,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Penny, for reaching out to me to make this presentation.

637
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:42,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really important for us to hear and for anyone who's, you know, in the community to hear the great work that we're doing.

638
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:51,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is really showing how we're bringing together so much of the response work and whether we're talking about climate or

639
00:59:52,984 --> 01:00:01,050
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, substance use disorder or food insecurity or housing insecurity, all the other issues that we know so many people in our community are facing.

640
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,073
[SPEAKER_08]: But also just bringing the community together in general and building a more resilient community.

641
01:00:05,153 --> 01:00:12,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think something that we have been talking about and will continue to be talking about is social emotional support for young people in our community.

642
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:16,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, you know, making sure that seniors have connection to the resources that they need in our community.

643
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:23,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just think that this is really showing that there's an intentional approach and that the staff on the ground are really doing amazing work.

644
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:28,691
[SPEAKER_08]: not just in bringing in funding so that we can do this, which I know is really tough.

645
01:00:29,352 --> 01:00:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the reasons that it hadn't been done before is we have huge budgetary problems.

646
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:47,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm glad that there's a pool of money that you're able to access for this, but also how we can really embed it throughout all of our public institutions, from our public schools, to our city departments, to our nonprofit organizations going forward.

647
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:58,442
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really impressive work, really thankful to you and everyone who's been working on it and obviously continue to love to support and help out where I can.

648
01:00:58,782 --> 01:00:59,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

649
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:00,543
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

650
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:01,583
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam President.

651
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.

652
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:10,188
[SPEAKER_27]: You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.

653
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:10,728
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think that

654
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:14,912
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, one thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.

655
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:17,534
[SPEAKER_27]: This is, this is what we've let we've lacked here for a long time.

656
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:22,319
[SPEAKER_27]: So I appreciate your effort, but, uh, a most vulnerable community right now.

657
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:24,481
[SPEAKER_27]: Have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.

658
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:29,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Are we partnering anything with the, with the method housing department to reach, uh, those families that I think that,

659
01:01:31,127 --> 01:01:31,507
[SPEAKER_27]: if you can.

660
01:01:31,668 --> 01:01:38,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are partnering with them through our health equity coordinator and the work that we're doing with our social work.

661
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:42,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely are in communication and working with them.

662
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:47,504
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just, it was just a formal partnership for the grant, is what I'm expressing here.

663
01:01:47,544 --> 01:01:49,406
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so obviously there'll be a big piece of this.

664
01:01:49,426 --> 01:01:49,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, definitely.

665
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:51,448
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you so much.

666
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:52,289
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

667
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:58,713
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I just wanted to thank you and your department for all of this work that you're doing.

668
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:13,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something that a few of us, many of us on this side of the rail have been talking about, a lot of community leaders have been talking about is the importance of bringing government to the people and not just expecting people to show up.

669
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:23,179
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that there are real equity access barriers when it comes to meetings, even meetings like this,

670
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:39,321
[SPEAKER_00]: any city meeting, any coming to city events, and your department's, I think, philosophical approach to outreach, I think is something that we should be proud that we're doing as a city.

671
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:49,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it can be really tough to do that outreach, and so I was wondering what some of the challenges that you've found were.

672
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:52,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I know the community liaisons have been doing a great job,

673
01:02:53,456 --> 01:03:07,820
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm wondering what are some of the barriers that you guys have faced and what are some of the ways that you're gonna address that with the Medford Connectors program in terms of outreach and getting to more people?

674
01:03:09,261 --> 01:03:10,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great question.

675
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the major issue that we have is the same issue that every city in town is having right now.

676
01:03:15,463 --> 01:03:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that there is no housing.

677
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no emergency shelter.

678
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone comes here and says, I don't have anywhere to go tonight.

679
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anywhere to send them.

680
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:29,284
[SPEAKER_02]: The shelters are full, they're full early.

681
01:03:30,424 --> 01:03:33,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That is our biggest worry.

682
01:03:33,066 --> 01:03:36,748
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we walk home at night like, we feel awful, right?

683
01:03:36,768 --> 01:03:38,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't have good answers when that happens.

684
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is, is we have to just be very honest with people in that regard.

685
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:56,559
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we did do that I think what really needs to happen is that we really do need to explain what can you access here in the city of Method.

686
01:03:56,919 --> 01:04:02,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was remiss to say that our library has incredible services.

687
01:04:02,542 --> 01:04:06,223
[SPEAKER_02]: They have tools that community members can use, right?

688
01:04:06,783 --> 01:04:10,145
[SPEAKER_02]: They are definitely a resiliency hub in so many regards, right?

689
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:23,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So driving people to these locations that can be a part of your everyday life in this community is really, really important.

690
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:34,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to think about this grant is very much about that, getting people to be in and a part of, and for us to go out to and truly create this to be like a home.

691
01:04:34,943 --> 01:04:41,647
[SPEAKER_02]: for everyone that lives here, that this is their home, regardless of the way our society is, where a lot of people live online, right?

692
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And they talk online and they commune online and stuff like that.

693
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:50,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, one of the key things we want to continue to do is describe city services, right?

694
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:53,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of violations do people get?

695
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:56,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Parking violations, trash maybe violations, right?

696
01:04:56,357 --> 01:04:57,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these things that are costly.

697
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:04,214
[SPEAKER_02]: to community members, we need to communicate better what those are and what the rules are and have access to that.

698
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:08,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like, you know, my aunt works at City Hall and I know that I could do this.

699
01:05:08,476 --> 01:05:11,897
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to just make those things a little bit more ready for everybody in the community.

700
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:23,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the website, when the new website is up, we do have recorded videos, audio videos in other languages about most of the city services, sort of like an FAQ for each department.

701
01:05:23,547 --> 01:05:26,489
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that like ready and prepared from the previous round of funding.

702
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:28,251
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to get it up live and out.

703
01:05:29,832 --> 01:05:38,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I really answered your question, but I think the issue is, is that us becoming more connected and communicative is really, really important.

704
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another, but what we are currently faced with is so overwhelming.

705
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:47,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much like that opioid, the opioid crisis is like, where do we even begin?

706
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:52,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and really there's things the state has to do to make those changes to support our community members.

707
01:05:54,008 --> 01:05:55,548
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been doing incredible work.

708
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:57,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really appreciate that answer.

709
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:59,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and what you were talking about.

710
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:21,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, um, I think the work you guys are doing, I think, um, lays out a foundation for what other departments in the city can, um, can do, including the city council, maybe in the further future, maybe I think you guys are testing the waters, seeing what works and perhaps in the future, um, our city council and other branches of government, uh, other departments of the government can look towards you guys and see,

711
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:33,589
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do to be more inclusive to get more of those voices that haven't been included in city government to help us come to our meetings and help us, you know, give us feedback and shape our agendas.

712
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's helpful.

713
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:41,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my question was slightly, slightly more about how are we reaching the residents that we haven't reached yet.

714
01:06:42,524 --> 01:06:45,005
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know can be a really difficult question to answer.

715
01:06:45,065 --> 01:06:46,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you guys are already working on it.

716
01:06:47,186 --> 01:07:07,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you guys partner with other city departments to, you know, keep track of who comes in for city services already, or in terms of maybe a city, the work that we do collecting survey data with our city, city census type things, seeing who moves into the city, pays our taxes, perhaps there's a way to,

717
01:07:09,594 --> 01:07:24,964
[SPEAKER_00]: even in, I know this can be costly, but putting even a short flyer in our water bills or something like that to try to get more people aware that your department exists, that the work that you guys are doing exists.

718
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:28,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that will reach more people, but you are the expert here, so.

719
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:31,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that you're totally right.

720
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we're looking at is like, okay, so we need to continue to build relationships with all of our faith communities.

721
01:07:38,813 --> 01:07:39,814
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one key thing.

722
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: The other piece that we are working on actively right now is going through our entire database of businesses and working in that angle as well.

723
01:07:49,919 --> 01:07:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think that I'll have a better answer and a more concrete answer for you in about six months.

724
01:07:57,418 --> 01:08:01,020
[SPEAKER_02]: when we get all of our staff in place and people are moving and operating.

725
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:15,987
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanna say though, one of the key things that has been a benefit since the RUOK or our social service navigation began is that we have 89 referrals from city employees to the social worker to get somebody help.

726
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're definitely getting the word out across the city departments that we can help.

727
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals that, you know, the other thing to note is that if I show up and I say I have a housing issue, I have other things that I need to be processed through.

728
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:40,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we really want our city social worker to kind of work with that person and ask those really, like, really hard questions for someone to reflect on.

729
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:49,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we really do want city department, we want our folks that work here to get the person to the right place in order to get the information that they need

730
01:08:50,556 --> 01:08:53,658
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually will be able to be viable, right?

731
01:08:53,718 --> 01:08:56,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Just giving someone a pamphlet doesn't solve their issue.

732
01:08:57,321 --> 01:09:01,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not gonna solve their issue either, but we can at least give them the correct information and the correct numbers.

733
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:03,665
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.

734
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:07,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to what you've been saying,

735
01:09:09,324 --> 01:09:14,727
[SPEAKER_00]: as a son of immigrant parents, I've had to translate a lot of things, find out a lot of things about city services.

736
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:15,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be super helpful.

737
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:18,729
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that you're describing will be super helpful.

738
01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:27,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think lay out groundwork for, you know, the work that we want to do on youth mental health, on, you know, making our community safer as well.

739
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:28,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.

740
01:09:28,214 --> 01:09:30,355
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

741
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:31,075
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Caraviello.

742
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:33,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

743
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Councilor Tang just asked my question, but I don't see the Asian population represented here.

744
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:41,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the largest growing segment of our community right now.

745
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:54,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know- So our plan is for this particular grant round is to expand one of our roles that we have a BIPOC connector role.

746
01:09:55,165 --> 01:09:58,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanna really relegate that and reach out to the Asian community.

747
01:09:58,868 --> 01:10:04,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I was with some people in Somerville and they just put on an Asian liaison in their community.

748
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that we can do that there.

749
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:06,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I do too.

750
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:07,795
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much for pointing that out.

751
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:08,494
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

752
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:09,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Collins.

753
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:18,501
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.

754
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:28,447
[SPEAKER_32]: I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but, you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.

755
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:37,693
[SPEAKER_32]: It's really great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to City Hall,

756
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:42,496
[SPEAKER_32]: are not reached out to, don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.

757
01:10:42,997 --> 01:10:50,220
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has enabled the city to do.

758
01:10:50,240 --> 01:11:03,848
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what doing that work of bringing more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.

759
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:22,860
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, as a, as a Councilor, and I know that you in your office, you, you, you get this, you know, 10 times more than, than we do, but, you know, we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, you know, the eviction crisis in Medford square several months ago, eviction help, you know, tenant organizing.

760
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,082
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.

761
01:11:26,122 --> 01:11:29,945
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I, what strikes me every time these conversations come up is,

762
01:11:30,461 --> 01:11:38,703
[SPEAKER_32]: It seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.

763
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:48,385
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that it's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.

764
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:52,326
[SPEAKER_32]: There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.

765
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:57,807
[SPEAKER_32]: And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.

766
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:00,048
[SPEAKER_32]: Where this comes in as I think,

767
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:09,302
[SPEAKER_32]: Given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.

768
01:12:09,322 --> 01:12:15,025
[SPEAKER_32]: I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.

769
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:28,011
[SPEAKER_32]: And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with, you know, regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to, you know, I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say,

770
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:30,386
[SPEAKER_32]: I can get you on that wait list.

771
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:31,447
[SPEAKER_32]: I can get you on that list.

772
01:12:31,507 --> 01:12:31,907
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't wait.

773
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:33,047
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't get you on that wait list.

774
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:35,188
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm sure that's, I'm sure that's really hard.

775
01:12:35,348 --> 01:12:37,309
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just thank you for, thank you for this work.

776
01:12:37,349 --> 01:12:38,909
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm really excited to see how it continues.

777
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:45,391
[SPEAKER_32]: And like vice president Behr said, so any way this council can support you and continue that work, you know, we're partners with you.

778
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:46,332
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

779
01:12:50,913 --> 01:12:51,714
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, councilor Collins.

780
01:12:53,374 --> 01:12:54,535
[SPEAKER_28]: Penny, I just had one question.

781
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:58,816
[SPEAKER_28]: So you mentioned part of the work really needing to lean on the communications department at city hall.

782
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,081
[SPEAKER_28]: So understanding that the communications department is essentially, it's one person.

783
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:07,883
[SPEAKER_28]: So is there any funding in this grant that, you know, funds additional communication support?

784
01:13:07,923 --> 01:13:11,504
[SPEAKER_28]: Because I think that's something we always run into in all aspects of City Hall.

785
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:13,605
[SPEAKER_28]: And I also, I don't want to detract from any of your work.

786
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,906
[SPEAKER_28]: This is incredible work, the work of you, the liaisons, everyone, like this is so much work.

787
01:13:18,506 --> 01:13:24,428
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to make sure, you know, communication supports that, but understanding how under, you know, it's one person, so.

788
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:26,669
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have,

789
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has hired a COVID-19, you know, communications support.

790
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is two people now.

791
01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:37,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

792
01:13:37,942 --> 01:13:38,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

793
01:13:38,642 --> 01:13:41,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's, that's excellent.

794
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:47,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that role really is absolutely applicable to supporting this grant.

795
01:13:47,847 --> 01:13:50,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have that as a fortunate positive.

796
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:54,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a little bit of money to go along like formal translations.

797
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lot of money to be able to do that.

798
01:13:57,512 --> 01:13:59,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously that's a big budget.

799
01:13:59,674 --> 01:14:06,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to be obviously thoughtful about what we're gonna use that funding for, but we do have the money relegated to help them to do that.

800
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:11,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think that's all I was supposed to say.

801
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:11,519
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

802
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:12,160
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

803
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:12,780
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate it.

804
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,162
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello to receive in place on file second by Councilor Knight.

805
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:20,342
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

806
01:14:20,602 --> 01:14:21,103
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Penny.

807
01:14:32,988 --> 01:14:33,148
Yes.

808
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:33,268
Yes.

809
01:14:33,288 --> 01:14:33,388
Yes.

810
01:14:33,408 --> 01:14:33,588
Yes.

811
01:14:43,837 --> 01:14:46,198
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

812
01:14:46,218 --> 01:15:02,987
[SPEAKER_28]: 22-604 offered by Vice President Bears, be it so resolved by the Metro City Council that the finance director appear at the December 20th, 2022 regular meeting to present the fiscal year 2023 quarter one financial update and warn articles as requested by the council on a multitude of occasions.

813
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:13,233
[SPEAKER_28]: The mayor and city administration committed that this information would be presented to the city council and the public by a mid-November deadline that has not been met.

814
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:19,213
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

815
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:21,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

816
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:24,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also do recognize that Councilor Knight did submit

817
01:15:25,345 --> 01:15:34,813
[SPEAKER_08]: an amendment to this paper requesting that the documents be presented to the council in advance of a presentation and that the presentation be tabled to the next regularly scheduled meeting.

818
01:15:35,394 --> 01:15:38,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what you have tonight for us, Director Dickinson.

819
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:48,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy to hear kind of a short update, but I do agree that in order for us to be fully prepared for a budget presentation and financial update, having the documents in advance would be helpful.

820
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:52,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want to speak for council tonight beyond that, but I do understand that.

821
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:54,404
[SPEAKER_08]: a concern.

822
01:15:54,624 --> 01:15:56,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'll just put that out there.

823
01:15:58,907 --> 01:15:59,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. Bears.

824
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:02,029
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight, or would you like to hear from finance?

825
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:13,017
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'd like to know why we still haven't received one copy of one Warren article since January of 2020, 2021 now, 2021.

826
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:16,679
[SPEAKER_18]: We have not received one copy of one Warren article.

827
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:23,444
[SPEAKER_18]: You sat here before this body and put a budget presentation on and we made it pretty darn clear

828
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:24,915
[SPEAKER_18]: that we want this document.

829
01:16:25,475 --> 01:16:33,520
[SPEAKER_18]: This council has passed countless resolutions saying we want this document, yet your office has failed to provide it time and time again.

830
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:46,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, Bob, I know you're new to the city and, you know, at some point you got to say, I'm not blaming you, but now I am blaming you because you sat here before us in June when we asked for this document, we still haven't received it.

831
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:48,390
[SPEAKER_18]: The council has taken numerous votes.

832
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:52,292
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor's office has said, refer it to the finance director in a response to this body.

833
01:16:52,705 --> 01:16:53,866
[SPEAKER_18]: but we still haven't received it.

834
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:54,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

836
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:05,171
[SPEAKER_35]: What precisely are you looking for?

837
01:17:05,251 --> 01:17:07,312
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, is this a for real story right now?

838
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:08,752
[SPEAKER_35]: This is a for real story.

839
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, literally.

840
01:17:10,253 --> 01:17:15,336
[SPEAKER_18]: After a year and a half of waiting for this document.

841
01:17:15,356 --> 01:17:15,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

842
01:17:16,636 --> 01:17:20,258
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been asking for this document for a year and a half and he goes, what are you asking for now?

843
01:17:20,885 --> 01:17:22,907
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, is this- 

843
01:17:20,885 --> 01:17:22,907
[SPEAKER_28]: I understand the frustration.

844
01:17:22,947 --> 01:17:24,268
[SPEAKER_18]: No, this isn't even about frustration.

845
01:17:24,288 --> 01:17:26,050
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about a waste of my goddamn time.

846
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,411
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, that's what this is.

847
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:28,672
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, it's a waste.

848
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:33,056
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a waste of all of our time to come up here and be pranced around like dog and pony.

849
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,600
[SPEAKER_28]: Director Dickinson.

850
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,382
[SPEAKER_18]: To be pranced around like dog and pony.

851
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:41,524
[SPEAKER_35]: Warren articles are passed by this body.

852
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:43,065
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not passed by this body.

853
01:17:43,786 --> 01:17:46,048
[SPEAKER_18]: We've never voted on a Warren article in the last decade.

854
01:17:51,357 --> 01:17:55,280
[SPEAKER_28]: Director Dickinson, do you have an update for us or anything you can provide?

855
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,042
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, I'd like to clear this up.

856
01:17:58,582 --> 01:18:00,723
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to give this body everything that it wants.

857
01:18:01,764 --> 01:18:02,885
[SPEAKER_35]: I really do.

858
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:04,666
[SPEAKER_35]: I came here.

859
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:08,609
[SPEAKER_35]: I have the budget actuals for the first quarter.

860
01:18:08,629 --> 01:18:15,233
[SPEAKER_35]: I have revenue projections that unfortunately are locked up in my computer, which died.

861
01:18:16,334 --> 01:18:18,395
[SPEAKER_35]: But I can email all that stuff to you.

862
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:27,412
[SPEAKER_35]: I really don't want to sit here and there's no reason for me not to give you stuff that you want.

863
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,533
[SPEAKER_35]: That's what I'm saying.

864
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,233
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay, and we're on the same page.

865
01:18:30,934 --> 01:18:31,574
[SPEAKER_35]: We really are.

866
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,755
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not really sure physically what it is.

867
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:38,677
[SPEAKER_35]: Warrant articles are passed by this body.

868
01:18:38,897 --> 01:18:39,258
[SPEAKER_35]: They're not.

869
01:18:39,558 --> 01:18:41,519
[SPEAKER_35]: We've never voted on them once, ever.

870
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:45,080
[SPEAKER_08]: They're never presented to us, Bob.

871
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:45,841
[SPEAKER_35]: What are we looking for?

872
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:54,723
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know how much money KP Law has received in the past year, for example.

873
01:18:55,063 --> 01:19:01,165
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can take a look at the Warren articles and I can say, oh, geez, we have a budget in the law department that says they're going to spend $200,000.

874
01:19:01,526 --> 01:19:06,067
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm looking here, in the last six months, we've spent $1.7 million at KP Law.

875
01:19:06,127 --> 01:19:06,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

876
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:12,689
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can get ahead of some of these issues so that come the budget in probably, well, we'll get it, what, maybe June 30th.

877
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:14,690
[SPEAKER_20]: When we get to June 30th for, you know,

878
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:21,466
[SPEAKER_20]: July 1st vote, I might be able to have a little bit of understanding as to why we're in the situation we're in.

879
01:19:22,086 --> 01:19:33,830
[SPEAKER_35]: Now I am absolutely clear on what you, when you're talking about the AP warrant, that's what you want to see, which all the bills that get paid every week.

880
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:36,190
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

881
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:37,871
[SPEAKER_35]: How many years do you want that for?

882
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:42,129
[SPEAKER_18]: 2020. We're going to start there. You know what I mean?

883
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,830
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been asking for it.

884
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:44,154
[SPEAKER_08]: 2020 to the present is what we're requesting.

885
01:19:44,174 --> 01:19:46,921
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been asking for it for four years, but you know, in three years.

886
01:19:48,064 --> 01:19:48,305
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

887
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:51,709
[SPEAKER_35]: Now I understand exactly what you're looking for.

888
01:19:51,869 --> 01:19:56,471
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sorry to take my frustration out on you, but there's a mayor in this, there's a mayor in this building, right?

889
01:19:56,911 --> 01:20:00,273
[SPEAKER_18]: And we send these papers to her and they just sit there and they don't move.

890
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:01,313
[SPEAKER_18]: They just sit on the desk.

891
01:20:01,353 --> 01:20:05,255
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so I show up here and I try to do my job as hard as I can.

892
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:08,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I try, I really do, but I can't do it if I don't have the tools.

893
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:09,797
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't build a house with a saw.

894
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:16,740
[SPEAKER_35]: I understand your frustration and I will work with the mayor to get this documentation to you.

895
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,961
[SPEAKER_35]: Because if there's a holdup,

896
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,192
[SPEAKER_35]: My issue with this whole thing is procedural.

897
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:25,835
[SPEAKER_35]: I need to know exactly what you need to see when you need to see it.

898
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:28,537
[SPEAKER_35]: And I'm not completely clear.

899
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:35,242
[SPEAKER_35]: We're not having a good... 

893
01:20:35,242 --> 01:20:35,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Has the mayor's office ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?

900
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:36,123
[SPEAKER_35]: No.

901
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:43,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Has the chief of staff ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?

902
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:48,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Has the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft an ordinance

903
01:20:49,991 --> 01:20:51,871
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what they're looking for.

904
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:53,092
[SPEAKER_35]: No, the law department's never called me.

905
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:56,933
[SPEAKER_18]: So the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, and the mayor's office hasn't called you.

906
01:20:57,173 --> 01:21:01,474
[SPEAKER_18]: But this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.

907
01:21:07,315 --> 01:21:14,277
[SPEAKER_18]: But then tonight, we have a paper before us to create another new job and give somebody else another raise.

908
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:18,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, come on.

909
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:23,983
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

910
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:28,826
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, and just to just to clarify...

910
01:21:28,826 --> 01:21:29,466
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel bad that they sent you out here to fall on your sword to be a sacrificial lamb.

911
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:38,251
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm fine with falling on my sword

910
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:38,371
[SPEAKER_28]: because we do we vote on these papers, they're supposed to go to the administration, the administration is supposed to send them to the to the parties that are there.

912
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:41,633
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're not getting that, 

911
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:41,813
[SPEAKER_35]: I will make sure that I'm getting them.

913
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,495
[SPEAKER_35]: And I will make sure that you're getting the information that you need.

914
01:21:45,055 --> 01:21:50,238
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I can also always, you know, I can reach out, I can have the Clerk reach out after the fact, if it's not, if it's not getting there.

915
01:21:50,913 --> 01:21:53,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

916
01:21:53,153 --> 01:21:54,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

917
01:21:55,534 --> 01:22:00,695
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could, I think it sounds like we should just get on paper right now what we're asking for.

918
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,335
[SPEAKER_35]: That would be great.

919
01:22:02,435 --> 01:22:06,116
[SPEAKER_35]: And you know, part of this is me being new.

920
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:09,357
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm not coordinating with the mayor's office.

921
01:22:09,417 --> 01:22:12,257
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, new or not, if you're not getting the papers, you're not getting the papers.

922
01:22:12,377 --> 01:22:13,438
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's not your fault.

923
01:22:16,151 --> 01:22:18,733
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't wanna be saying that they're somehow remiss.

924
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:21,455
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not exclusive to the finance department, Bob.

925
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:32,704
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost, unless we make the outreach directly, every paper that we submit to the mayor's office to almost any department, we're not getting the response in a timely manner or a complete manner.

926
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:36,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanna put that out there and I'm not gonna ask you to say that, I'll say it.

927
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:45,033
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing I wanna just get on, so yes, I think the first thing we'd really like to see would be the AP warrants

928
01:22:45,939 --> 01:22:48,080
[SPEAKER_08]: from January 2020 to present.

929
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:54,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that's probably a pretty big file, but I think we'd all like to see it electronically and also to be sent to the clerk to be delivered to us.

930
01:22:56,063 --> 01:22:56,323
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

931
01:22:57,024 --> 01:23:00,485
[SPEAKER_35]: It would simply be these, these are the vendors who were paid this warrant.

932
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:01,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

933
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:12,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, we can also send you an example of what the previous finance or finance director gave us for...

931
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:14,725
[SPEAKER_35]: Specific bills would have to be looked up if you wanted to see a specific bill, but it will say, you know, we paid Joe Schmo $600

934
01:23:14,725 --> 01:23:15,285
[SPEAKER_18]: out of this account.

935
01:23:15,846 --> 01:23:16,006
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

936
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:16,746
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

937
01:23:16,946 --> 01:23:20,128
[SPEAKER_28]: I can also have the Clerk send you when the records are ready.

938
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:24,091
[SPEAKER_28]: Control F, find your name, and you can also see this right now.

939
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:24,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

940
01:23:24,411 --> 01:23:35,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the other thing we can send you is Aleesha Nunley Benjamin did provide us with copies of what we call warrant articles and we can provide you an example of that so that you can see what those reports were like.

941
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:41,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the two things that you said that you have with you tonight, you said you had a quarter one

942
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:47,648
[SPEAKER_35]: Quarter one budget to actual with the votes that you took on the 28th for the general fund and water sewer.

943
01:23:48,228 --> 01:23:50,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other thing that you said is you have revenue projections.

944
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:58,034
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, I have first quarter revenue compared to first quarter revenue from fiscal 2022.

945
01:23:58,535 --> 01:23:59,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

946
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:02,077
[SPEAKER_35]: It's stuck in my computer.

947
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:04,818
[SPEAKER_35]: I can email these files to you if you prefer.

948
01:24:04,918 --> 01:24:05,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

949
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:08,801
[SPEAKER_35]: I do have paper copies of this along with the budget stuff.

950
01:24:10,374 --> 01:24:13,136
[SPEAKER_35]: along with the vote, the copy of the vote that was taken.

951
01:24:13,156 --> 01:24:14,978
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have multiple copies?

952
01:24:15,978 --> 01:24:16,238
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh yeah.

953
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:19,241
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you hand them, can you pass them to Larry and he'll get them to us?

954
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:19,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

955
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:21,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't mean this to be exhaustive.

956
01:24:21,582 --> 01:24:34,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure other Councilors are going to have other items, but basically what would be also very helpful is if you could take anything, anything that we request tonight, send them to us in a digital format and the clerk in a digital format, he can provide it to us in a print format.

957
01:24:35,072 --> 01:24:38,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we can have that, you know, maybe by the end of this week,

958
01:24:40,334 --> 01:24:49,459
[SPEAKER_08]: then we could have a full presentation from you in January, as Councilor Knight had requested, where we've had time to review the documents in advance to ask, have our questions ready.

959
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:51,340
[SPEAKER_35]: Okay.

960
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:57,824
[SPEAKER_18]: It might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet?

961
01:24:57,944 --> 01:25:07,710
[SPEAKER_18]: It says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.

962
01:25:08,722 --> 01:25:12,385
[SPEAKER_35]: All right, well, I apologize that I haven't acted on.

963
01:25:13,686 --> 01:25:15,968
[SPEAKER_35]: I will follow up with that.

964
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:18,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm through, thank you.

965
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:19,191
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam President.

966
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:26,677
[SPEAKER_27]: Bob, again, the other person taking the heat, and I apologize for that.

967
01:25:26,757 --> 01:25:27,518
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not fair to you.

968
01:25:30,485 --> 01:25:32,846
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.

969
01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:44,911
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a Committee of the Whole meeting with Bob once we have all this information

970
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:49,301
[SPEAKER_27]: so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.

971
01:25:49,341 --> 01:25:55,024
[SPEAKER_27]: This is something that, so you understand, Bob, you know, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.

972
01:25:56,564 --> 01:25:58,785
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, when I was 14, I opened up a checking account.

973
01:25:58,845 --> 01:26:02,547
[SPEAKER_27]: My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.

974
01:26:02,627 --> 01:26:03,988
[SPEAKER_27]: This is how you spend your money.

975
01:26:04,628 --> 01:26:12,692
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you don't, if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.

976
01:26:12,712 --> 01:26:14,613
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, you're responsible.

977
01:26:15,307 --> 01:26:16,768
[SPEAKER_27]: to control your own finance.

978
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:27,098
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, what was saying time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers.

979
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:38,489
[SPEAKER_27]: And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I, I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic

980
01:26:39,642 --> 01:26:41,283
[SPEAKER_27]: financial breakdowns of our community.

981
01:26:41,903 --> 01:26:44,345
[SPEAKER_27]: You were there when we had the tough budget process.

982
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:46,366
[SPEAKER_27]: It was horrifying for you being new.

983
01:26:46,926 --> 01:26:51,749
[SPEAKER_27]: And as we're going through this process, Bob, we haven't gotten one, one paper.

984
01:26:52,049 --> 01:26:54,530
[SPEAKER_27]: We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.

985
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,732
[SPEAKER_27]: And here we are, God, almost January, January one.

986
01:26:59,273 --> 01:27:05,236
[SPEAKER_27]: So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling in the council.

987
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:07,734
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't have a city solicitor.

988
01:27:07,774 --> 01:27:12,676
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm trying to ask questions about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.

989
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:18,579
[SPEAKER_27]: And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.

990
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:22,100
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.

991
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:25,282
[SPEAKER_28]: I did see her on the call earlier.

992
01:27:25,362 --> 01:27:29,164
[SPEAKER_28]: She is on the call.

993
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:37,569
[SPEAKER_27]: If I can, can we address the question to her?

994
01:27:38,549 --> 01:27:54,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Madam Chief of Staff, are you there?

995
01:27:54,835 --> 01:27:56,135
[SPEAKER_27]: I think it's a simple question.

996
01:27:56,595 --> 01:28:04,178
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that the Chief of Staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't

997
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:14,655
[SPEAKER_27]: She just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?

998
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:19,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure I would phrase it that way.

999
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:29,799
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I would state that both he and I have been discussing the matter, attempting to work on what specifically it is that the council is looking for.

1000
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:31,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that this is a matter of language

1001
01:28:32,435 --> 01:28:37,579
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've also been working to try to find out what historically the city council has received.

1002
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:40,180
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, as you stated, I'm returning from leave.

1003
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:50,908
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a matter that's important to myself, the administration, the finance director, I believe we all intend and want to provide this information.

1004
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:56,011
[SPEAKER_13]: So I apologize that it hasn't been provided yet and I take responsibility for that.

1005
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:10,479
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just curious if a rank and file employee say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?

1006
01:29:13,841 --> 01:29:16,843
[SPEAKER_13]: President Morell through you, I take that as a rhetorical question.

1007
01:29:19,224 --> 01:29:22,286
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.

1008
01:29:30,205 --> 01:29:30,845
[SPEAKER_18]: even when it's clear.

1009
01:29:32,746 --> 01:29:37,948
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, I heard your answer.

1010
01:29:37,968 --> 01:29:40,269
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't appreciate the response.

1011
01:29:40,309 --> 01:29:44,991
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council.

1012
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:56,196
[SPEAKER_27]: We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.

1013
01:29:56,836 --> 01:29:59,397
[SPEAKER_27]: And we don't know where we are financially.

1014
01:30:00,738 --> 01:30:24,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, so to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests, and then ask for funding for deeply needed, uh, resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially is very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions, moving the city forward.

1015
01:30:25,813 --> 01:30:25,833
[SPEAKER_27]: I,

1016
01:30:28,072 --> 01:30:36,977
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.

1017
01:30:39,379 --> 01:30:42,781
[SPEAKER_27]: There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.

1018
01:30:43,341 --> 01:30:45,162
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is so totally embarrassing.

1019
01:30:46,102 --> 01:30:47,183
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm disheartened right now.

1020
01:30:47,523 --> 01:30:53,187
[SPEAKER_27]: So Bob, again, I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.

1021
01:30:53,207 --> 01:30:56,348
[SPEAKER_27]: The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers.

1022
01:30:57,895 --> 01:31:05,538
[SPEAKER_27]: the day after we had our budget and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.

1023
01:31:06,338 --> 01:31:09,500
[SPEAKER_27]: We're trying to figure out what tonight's a very important meeting.

1024
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,580
[SPEAKER_27]: There's some resolutions tonight.

1025
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:27,087
[SPEAKER_27]: We're talking about some very important issues and looking to fund some very important issues, but getting the okay from the administration to fund papers and then not understanding where we are, because I believe the mayor, you were there when the mayor said as critical as last year's budget was,

1026
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,389
[SPEAKER_27]: next year's is going to be even worse.

1027
01:31:30,269 --> 01:31:42,515
[SPEAKER_27]: And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.

1028
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:44,856
[SPEAKER_27]: So I find this very disheartening.

1029
01:31:45,336 --> 01:31:52,899
[SPEAKER_27]: I find this very troubling and I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter

1030
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:04,566
[SPEAKER_27]: has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multi-million dollar corporation called Medford.

1031
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:10,851
[SPEAKER_27]: So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I had to express my concerns and disgust.

1032
01:32:10,951 --> 01:32:11,492
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you.

1033
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:14,214
[SPEAKER_35]: Councilors, at some point it is going to be me.

1034
01:32:14,274 --> 01:32:18,638
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm just to let you know, we have had staffing issues.

1035
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:20,659
[SPEAKER_35]: Tina's been out, Tyler quit.

1036
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,922
[SPEAKER_35]: We've got a very, very good person to take over from

1037
01:32:24,636 --> 01:32:29,140
[SPEAKER_35]: Tyler, she is already working on the 2024 budget.

1038
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:34,685
[SPEAKER_35]: We've already had meetings on it with all the department heads.

1039
01:32:35,545 --> 01:32:37,507
[SPEAKER_35]: So we're working on that right now.

1040
01:32:38,748 --> 01:32:39,889
[SPEAKER_35]: We got the recap done.

1041
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:42,171
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm working on the state reporting.

1042
01:32:42,231 --> 01:32:43,472
[SPEAKER_35]: So we'll know what pre-cash will be.

1043
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:48,917
[SPEAKER_35]: Hopefully we'll have that wrapped up within the next month, depending on how much availability they have.

1044
01:32:48,977 --> 01:32:50,338
[SPEAKER_35]: They have staffing issues too.

1045
01:32:51,135 --> 01:32:58,360
[SPEAKER_35]: We were fortunate to get the recap done so quickly because there are people out there too and everybody does their recap at the same time.

1046
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:01,442
[SPEAKER_35]: So that's coming along.

1047
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:10,769
[SPEAKER_35]: By the end of December, I should, I can do the cash recon for the first half of

1048
01:33:12,568 --> 01:33:20,150
[SPEAKER_35]: fiscal 2023, which we can send off to CLA and get our revenue replacement number from ARPA for that.

1049
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:27,132
[SPEAKER_35]: You also have a much better projection of how much, you know, how much revenue we are actually going to take in in 2023.

1050
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:30,613
[SPEAKER_35]: So we are working on all these things.

1051
01:33:30,733 --> 01:33:40,175
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm doing a lot of cleanup work, especially on all the grant fundings and the CPC, the linkage funds, all of that stuff.

1052
01:33:41,172 --> 01:33:48,596
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm just trying to get the books back in order to be in a firm foundation from what I'm being able to say, this is what's actually going on.

1053
01:33:49,656 --> 01:33:57,561
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm sorry for the miscommunications or lack of communications, but we are seriously working on this stuff.

1054
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:05,285
[SPEAKER_35]: And I don't wanna be here till two in the morning on June 28th hashing out a budget, neither do you guys.

1055
01:34:05,685 --> 01:34:07,806
[SPEAKER_35]: So this is all gonna be taken care of.

1056
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:11,552
[SPEAKER_35]: well before that.

1057
01:34:13,753 --> 01:34:15,474
[SPEAKER_35]: That is what's going on right now with us.

1058
01:34:16,695 --> 01:34:17,595
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Director Dickinson.

1059
01:34:17,755 --> 01:34:18,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Collins.

1060
01:34:19,556 --> 01:34:24,018
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to thank you for coming before us for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.

1061
01:34:24,038 --> 01:34:37,704
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want

1062
01:34:39,025 --> 01:34:45,209
[SPEAKER_32]: you know, your, your role in, in, in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.

1063
01:34:45,269 --> 01:34:48,191
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.

1064
01:34:48,211 --> 01:34:52,034
[SPEAKER_32]: I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.

1065
01:34:52,595 --> 01:35:05,764
[SPEAKER_32]: And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication wise, what it needs,

1066
01:35:06,817 --> 01:35:08,659
[SPEAKER_32]: just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.

1067
01:35:08,699 --> 01:35:09,940
[SPEAKER_32]: So again, thank you for being here.

1068
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,861
[SPEAKER_32]: We do really appreciate your hard work.

1069
01:35:13,022 --> 01:35:14,503
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1070
01:35:15,023 --> 01:35:18,066
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli, was that a motion to send this to the whole?

1071
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:30,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it, I think we need it immediately.

1072
01:35:30,775 --> 01:35:33,897
[SPEAKER_27]: It's something that, you know, we've been asking for

1073
01:35:35,947 --> 01:35:39,689
[SPEAKER_27]: forever so thank you.

1074
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Just amend the motion to request that the finance director submit to the clerk in the council and digital format, the documents requested and documents that we listed out earlier.

1075
01:35:52,817 --> 01:36:00,362
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll leave it at that but I do think we should try to schedule this early in January and try to figure out.

1076
01:36:02,168 --> 01:36:06,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, and I can, I can connect with you Bob, just whenever it's ready, I can, we can get that on the schedule.

1077
01:36:08,011 --> 01:36:13,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Whenever everything is ready, we can get that on a schedule so I can coordinate with you.

1078
01:36:15,115 --> 01:36:22,299
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll work with you whenever, I'll email you, I'll follow up so we can schedule it when you have everything ready.

1079
01:36:22,579 --> 01:36:26,181
[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by

1080
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,403
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, counts and I had submitted advance for which.

1081
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:49,837
[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1082
01:37:01,206 --> 01:37:01,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Bears.

1083
01:37:02,266 --> 01:37:02,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1084
01:37:03,727 --> 01:37:04,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Caraviello.

1085
01:37:04,507 --> 01:37:04,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1086
01:37:05,147 --> 01:37:05,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Collins.

1087
01:37:05,808 --> 01:37:06,028
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

1088
01:37:06,428 --> 01:37:06,848
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

1089
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:07,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1090
01:37:07,548 --> 01:37:08,228
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1091
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:08,629
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1092
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:09,449
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Tseng.

1093
01:37:10,069 --> 01:37:10,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1094
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:11,910
[SPEAKER_21]: President Morell.

1095
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:12,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1096
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:14,551
[SPEAKER_28]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1097
01:37:14,731 --> 01:37:19,472
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli, you had asked me to take another paper.

1098
01:37:22,273 --> 01:37:23,454
[SPEAKER_28]: Paper 22-613.

1099
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:24,714
[SPEAKER_28]: 22-613 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1100
01:37:24,854 --> 01:37:30,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Be it so resolved that the city council discuss enlisted parents dealing with the safety concerns at Medford High School after the horrific incident

1101
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:34,413
[SPEAKER_28]: that occurred at Medford High School on Monday, December 19th.

1102
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:38,877
[SPEAKER_28]: Be it further resolved that the City Council take immediate action to ensure the safety of our children and teachers.

1103
01:37:38,897 --> 01:37:39,978
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1104
01:37:40,018 --> 01:37:40,938
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam President.

1105
01:37:41,659 --> 01:37:43,200
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate taking this out of order.

1106
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:48,824
[SPEAKER_27]: This has been a very emotional last 24 hours.

1107
01:37:48,844 --> 01:38:00,834
[SPEAKER_27]: It's been very intense and I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared so I don't miss anything.

1108
01:38:04,097 --> 01:38:05,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Medford's in crisis.

1109
01:38:06,337 --> 01:38:14,899
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.

1110
01:38:15,999 --> 01:38:20,840
[SPEAKER_27]: Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.

1111
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:30,722
[SPEAKER_27]: But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.

1112
01:38:32,369 --> 01:38:40,673
[SPEAKER_27]: Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.

1113
01:38:42,593 --> 01:38:48,076
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanna look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.

1114
01:38:49,577 --> 01:38:52,538
[SPEAKER_27]: First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?

1115
01:38:54,099 --> 01:38:55,559
[SPEAKER_27]: No, they're not.

1116
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:01,942
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not the data that we need now, we now have the actual proof

1117
01:39:02,406 --> 01:39:03,427
[SPEAKER_27]: from our experiences.

1118
01:39:04,387 --> 01:39:08,970
[SPEAKER_27]: Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?

1119
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:12,873
[SPEAKER_27]: No, the warning signs are there and we ignored it.

1120
01:39:15,975 --> 01:39:17,756
[SPEAKER_27]: Are we unified on this issue?

1121
01:39:18,637 --> 01:39:19,377
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolutely not.

1122
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:25,001
[SPEAKER_27]: Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.

1123
01:39:26,923 --> 01:39:28,824
[SPEAKER_27]: I question the personal motives

1124
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:37,840
[SPEAKER_27]: of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.

1125
01:39:41,462 --> 01:39:49,186
[SPEAKER_27]: There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.

1126
01:39:50,386 --> 01:39:57,030
[SPEAKER_27]: National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.

1127
01:39:58,843 --> 01:40:02,726
[SPEAKER_27]: Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?

1128
01:40:03,687 --> 01:40:04,827
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, that's evident.

1129
01:40:05,848 --> 01:40:08,810
[SPEAKER_27]: The division in this great community is tragic.

1130
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:17,777
[SPEAKER_27]: If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.

1131
01:40:18,798 --> 01:40:22,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.

1132
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:26,083
[SPEAKER_27]: Unified, we will overcome together,

1133
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:32,912
[SPEAKER_27]: divided we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.

1134
01:40:36,173 --> 01:40:39,914
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, last night I was accused of politicizing this issue.

1135
01:40:42,415 --> 01:40:52,117
[SPEAKER_27]: My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.

1136
01:40:53,037 --> 01:40:53,857
[SPEAKER_27]: Then I thought about it.

1137
01:40:55,078 --> 01:40:56,678
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course I'm politicizing this issue.

1138
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:05,406
[SPEAKER_27]: because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.

1139
01:41:06,347 --> 01:41:11,088
[SPEAKER_27]: We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.

1140
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:25,653
[SPEAKER_27]: So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect and responsibilities.

1141
01:41:27,486 --> 01:41:40,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.

1142
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:48,105
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.

1143
01:41:50,157 --> 01:41:59,204
[SPEAKER_27]: If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.

1144
01:42:01,186 --> 01:42:03,688
[SPEAKER_27]: We were elected by the people, for the people.

1145
01:42:05,089 --> 01:42:09,593
[SPEAKER_27]: It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.

1146
01:42:11,214 --> 01:42:14,617
[SPEAKER_27]: See, when we got elected by the people,

1147
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:18,333
[SPEAKER_27]: It should not be measured by winning or losing.

1148
01:42:19,154 --> 01:42:24,578
[SPEAKER_27]: It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.

1149
01:42:26,819 --> 01:42:31,183
[SPEAKER_27]: This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.

1150
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:35,646
[SPEAKER_27]: The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?

1151
01:42:37,387 --> 01:42:44,393
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids the way that they require from us.

1152
01:42:47,435 --> 01:43:09,471
[SPEAKER_27]: First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.

1153
01:43:11,972 --> 01:43:13,173
[SPEAKER_27]: We want them to feel safe.

1154
01:43:14,794 --> 01:43:16,696
[SPEAKER_27]: Meetings, consultants,

1155
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:18,551
[SPEAKER_27]: That's passed.

1156
01:43:19,132 --> 01:43:25,303
[SPEAKER_27]: We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.

1157
01:43:25,804 --> 01:43:26,445
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure of that.

1158
01:43:29,372 --> 01:43:40,556
[SPEAKER_27]: I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.

1159
01:43:41,356 --> 01:43:57,662
[SPEAKER_27]: Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute-to-minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways, to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get

1160
01:43:58,137 --> 01:43:59,798
[SPEAKER_27]: the support there as soon as possible.

1161
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:07,425
[SPEAKER_27]: Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.

1162
01:44:09,066 --> 01:44:12,129
[SPEAKER_27]: We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.

1163
01:44:13,810 --> 01:44:15,212
[SPEAKER_27]: And he mentioned that.

1164
01:44:15,232 --> 01:44:16,253
[SPEAKER_27]: I thought that was a great idea.

1165
01:44:16,313 --> 01:44:18,855
[SPEAKER_27]: When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.

1166
01:44:19,415 --> 01:44:24,740
[SPEAKER_27]: She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about

1167
01:44:25,313 --> 01:44:30,816
[SPEAKER_27]: a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.

1168
01:44:31,697 --> 01:44:32,878
[SPEAKER_27]: It's called Dads in the Hall.

1169
01:44:33,718 --> 01:44:36,320
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.

1170
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:48,507
[SPEAKER_27]: If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as you walk the halls.

1171
01:44:49,568 --> 01:44:51,509
[SPEAKER_27]: So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.

1172
01:44:52,762 --> 01:45:02,068
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.

1173
01:45:02,128 --> 01:45:13,734
[SPEAKER_27]: So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.

1174
01:45:14,335 --> 01:45:19,658
[SPEAKER_27]: The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.

1175
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:33,652
[SPEAKER_27]: to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.

1176
01:45:34,672 --> 01:45:49,035
[SPEAKER_27]: If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue

1177
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:52,191
[SPEAKER_27]: to have a voice and they can listen.

1178
01:45:55,132 --> 01:46:00,373
[SPEAKER_27]: So this has been a very intense last 24 hours.

1179
01:46:02,934 --> 01:46:10,215
[SPEAKER_27]: My daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.

1180
01:46:11,215 --> 01:46:19,177
[SPEAKER_27]: The word back was that the police were there and they were present, but we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.

1181
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:39,347
[SPEAKER_27]: So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks so we have our children feeling safe.

1182
01:46:41,408 --> 01:46:46,591
[SPEAKER_27]: And that leaves me with one thing.

1183
01:46:46,611 --> 01:46:48,453
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that she's not here right now,

1184
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:56,224
[SPEAKER_27]: But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.

1185
01:46:56,844 --> 01:46:57,705
[SPEAKER_27]: It was directed to me.

1186
01:46:58,005 --> 01:46:58,886
[SPEAKER_27]: It's direct to all of us.

1187
01:46:59,607 --> 01:47:03,269
[SPEAKER_27]: It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.

1188
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:08,754
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.

1189
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:30,337
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.

1190
01:47:32,197 --> 01:47:34,738
[SPEAKER_27]: So let's unify this community.

1191
01:47:35,098 --> 01:47:37,199
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's unify our schools.

1192
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:46,352
[SPEAKER_27]: and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.

1193
01:47:47,012 --> 01:47:48,012
[SPEAKER_27]: So thank you, Madam President.

1195
01:48:00,794 --> 01:48:05,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I also had a grandchild that didn't go to school today either because of her fear, but, you know,

1196
01:48:06,089 --> 01:48:20,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of being here tonight advocating for funding, hiring teachers, school repairs, or asking for supplies, I'm here tonight to add my voice to the groundswell of anger and outrage that so many are feeling regarding the recent violence at Bedford High School.

1197
01:48:21,094 --> 01:48:27,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I am demanding adequate resources, security, to help keep our students safe.

1198
01:48:28,316 --> 01:48:29,676
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, let's get one thing straight.

1199
01:48:30,536 --> 01:48:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Stabbing yesterday was not an isolated incident.

1200
01:48:33,217 --> 01:48:35,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullying has been going on for a long time at that high school.

1201
01:48:36,419 --> 01:48:37,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't just start yesterday.

1202
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:44,504
[SPEAKER_05]: A gun clip found in a middle school auditorium during a school vacation was an isolated incident.

1203
01:48:44,984 --> 01:48:45,645
[SPEAKER_05]: No one was hurt.

1204
01:48:46,165 --> 01:48:50,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Gun clips by themselves don't hurt people, but knives and physical violence do.

1205
01:48:51,468 --> 01:48:54,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone who engages in the community could see this coming a mile away.

1206
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:58,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullying has been escalated, unchecked, since the start of the school year.

1207
01:49:00,754 --> 01:49:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But rather than address the situation on early

1208
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: school officials, superintendent, school committee, and the mayor consistently downplayed each and every incident, hoping it would go away.

1209
01:49:10,562 --> 01:49:15,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unconscionable that no comment, acknowledgement, or plan of action was implemented immediately.

1210
01:49:16,484 --> 01:49:17,165
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we thinking?

1211
01:49:18,445 --> 01:49:20,666
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know when people aren't thinking.

1212
01:49:22,047 --> 01:49:27,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday's school committee was another pointless charade of the council needs to work together and not yell at us.

1213
01:49:27,809 --> 01:49:28,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you something.

1214
01:49:28,809 --> 01:49:30,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been working here for 11 years.

1215
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten yelled at many times.

1216
01:49:33,444 --> 01:49:35,744
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't take getting yelled at, then don't run for office.

1217
01:49:36,925 --> 01:49:40,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been willing to work together with any elected body since the first day I was elected.

1218
01:49:41,566 --> 01:49:42,846
[SPEAKER_05]: People are justifiably angry.

1219
01:49:43,206 --> 01:49:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's become quite clear that when the teachers had a vote of no confidence, it was directed to the school committee and the mayor's chair.

1220
01:49:50,688 --> 01:49:58,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of seeing my city, Medford, in the media recently with a glaring negative spotlight now focused on our community.

1221
01:49:59,089 --> 01:50:02,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's evident that we're not ready for this prime time.

1222
01:50:03,001 --> 01:50:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I was astonished to hear our superintendent say on television last night, we don't encourage bringing weapons to school, encourage.

1223
01:50:12,007 --> 01:50:13,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Statement I find boggles, say at least.

1224
01:50:14,288 --> 01:50:29,278
[SPEAKER_05]: How about zero tolerance statement for any weapons and violence of any kind, and we'll act swiftly and with determination to eradicate this unacceptable behavior and prosecute anyone who violates this policy to the fullest extent of the law.

1225
01:50:31,223 --> 01:50:33,044
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what our superintendent should have said.

1226
01:50:33,884 --> 01:50:34,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another mind twister.

1227
01:50:35,885 --> 01:50:38,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Biffin High has no expulsion policy or program in place.

1228
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:40,286
[SPEAKER_05]: What measures does it send?

1229
01:50:41,907 --> 01:50:45,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want, and don't worry, you won't get kicked out of school.

1230
01:50:45,888 --> 01:50:47,869
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, everyone is entitled to an education.

1231
01:50:49,309 --> 01:50:51,690
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not if they're a danger to this community.

1232
01:50:52,110 --> 01:50:54,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this begs the question, where is the mayor in all this?

1233
01:50:55,331 --> 01:50:57,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this just goes away, not showing leadership.

1234
01:50:58,192 --> 01:50:59,633
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a surprise to me here either.

1235
01:51:00,936 --> 01:51:02,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So where do we go from here?

1236
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:08,661
[SPEAKER_05]: First, keep the police present in our high school indefinitely.

1237
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:10,362
[SPEAKER_05]: 392 students called out today.

1238
01:51:10,782 --> 01:51:14,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Students, teachers, and parents demand a safe learning environment.

1239
01:51:14,845 --> 01:51:23,210
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a first step, bringing Councilors to talk to our affected students and ensure them that the situation now finally is being addressed.

1240
01:51:24,331 --> 01:51:29,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Schedule multiple listening sessions for parents and community members to express their feelings and vent.

1241
01:51:30,387 --> 01:51:33,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them your absolute promise that this ends now.

1242
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:38,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Go through the school incident logs and put problem students on the notice immediately.

1243
01:51:40,292 --> 01:51:43,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's an insult to say this was an outside incident.

1244
01:51:43,454 --> 01:51:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: The kids at the school have seen a growing power vacuum of non-discipline with the recent bully and failing body to act up themselves.

1245
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,800
[SPEAKER_05]: It's copycat pure violence and simple.

1246
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:58,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, hold yourself accountable and admit that

1247
01:51:59,861 --> 01:52:02,261
[SPEAKER_05]: you minimize the problem instead of deflecting the blame.

1248
01:52:03,302 --> 01:52:04,882
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only way to move forward from this.

1249
01:52:04,922 --> 01:52:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: The principal and superintendents should put a clear professional plan in place to start 2023 right.

1250
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:12,344
[SPEAKER_05]: We owe it to our children and their future.

1251
01:52:13,504 --> 01:52:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We can fix mistakes that were made, but if someone loses their life due to needless violence, that's not a mistake that anyone can fix.

1252
01:52:22,886 --> 01:52:26,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud to be a graduate of Bedford High School, and I have many fond memories of my time there.

1253
01:52:27,647 --> 01:52:29,547
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of memories are these children gonna have

1254
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:31,921
[SPEAKER_05]: for the eight years at Medford High.

1255
01:52:32,402 --> 01:52:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We can change that, but we've got to act now.

1256
01:52:36,064 --> 01:52:36,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1257
01:52:52,423 --> 01:53:04,311
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for being outspoken in their efforts to raise awareness as to what's going on in our schools.

1258
01:53:05,832 --> 01:53:11,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Neither one of these gentlemen were required to appear for the school committee meeting last night.

1259
01:53:11,836 --> 01:53:19,861
[SPEAKER_20]: They did so as concerned parents, grandparents, and public servants here in the city.

1260
01:53:20,981 --> 01:53:39,046
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I listen to what they say, and I listen to what people on the street say, and when I listen to what my kids say, and I listen to what my wife has to say about these public schools as an educator at 25 years in a neighboring school district, it doesn't make me feel good.

1261
01:53:40,226 --> 01:53:41,387
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't make me feel good at all.

1262
01:53:43,567 --> 01:53:45,848
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel as though we're failing our students.

1263
01:53:47,435 --> 01:53:52,436
[SPEAKER_20]: We're feeling the most vulnerable members of our population, our children.

1264
01:53:54,877 --> 01:53:56,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Scarpelli made a good point.

1265
01:53:57,657 --> 01:53:59,138
[SPEAKER_20]: He said, it's the one-year anniversary.

1266
01:54:00,018 --> 01:54:00,938
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, one-year anniversary?

1267
01:54:00,958 --> 01:54:02,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you talking one-year anniversary or what?

1268
01:54:03,419 --> 01:54:04,099
[SPEAKER_20]: One-year anniversary.

1269
01:54:04,119 --> 01:54:05,459
[SPEAKER_20]: It's December.

1270
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:06,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Christmas hasn't happened yet.

1271
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:07,620
[SPEAKER_20]: I go, one-year anniversary or what?

1272
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:12,381
[SPEAKER_19]: He goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year?

1273
01:54:14,261 --> 01:54:16,742
[SPEAKER_19]: The two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year?

1274
01:54:17,717 --> 01:54:33,687
[SPEAKER_19]: because of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore.

1275
01:54:33,707 --> 01:54:34,288
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had enough.

1276
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:39,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we are exactly one year later.

1277
01:54:41,272 --> 01:54:42,453
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we're in a better place.

1278
01:54:44,114 --> 01:54:45,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're in a worse place.

1279
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:48,351
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're in a worse place.

1280
01:54:51,293 --> 01:54:54,756
[SPEAKER_18]: We're in a place where parents are shut out, don't have the opportunity to speak.

1281
01:54:57,538 --> 01:54:59,680
[SPEAKER_18]: We're in a place where our kids are afraid to go to school.

1282
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:03,863
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school.

1283
01:55:05,904 --> 01:55:08,346
[SPEAKER_18]: We've all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed.

1284
01:55:09,187 --> 01:55:15,772
[SPEAKER_18]: We've all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools.

1285
01:55:19,292 --> 01:55:22,094
[SPEAKER_18]: We've all seen this, it's happened in neighboring states.

1286
01:55:23,034 --> 01:55:29,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Why do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances?

1287
01:55:29,159 --> 01:55:30,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're not, we're not.

1288
01:55:32,861 --> 01:55:34,842
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school.

1289
01:55:36,303 --> 01:55:46,270
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned.

1290
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,461
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's a shame because the city is better than that.

1291
01:55:50,822 --> 01:55:51,882
[SPEAKER_18]: The city is better than that.

1292
01:55:53,483 --> 01:55:55,044
[SPEAKER_18]: And our kids deserve better than what they're getting.

1293
01:55:59,547 --> 01:56:09,412
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no accountability that shows it shows in this culture that's permeating our school system is transcending into the classroom.

1294
01:56:11,854 --> 01:56:13,555
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can all sit here and we can say, this isn't right.

1295
01:56:13,575 --> 01:56:14,215
[SPEAKER_18]: And this isn't wrong.

1296
01:56:15,336 --> 01:56:16,316
[SPEAKER_18]: but the data doesn't lie.

1297
01:56:16,677 --> 01:56:18,037
[SPEAKER_18]: The numbers don't lie.

1298
01:56:18,337 --> 01:56:19,778
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's talk about the numbers a little bit.

1299
01:56:20,998 --> 01:56:22,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's talk about the numbers.

1300
01:56:23,259 --> 01:56:38,565
[SPEAKER_18]: 42% proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate, and 184th overall.

1301
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:40,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Our kids deserve better.

1302
01:56:41,226 --> 01:56:42,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Our kids deserve better than what they're getting.

1303
01:56:43,493 --> 01:56:45,774
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't deserve to go to school afraid.

1304
01:56:46,414 --> 01:56:52,156
[SPEAKER_18]: They deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge.

1305
01:56:53,436 --> 01:57:04,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration.

1306
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:10,421
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have to take a look at it and just mention it because I think it really speaks volumes.

1307
01:57:11,361 --> 01:57:13,302
[SPEAKER_18]: If I can find it and remember how to work this thing.

1308
01:57:26,083 --> 01:57:33,267
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent.

1309
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:38,790
[SPEAKER_18]: MHS is currently in a stay-in-place due to a medical emergency.

1310
01:57:39,864 --> 01:57:42,685
[SPEAKER_18]: A student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH.

1311
01:57:42,785 --> 01:57:44,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Four students have been identified.

1312
01:57:44,866 --> 01:57:46,047
[SPEAKER_18]: The police are here working with us.

1313
01:57:46,167 --> 01:57:47,948
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working on an official communication.

1314
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:50,069
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that mean?

1315
01:57:50,769 --> 01:57:52,410
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working on an official communication.

1316
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:54,711
[SPEAKER_18]: You shouldn't have to work on facts.

1317
01:57:54,911 --> 01:57:56,112
[SPEAKER_18]: You shouldn't have to work on truth.

1318
01:57:56,732 --> 01:58:01,634
[SPEAKER_18]: You shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're going to do to prevent it from happening again.

1319
01:58:02,855 --> 01:58:05,756
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we are 60 days ago, two short months ago.

1320
01:58:08,057 --> 01:58:09,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Two short months ago, a girl was assaulted.

1321
01:58:10,387 --> 01:58:16,132
[SPEAKER_18]: terribly assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations.

1322
01:58:16,532 --> 01:58:19,174
[SPEAKER_18]: This poor girl has to go to school every day, shaking in her boots.

1323
01:58:19,675 --> 01:58:33,326
[SPEAKER_18]: If it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues, it would have gone away.

1324
01:58:33,966 --> 01:58:39,831
[SPEAKER_18]: And then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed, and then it would have gone away.

1325
01:58:41,104 --> 01:58:45,906
[SPEAKER_18]: And then 60 days later, something else would happen and we'd bring it up again and we'd start talking about it.

1326
01:58:46,806 --> 01:58:47,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get serious about it.

1327
01:58:48,166 --> 01:58:48,427
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1328
01:58:48,967 --> 01:58:49,647
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a year.

1329
01:58:50,147 --> 01:58:52,848
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough.

1330
01:58:54,008 --> 01:58:57,170
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out.

1331
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:58,130
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1332
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:01,151
[SPEAKER_18]: They had more courage than the adults in the building.

1333
01:59:07,053 --> 01:59:10,054
[SPEAKER_18]: And now they have to have more courage than the adults in the building to go to school.

1334
01:59:10,558 --> 01:59:12,419
[SPEAKER_18]: because they're scared for their safety.

1335
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:14,501
[SPEAKER_18]: This is sickening.

1336
01:59:15,402 --> 01:59:16,162
[SPEAKER_18]: This is sickening.

1337
01:59:16,783 --> 01:59:22,007
[SPEAKER_18]: And nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it.

1338
01:59:22,948 --> 01:59:24,529
[SPEAKER_18]: The way it's been handled is horrible.

1339
01:59:25,369 --> 01:59:25,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Horrible.

1340
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:27,251
[SPEAKER_18]: These aren't isolated incidents.

1341
01:59:28,092 --> 01:59:32,355
[SPEAKER_18]: A year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out.

1342
01:59:32,975 --> 01:59:35,237
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not an isolated incident.

1343
01:59:36,178 --> 01:59:40,181
[SPEAKER_18]: And the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident,

1344
01:59:41,069 --> 01:59:43,010
[SPEAKER_18]: The more isolated incidents are going to occur.

1345
01:59:45,572 --> 01:59:49,194
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth.

1346
01:59:49,694 --> 01:59:53,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, everybody wants to go to Minuteman and everybody wants to go to the charter school.

1347
01:59:53,156 --> 01:59:53,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, yeah, no kidding.

1348
01:59:54,457 --> 01:59:55,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Why wouldn't they?

1349
01:59:56,558 --> 01:59:59,900
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to sign your kid up for karate when they're five years old just to go to Medford High.

1350
02:00:04,003 --> 02:00:05,644
[SPEAKER_18]: You can pay one way or you can pay the other.

1351
02:00:07,165 --> 02:00:10,867
[SPEAKER_18]: You can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school

1352
02:00:11,374 --> 02:00:14,556
[SPEAKER_18]: where you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve.

1353
02:00:17,459 --> 02:00:20,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you can take the risks and send them to Medford High.

1354
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:22,122
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what parents are going to say to themselves.

1355
02:00:22,142 --> 02:00:26,345
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this?

1356
02:00:27,306 --> 02:00:30,508
[SPEAKER_18]: And parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it.

1357
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:35,392
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm losing faith in the Medford public school system.

1358
02:00:37,914 --> 02:00:38,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hate to say it.

1359
02:00:39,915 --> 02:00:40,616
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate to say it.

1360
02:00:41,533 --> 02:00:43,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I went to the Hervey School.

1361
02:00:44,355 --> 02:00:45,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to the Brooks School.

1362
02:00:46,676 --> 02:00:47,897
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to the Hopps School.

1363
02:00:48,357 --> 02:00:49,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to Medford High School.

1364
02:00:50,178 --> 02:00:51,859
[SPEAKER_18]: I played sports for Bud Kelly.

1365
02:00:52,139 --> 02:00:54,581
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins.

1366
02:00:55,061 --> 02:00:59,824
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community.

1367
02:01:00,805 --> 02:01:03,086
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's why I chose to seek public office.

1368
02:01:03,686 --> 02:01:09,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I sit here and I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me.

1369
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:16,863
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something.

1370
02:01:18,564 --> 02:01:22,686
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for.

1371
02:01:25,488 --> 02:01:26,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

1372
02:01:27,188 --> 02:01:30,911
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1373
02:01:31,611 --> 02:01:32,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Collins.

1374
02:01:34,493 --> 02:01:35,353
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, President Morell.

1375
02:01:36,434 --> 02:01:40,596
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, mostly right now, I want to, I know there are community members in the room, I want to hear

1376
02:01:41,169 --> 02:01:42,030
[SPEAKER_32]: from community members.

1377
02:01:43,551 --> 02:01:48,374
[SPEAKER_32]: But I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.

1378
02:01:48,394 --> 02:01:54,558
[SPEAKER_32]: It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.

1379
02:01:56,219 --> 02:01:57,640
[SPEAKER_32]: These events affect the whole community.

1380
02:01:58,801 --> 02:02:04,685
[SPEAKER_32]: As leaders, I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are the most affected, the students, the families, teachers, and staff.

1381
02:02:04,705 --> 02:02:10,189
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we can all agree, nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive

1382
02:02:11,007 --> 02:02:12,628
[SPEAKER_32]: everybody who has to be inside of them.

1383
02:02:12,648 --> 02:02:14,529
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's a really shared goal.

1384
02:02:15,529 --> 02:02:19,571
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.

1385
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:20,892
[SPEAKER_32]: They're not secure.

1386
02:02:21,072 --> 02:02:22,072
[SPEAKER_32]: They don't feel supportive.

1387
02:02:23,053 --> 02:02:27,334
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, in this conversation, you know, I want to hear from the people most affected.

1388
02:02:27,355 --> 02:02:30,316
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.

1389
02:02:31,857 --> 02:02:39,200
[SPEAKER_32]: As we mentioned, you know, many Councilors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.

1390
02:02:41,372 --> 02:02:42,512
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll get into more of that later.

1391
02:02:44,693 --> 02:02:47,375
[SPEAKER_32]: It's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.

1392
02:02:49,296 --> 02:02:57,841
[SPEAKER_32]: It's hard to put into words how to express sympathy for something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.

1393
02:02:59,161 --> 02:03:06,785
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.

1394
02:03:06,865 --> 02:03:09,487
[SPEAKER_32]: Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.

1395
02:03:10,199 --> 02:03:13,821
[SPEAKER_32]: We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.

1396
02:03:13,841 --> 02:03:17,563
[SPEAKER_32]: And I completely agree, completely agree.

1397
02:03:18,283 --> 02:03:21,324
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.

1398
02:03:22,265 --> 02:03:23,586
[SPEAKER_32]: We aren't the school committee.

1399
02:03:24,286 --> 02:03:25,266
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't be the school committee.

1400
02:03:25,887 --> 02:03:29,188
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't make the type of the decisions that the school community is empowered to make.

1401
02:03:30,029 --> 02:03:36,752
[SPEAKER_32]: We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation.

1402
02:03:37,628 --> 02:03:43,150
[SPEAKER_32]: to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.

1403
02:03:44,231 --> 02:03:46,952
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.

1404
02:03:46,992 --> 02:03:54,535
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative, that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.

1405
02:03:55,715 --> 02:04:05,660
[SPEAKER_32]: And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.

1406
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,580
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not for the faint of heart.

1407
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:13,922
[SPEAKER_32]: And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.

1408
02:04:14,543 --> 02:04:25,173
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanna restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available to any resident, to any constituent to field ideas, to hear your questions.

1409
02:04:25,213 --> 02:04:30,297
[SPEAKER_32]: If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me, we're available.

1410
02:04:33,218 --> 02:04:37,121
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.

1411
02:04:37,341 --> 02:04:37,701
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1412
02:04:38,381 --> 02:04:40,203
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1413
02:04:40,423 --> 02:04:41,123
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Bears.

1414
02:04:42,764 --> 02:04:43,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

1415
02:04:46,166 --> 02:04:47,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's happy.

1416
02:04:49,108 --> 02:04:50,889
[SPEAKER_08]: There's disagreements about this.

1417
02:04:51,650 --> 02:04:53,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's any single person.

1418
02:04:53,411 --> 02:04:58,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there is, they got to get checked out who was happy about what happened yesterday.

1419
02:05:00,233 --> 02:05:21,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everyone agrees and agreed six months ago, or two months ago, or two days ago, that there are things that need to be improved, that there are problems that need to be solved, that we're not always, and even if we had solved them, that we're not always going to get it 100% right 100% of the time.

1420
02:05:21,246 --> 02:05:21,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, how we,

1421
02:05:28,559 --> 02:05:36,304
[SPEAKER_08]: address those problems, how we build processes, how we improve systems, how we address systemic challenges is by putting forward solutions.

1422
02:05:38,125 --> 02:05:44,108
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing that we're talking about in resolutions coming later than this are some ideas around that.

1423
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:56,876
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think also it's important to look back at what we've heard from our school committee and school administration, what we've heard from

1424
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:12,629
[SPEAKER_08]: this council, when it comes to the budget and the funding of our schools, when it comes to the resources that we need, when it comes to the resources that we need in this moment, when we know, hey, there was violence at Medford High School when I was there.

1425
02:06:13,189 --> 02:06:15,091
[SPEAKER_08]: There was violence at Medford High School 30 years ago.

1426
02:06:15,931 --> 02:06:17,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can talk about certain numbers.

1427
02:06:17,732 --> 02:06:22,215
[SPEAKER_08]: The one number that hasn't been talked about any of this is actually looking at the trends and data on this issue.

1428
02:06:23,561 --> 02:06:34,388
[SPEAKER_08]: But the one thing we do know is whether it's Medford or a neighboring community or every community in Massachusetts or every community in this country is that student supports are deeply needed.

1429
02:06:34,648 --> 02:06:36,709
[SPEAKER_08]: That mental health is a serious issue.

1430
02:06:37,049 --> 02:06:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That conflict resolution and addressing problems in a peaceful manner is a huge problem.

1431
02:06:43,733 --> 02:06:49,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And that quite frankly, before these things got worse, it was a problem.

1432
02:06:49,276 --> 02:06:50,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an even worse problem now.

1433
02:06:51,318 --> 02:06:53,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Students are walking out because they recognize it.

1434
02:06:53,829 --> 02:06:57,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Students are crying out because they know that they need help or they know someone who needs help.

1435
02:06:58,572 --> 02:06:59,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a question of resources.

1436
02:07:00,993 --> 02:07:05,516
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing I thought about when I ran for office was the funding for our schools three years ago, that was before the pandemic.

1437
02:07:06,056 --> 02:07:14,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my first concern in June when we were talking about the fiscal 23 budget and the $2.8 million that got cut from our schools at the last minute.

1438
02:07:15,401 --> 02:07:22,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And two weeks ago, it was again, where I was focusing my energy and efforts in a resolution that passed this council

1439
02:07:24,369 --> 02:07:26,911
[SPEAKER_08]: about funding and asking what are the supports?

1440
02:07:26,951 --> 02:07:28,092
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the funding that's needed?

1441
02:07:29,693 --> 02:07:31,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that needs resources and funding.

1442
02:07:31,815 --> 02:07:34,457
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just talking about it for municipal vulnerability plan.

1443
02:07:34,498 --> 02:07:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: We were just talking about it.

1444
02:07:36,499 --> 02:07:44,506
[SPEAKER_08]: When we talk about this whole city, schools and city side, communications and engagement, the city doesn't invest its budgetary resources in that issue.

1445
02:07:45,026 --> 02:07:51,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have, you know, people scrambling to put something together to get it out when there's an emergency situation.

1446
02:07:52,475 --> 02:07:59,559
[SPEAKER_08]: We have in a million other situations insufficient resources for communication and engagement.

1447
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:04,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of these things, no one is happy here.

1448
02:08:05,222 --> 02:08:07,824
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all identified problems that we want to solve.

1449
02:08:08,324 --> 02:08:10,205
[SPEAKER_08]: We're starting to talk about solutions.

1450
02:08:10,966 --> 02:08:18,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The big elephant in the room solution that we don't want to zone in on is that we don't have the resources to address the scope of the problems that we have.

1451
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:22,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And until we are willing to admit that,

1452
02:08:22,734 --> 02:08:32,862
[SPEAKER_08]: and engage in a good faith discussion about what is the true scope of resources that we need to invest in our schools and in our community to address the sheer scale of the problems that we have.

1453
02:08:33,763 --> 02:08:39,267
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to unify or come together or solve these issues.

1454
02:08:40,148 --> 02:08:44,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are of a scope and scale we could not have imagined four years ago.

1455
02:08:45,212 --> 02:08:48,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the crux of this whole question.

1456
02:08:49,275 --> 02:08:51,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We come together in government

1457
02:08:51,704 --> 02:08:55,487
[SPEAKER_08]: to pool our resources to address our collective problems.

1458
02:08:55,927 --> 02:08:58,569
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what we do more than anything else.

1459
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:08,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've clearly identified a collective problem that needs resources and the resources, we are literally unable to put those resources on the table.

1460
02:09:09,538 --> 02:09:12,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I think there are things that we can do and should do.

1461
02:09:12,816 --> 02:09:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: and try to do in the short-term, medium, and long-term with what we have to better target what we have and do the best that we can do with what we have, but that's not going to be enough.

1462
02:09:27,066 --> 02:09:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: The other two things I want to talk about here are that we are once again not going to get unified and be on the same page and be able to move forward collectively unless we are moving on a single set of facts.

1463
02:09:41,903 --> 02:09:48,528
[SPEAKER_08]: about who has the authority to do what, who has the power to do what, and who sets the rules about what.

1464
02:09:49,849 --> 02:09:59,416
[SPEAKER_08]: The state and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education set a number of rules about a lot of the things that we're talking about tonight, or have talked about in previous meetings.

1465
02:10:00,457 --> 02:10:04,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The state defines the scope of the authority of the school committee and the city council.

1466
02:10:05,701 --> 02:10:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: The one place where we truly do have authority

1467
02:10:09,125 --> 02:10:12,707
[SPEAKER_08]: is on this fundamental core question of funding and the budget.

1468
02:10:13,007 --> 02:10:14,428
[SPEAKER_08]: That is where we can partner.

1469
02:10:14,828 --> 02:10:25,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that there's a resolution from Councilor Scarpelli on that question and a resolution from Councilor Collins and I on that question, because that is where we can most and best engage in this discussion.

1470
02:10:26,054 --> 02:10:31,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't say that to limit that there may be other things, but that is where our authority and power lies.

1471
02:10:32,738 --> 02:10:35,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last thing I'm going to say, people aren't going to be happy about it, you know,

1472
02:10:39,468 --> 02:10:42,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not happy about everything that everyone else has said, so I'm just going to go ahead and say it.

1473
02:10:44,011 --> 02:10:49,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what veiled accusations about national organizations are going to get us anywhere.

1474
02:10:50,516 --> 02:11:03,825
[SPEAKER_08]: When we have information that is not correct out there about why people are making decisions that they're making or what decisions have been made or the policies and rules that actually exist and are actually being followed or should be being followed,

1475
02:11:04,864 --> 02:11:13,527
[SPEAKER_08]: we're never going to get on the same enough page to move forward in a collective way and really talk about having the community and collaborative conversations that we need to have.

1476
02:11:14,667 --> 02:11:22,450
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I know that that's, that's the nicest way that I can think of to say what I really want to say here.

1477
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:29,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talk about unity, we can't then have the next sentence be something that divides.

1478
02:11:31,033 --> 02:11:34,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, again,

1479
02:11:34,895 --> 02:11:44,123
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing that we can unify around here, maybe it's not the most heartwarming thing to unify around here is that nobody is happy.

1480
02:11:44,864 --> 02:11:49,608
[SPEAKER_08]: There are problems and we need to identify and move forward on solutions to those problems.

1481
02:11:49,748 --> 02:11:58,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if we can do that and accept a single set of facts about what is truly going on, then we are laying the foundation

1482
02:11:59,284 --> 02:12:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: to have the substantive conversations and make the real actions that we need so that kids in our schools feel safe.

1483
02:12:07,086 --> 02:12:08,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it was like to not feel safe.

1484
02:12:09,647 --> 02:12:15,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I stayed home for a whole week from school because I didn't want to get on the bus because I was attacked when I was in middle school, okay?

1485
02:12:15,709 --> 02:12:20,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not even equating that to what happened on Monday or what happened to other people, right?

1486
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:23,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I experienced that in my family.

1487
02:12:24,572 --> 02:12:28,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can say that there's a monopoly on the feelings here,

1488
02:12:29,022 --> 02:12:43,848
[SPEAKER_08]: but we know what we know and we know that what we have to put forward is not sufficient at this moment to address the scope of the challenge that we face.

1489
02:12:44,408 --> 02:12:55,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the best thing that we can do is to look at the resolutions before us that are solutions focused and ask the people most affected, the students and teachers on the ground to work with

1490
02:12:55,629 --> 02:13:22,136
[SPEAKER_08]: the school committee and the mayor and the school administration and the city council to figure out what we can do in the short term to address funding and what we can do in the long term to make a systemic solution and a systemic approach to make sure that we're addressing this issue in two weeks, in two months, in two years, and in two decades, because we heard last night that there were people who felt that 30 years ago to today, things hadn't been fixed.

1491
02:13:23,188 --> 02:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I wanna say on this.

1492
02:13:24,728 --> 02:13:26,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Beyond that, I'm not gonna speak to this paper anymore.

1493
02:13:27,389 --> 02:13:32,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll speak to the solutions focused resolutions that we have next, and I'll leave it at that.

1494
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:33,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

1495
02:13:33,730 --> 02:13:33,990
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1496
02:13:34,451 --> 02:13:35,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng.

1497
02:13:35,931 --> 02:13:37,071
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information if I can.

1498
02:13:37,771 --> 02:13:38,972
[SPEAKER_28]: Point of information Councilor Scarpelli.

1499
02:13:40,452 --> 02:13:42,552
[SPEAKER_27]: The funding was there for the school system.

1500
02:13:43,573 --> 02:13:48,974
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.

1501
02:13:50,031 --> 02:13:52,973
[SPEAKER_27]: So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.

1502
02:13:53,394 --> 02:13:53,714
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1503
02:13:58,117 --> 02:13:59,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Morell.

1504
02:14:00,038 --> 02:14:07,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to thank first the teachers and the school staff and the parents who were there.

1505
02:14:09,056 --> 02:14:17,319
[SPEAKER_00]: who are helping the students through the ordeal, who themselves had to deal with emotional side of everything.

1506
02:14:18,219 --> 02:14:21,721
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important not to forget about that.

1507
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:23,641
[SPEAKER_00]: This hurts.

1508
02:14:24,182 --> 02:14:25,782
[SPEAKER_00]: This hurts emotionally.

1509
02:14:25,802 --> 02:14:29,984
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts physically.

1510
02:14:30,084 --> 02:14:31,644
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to deal with it.

1511
02:14:31,985 --> 02:14:32,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And it matters.

1512
02:14:33,165 --> 02:14:34,185
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters to all of us.

1513
02:14:34,265 --> 02:14:37,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, everyone, everyone,

1514
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:46,603
[SPEAKER_00]: in this room, everyone online on Zoom is upset, is frustrated, is saddened.

1515
02:14:48,383 --> 02:15:01,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we all feel sympathy for the experience that our students have had to deal with and continue to have to deal with at Medford High School.

1516
02:15:02,648 --> 02:15:05,269
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I am relieved to hear

1517
02:15:06,021 --> 02:15:12,887
[SPEAKER_00]: that the student is in stable condition, but that doesn't mean that everything is over.

1518
02:15:15,629 --> 02:15:23,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the talk from Councilors of all backgrounds about the importance of finding solutions.

1519
02:15:24,997 --> 02:15:35,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to that effect, I wanna thank President Morell and Vice President Bears for opening up the city council agenda to allow us to put resolutions on the agenda to have this conversation tonight.

1520
02:15:35,860 --> 02:15:45,727
[SPEAKER_00]: and to allow us to act fast and to allow us to have this conversation tonight, to have parents in the room and on Zoom.

1521
02:15:47,068 --> 02:15:53,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, school violence, and I've said this before, and it's in the news, there's tons of research out there.

1522
02:15:54,094 --> 02:15:56,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an international problem.

1523
02:15:56,395 --> 02:15:57,416
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a domestic problem.

1524
02:15:57,556 --> 02:15:58,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Medford problem.

1525
02:15:59,889 --> 02:16:02,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually means that we have to deal with it.

1526
02:16:02,691 --> 02:16:04,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have to address it here at home.

1527
02:16:05,834 --> 02:16:09,156
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, school violence has been around for a while.

1528
02:16:10,317 --> 02:16:13,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Bears has spoken to his experience.

1529
02:16:14,179 --> 02:16:16,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Medford High School just five years ago.

1530
02:16:16,121 --> 02:16:19,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like there.

1531
02:16:19,903 --> 02:16:22,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a wonderful, it's a wonderful institution to learn.

1532
02:16:23,171 --> 02:16:25,353
[SPEAKER_00]: there are, you know, blemishes on it as well.

1533
02:16:26,133 --> 02:16:38,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work, these are all issues that school leaders, teachers, students, everyone has been working together to address over the last few years.

1534
02:16:38,624 --> 02:16:41,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's evident that we need to put even more energy towards it.

1535
02:16:42,887 --> 02:16:52,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've said before as well, until our schools are safe for everyone, for all, we still have more work to do.

1536
02:16:52,984 --> 02:16:59,308
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find sustainable solutions, and that means engaging stakeholders from students to parents to teachers.

1537
02:16:59,949 --> 02:17:10,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people aren't going to like this, but the school committee who have been elected to govern our schools, to oversee our schools, and we need to engage school leaders as well.

1538
02:17:11,156 --> 02:17:16,720
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to enforce the existing policies on violence and on anti-bullying.

1539
02:17:17,521 --> 02:17:21,424
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need accountability to make sure that we're enforcing these policies.

1540
02:17:23,065 --> 02:17:41,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think through the actions that we can take to protect all kids carefully and quickly, I will add, but we need to make sure that they're equitable and reasonable and that they really truly do protect every kid in the classroom and in the hallways.

1541
02:17:43,279 --> 02:17:46,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also evidence that there's a major communications problem

1542
02:17:47,938 --> 02:18:01,677
[SPEAKER_00]: that we as a city council have been bringing up in the city, the communications problem in the city when it comes to not just in an incident like this, but just in general, getting the message out to residents.

1543
02:18:02,418 --> 02:18:05,943
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to this incident as well,

1544
02:18:07,143 --> 02:18:12,646
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know, and I think President Morell and I have written a resolution to this effect.

1545
02:18:13,986 --> 02:18:16,127
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know about the incident.

1546
02:18:16,147 --> 02:18:17,147
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know the details.

1547
02:18:17,187 --> 02:18:20,089
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know authority and rules and who has authority over what.

1548
02:18:21,289 --> 02:18:23,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to prevent misinformation from being spread.

1549
02:18:25,491 --> 02:18:35,895
[SPEAKER_00]: And school community members at yesterday's meeting have also acknowledged that as a city, we need to do better on communications and on engaging families as well.

1550
02:18:38,411 --> 02:18:41,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Bears is right, the funding problem is real.

1551
02:18:41,114 --> 02:18:53,389
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons why I decided to run for office in the first place, watching the budget conversation years ago, when we cut, we made major cuts to guidance and to mental health and counseling at our schools.

1552
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:55,431
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're seeing the effects of it.

1553
02:18:56,392 --> 02:18:59,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we need to, we need to be serious about that.

1554
02:18:59,993 --> 02:19:04,355
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be serious that about funding and to realize that there is a funding issue.

1555
02:19:05,095 --> 02:19:15,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that, that, that effect that the problem is trickling down to our hallways into our classrooms and, um,

1556
02:19:16,289 --> 02:19:27,180
[SPEAKER_00]: and that particularly after COVID and after remote learning, there has been an epidemic of poor mental health in the city and in this country.

1557
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:34,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked the city and the city council joined me in passing a resolution months ago

1558
02:19:34,987 --> 02:19:46,175
[SPEAKER_00]: asking the city to do a general survey on youth mental health and to look at the effects of that and to see what we can do to invest more in it and to prevent things like this from happening.

1559
02:19:46,975 --> 02:19:51,618
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is upsetting as a Councilor to see that we haven't done enough on it.

1560
02:19:53,159 --> 02:19:58,423
[SPEAKER_00]: This council has been responsible in doing that and we have been proactive in addressing youth mental health.

1561
02:20:00,635 --> 02:20:03,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I want us to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible.

1562
02:20:05,038 --> 02:20:08,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that everyone behind the reel would agree on.

1563
02:20:10,123 --> 02:20:14,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also do want to make sure that we are creating lasting solutions within our purview.

1564
02:20:15,567 --> 02:20:26,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not everyone will agree with my approach on this issue and my ideas, but I am open-minded to hear more ideas, to hear feedback, both positive and negative.

1565
02:20:28,193 --> 02:20:48,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand, as Councilor Collins has mentioned, that many members of our community weren't able to make it to this meeting for scheduling reasons, for family reasons, and many members of our community aren't joining us today because they're afraid to talk and talking in public is not for everyone.

1566
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:55,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And to those people, my inbox and my voicemail box and my text message inbox is also open to everyone.

1567
02:20:57,253 --> 02:21:07,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important to emphasize that regardless of the tone of this conversation, regardless of the points that people have brought up, regardless of the feedback that we're going to hear.

1568
02:21:07,383 --> 02:21:14,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people in our community, there are many, many different ways of thinking about this issue and about the solutions for this issue.

1569
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:19,434
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been evident to me in the conversations that I've had.

1570
02:21:19,912 --> 02:21:23,473
[SPEAKER_00]: with neighbors, with residents, with young folks in the last 24 hours.

1571
02:21:25,033 --> 02:21:44,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to acknowledge the differences, but to also acknowledge the points of unity that I think we see on this agenda tonight, because those points of unity, those are the seeds, I think, for more lasting, more substantive policy changes in the future that will better, I think, create a school environment for our children.

1572
02:21:44,678 --> 02:21:47,238
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1573
02:21:47,479 --> 02:21:48,139
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1574
02:21:48,699 --> 02:21:49,499
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Madam President.

1575
02:21:53,018 --> 02:22:02,141
[SPEAKER_27]: trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.

1576
02:22:03,202 --> 02:22:04,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Agree to disagree.

1577
02:22:04,702 --> 02:22:05,823
[SPEAKER_27]: We've done that many times.

1578
02:22:10,404 --> 02:22:11,345
[SPEAKER_27]: These are our children.

1579
02:22:12,525 --> 02:22:13,425
[SPEAKER_27]: They're unsafe.

1580
02:22:14,006 --> 02:22:14,886
[SPEAKER_27]: They're scared.

1581
02:22:15,906 --> 02:22:17,467
[SPEAKER_27]: Our teachers are scared.

1582
02:22:20,339 --> 02:22:26,520
[SPEAKER_27]: To talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.

1583
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:38,142
[SPEAKER_27]: The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.

1584
02:22:38,542 --> 02:22:41,343
[SPEAKER_27]: This is happening right now.

1585
02:22:43,883 --> 02:22:49,524
[SPEAKER_27]: When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.

1586
02:22:51,297 --> 02:22:59,201
[SPEAKER_27]: We see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.

1587
02:23:00,302 --> 02:23:12,769
[SPEAKER_27]: And some school committees members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.

1588
02:23:14,269 --> 02:23:15,050
[SPEAKER_27]: And as I'm seeing,

1589
02:23:16,084 --> 02:23:38,048
[SPEAKER_27]: the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.

1590
02:23:41,108 --> 02:23:45,229
[SPEAKER_27]: So these issues are concerning to the community to understand

1591
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:56,876
[SPEAKER_27]: that we need to put that away, open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.

1592
02:23:57,556 --> 02:24:03,240
[SPEAKER_27]: Not what happened five years ago, not what happened 30 years ago, what's happening today.

1593
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:06,802
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not gonna get the funding we need.

1594
02:24:06,862 --> 02:24:08,803
[SPEAKER_27]: We know that, but that's not gonna change.

1595
02:24:08,843 --> 02:24:13,646
[SPEAKER_27]: So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.

1596
02:24:14,588 --> 02:24:17,129
[SPEAKER_27]: That's just a buzzword and a check off.

1597
02:24:19,031 --> 02:24:22,192
[SPEAKER_27]: So I will tell you, we need movement now.

1598
02:24:23,653 --> 02:24:28,336
[SPEAKER_27]: We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.

1599
02:24:30,557 --> 02:24:31,798
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanna see action now.

1600
02:24:33,339 --> 02:24:36,160
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.

1601
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:40,923
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.

1602
02:24:42,591 --> 02:24:44,834
[SPEAKER_27]: So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.

1603
02:24:46,556 --> 02:24:48,418
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the next few days are going to be useless.

1604
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:51,501
[SPEAKER_27]: There's going to be no learning.

1605
02:24:53,604 --> 02:24:59,871
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to hear solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.

1606
02:25:01,132 --> 02:25:02,414
[SPEAKER_27]: Safe when they go back to school.

1607
02:25:05,185 --> 02:25:21,256
[SPEAKER_27]: So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.

1608
02:25:21,336 --> 02:25:23,138
[SPEAKER_27]: Politically, I don't care.

1609
02:25:23,158 --> 02:25:30,143
[SPEAKER_27]: Our kids are hurting and what people are seeing

1610
02:25:31,377 --> 02:25:37,862
[SPEAKER_27]: and what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.

1611
02:25:40,804 --> 02:25:45,147
[SPEAKER_27]: I was questioned that I was part of that school committee and there are legalities.

1612
02:25:46,748 --> 02:25:49,850
[SPEAKER_27]: And I understood those legalities, but you know what?

1613
02:25:50,390 --> 02:25:54,073
[SPEAKER_27]: When it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed.

1614
02:25:54,473 --> 02:25:55,714
[SPEAKER_27]: I made sure that they were safe.

1615
02:25:57,295 --> 02:26:00,958
[SPEAKER_27]: I never had this situation when I was on the school committee, thank God.

1616
02:26:03,234 --> 02:26:12,461
[SPEAKER_27]: But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.

1617
02:26:13,042 --> 02:26:17,005
[SPEAKER_27]: My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.

1618
02:26:17,445 --> 02:26:18,946
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's bring everybody together now.

1619
02:26:19,367 --> 02:26:25,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.

1620
02:26:25,071 --> 02:26:32,517
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.

1621
02:26:34,036 --> 02:26:34,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1622
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

1623
02:26:42,441 --> 02:26:43,342
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, if I may.

1624
02:26:43,602 --> 02:26:44,603
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight.

1625
02:26:44,743 --> 02:26:45,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

1626
02:26:45,403 --> 02:26:53,508
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, there's no such thing as a utopian society.

1627
02:26:55,489 --> 02:27:02,354
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue and quite frankly,

1628
02:27:03,123 --> 02:27:09,828
[SPEAKER_20]: given the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend.

1629
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:15,433
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.

1630
02:27:16,534 --> 02:27:22,258
[SPEAKER_20]: It might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.

1631
02:27:25,441 --> 02:27:28,804
[SPEAKER_20]: What this is about is reallocation.

1632
02:27:31,025 --> 02:27:31,646
[SPEAKER_20]: As of right now,

1633
02:27:32,895 --> 02:27:37,837
[SPEAKER_20]: The committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us.

1634
02:27:38,897 --> 02:27:41,338
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can jump up and down and say, we want more money, we want more money.

1635
02:27:41,398 --> 02:27:42,739
[SPEAKER_20]: We do that every week about every issue.

1636
02:27:43,799 --> 02:27:58,565
[SPEAKER_20]: But ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue.

1637
02:27:58,605 --> 02:27:59,846
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's the plan and what are you going to do?

1638
02:28:01,141 --> 02:28:06,565
[SPEAKER_20]: And why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do?

1639
02:28:07,405 --> 02:28:10,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Quite frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation.

1640
02:28:11,768 --> 02:28:14,910
[SPEAKER_20]: Blanket, sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation.

1641
02:28:15,691 --> 02:28:20,814
[SPEAKER_20]: In the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us.

1642
02:28:21,674 --> 02:28:23,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a year has gone by and we haven't showed that.

1643
02:28:27,938 --> 02:28:49,404
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I'm certainly someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools.

1644
02:28:50,285 --> 02:28:54,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Reversing some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start.

1645
02:28:58,473 --> 02:29:03,274
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough.

1646
02:29:03,634 --> 02:29:04,354
[SPEAKER_20]: How much is enough?

1647
02:29:05,234 --> 02:29:06,194
[SPEAKER_20]: There's never going to be enough.

1648
02:29:06,815 --> 02:29:08,875
[SPEAKER_20]: There's never, we're never going to reach a point where you say, Oh, we're cool.

1649
02:29:09,175 --> 02:29:09,655
[SPEAKER_20]: This is good.

1650
02:29:09,875 --> 02:29:11,735
[SPEAKER_20]: This is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do.

1651
02:29:12,396 --> 02:29:12,636
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1652
02:29:12,736 --> 02:29:13,436
[SPEAKER_20]: That doesn't happen.

1653
02:29:14,556 --> 02:29:15,296
[SPEAKER_20]: That doesn't happen.

1654
02:29:15,376 --> 02:29:18,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year.

1655
02:29:18,657 --> 02:29:19,677
[SPEAKER_20]: That's just not the way it works.

1656
02:29:20,537 --> 02:29:24,738
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money?

1657
02:29:24,758 --> 02:29:25,498
[SPEAKER_20]: And is this a good plan?

1658
02:29:26,257 --> 02:29:27,958
[SPEAKER_20]: Because throwing money at issues doesn't do anything.

1659
02:29:27,978 --> 02:29:30,299
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place.

1660
02:29:30,659 --> 02:29:33,781
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place.

1661
02:29:34,581 --> 02:29:36,482
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan.

1662
02:29:36,763 --> 02:29:40,885
[SPEAKER_20]: And then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have?

1663
02:29:41,445 --> 02:29:48,509
[SPEAKER_20]: Because quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up to just anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's we don't have any money.

1664
02:29:48,889 --> 02:29:49,849
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have any money to do it.

1665
02:29:49,869 --> 02:29:50,810
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have any money to do it.

1666
02:29:52,011 --> 02:29:52,251
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1667
02:29:52,311 --> 02:29:54,172
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, if you don't have any money to do it, it needs to get done.

1668
02:29:54,212 --> 02:29:55,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Then what's the next thing you got to do?

1669
02:29:55,632 --> 02:29:56,812
[SPEAKER_20]: You got to reallocate.

1670
02:29:56,832 --> 02:29:59,373
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks.

1671
02:29:59,473 --> 02:30:00,753
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I mean?

1672
02:30:00,874 --> 02:30:03,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Bella check at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game.

1673
02:30:04,294 --> 02:30:06,455
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not changing the game plan at halftime.

1674
02:30:06,635 --> 02:30:16,578
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.

1675
02:30:19,602 --> 02:30:21,322
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Vice President Farris, then Councilor Collins.

1676
02:30:21,462 --> 02:30:21,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be short.

1677
02:30:22,303 --> 02:30:23,003
[SPEAKER_08]: The game is rigged.

1678
02:30:24,623 --> 02:30:34,765
[SPEAKER_08]: We can try to change our game plan as much as we want, but when we're talking about city departments and city budgets that in real inflation adjusted dollar terms have less money now than they did in 1980, the game is rigged.

1679
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:37,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the first thing.

1680
02:30:37,225 --> 02:30:45,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not disputing that there are things we could do immediately to bring people together and try to find solutions.

1681
02:30:45,107 --> 02:30:46,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's exactly what we have on here tonight.

1682
02:30:47,622 --> 02:30:51,663
[SPEAKER_08]: There are things we could do with short money that could make a big impact and make people feel safer.

1683
02:30:51,683 --> 02:30:52,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's what we're asking for.

1684
02:30:53,523 --> 02:31:17,068
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the idea that we can fix this whole problem or that the notion of putting more resources, this is just throwing money at the problem, that we can address a problem that has been persistent, that is growing in scale, that is not just unique to Medford, even though we could do what we can in Medford to find unique solutions with what we have through reallocation and additional resources, it's promising something that's unachievable.

1685
02:31:17,958 --> 02:31:23,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So I agree, let's do what we can now with short money or no money at all to make people feel safer in the schools.

1686
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:25,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely understand and respect that.

1687
02:31:26,300 --> 02:31:27,460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we have to do that.

1688
02:31:28,161 --> 02:31:42,404
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we're not, again, if we're not thinking about this in a bigger terms of, you know, when we talk about resources, yeah, make people feel safer, I would bet to have some additional resources around the hallways and the bathrooms, because that's clearly been a problem.

1689
02:31:42,444 --> 02:31:45,025
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a problem that came up before what happened yesterday.

1690
02:31:45,675 --> 02:31:47,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously it was a problem yesterday.

1691
02:31:47,076 --> 02:31:48,738
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that'll make people feel safer.

1692
02:31:49,118 --> 02:31:51,400
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can figure out ways to target resources to do that.

1693
02:31:52,661 --> 02:32:14,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talk about students' mental health and the mental health crisis and the fact that we need dozens of more Councilors at our school, or we need to bring back maybe an assistant principal at the high school, or we have to look at the funding cuts that were made in 2020 or 2023, those are big ticket items that, you know, if we just want to say we'll never get there, then,

1694
02:32:15,905 --> 02:32:24,952
[SPEAKER_08]: All we're going to do is the short money things that make people feel a little bit safer until they don't work anymore or until more kids are facing issues with mental health and conflict resolution.

1695
02:32:25,633 --> 02:32:28,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to stop there because I don't think it's mutually exclusive.

1696
02:32:29,075 --> 02:32:31,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying we can only do one piece of it and not the other.

1697
02:32:31,517 --> 02:32:42,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think anyone else is saying the other way around, but if we don't have that conversation and admit that we're not going to be operating on a set of facts and

1698
02:32:44,235 --> 02:32:52,077
[SPEAKER_08]: under the urgency that we need to be operating under to bring the solutions to bear that we obviously all agree need to be brought to bear.

1699
02:32:52,957 --> 02:32:53,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1700
02:32:53,478 --> 02:32:54,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Collins.

1701
02:32:55,618 --> 02:32:56,498
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, President Morell.

1702
02:32:56,518 --> 02:32:58,799
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm speaking off the cuff here.

1703
02:32:58,819 --> 02:33:13,323
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just want to say, you know, I think that what the community deserves today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events, what the community deserves is

1704
02:33:14,111 --> 02:33:19,476
[SPEAKER_32]: a communicative, collaborative city council.

1705
02:33:19,876 --> 02:33:26,823
[SPEAKER_32]: They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.

1706
02:33:27,843 --> 02:33:29,665
[SPEAKER_32]: We owe our community better than infighting.

1707
02:33:30,386 --> 02:33:33,689
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before.

1708
02:33:34,389 --> 02:33:36,912
[SPEAKER_32]: Behind this rail, it'll happen again.

1709
02:33:37,292 --> 02:33:38,373
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what we're here to do.

1710
02:33:39,332 --> 02:33:42,953
[SPEAKER_32]: We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.

1711
02:33:42,973 --> 02:33:49,874
[SPEAKER_32]: We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to, how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.

1712
02:33:51,094 --> 02:34:05,638
[SPEAKER_32]: But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers to try to deal with the problems before us.

1713
02:34:06,478 --> 02:34:07,638
[SPEAKER_32]: I, you know,

1714
02:34:08,973 --> 02:34:25,097
[SPEAKER_32]: What, what looks like a buzzword to one Councilor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.

1715
02:34:25,717 --> 02:34:26,898
[SPEAKER_32]: It's put forth in good faith.

1716
02:34:27,018 --> 02:34:28,338
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that tracks both ways.

1717
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:31,199
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think it's productive for us to launch into

1718
02:34:34,321 --> 02:34:35,362
[SPEAKER_32]: veiled personal attacks.

1719
02:34:35,682 --> 02:34:38,964
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I don't want, I don't want that to be what tonight is.

1720
02:34:39,184 --> 02:34:40,525
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that we have to come together.

1721
02:34:40,846 --> 02:34:43,047
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.

1722
02:34:43,367 --> 02:34:49,312
[SPEAKER_32]: We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.

1723
02:34:50,372 --> 02:35:00,619
[SPEAKER_32]: It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.

1724
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:02,681
[SPEAKER_32]: The community deserves better than a performance.

1725
02:35:03,223 --> 02:35:06,624
[SPEAKER_32]: we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.

1726
02:35:07,105 --> 02:35:11,266
[SPEAKER_32]: And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.

1727
02:35:11,666 --> 02:35:17,649
[SPEAKER_32]: So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.

1728
02:35:17,669 --> 02:35:19,810
[SPEAKER_32]: I know those feelings aren't universally shared.

1729
02:35:19,850 --> 02:35:24,492
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain

1730
02:35:25,708 --> 02:35:33,098
[SPEAKER_32]: clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.

1731
02:35:33,399 --> 02:35:33,699
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

1732
02:35:33,719 --> 02:35:35,802
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1733
02:35:35,902 --> 02:35:39,647
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do believe the intent of the resolution is to open it up for public participation.

1734
02:35:39,667 --> 02:35:42,591
[SPEAKER_28]: So I want to see if there's any further discussion from the Council, but I want to make sure.

1735
02:35:43,226 --> 02:35:44,727
[SPEAKER_28]: we move forward to that.

1736
02:35:44,807 --> 02:35:49,790
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, I just want to just briefly, Councilor Scarpelli, I absolutely hear your calls for unity.

1737
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:51,090
[SPEAKER_28]: I hear everyone's calls for unity.

1738
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:57,574
[SPEAKER_28]: And I believe that the council is absolutely unified and that no one wanted yesterday to happen.

1739
02:35:58,094 --> 02:36:00,476
[SPEAKER_28]: No one wanted the incident two months ago to happen.

1740
02:36:00,556 --> 02:36:04,098
[SPEAKER_28]: No one wanted any student to get hurt in our schools ever.

1741
02:36:04,978 --> 02:36:05,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Schools should be a refuge.

1742
02:36:06,239 --> 02:36:11,822
[SPEAKER_28]: We talk about a lot of these issues go beyond the schools, that a lot of these issues start at home because of course they do.

1743
02:36:12,332 --> 02:36:16,873
[SPEAKER_28]: but every student deserves the opportunity to go to school and feel safe.

1744
02:36:16,993 --> 02:36:22,715
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know every member of this council, every person in the chambers, every person on Zoom, I know they feel that.

1745
02:36:23,495 --> 02:36:37,439
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope that we can continue to have this talk and come to solutions so that students can feel safe, so that parents can feel comfortable sending their kids to school, and so that teachers can have the space to do their jobs and do what they do best.

1746
02:36:38,632 --> 02:36:40,474
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to open it up to public participation.

1747
02:36:41,134 --> 02:36:45,397
[SPEAKER_28]: Before we go to that, I do just want to note public participation is just that, it is to hear from the public.

1748
02:36:45,598 --> 02:36:46,719
[SPEAKER_28]: It is not meant to be a debate.

1749
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:50,762
[SPEAKER_28]: No personal attacks will be permitted.

1750
02:36:50,782 --> 02:36:55,666
[SPEAKER_28]: I will gavel them and no speculation that will further endanger students will be allowed either.

1751
02:36:56,446 --> 02:36:57,547
[SPEAKER_28]: So opening it up.

1752
02:37:03,512 --> 02:37:06,334
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing Madam Superintendent and Member McLaughlin.

1753
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:10,741
[SPEAKER_30]: Madam President and council members.

1754
02:37:12,181 --> 02:37:14,682
[SPEAKER_30]: I am Marisa Edward-Vincent, Superintendent of Schools.

1755
02:37:14,862 --> 02:37:30,227
[SPEAKER_30]: I am here this evening to first represent the district and to say that the incident that took place yesterday is not something that we want to see repeated ever again in the Medford Public Schools.

1756
02:37:30,768 --> 02:37:37,690
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't endorse or support any kind of weapons coming into the school that is not the Medford Public Schools

1757
02:37:38,063 --> 02:37:39,284
[SPEAKER_30]: that I am here representing.

1758
02:37:39,685 --> 02:37:43,308
[SPEAKER_30]: So what happened yesterday was a terrible, terrible incident.

1759
02:37:44,049 --> 02:37:53,359
[SPEAKER_30]: It was not something that we knew was going to happen in advance and working with communications to get that message out and trying to keep the entire community safe.

1760
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:56,382
[SPEAKER_30]: Working collaboratively with the police, we had

1761
02:37:56,977 --> 02:38:02,498
[SPEAKER_30]: many, many police officers on campus yesterday, and there was a lot of investigating happening.

1762
02:38:02,518 --> 02:38:10,320
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a lot of information that as things were unfolding, we had to wait for more information to become available.

1763
02:38:10,861 --> 02:38:20,303
[SPEAKER_30]: So I know that we had two medical emergencies yesterday, one earlier in the morning, which was a separate event, and then the second event that took place.

1764
02:38:21,763 --> 02:38:24,764
[SPEAKER_30]: And that incident and all students that were involved

1765
02:38:25,239 --> 02:38:26,840
[SPEAKER_30]: a significant number of students.

1766
02:38:28,060 --> 02:38:33,483
[SPEAKER_30]: Again, looking at the video cameras and figuring out how many people were actually involved.

1767
02:38:33,603 --> 02:38:34,804
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a significant number.

1768
02:38:35,464 --> 02:38:37,665
[SPEAKER_30]: We had plenty of police support today.

1769
02:38:38,085 --> 02:38:40,446
[SPEAKER_30]: We also had fire support in the schools.

1770
02:38:41,227 --> 02:38:48,130
[SPEAKER_30]: Our fire personnel, additional administrators were at the high school, teachers, staff, everyone.

1771
02:38:48,150 --> 02:38:52,232
[SPEAKER_30]: It was all hands on deck working together to keep the community safe.

1772
02:38:52,850 --> 02:38:55,251
[SPEAKER_30]: We did have a higher absentee rate.

1773
02:38:55,671 --> 02:38:59,471
[SPEAKER_30]: It wasn't 400 students, but we were in the high 200s today.

1774
02:39:00,112 --> 02:39:04,533
[SPEAKER_30]: Normally we hover around 10% in terms of absence.

1775
02:39:06,173 --> 02:39:15,295
[SPEAKER_30]: I am here today to just say that we are doing everything that we can do to address the situation that happened based on the students that are involved.

1776
02:39:15,895 --> 02:39:19,196
[SPEAKER_30]: And because of the nature of yesterday's incident,

1777
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:28,826
[SPEAKER_30]: The police again are continuing their investigation at MPD and we are working collaboratively because it is an ongoing investigation.

1778
02:39:29,367 --> 02:39:34,490
[SPEAKER_30]: And again, it was a significant number of students that were involved, others that were just bystanders.

1779
02:39:35,071 --> 02:39:44,598
[SPEAKER_30]: And so that's the reason why there's been limited information because it's still an active, very active situation.

1780
02:39:45,699 --> 02:39:48,581
[SPEAKER_30]: I do also want to report that we did have the opportunity

1781
02:39:49,548 --> 02:39:55,211
[SPEAKER_30]: speak with the family today and with the student on campus.

1782
02:39:55,791 --> 02:40:04,595
[SPEAKER_30]: And we are continuing to pray for his speedy recovery, but we are in communication and we are working collaboratively with the family as well.

1783
02:40:08,657 --> 02:40:10,257
[SPEAKER_34]: May I?

1784
02:40:10,437 --> 02:40:14,139
[SPEAKER_20]: My understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student.

1785
02:40:14,159 --> 02:40:15,460
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my understanding.

1786
02:40:16,593 --> 02:40:20,596
[SPEAKER_30]: It is a vocational student in one of our programs.

1787
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:25,619
[SPEAKER_20]: And do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident?

1788
02:40:26,180 --> 02:40:34,686
[SPEAKER_20]: What was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?

1789
02:40:34,986 --> 02:40:43,892
[SPEAKER_30]: So again, that action was surprising to everyone based on some of what's been shown on some of the video footage.

1790
02:40:44,853 --> 02:40:45,994
[SPEAKER_30]: We're not sure.

1791
02:40:47,321 --> 02:40:51,962
[SPEAKER_30]: There were comments about other interactions happening at other times.

1792
02:40:52,602 --> 02:41:03,144
[SPEAKER_30]: Since it is an active investigation, I have to be, I'm not able to say too much, but what I can say is it's an active investigation.

1793
02:41:03,164 --> 02:41:14,966
[SPEAKER_30]: The police are deeply involved and any situation involving weapons, which are not allowed in schools, discipline is being meted out.

1794
02:41:15,433 --> 02:41:19,716
[SPEAKER_30]: according to what is said in the law regarding any kind of weapon.

1795
02:41:20,137 --> 02:41:23,379
[SPEAKER_30]: So I do want to say that it's not being taken lightly.

1796
02:41:23,579 --> 02:41:25,581
[SPEAKER_30]: It's being addressed appropriately.

1797
02:41:25,961 --> 02:41:41,933
[SPEAKER_30]: And because of FERPA, we just, I still need to be careful with what is said publicly on the floor, but what I can assure this body and the community that is listening is that it is being addressed and we are making sure that we have all of the individuals

1798
02:41:42,523 --> 02:41:45,506
[SPEAKER_30]: that were involved or were bystanders.

1799
02:41:47,788 --> 02:41:48,869
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1800
02:41:48,989 --> 02:41:52,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Could the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school?

1801
02:41:53,513 --> 02:41:54,614
[SPEAKER_20]: Not according to the law.

1802
02:41:55,836 --> 02:41:58,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?

1803
02:41:58,378 --> 02:41:59,479
[SPEAKER_30]: We are following the law, yes.

1804
02:41:59,859 --> 02:42:02,842
[SPEAKER_30]: Any kind of weapon that's- You're going to expel the kid, he's gone.

1805
02:42:02,982 --> 02:42:03,883
[SPEAKER_30]: We follow the law.

1806
02:42:04,023 --> 02:42:04,304
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1807
02:42:04,324 --> 02:42:06,025
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm asking if the kid's getting expelled.

1808
02:42:07,627 --> 02:42:07,827
[SPEAKER_34]: May I?

1809
02:42:09,163 --> 02:42:10,284
[SPEAKER_34]: So thank you.

1810
02:42:10,564 --> 02:42:12,045
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm Melanie McLaughlin.

1811
02:42:12,085 --> 02:42:12,965
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a school committee member.

1812
02:42:13,005 --> 02:42:18,788
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm also a parent of three, two Medford high school graduates, one current Medford public school student.

1813
02:42:19,409 --> 02:42:32,216
[SPEAKER_34]: I've lived in Medford for 23 years and I'm here tonight specifically because I want to support the superintendent in her role and because I want to support the school committee and the parents and families and students in the city.

1814
02:42:33,036 --> 02:42:36,578
[SPEAKER_34]: We're all heartbroken about what has happened to our children.

1815
02:42:37,051 --> 02:42:40,473
[SPEAKER_34]: over the past few months, but it has not been just the past few months.

1816
02:42:40,553 --> 02:42:43,734
[SPEAKER_34]: And there are plenty of people in the community that know that and that understand that.

1817
02:42:44,134 --> 02:42:44,975
[SPEAKER_34]: It has been years.

1818
02:42:45,475 --> 02:42:46,636
[SPEAKER_34]: We've had a bullying problem.

1819
02:42:46,696 --> 02:42:48,296
[SPEAKER_34]: Most high schools have bullying problems.

1820
02:42:48,336 --> 02:42:49,997
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a rise in violence.

1821
02:42:50,397 --> 02:42:51,118
[SPEAKER_34]: It's national.

1822
02:42:51,158 --> 02:42:52,438
[SPEAKER_34]: You can see it all over the country.

1823
02:42:52,939 --> 02:43:02,603
[SPEAKER_34]: It is happening particularly because of pandemic, but also because of the politicized nature of the hatred that exists in communities between polarized sides.

1824
02:43:03,003 --> 02:43:06,085
[SPEAKER_34]: And our children are often mimicking what they're seeing their adults do.

1825
02:43:06,567 --> 02:43:17,873
[SPEAKER_34]: And what I think is really important is what we've heard from city council members who are talking about finding solutions to work together, to collaborate, to change systems for all of our children, not some of our children, all of our children.

1826
02:43:18,173 --> 02:43:18,973
[SPEAKER_34]: This has been ongoing.

1827
02:43:19,013 --> 02:43:29,479
[SPEAKER_34]: We're talking about not just the past four years of this administration, meaning this particular superintendent, this has been an ongoing problem from when other people were on school committee, from when people have been around for some time.

1828
02:43:29,519 --> 02:43:35,742
[SPEAKER_34]: I wanna clarify for the community and for city councilors, I'm not afraid of being yelled at,

1829
02:43:36,311 --> 02:43:37,211
[SPEAKER_34]: I just don't like it.

1830
02:43:37,571 --> 02:43:39,712
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's inappropriate and unprofessional.

1831
02:43:40,352 --> 02:43:49,416
[SPEAKER_34]: And when we talk about bullying in our community, I have never seen more of an example of bullying in our community than I see in the city council chambers every single week.

1832
02:43:49,996 --> 02:43:53,557
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think that everybody in the community would agree with that.

1833
02:43:54,298 --> 02:43:57,058
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information. There's a difference between bullying and passion.

1834
02:43:57,459 --> 02:43:58,319
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's what you lack, madam. You lack passion.

1835
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:04,031
[SPEAKER_34]: Ok Mr. Scarpelli. I think we both know each other well, George.

1836
02:44:04,051 --> 02:44:04,911
[SPEAKER_34]: We're all neighbors here.

1837
02:44:04,951 --> 02:44:06,211
[SPEAKER_34]: We all know each other.

1838
02:44:06,311 --> 02:44:07,132
[SPEAKER_34]: We all know each other.

1839
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:08,912
[SPEAKER_34]: Our children play together.

1840
02:44:19,017 --> 02:44:22,439
[SPEAKER_34]: So the ongoing bullying is inappropriate and is what our children are seeing.

1841
02:44:22,799 --> 02:44:24,720
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's what I would like to specifically point out.

1842
02:44:25,081 --> 02:44:30,583
[SPEAKER_34]: We wanna figure out how to work, should collaborate together to change outcomes for all children.

1843
02:44:30,964 --> 02:44:35,706
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm not gonna be shamed, I'm not gonna be blamed and I'm not gonna be named and neither should any of us.

1844
02:44:36,146 --> 02:44:42,530
[SPEAKER_34]: And I would ask that our city council members across the board and that our community across the board stand up to bullies everywhere.

1845
02:44:43,170 --> 02:44:46,272
[SPEAKER_34]: And we make sure that this stops in our community and in our schools.

1846
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,071
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm here to do that.

1847
02:44:48,151 --> 02:44:50,372
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm here to roll up my sleeves and help make sure that that happens.

1848
02:44:50,692 --> 02:44:52,253
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think we all should be doing that.

1849
02:44:53,314 --> 02:44:53,554
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1849
02:44:53,554 --> 02:44:56,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Point of information, Madam president. 

1849
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,000
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1849
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:10,000
[SPEAKER_27]: Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened. Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior? 

1846
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
[SPEAKER_34]: Uh huh.

1849
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
[SPEAKER_27]: I asked the Superintendent

1852
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:14,000
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, obviously.

1850
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:27,191
[SPEAKER_27]: Was that addressed today? Did you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?

1851
02:45:27,671 --> 02:45:29,231
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you address that today?

1852
02:45:30,611 --> 02:45:44,215
[SPEAKER_30]: That specific, um, comment that was made yesterday, it's still being under investigation and there's another, uh, there are other things that have come forward, which are also being fully investigated.

1853
02:45:47,366 --> 02:45:47,826
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1854
02:45:50,607 --> 02:45:50,907
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1855
02:45:51,988 --> 02:45:54,909
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1856
02:45:55,749 --> 02:45:56,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Caraviello.

1857
02:45:57,009 --> 02:45:59,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Superintendent, I have a question.

1858
02:46:00,971 --> 02:46:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm a little concerned about what I'm seeing now is these are looking like staged events.

1859
02:46:06,632 --> 02:46:09,974
[SPEAKER_05]: These are kids standing there waiting for this to happen.

1860
02:46:10,694 --> 02:46:12,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And that upsets me most.

1861
02:46:13,395 --> 02:46:16,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I saw the video, this one, another one says,

1862
02:46:17,995 --> 02:46:23,819
[SPEAKER_05]: and kids are standing there with the cameras, like this is a TV show production waiting to happen.

1863
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:24,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's got a camera.

1864
02:46:25,501 --> 02:46:28,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't those kids being suspended too?

1865
02:46:28,403 --> 02:46:34,788
[SPEAKER_30]: Councilor Caraviello, I agree exactly with what you're saying right now.

1866
02:46:34,828 --> 02:46:44,636
[SPEAKER_30]: The professional videographers, events that are taking place where it appears to be staged, we are having very similar conversations with the police.

1867
02:46:45,496 --> 02:46:47,718
[SPEAKER_30]: All of the individuals that were involved

1868
02:46:48,439 --> 02:46:56,203
[SPEAKER_30]: in yesterday's event, based on what we could see from the video footage, they are all being addressed, including the bystanders.

1869
02:46:58,324 --> 02:47:04,847
[SPEAKER_30]: So all of the individuals that we've been able to identify, discipline is being meted out.

1870
02:47:06,468 --> 02:47:09,370
[SPEAKER_30]: Discipline is being meted out at the district level.

1871
02:47:10,010 --> 02:47:14,912
[SPEAKER_30]: So again, students videotaping it, students that are just watching their bystanders.

1872
02:47:18,757 --> 02:47:20,518
[SPEAKER_05]: at our TV station at the high school.

1873
02:47:21,178 --> 02:47:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, I mean, the challenges that we're facing.

1874
02:47:23,339 --> 02:47:24,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Not saying they're waiting for fights to happen.

1875
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:27,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That really upsets me when I see that.

1876
02:47:27,701 --> 02:47:34,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that's your fault, but that upsets me when there's a whole bunch of kids waiting, because they all knew that this was going to happen.

1877
02:47:36,144 --> 02:47:37,965
[SPEAKER_34]: The social media piece of it is really upsetting.

1878
02:47:42,347 --> 02:47:44,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Another challenge that didn't exist 12 years ago.

1879
02:47:47,719 --> 02:47:49,420
[SPEAKER_30]: Social media is a challenge.

1880
02:47:49,921 --> 02:47:51,562
[SPEAKER_30]: Social media is truly a challenge.

1881
02:47:51,642 --> 02:48:01,809
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a huge challenge, especially for bullying, especially for videos being distributed, for videos being given to the news media, for information being shared, for people politicizing situation is terrible.

1882
02:48:02,310 --> 02:48:05,272
[SPEAKER_34]: And the children are the social media piece of it.

1883
02:48:05,532 --> 02:48:10,175
[SPEAKER_34]: The bullying element on social media is compounded exponentially.

1884
02:48:10,515 --> 02:48:15,279
[SPEAKER_34]: So when we talk about resources that we need, we need resources to help support our children's mental health.

1885
02:48:15,339 --> 02:48:16,840
[SPEAKER_34]: It is a mental health crisis right now.

1886
02:48:17,287 --> 02:48:19,288
[SPEAKER_34]: because of what people are dealing with on the daily.

1887
02:48:22,350 --> 02:48:26,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Was there a drug overdose?

1888
02:48:26,914 --> 02:48:30,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that what the drug overdose?

1889
02:48:31,697 --> 02:48:38,562
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't, I just know that there was a medical emergency earlier in the day, I was not told that there was a drug overdose.

1890
02:48:40,683 --> 02:48:43,305
[SPEAKER_18]: And you did say that the police and the fire department were there today?

1891
02:48:43,805 --> 02:48:45,546
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, providing additional support.

1892
02:48:45,746 --> 02:48:46,647
[SPEAKER_18]: What kind of support?

1893
02:48:47,601 --> 02:48:49,122
[SPEAKER_30]: They were supporting in the hallways.

1894
02:48:49,182 --> 02:48:59,228
[SPEAKER_30]: They were just available and also conducting the investigation as additional students' names became available that did not appear on some of the videos.

1895
02:48:59,888 --> 02:49:05,011
[SPEAKER_30]: So they've been providing additional support in conducting their official investigation.

1896
02:49:05,211 --> 02:49:06,612
[SPEAKER_18]: So they weren't there in a security capacity?

1897
02:49:09,734 --> 02:49:10,554
[SPEAKER_30]: I would say both.

1898
02:49:10,875 --> 02:49:12,015
[SPEAKER_30]: They were present.

1899
02:49:12,095 --> 02:49:16,498
[SPEAKER_30]: They were present in hallways, but they were also conducting the investigation.

1900
02:49:20,427 --> 02:49:22,930
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, we probably had maybe six.

1901
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:26,033
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe there were six police officers there providing support.

1902
02:49:26,914 --> 02:49:28,695
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not sure of the final number today.

1903
02:49:29,636 --> 02:49:34,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools.

1904
02:49:35,883 --> 02:49:43,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Most high schools on the news every day, though, ours is. Ours is on the news every day, surrounding communities on the news every day.

1905
02:49:43,908 --> 02:49:44,148
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1906
02:49:44,388 --> 02:49:47,289
[SPEAKER_20]: And don't make this about the Medford City Council gets passionate about issues.

1907
02:49:47,329 --> 02:49:49,889
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school, because that's nonsense.

1908
02:49:49,949 --> 02:49:50,209
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1909
02:49:50,229 --> 02:49:51,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we don't make the policies up there.

1910
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:52,110
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1911
02:49:52,330 --> 02:49:53,150
[SPEAKER_20]: The school committee does.

1912
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:54,430
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the ones that set the policies.

1913
02:49:54,790 --> 02:49:55,911
[SPEAKER_20]: They're the ones that are responsible.

1914
02:49:55,951 --> 02:49:59,231
[SPEAKER_30]: But nobody is making policies for students to get injured.

1915
02:50:00,431 --> 02:50:03,532
[SPEAKER_30]: So there were bigger issues that need to be addressed.

1916
02:50:03,552 --> 02:50:05,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are the 12 kids hanging out in the bathroom?

1917
02:50:05,413 --> 02:50:06,553
[SPEAKER_34]: Can I, may I please?

1918
02:50:07,933 --> 02:50:08,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

1919
02:50:09,233 --> 02:50:10,634
[SPEAKER_34]: So this is what we're talking about.

1920
02:50:10,694 --> 02:50:11,734
[SPEAKER_34]: This is the barraging.

1921
02:50:11,794 --> 02:50:12,434
[SPEAKER_34]: This is the sort of,

1922
02:50:12,779 --> 02:50:15,201
[SPEAKER_34]: you know, back and forth with people trying to intimidate people.

1923
02:50:15,241 --> 02:50:16,021
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's really important.

1924
02:50:16,061 --> 02:50:18,643
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said.

1925
02:50:18,763 --> 02:50:19,544
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have the floor.

1926
02:50:19,904 --> 02:50:22,005
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have a point of information because you're not a Councilor.

1927
02:50:22,165 --> 02:50:24,307
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me know when you're finished.

1928
02:50:24,727 --> 02:50:27,269
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous.

1929
02:50:28,049 --> 02:50:28,710
[SPEAKER_20]: This is ridiculous.

1930
02:50:28,730 --> 02:50:32,172
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school?

1931
02:50:32,472 --> 02:50:34,153
[SPEAKER_20]: How are they going to be safer than they were yesterday?

1932
02:50:36,655 --> 02:50:39,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's answer that question, because that's really what the people care about.

1933
02:50:39,237 --> 02:50:41,218
[SPEAKER_34]: May I?

1934
02:50:42,950 --> 02:50:49,093
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, for one moment, if you don't mind, Superintendent, is that okay?

1935
02:50:49,173 --> 02:50:50,454
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not answering your question.

1936
02:50:50,494 --> 02:50:51,975
[SPEAKER_34]: May I, through the chair?

1937
02:50:53,115 --> 02:50:53,275
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1938
02:50:53,435 --> 02:50:53,816
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1939
02:50:54,316 --> 02:51:08,543
[SPEAKER_34]: So I just wanted to say that to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins remarks earlier about people who are intimidated to come up to this podium and who are not able to speak for a number of reasons publicly.

1940
02:51:09,008 --> 02:51:14,532
[SPEAKER_34]: to please feel free to reach out for solution oriented options, because we are willing and open to listen to community members.

1941
02:51:14,552 --> 02:51:15,673
[SPEAKER_34]: This is a community problem.

1942
02:51:16,033 --> 02:51:17,954
[SPEAKER_34]: This is not seven people that are gonna solve a problem.

1943
02:51:17,995 --> 02:51:19,536
[SPEAKER_34]: It's not one person that's gonna solve a problem.

1944
02:51:19,896 --> 02:51:23,499
[SPEAKER_34]: This is a community systemic problem, and it's a national problem.

1945
02:51:23,579 --> 02:51:25,100
[SPEAKER_34]: And we need all hands working together.

1946
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:26,821
[SPEAKER_34]: We don't need people yelling at people.

1947
02:51:26,861 --> 02:51:28,042
[SPEAKER_34]: We need people collaborating.

1948
02:51:28,602 --> 02:51:29,203
[SPEAKER_34]: And I don't know.

1949
02:51:29,303 --> 02:51:32,045
[SPEAKER_20]: And to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.

1950
02:51:33,566 --> 02:51:37,869
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to respond to your comment, Councilor Knight, regarding

1951
02:51:38,587 --> 02:51:39,788
[SPEAKER_30]: what is the high school doing?

1952
02:51:40,008 --> 02:51:42,990
[SPEAKER_30]: We have additional social emotional supports at the school.

1953
02:51:43,530 --> 02:51:46,512
[SPEAKER_30]: We had outside support available as well at the school.

1954
02:51:46,952 --> 02:51:55,217
[SPEAKER_30]: We had additional police presence and we redeployed several of our administrators who were also present at the high school today.

1955
02:51:55,718 --> 02:52:05,904
[SPEAKER_30]: So there was an abundance of administrators, staff, police presence, fire presence, additional Councilors.

1956
02:52:06,084 --> 02:52:07,705
[SPEAKER_30]: We were all hands on deck.

1957
02:52:08,197 --> 02:52:12,601
[SPEAKER_30]: working collaboratively to keep everything running smoothly at the high school today.

1958
02:52:12,741 --> 02:52:15,363
[SPEAKER_30]: And we had a very quiet day today.

1959
02:52:17,645 --> 02:52:18,506
[SPEAKER_20]: But I just have a question.

1960
02:52:18,566 --> 02:52:24,711
[SPEAKER_20]: How many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?

1961
02:52:24,871 --> 02:52:27,413
[SPEAKER_30]: But it's the... How many?

1962
02:52:28,334 --> 02:52:29,975
[SPEAKER_34]: It's the superintendent that's answering.

1963
02:52:30,155 --> 02:52:30,375
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1964
02:52:30,756 --> 02:52:31,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1965
02:52:31,356 --> 02:52:33,078
[SPEAKER_18]: You keep piping in too, because I'm trying to figure that out.

1966
02:52:33,158 --> 02:52:35,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.

1967
02:52:35,780 --> 02:52:37,041
[SPEAKER_28]: Madam Superintendent, sorry.

1968
02:52:37,723 --> 02:52:49,412
[SPEAKER_30]: So all the administrators that are there are providing additional support and supervision in the hallways during passing, during transition times for the students.

1969
02:52:50,113 --> 02:52:55,317
[SPEAKER_30]: So that was part of what took place today because students did express that they did not feel safe.

1970
02:52:55,717 --> 02:53:00,561
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a lot of extra presence and extra support today and extra counseling support.

1971
02:53:00,981 --> 02:53:04,304
[SPEAKER_30]: All of that is going to be available for the entire week.

1972
02:53:04,804 --> 02:53:07,206
[SPEAKER_30]: We are there to meet the needs of our students,

1973
02:53:07,725 --> 02:53:11,808
[SPEAKER_30]: The staff and teachers, many of them were also on duty.

1974
02:53:11,968 --> 02:53:18,173
[SPEAKER_30]: They volunteered and they were providing additional support and supervision in the hallways today.

1975
02:53:19,174 --> 02:53:22,196
[SPEAKER_30]: And things were, it was a quiet day today.

1976
02:53:22,657 --> 02:53:25,939
[SPEAKER_30]: So we were very happy that it was a productive day for the community.

1977
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:36,908
[SPEAKER_30]: We know that it's going to take time and that's why we do also have the additional counseling support available for any student and staff that require that.

1978
02:53:38,614 --> 02:53:41,596
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies.

1979
02:53:41,676 --> 02:53:47,078
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe from getting stabbed and beat up and fought and stuff like that.

1980
02:53:47,178 --> 02:53:49,879
[SPEAKER_20]: So obviously we've got a systemic problem there, right?

1981
02:53:50,820 --> 02:53:52,881
[SPEAKER_20]: These events are happening over and over again.

1982
02:53:53,061 --> 02:53:54,882
[SPEAKER_30]: They are not happening over and over again.

1983
02:53:54,982 --> 02:53:57,463
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had two major events in the last 60 days.

1984
02:53:57,543 --> 02:53:59,204
[SPEAKER_30]: But that is not over and over again.

1985
02:53:59,324 --> 02:54:00,584
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not isolated.

1986
02:54:00,624 --> 02:54:02,645
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli has a point of information.

1987
02:54:03,266 --> 02:54:07,688
[SPEAKER_27]: Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from

1988
02:54:09,442 --> 02:54:17,048
[SPEAKER_27]: personnel that were there to support, that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely.

1989
02:54:18,569 --> 02:54:21,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Has that even been addressed?

1990
02:54:21,611 --> 02:54:23,993
[SPEAKER_30]: I have been, I was in the hallways today as well.

1991
02:54:24,033 --> 02:54:26,655
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't know exactly what point in time that was.

1992
02:54:26,855 --> 02:54:33,139
[SPEAKER_30]: Students were allowed to go between, some students maybe needed a break.

1993
02:54:33,199 --> 02:54:37,983
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm not sure the information that you're receiving, because that's not the information that I saw

1994
02:54:38,516 --> 02:54:54,934
[SPEAKER_30]: firsthand today, and I was with the administration, Principal DeLava, Principal Fallon, the assistant principals, we were together today, and there was significant, significant adult presence in all of the hallways, including additional teachers and staff.

1995
02:54:55,414 --> 02:54:59,599
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's not the experience that I saw today at the high school.

1996
02:54:59,619 --> 02:55:00,460
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, that's good to hear.

1997
02:55:01,182 --> 02:55:18,338
[SPEAKER_27]: As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, and what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.

1998
02:55:19,058 --> 02:55:23,302
[SPEAKER_27]: Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of

1999
02:55:23,999 --> 02:55:30,823
[SPEAKER_27]: acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.

2000
02:55:32,044 --> 02:55:45,892
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.

2001
02:55:45,912 --> 02:55:47,093
[SPEAKER_27]: That hasn't been done yet.

2002
02:55:47,153 --> 02:55:51,275
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, so what you're talking about, we are working on meeting with the students.

2003
02:55:51,356 --> 02:55:52,836
[SPEAKER_30]: We would not meet with all 1300 students

2004
02:55:54,438 --> 02:55:56,919
[SPEAKER_30]: at one time, because it's just too large a number.

2005
02:55:57,419 --> 02:56:10,405
[SPEAKER_30]: So we have already been planning to meet with the students by grade level teams and in smaller groups of 100, so that it's a more manageable number, and that students will have an opportunity to speak back.

2006
02:56:10,545 --> 02:56:13,966
[SPEAKER_30]: So we are actively working on that as a team.

2007
02:56:14,126 --> 02:56:15,247
[SPEAKER_27]: That's good to hear, thanks.

2008
02:56:15,847 --> 02:56:16,187
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2009
02:56:16,407 --> 02:56:16,807
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2010
02:56:18,408 --> 02:56:18,808
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you both.

2011
02:56:23,246 --> 02:56:23,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Name for the record, please.

2012
02:56:24,587 --> 02:56:25,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Nicole Branley.

2013
02:56:27,349 --> 02:56:29,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time I come to these meetings, I say, I'm not gonna speak.

2014
02:56:29,811 --> 02:56:31,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I listened to what everybody has to say.

2015
02:56:32,733 --> 02:56:41,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And I take a lot of notes and everybody here makes it pretty easy for me to end up being the, maybe the calm voice.

2016
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:43,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that everybody needs to hear.

2017
02:56:43,401 --> 02:56:46,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's the parents and the kids at home that need to hear my voice.

2018
02:56:46,483 --> 02:56:47,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's you.

2019
02:56:49,125 --> 02:56:51,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I'm not just hearing myself at this point.

2020
02:56:52,261 --> 02:56:53,602
[SPEAKER_14]: But a lot of things have been said.

2021
02:56:56,905 --> 02:57:01,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard the superintendent say that all hands were on deck.

2022
02:57:02,610 --> 02:57:03,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We need that every day.

2023
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:06,993
[SPEAKER_14]: We need all hands on deck every single day for these children.

2024
02:57:13,739 --> 02:57:21,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli quoted our daughter and our community really has seemed to rally around: Step up

2025
02:57:22,563 --> 02:57:23,324
[SPEAKER_14]: or step down.

2026
02:57:25,205 --> 02:57:31,150
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was something else that our daughter said yesterday that impressed me.

2027
02:57:31,990 --> 02:57:47,762
[SPEAKER_14]: And this morning I sent an email to her teachers and she said, if it weren't for my amazing teachers and my amazing vocational program, I would transfer, I would leave.

2028
02:57:50,004 --> 02:57:50,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that says a lot.

2029
02:57:51,980 --> 02:58:04,004
[SPEAKER_14]: about our staff, about our teachers, about her friends who are dealing with this at her age, right along with her, with their families who have stood by our side.

2030
02:58:05,905 --> 02:58:14,408
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very impressive to me that the teachers were the ones that were with our kids today.

2031
02:58:15,109 --> 02:58:18,950
[SPEAKER_15]: They were the ones that were with our children during that lockdown yesterday.

2032
02:58:19,778 --> 02:58:23,719
[SPEAKER_15]: As upset as my daughter was, her teacher took care of her yesterday.

2033
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:27,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Her teacher saved her life on October 17th.

2034
02:58:30,722 --> 02:58:33,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Her teachers saved her life.

2035
02:58:35,283 --> 02:58:42,925
[SPEAKER_15]: I know four by name, there were others in the incident report that I did not know of, but they saved her life.

2036
02:58:46,006 --> 02:58:47,647
[SPEAKER_15]: We're asking a lot of our teachers

2037
02:58:49,192 --> 02:58:54,176
[SPEAKER_15]: or asking too much, but yet they're rising to the occasion every single time.

2038
02:58:54,316 --> 02:58:55,317
[SPEAKER_15]: And so are these kids.

2039
02:58:56,458 --> 02:58:58,039
[SPEAKER_15]: These kids are kids.

2040
02:58:58,699 --> 02:59:00,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to be the adults that lead here.

2041
02:59:01,041 --> 02:59:02,603
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to be the adults that lead here.

2042
02:59:03,383 --> 02:59:11,249
[SPEAKER_15]: So when it comes down to money, there's no dollar amount that should be set on any child.

2043
02:59:12,490 --> 02:59:15,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that in the big picture, we have limits.

2044
02:59:15,272 --> 02:59:15,853
[SPEAKER_15]: I get that.

2045
02:59:16,613 --> 02:59:21,577
[SPEAKER_15]: but our teachers, our staff, our students, families, this is what's the most important thing.

2046
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:30,184
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard many people say that there's been years of bullying, years of bullying.

2047
02:59:32,086 --> 02:59:37,310
[SPEAKER_15]: The bullying in our situation started in June, continued in September.

2048
02:59:38,952 --> 02:59:42,715
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one, two, three, four,

2049
02:59:43,439 --> 02:59:46,720
[SPEAKER_15]: police reports since September for our situation of bullying.

2050
02:59:48,400 --> 03:00:02,764
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet the bullying plan that we have was not initiated until the nurse saw my daughter on October 17th.

2051
03:00:02,804 --> 03:00:04,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I want you to hear that.

2052
03:00:05,104 --> 03:00:12,366
[SPEAKER_15]: No one filled out that bullying incident report until October 17th when she was on the ground and the nurse asked me,

2053
03:00:13,021 --> 03:00:15,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this something that's been going on?

2054
03:00:15,682 --> 03:00:18,342
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, yes, we've been dealing with this since June.

2055
03:00:19,203 --> 03:00:22,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And she said, I need to write the bullying incident report.

2056
03:00:23,044 --> 03:00:25,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't receive it until December 9th.

2057
03:00:27,745 --> 03:00:28,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I asked for it.

2058
03:00:28,625 --> 03:00:29,565
[SPEAKER_15]: You all know I asked for it.

2059
03:00:29,585 --> 03:00:32,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked all of you to help me get that paperwork.

2060
03:00:37,607 --> 03:00:39,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So years of bullying have been happening.

2061
03:00:39,128 --> 03:00:40,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And that bullying plan,

2062
03:00:41,308 --> 03:00:44,730
[SPEAKER_15]: that I sat on a subcommittee meeting, right?

2063
03:00:44,931 --> 03:00:48,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Subcommittee meeting, school committee meeting on December 6th.

2064
03:00:48,993 --> 03:00:51,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, I've never gotten these papers.

2065
03:00:51,755 --> 03:01:04,805
[SPEAKER_15]: I asked if the bullying plan that we were going over was actually something currently that we were using because it was foreign to me in the sense that none of it was executed.

2066
03:01:06,126 --> 03:01:09,408
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we have in place needs to be followed

2067
03:01:09,704 --> 03:01:11,485
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do.

2068
03:01:11,525 --> 03:01:12,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get me wrong.

2069
03:01:12,405 --> 03:01:14,046
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do.

2070
03:01:14,526 --> 03:01:15,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We really need to step it up.

2071
03:01:17,047 --> 03:01:20,528
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we have in place could work if we followed it also.

2072
03:01:21,008 --> 03:01:21,928
[SPEAKER_15]: That has to be done.

2073
03:01:22,669 --> 03:01:37,434
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know Councilor Knight, you said maybe cancel school for the rest of the week because no learning will be done, but maybe something just as valuable as learning can be done because

2074
03:01:38,942 --> 03:01:48,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I noticed today that for our daughter, it was a bit therapeutic to be with her friends, to be with other students.

2075
03:01:49,265 --> 03:01:55,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand why parents or guardians felt that they didn't feel comfortable sending their kids or that kids didn't feel comfortable being at school today.

2076
03:01:56,266 --> 03:01:56,947
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that.

2077
03:01:57,527 --> 03:02:00,627
[SPEAKER_15]: But today was probably the safest day to be at school.

2078
03:02:02,848 --> 03:02:03,908
[SPEAKER_15]: It certainly wasn't yesterday.

2079
03:02:05,049 --> 03:02:06,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And it certainly wasn't October 17th.

2080
03:02:08,155 --> 03:02:09,176
[SPEAKER_15]: I can vouch for that.

2081
03:02:10,657 --> 03:02:12,759
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have all these good faith discussions.

2082
03:02:12,859 --> 03:02:17,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard the words mentioned sustainable solutions.

2083
03:02:20,284 --> 03:02:21,825
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to put our politics aside.

2084
03:02:22,606 --> 03:02:24,427
[SPEAKER_15]: We really need to put our politics aside.

2085
03:02:24,607 --> 03:02:26,128
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to all stop arguing.

2086
03:02:26,148 --> 03:02:29,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that I was very emotional last night.

2087
03:02:31,112 --> 03:02:32,873
[SPEAKER_15]: This whole situation is making me lose my voice.

2088
03:02:34,555 --> 03:02:36,496
[SPEAKER_15]: But the division is

2089
03:02:37,168 --> 03:02:38,248
[SPEAKER_15]: is what our kids are seeing.

2090
03:02:41,089 --> 03:02:41,870
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not okay.

2091
03:02:42,390 --> 03:02:43,050
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not okay.

2092
03:02:43,390 --> 03:02:44,690
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to see us all united.

2093
03:02:45,171 --> 03:02:50,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that I've been very vocal to everybody that I am willing to help.

2094
03:02:51,293 --> 03:02:53,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I have an army of people behind me.

2095
03:02:53,713 --> 03:02:54,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do.

2096
03:02:54,314 --> 03:02:56,934
[SPEAKER_15]: It is amazing to me, the outpouring of people.

2097
03:02:57,054 --> 03:03:04,837
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank every single last one of them because it has helped give me the strength and helped give my daughter the strength, our family,

2098
03:03:05,663 --> 03:03:22,427
[SPEAKER_15]: My husband and my son give us the strength to keep moving forward because there's no doubt if I went away, if I went away October 17th, if I pulled her from Mefford High, we'd be here right now, but it wouldn't be about her.

2099
03:03:23,748 --> 03:03:27,248
[SPEAKER_15]: It would just be another situation and maybe the urgency wouldn't be there.

2100
03:03:27,268 --> 03:03:30,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why this has all happened to us.

2101
03:03:31,530 --> 03:03:32,130
[SPEAKER_15]: I really don't.

2102
03:03:34,706 --> 03:03:35,547
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't stop.

2103
03:03:35,807 --> 03:03:42,210
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just, I beg every single parent to come to every single school committee meeting to join me.

2104
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:48,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I've sat here the first night, an abundance of people, but I've sat here every single meeting.

2105
03:03:48,992 --> 03:03:49,833
[SPEAKER_15]: You all have seen me.

2106
03:03:50,173 --> 03:03:51,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spoken at your meetings.

2107
03:03:51,173 --> 03:03:54,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is number three here at the city council.

2108
03:03:55,515 --> 03:03:56,856
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to hear your voice.

2109
03:03:57,722 --> 03:04:00,543
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to hear voices, parents, because I've heard you all.

2110
03:04:00,803 --> 03:04:04,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm relaying the messages, but I'm just one woman repeating myself.

2111
03:04:04,624 --> 03:04:06,524
[SPEAKER_15]: We need all of your voices.

2112
03:04:07,164 --> 03:04:18,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So I also wanted to mention too, my four police reports are all about bullying, but I met this other mom yesterday outside of Medford High, someone I've never met before in my life.

2113
03:04:19,848 --> 03:04:20,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know her.

2114
03:04:21,168 --> 03:04:24,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Between us, we have seven police reports from this school year.

2115
03:04:29,059 --> 03:04:30,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Her story is so similar to mine.

2116
03:04:31,881 --> 03:04:37,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like I've known her for a very long time, even though we've just met yesterday outside of Medford High School.

2117
03:04:38,426 --> 03:04:45,212
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a bond moms should have while their daughters are in high school.

2118
03:04:46,833 --> 03:04:48,935
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not the bond that we should be making.

2119
03:04:49,995 --> 03:04:51,056
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm grateful for it.

2120
03:04:52,477 --> 03:04:54,599
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is a sad time.

2121
03:04:54,859 --> 03:04:55,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is a sad time.

2122
03:04:56,320 --> 03:04:57,201
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to step up.

2123
03:04:58,322 --> 03:04:59,843
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to work together, please.

2124
03:05:00,944 --> 03:05:06,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I've asked, and I almost messaged the school committee today and said, let me help.

2125
03:05:07,410 --> 03:05:07,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me help.

2126
03:05:08,171 --> 03:05:09,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been at every meeting.

2127
03:05:10,252 --> 03:05:10,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been here.

2128
03:05:11,053 --> 03:05:11,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it all.

2129
03:05:12,154 --> 03:05:12,795
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it all.

2130
03:05:12,935 --> 03:05:13,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Just tell me.

2131
03:05:13,776 --> 03:05:15,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you all know how persistent I am at this point.

2132
03:05:16,678 --> 03:05:17,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not going away.

2133
03:05:17,679 --> 03:05:19,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I love this city.

2134
03:05:19,060 --> 03:05:21,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I love, I believe the blue and white too.

2135
03:05:22,723 --> 03:05:23,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it too.

2136
03:05:23,857 --> 03:05:26,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna be proud, and I always have been.

2137
03:05:26,579 --> 03:05:28,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so proud that the football team was here tonight.

2138
03:05:29,240 --> 03:05:39,987
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to recognize all the good that's happening here, starting with the teachers, the sports, the culinary program, the vocational school, all of it.

2139
03:05:40,067 --> 03:05:44,489
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be celebrated, but we can't let this other stuff be swept under the rug anymore.

2140
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:47,531
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you again for your time.

2141
03:05:47,551 --> 03:05:50,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me stand here with you.

2142
03:05:52,199 --> 03:05:53,019
[SPEAKER_28]: She's a little nervous.

2143
03:05:53,039 --> 03:05:54,379
[SPEAKER_28]: She asked me if I would stand with her.

2144
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:54,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2145
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:56,180
[SPEAKER_28]: And I just want to discuss this.

2146
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:58,640
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll take the two people standing in person and then I'll go to Zoom.

2147
03:05:58,680 --> 03:05:59,200
[SPEAKER_28]: So sure.

2148
03:05:59,240 --> 03:05:59,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2149
03:06:00,281 --> 03:06:01,341
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

2150
03:06:01,821 --> 03:06:04,382
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Samantha Ripley and I live on Kenmare Road.

2151
03:06:05,622 --> 03:06:11,643
[SPEAKER_29]: We all know what has been going on at the high school for a few months now and has gotten to the point where we had a stabbing yesterday morning.

2152
03:06:12,503 --> 03:06:15,964
[SPEAKER_29]: Many of the students I know are afraid to go to school because this has gotten too far.

2153
03:06:16,502 --> 03:06:20,785
[SPEAKER_29]: I personally haven't had to experience many problems at this school, but my friends have.

2154
03:06:21,285 --> 03:06:33,773
[SPEAKER_29]: I wanted to speak out tonight in hopes my voice will be heard on the issues going on at the school as a student who actively has to get up each morning into that building and walk into that building and wonder what can possibly happen next.

2155
03:06:34,313 --> 03:06:38,996
[SPEAKER_29]: As a senior about to finish and graduate from this high school, I'm ashamed to be graduating from Medford.

2156
03:06:39,454 --> 03:06:51,122
[SPEAKER_29]: I did not attend the school my freshman year as I went to Malton Catholic, but this past year has left me questioning why I left with all the violence that is going on and the fact that a plan hasn't been placed into action to stop the violence.

2157
03:06:51,662 --> 03:06:57,386
[SPEAKER_29]: When I first came to Medford High, I was extremely excited because I had the opportunity to be a part of the vocational program.

2158
03:06:57,846 --> 03:07:01,969
[SPEAKER_29]: But lately, I haven't been feeling safe at a place many of us call our second home.

2159
03:07:02,509 --> 03:07:07,192
[SPEAKER_29]: We are tired and frustrating of having to enter the halls of Medford High, wondering what will occur today.

2160
03:07:07,776 --> 03:07:11,358
[SPEAKER_29]: Why aren't the voices of students and teachers who are being affected being heard?

2161
03:07:11,918 --> 03:07:16,901
[SPEAKER_29]: We are in that building for six hours plus a day, five days a week, and our voices aren't being heard.

2162
03:07:17,401 --> 03:07:21,063
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we are the ones who have to witness incidents occur on a daily basis.

2163
03:07:21,644 --> 03:07:25,466
[SPEAKER_29]: What more has to happen for something to be done?

2164
03:07:25,946 --> 03:07:29,208
[SPEAKER_29]: It has gotten to a point where students and parents are now concerned about safety.

2165
03:07:30,148 --> 03:07:32,670
[SPEAKER_29]: All we want to know is what steps will be taken

2166
03:07:33,962 --> 03:07:41,126
[SPEAKER_29]: sorry, all we want to know is what will be the next steps to help the school become a safer environment that an incident like this will not happen again.

2167
03:07:41,806 --> 03:07:48,550
[SPEAKER_29]: The school should have been placed, should have placed a disciplinary action as soon as we got back into the building during the hybrid schedule.

2168
03:07:49,010 --> 03:07:56,354
[SPEAKER_29]: All the student wants is to be able to feel safe and know they have the right guidance from the faculty who are supposed to be leading us into this adult life.

2169
03:07:56,854 --> 03:08:03,538
[SPEAKER_29]: The fact that after three plus hours on lockdown, we had a fire alarm go off and many students were anxious and scared

2170
03:08:04,147 --> 03:08:05,229
[SPEAKER_29]: and just wanting to leave.

2171
03:08:05,509 --> 03:08:12,839
[SPEAKER_29]: My anxiety was so high yesterday that once the fire alarm went off, my history teacher from last year had to help me calm down because I was crying.

2172
03:08:13,540 --> 03:08:19,569
[SPEAKER_29]: All because of the staff we have to guide us, do not know how to handle such situations because of the lack of resources given.

2173
03:08:21,778 --> 03:08:26,840
[SPEAKER_29]: I shouldn't have to be worrying about my safety for myself and my friends while at a place that is supposed to protect us.

2174
03:08:27,460 --> 03:08:34,363
[SPEAKER_29]: I should be excited for the next few months as graduation is coming up, but instead I'm expressing my concerns on the safety for everyone at MHS.

2175
03:08:34,983 --> 03:08:37,784
[SPEAKER_29]: There needs to be more interaction between staff and students.

2176
03:08:38,184 --> 03:08:43,486
[SPEAKER_29]: The lack of trust and support that students have from faculty to express concern is unacceptable.

2177
03:08:44,127 --> 03:08:49,530
[SPEAKER_29]: The students should have something to look forward to and not having to worry about if we will be the next victim.

2178
03:08:50,011 --> 03:08:57,975
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a huge problem that we as the students not feel we have the support from many faculty and staff members in the building.

2179
03:08:58,356 --> 03:09:00,877
[SPEAKER_29]: The building we spend most of our time out of our day in.

2180
03:09:03,419 --> 03:09:12,124
[SPEAKER_29]: We all just want actions with solutions to be placed into a system to help our anxiety and to be able to feel safe at school so we can get the proper education we deserve.

2181
03:09:12,424 --> 03:09:12,744
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2182
03:09:14,073 --> 03:09:17,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2183
03:09:17,694 --> 03:09:20,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'll stay with everybody's the popular one.

2184
03:09:25,737 --> 03:09:28,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So good evening, my name is Joanne.

2185
03:09:28,938 --> 03:09:32,059
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter is a sophomore at the high school.

2186
03:09:32,179 --> 03:09:34,180
[SPEAKER_11]: She's also in the vocational program.

2187
03:09:34,820 --> 03:09:40,702
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter has goals and dreams like most of your children if you have children.

2188
03:09:41,201 --> 03:09:42,623
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants to be a trauma surgeon.

2189
03:09:43,123 --> 03:09:44,424
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants to reach that goal.

2190
03:09:44,625 --> 03:09:45,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I expect her to do that.

2191
03:09:49,390 --> 03:09:52,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I never thought I'd be here discussing this.

2192
03:09:53,634 --> 03:09:58,659
[SPEAKER_11]: But bullying, it's a real thing in the school, outside of school as well.

2193
03:09:59,900 --> 03:10:00,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an only child.

2194
03:10:02,503 --> 03:10:02,703
[SPEAKER_11]: And

2195
03:10:06,318 --> 03:10:16,306
[SPEAKER_11]: The police reports that I obtained, because you need three, I have probably 10 just from this school year, okay?

2196
03:10:16,767 --> 03:10:23,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So this one was from April, but this was a continuation from last year, but this was April of this year.

2197
03:10:24,213 --> 03:10:25,954
[SPEAKER_11]: It's quite a few pages long.

2198
03:10:28,016 --> 03:10:32,840
[SPEAKER_11]: This incident, my daughter was in her classroom doing her work,

2199
03:10:33,416 --> 03:10:42,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And a group of girls barged into her classroom, went right up to her while she was sitting at her desk, and antagonized her to start a fight.

2200
03:10:45,399 --> 03:10:46,859
[SPEAKER_11]: She kept her hands to herself.

2201
03:10:47,459 --> 03:10:52,400
[SPEAKER_11]: We would be having a much different conversation if my daughter was harmed physically.

2202
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:56,781
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all talk, talk, talk, talk.

2203
03:10:57,421 --> 03:11:00,462
[SPEAKER_11]: But at some point, it's going to become physical.

2204
03:11:01,972 --> 03:11:03,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that was April.

2205
03:11:05,916 --> 03:11:10,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, then we have, so we figured, okay, the summer, you know, summertime, everything's fine.

2206
03:11:11,641 --> 03:11:18,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Go back to school, September, uh, September, September 28th, another police report.

2207
03:11:19,648 --> 03:11:24,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, officer Conway, uh, calls me and tells me what's going on at the school.

2208
03:11:24,892 --> 03:11:27,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And now my daughter is being escorted to her classes.

2209
03:11:28,533 --> 03:11:31,294
[SPEAKER_11]: because these girls are following her to her locker.

2210
03:11:31,574 --> 03:11:33,255
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't even use the bathroom at school.

2211
03:11:34,235 --> 03:11:37,376
[SPEAKER_11]: But last week she did because she's in the medical assisting program.

2212
03:11:37,896 --> 03:11:43,138
[SPEAKER_11]: She went into the bathroom with her other medical assisting friends to change into their uniforms.

2213
03:11:45,079 --> 03:11:47,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I call this one girl a ringleader.

2214
03:11:47,560 --> 03:11:52,141
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not in the school right now because once she turned 16, she was allowed to drop out.

2215
03:11:52,882 --> 03:11:53,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

2216
03:11:55,162 --> 03:11:56,403
[SPEAKER_11]: But she calls her

2217
03:11:57,110 --> 03:11:58,811
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, gang of friends, if you will.

2218
03:11:59,632 --> 03:12:03,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, so-and-so, you know, follow her, follow her, follow her.

2219
03:12:04,135 --> 03:12:05,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Many different names are on here.

2220
03:12:05,676 --> 03:12:09,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they're minors, I can't mention their names, but they are on the police reports.

2221
03:12:09,679 --> 03:12:13,122
[SPEAKER_11]: They have, it's sickening.

2222
03:12:13,722 --> 03:12:26,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week, so that was September 29th, just last week, a different batch of girls from this original ringleader sent

2223
03:12:27,003 --> 03:12:33,504
[SPEAKER_11]: another group of girls into the bathroom and cornered her in there and tried to jump her.

2224
03:12:35,385 --> 03:12:36,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So those girls were sent home.

2225
03:12:38,705 --> 03:12:40,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the boys had a fight.

2226
03:12:40,946 --> 03:12:43,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course, retaliation happened yesterday.

2227
03:12:46,347 --> 03:12:50,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's going on in the bathrooms, but there's a lot of drug use in the school.

2228
03:12:52,088 --> 03:12:52,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knows it.

2229
03:12:53,228 --> 03:12:56,509
[SPEAKER_11]: These kids are in the bathroom doing drugs and whatever else they're doing.

2230
03:12:57,867 --> 03:12:59,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the drugs were laced.

2231
03:12:59,508 --> 03:13:01,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hearing that's why there were some overdoses.

2232
03:13:02,491 --> 03:13:04,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that, it could be hearsay.

2233
03:13:05,053 --> 03:13:14,481
[SPEAKER_11]: However, to get anything done, I can understand parents' frustrations on getting something on paper.

2234
03:13:15,202 --> 03:13:18,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So I collected my three incident reports.

2235
03:13:19,886 --> 03:13:25,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to the, Officer Conway gave them to me at the high school.

2236
03:13:26,164 --> 03:13:30,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I then went to Medford Police Department to file a new report for a new incident.

2237
03:13:32,329 --> 03:13:33,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I went to the Somerville Courthouse.

2238
03:13:33,810 --> 03:13:35,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville Courthouse said, they're juveniles.

2239
03:13:35,591 --> 03:13:37,152
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to go to the Cambridge Courthouse.

2240
03:13:37,793 --> 03:13:39,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to the Cambridge Courthouse.

2241
03:13:39,054 --> 03:13:39,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's your daughter?

2242
03:13:39,814 --> 03:13:40,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, she's in school.

2243
03:13:40,875 --> 03:13:42,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you have to have your daughter with you.

2244
03:13:43,197 --> 03:13:45,939
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very frustrating that nothing can be done immediately.

2245
03:13:46,139 --> 03:13:46,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

2246
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:51,083
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know that a lot of parents probably don't want to go through that whole process of it.

2247
03:13:51,943 --> 03:13:54,205
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have to, unfortunately.

2248
03:13:55,896 --> 03:13:59,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get my police reports in order.

2249
03:13:59,297 --> 03:14:04,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to the Cambridge courthouse, file my paperwork with them.

2250
03:14:05,078 --> 03:14:06,158
[SPEAKER_11]: They give me a court date.

2251
03:14:07,179 --> 03:14:09,479
[SPEAKER_11]: The girl and her mom show up about two hours late.

2252
03:14:09,539 --> 03:14:11,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she tells the judge, hey, I gotta go.

2253
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:12,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta go pick up my kid at home.

2254
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:14,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's not how it works.

2255
03:14:15,361 --> 03:14:19,042
[SPEAKER_11]: You're here because you're harassing my daughter and many others.

2256
03:14:19,662 --> 03:14:21,382
[SPEAKER_11]: This girl is a problem.

2257
03:14:22,022 --> 03:14:24,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And so on all of her friends that are still in the school.

2258
03:14:25,802 --> 03:14:26,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Why aren't they expelled?

2259
03:14:26,962 --> 03:14:28,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Why aren't they suspended?

2260
03:14:28,223 --> 03:14:31,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it, mass law, everybody's entitled to their education.

2261
03:14:32,083 --> 03:14:36,004
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter's entitled to an education and she's not a troublemaker.

2262
03:14:38,265 --> 03:14:40,525
[SPEAKER_11]: She has never touched anybody in that school.

2263
03:14:40,545 --> 03:14:46,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll be damned if somebody puts a finger on her, because this would be a different conversation.

2264
03:14:47,007 --> 03:14:51,128
[SPEAKER_11]: So then I get a court date, then it's, oh, let's try mediation.

2265
03:14:51,868 --> 03:14:55,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we tried that at school and the girl jumped over the desk.

2266
03:14:56,058 --> 03:14:59,039
[SPEAKER_11]: and try to attack the principal, okay?

2267
03:14:59,659 --> 03:15:13,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So then, last week, Mrs. Wacha says to me, well, your daughter is a target because she's very nice, she's happy, these girls are jealous, she's very social, she's popular, I commend your daughter for staying strong.

2268
03:15:17,643 --> 03:15:21,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But nothing's happening because this is still ongoing.

2269
03:15:21,244 --> 03:15:23,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's great, she's a good kid, we all know that.

2270
03:15:24,764 --> 03:15:28,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So why are the good kids being punished and why aren't the bad kids out of the school?

2271
03:15:30,248 --> 03:15:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, a couple of them went over to the Tufts Curtis.

2272
03:15:33,070 --> 03:15:33,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess what?

2273
03:15:33,430 --> 03:15:34,871
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't work out there for them either.

2274
03:15:35,932 --> 03:15:37,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care if they have problems at home.

2275
03:15:37,413 --> 03:15:38,393
[SPEAKER_11]: We all have problems.

2276
03:15:39,374 --> 03:15:40,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't bring it to school.

2277
03:15:40,455 --> 03:15:42,676
[SPEAKER_11]: That's supposed to be their safe place.

2278
03:15:46,079 --> 03:15:46,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't go to the bathroom.

2279
03:15:46,979 --> 03:15:48,400
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter doesn't go to the bathroom at school.

2280
03:15:48,620 --> 03:15:52,243
[SPEAKER_11]: She holds it until, we pick her up and drop her off every single day.

2281
03:15:53,464 --> 03:15:57,927
[SPEAKER_11]: She's never taken public transportation because you know what happens on the public transportation?

2282
03:15:58,367 --> 03:16:06,192
[SPEAKER_11]: They're smoking, they're doing their thing, they're fighting, they're offloading the kids in Medford Square because there's a brawl on the bus.

2283
03:16:06,693 --> 03:16:08,734
[SPEAKER_11]: They all have to get off the bus, go on another bus.

2284
03:16:08,754 --> 03:16:10,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want my daughter experiencing that.

2285
03:16:12,616 --> 03:16:21,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So we go to mediation and we get the complaint for protection for harassment, a harassment prevention order.

2286
03:16:22,685 --> 03:16:28,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I sign it, my husband signs it, my daughter signs it, the girl signs it, her mom signs it.

2287
03:16:28,971 --> 03:16:32,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Two weeks later, the girl's harassing my daughter again.

2288
03:16:33,034 --> 03:16:41,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's not even in the school, but she's taking pictures of her, taking screenshots of her, posting it on social media and saying nasty things about her.

2289
03:16:41,642 --> 03:16:42,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a violation.

2290
03:16:43,964 --> 03:16:44,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing happens.

2291
03:16:46,386 --> 03:16:49,649
[SPEAKER_11]: So then we reach out to the superintendent

2292
03:16:53,917 --> 03:17:03,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And they send me a 34 page pamphlet on bullying, investigation and response forms.

2293
03:17:04,843 --> 03:17:14,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So this first seven pages that you have to fill out the bullying incident report, the police reports, I guess aren't enough.

2294
03:17:15,408 --> 03:17:19,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there'll be a bullying investigation form, which

2295
03:17:21,078 --> 03:17:21,778
[SPEAKER_11]: is two pages.

2296
03:17:21,818 --> 03:17:27,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess whoever this was handed to is supposed to fill this out to see what has been done.

2297
03:17:27,962 --> 03:17:33,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this was passed in on Friday because this happened either Wednesday or Thursday last week.

2298
03:17:35,227 --> 03:17:38,168
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's going to be a plan.

2299
03:17:40,590 --> 03:17:41,350
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the plan?

2300
03:17:42,191 --> 03:17:47,334
[SPEAKER_11]: All this paperwork has done nothing, nothing, nothing at all.

2301
03:17:49,138 --> 03:17:51,799
[SPEAKER_11]: There's married people that get restraining orders on each other.

2302
03:17:51,819 --> 03:17:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: They end up killing each other anyway.

2303
03:17:53,620 --> 03:17:55,261
[SPEAKER_11]: The piece of paper isn't doing anything.

2304
03:17:57,282 --> 03:18:14,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know what the answers are going to be, but what's going to happen is people are going to start taking this into their own hands because the people that are supposed to be leaders in the community and our superintendent of schools, the administration, nobody wants to take responsibility.

2305
03:18:14,671 --> 03:18:18,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, how much do parents have to do?

2306
03:18:20,445 --> 03:18:20,786
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

2307
03:18:22,546 --> 03:18:23,947
[SPEAKER_11]: My daughter wasn't physically harmed.

2308
03:18:23,987 --> 03:18:24,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Hers was.

2309
03:18:25,748 --> 03:18:27,148
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the same situation.

2310
03:18:27,348 --> 03:18:28,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Tons of police reports.

2311
03:18:28,469 --> 03:18:30,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And I only brought the ones that I had to bring.

2312
03:18:31,610 --> 03:18:32,370
[SPEAKER_11]: You only need three.

2313
03:18:32,390 --> 03:18:33,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I have probably 20.

2314
03:18:34,691 --> 03:18:37,493
[SPEAKER_11]: She's got a whole bag full of paperwork.

2315
03:18:37,593 --> 03:18:38,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all papers.

2316
03:18:38,553 --> 03:18:40,014
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the bag I carry around.

2317
03:18:40,034 --> 03:18:41,514
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my whole life right now.

2318
03:18:42,375 --> 03:18:43,715
[SPEAKER_11]: All talk, talk, talk.

2319
03:18:44,015 --> 03:18:45,096
[SPEAKER_11]: No action at all.

2320
03:18:48,655 --> 03:18:49,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even imagine.

2321
03:18:49,616 --> 03:18:56,321
[SPEAKER_14]: One. Two. Three.

2322
03:18:57,382 --> 03:18:59,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course my OCD, everything's color coded.

2323
03:18:59,644 --> 03:19:01,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Four.

2324
03:19:03,667 --> 03:19:04,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want a pile that big.

2325
03:19:05,508 --> 03:19:06,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it any thicker than this.

2326
03:19:10,873 --> 03:19:15,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're, you know, as parents, you know, we do the best with our children.

2327
03:19:16,156 --> 03:19:17,757
[SPEAKER_11]: My child is a straight A student.

2328
03:19:17,937 --> 03:19:19,037
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants to go to college.

2329
03:19:19,077 --> 03:19:20,118
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants to have a future.

2330
03:19:20,158 --> 03:19:21,318
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants her education.

2331
03:19:21,939 --> 03:19:24,100
[SPEAKER_11]: She doesn't want any of this other extra stuff.

2332
03:19:25,100 --> 03:19:32,263
[SPEAKER_11]: And neither does, you know, I just don't understand why the bad kids are still allowed to come back to school.

2333
03:19:32,563 --> 03:19:32,963
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

2334
03:19:33,024 --> 03:19:33,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're not bad.

2335
03:19:34,084 --> 03:19:37,145
[SPEAKER_14]: They have unexpected behavior and adults aren't doing their job.

2336
03:19:38,986 --> 03:19:41,667
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why adults aren't doing their job.

2337
03:19:42,268 --> 03:19:45,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So all their unexpected behavior continues.

2338
03:19:46,789 --> 03:19:47,349
[SPEAKER_14]: continues.

2339
03:19:48,129 --> 03:19:51,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And yesterday was just like, you know, no, that's fine.

2340
03:19:52,510 --> 03:19:57,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yesterday, you know, you get a text from your child, Hey, we're on lockdown for two hours.

2341
03:19:58,532 --> 03:19:59,432
[SPEAKER_11]: School didn't even tell us.

2342
03:20:01,372 --> 03:20:03,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I was at the school before some of the fire trucks.

2343
03:20:04,033 --> 03:20:06,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is when I met Mr. Scarpelli.

2344
03:20:07,854 --> 03:20:11,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, you know, I just thought he was, I had no idea who anybody was, but

2345
03:20:12,830 --> 03:20:19,416
[SPEAKER_11]: There were parents there, and he's there in his hoodie and his shorts, and we're just talking, and I didn't have a clue to who he was.

2346
03:20:19,496 --> 03:20:22,838
[SPEAKER_11]: He was painting his attic or something, and I was like, wow, you know?

2347
03:20:22,959 --> 03:20:26,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I see him here tonight, and I'm like, oh, okay.

2348
03:20:28,423 --> 03:20:32,707
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but I spoke to him just like I spoke to Nicole.

2349
03:20:34,068 --> 03:20:35,329
[SPEAKER_11]: We just shared our stories.

2350
03:20:35,779 --> 03:20:38,139
[SPEAKER_11]: There was another mom there, her son's autistic.

2351
03:20:38,239 --> 03:20:40,040
[SPEAKER_11]: They attacked him in the library.

2352
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:43,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's, it's, this isn't isolated is what I'm getting at.

2353
03:20:44,020 --> 03:20:47,741
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a daily occurrence every single day.

2354
03:20:47,761 --> 03:20:49,802
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not my daughter, it's someone else's.

2355
03:20:50,582 --> 03:21:03,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know anything about much of the boy stuff, but the girls, there's groups of them that target the educated children, you know, and,

2356
03:21:04,421 --> 03:21:08,844
[SPEAKER_11]: The parents that I go to at the courthouse, they're not doing anything.

2357
03:21:10,244 --> 03:21:11,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's okay, sweetheart.

2358
03:21:11,245 --> 03:21:12,245
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to go to school.

2359
03:21:12,545 --> 03:21:13,546
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll send you somewhere else.

2360
03:21:14,446 --> 03:21:15,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Where am I going to send my daughter?

2361
03:21:15,947 --> 03:21:17,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Why should I have to pull her out of school?

2362
03:21:17,848 --> 03:21:18,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely not.

2363
03:21:19,069 --> 03:21:20,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, she's there for a reason.

2364
03:21:21,590 --> 03:21:24,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Excitement about being in the vocational.

2365
03:21:24,652 --> 03:21:28,314
[SPEAKER_11]: You're getting, you know, a certificate when you graduate.

2366
03:21:28,734 --> 03:21:30,055
[SPEAKER_11]: You can use that towards,

2367
03:21:31,325 --> 03:21:35,387
[SPEAKER_11]: going to college, she plays sports, she's very active, she does community service.

2368
03:21:35,407 --> 03:21:40,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these other kids are not doing any of that.

2369
03:21:40,110 --> 03:21:41,471
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not even going to school.

2370
03:21:42,872 --> 03:21:45,874
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my say.

2371
03:21:45,894 --> 03:21:53,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I found out about this meeting from Nicole, so I will probably be here more often than not.

2372
03:21:54,399 --> 03:21:59,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I know, I had to actually Google how to get here because I never had to be here before.

2373
03:22:00,250 --> 03:22:01,670
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm here for Nicole.

2374
03:22:01,730 --> 03:22:05,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm here to speak on behalf of other parents as well.

2375
03:22:07,531 --> 03:22:08,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

2376
03:22:08,371 --> 03:22:08,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2377
03:22:09,472 --> 03:22:10,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

2378
03:22:10,392 --> 03:22:11,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

2379
03:22:11,072 --> 03:22:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, through you to the superintendent.

2380
03:22:15,053 --> 03:22:19,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know how many reports like this are throughout our school?

2381
03:22:20,474 --> 03:22:28,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yesterday when I was there with Councilor Scarpelli, I heard the young lady telling Councilor Scarpelli about her incidents

2382
03:22:28,971 --> 03:22:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: with going to the police and believe it or not, I probably heard the same story from a half a dozen other people that were standing outside waiting for the drone saying they had all filed police reports.

2383
03:22:39,894 --> 03:22:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: How many police reports have been filed over the last year in the school?

2384
03:22:43,535 --> 03:22:45,976
[SPEAKER_28]: We did have the council pass a resolution.

2385
03:22:45,996 --> 03:22:48,737
[SPEAKER_28]: We voted on it.

2386
03:22:48,757 --> 03:22:51,718
[SPEAKER_28]: Two weeks ago and I did actually, I called you publicly as well.

2387
03:22:54,722 --> 03:22:57,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I met half a dozen people outside what's what's on Councilor Scarpelli yesterday.

2388
03:22:58,324 --> 03:23:01,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were all saying the same thing that you know, they all they all have reports.

2389
03:23:02,085 --> 03:23:03,525
[SPEAKER_05]: They will restraining orders.

2390
03:23:03,545 --> 03:23:06,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know why they're not being enforced.

2391
03:23:07,367 --> 03:23:08,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, can we get a number?

2392
03:23:09,567 --> 03:23:10,328
[SPEAKER_28]: The request is in.

2393
03:23:10,988 --> 03:23:14,369
[SPEAKER_28]: And I get as we've learned tonight, sometimes those requests don't get where they're supposed to go.

2394
03:23:14,409 --> 03:23:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have I did another request we won't get.

2395
03:23:19,394 --> 03:23:20,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, just to add one thing.

2396
03:23:20,855 --> 03:23:23,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know if I had mentioned it to you, I think.

2397
03:23:24,017 --> 03:23:26,058
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't keep track.

2398
03:23:26,239 --> 03:23:33,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I can look at all my notes, but the resolution had talked about incidents that Officer Conway could put together.

2399
03:23:33,443 --> 03:23:34,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it was 30 days.

2400
03:23:37,146 --> 03:23:47,593
[SPEAKER_15]: And will that include incident reports within the school, not just the police reports, but on student violence in the schools that's handled within

2401
03:23:48,001 --> 03:23:49,422
[SPEAKER_15]: an assistant principal, a principal.

2402
03:23:49,442 --> 03:23:49,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2403
03:23:49,602 --> 03:23:54,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that that was all included, not just from the SRO because he would only have access.

2404
03:23:54,846 --> 03:23:56,588
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what we'll get back, but that's okay.

2405
03:23:56,768 --> 03:23:57,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause cause, okay.

2406
03:23:57,648 --> 03:24:01,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, um, he can only produce the stuff from the police department.

2407
03:24:02,272 --> 03:24:02,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So, all right.

2408
03:24:02,752 --> 03:24:02,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

2409
03:24:03,013 --> 03:24:03,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

2410
03:24:03,573 --> 03:24:04,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2411
03:24:04,574 --> 03:24:05,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Collins.

2412
03:24:06,495 --> 03:24:07,176
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

2413
03:24:07,856 --> 03:24:11,219
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, I it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.

2414
03:24:11,239 --> 03:24:12,100
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't have anything to add.

2415
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:13,961
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.

2416
03:24:14,021 --> 03:24:15,182
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for sharing your story.

2417
03:24:16,402 --> 03:24:17,102
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not a parent.

2418
03:24:17,182 --> 03:24:20,143
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that.

2419
03:24:20,183 --> 03:24:23,464
[SPEAKER_32]: Something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.

2420
03:24:24,144 --> 03:24:24,865
[SPEAKER_32]: It's heartbreaking.

2421
03:24:24,885 --> 03:24:26,685
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.

2422
03:24:26,725 --> 03:24:27,265
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for being here.

2423
03:24:28,926 --> 03:24:29,186
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2424
03:24:29,266 --> 03:24:34,107
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do, yeah, I think everyone who's coming to speak for the first time tonight, I know it's not easy.

2425
03:24:34,127 --> 03:24:38,649
[SPEAKER_28]: I know it's really hard and I appreciate you taking the time of your night to come speak before us.

2426
03:24:38,709 --> 03:24:38,989
[SPEAKER_28]: You know,

2427
03:24:43,766 --> 03:24:45,707
[SPEAKER_28]: Sometimes they're 20 minutes, sometimes they're five hours.

2428
03:24:45,747 --> 03:24:46,668
[SPEAKER_28]: You never know until you're here.

2429
03:24:48,969 --> 03:25:00,556
[SPEAKER_28]: So, but I appreciate, and I think a lot of us that if we went to public schools, you know, I graduated 20 years ago, there were some of these, I didn't go to Medford High, I went to a different high school that had many of its own issues.

2430
03:25:01,477 --> 03:25:11,203
[SPEAKER_28]: But I think it's very clear that some of us may have experienced stuff similar, but stuff has gotten to a level that I think is unimaginable for a lot of us that were in high school,

2431
03:25:12,130 --> 03:25:25,782
[SPEAKER_28]: possibly even 10 years ago I don't know I think second smartphones get added seems like stuff that's, I can't even imagine so I, I really appreciate you coming out to talk my heart goes out to you, I, you know, I'm a mother of a very young child.

2432
03:25:26,523 --> 03:25:32,268
[SPEAKER_28]: But this is stuff that, of course, we're all thinking of constantly so I appreciate you taking the time to share your stories.

2433
03:25:33,522 --> 03:25:35,343
[SPEAKER_28]: as a Councilor and as a mother, so thank you.

2434
03:25:36,784 --> 03:25:40,727
[SPEAKER_28]: I do see Councilors saying, and then I'm gonna go to one person on Zoom and then we'll come back to Mr. South, okay.

2435
03:25:41,448 --> 03:25:44,630
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Tseng, vice president Bears, we'll go to Zoom and we'll come back to Mr. South.

2436
03:25:46,551 --> 03:25:47,332
[SPEAKER_28]: No, Councilor Tseng.

2437
03:25:48,274 --> 03:25:48,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2438
03:25:48,974 --> 03:25:54,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also wanted to, uh, thank, um, the parents for coming up and telling you the stories.

2439
03:25:54,978 --> 03:26:03,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I hadn't heard the story before, and I think president Morello, you put it well that even though.

2440
03:26:04,707 --> 03:26:15,112
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I was there five years ago, I think things have, you know, things are slightly different now and smartphones and COVID and all of that changes everything as well.

2441
03:26:15,172 --> 03:26:19,014
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually, it's really helpful to hear that perspective.

2442
03:26:21,155 --> 03:26:21,475
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2443
03:26:22,135 --> 03:26:22,816
[SPEAKER_28]: President Bears.

2444
03:26:23,436 --> 03:26:24,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

2445
03:26:24,316 --> 03:26:24,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2446
03:26:24,977 --> 03:26:27,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to thank you for coming out to everyone who spoke tonight.

2447
03:26:27,938 --> 03:26:28,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

2448
03:26:28,158 --> 03:26:30,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Ripley, you were really good.

2449
03:26:32,651 --> 03:26:39,292
[SPEAKER_08]: And the students who spoke last night as well, I think that that takes a lot of courage because you, you're going back there and you know what it's like.

2450
03:26:39,672 --> 03:26:59,356
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to say too, to President Morell's point, you know, I graduated 2011 from Medford High School, my sister 2016, and there were clicks and bullying and police reports and, you know, issues that we faced in our time at Medford High School.

2451
03:27:03,281 --> 03:27:05,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, again, there's not much more I can add.

2452
03:27:07,201 --> 03:27:08,582
[SPEAKER_08]: People have been experiencing this.

2453
03:27:08,762 --> 03:27:10,904
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clearly worse now than it's ever been before.

2454
03:27:11,204 --> 03:27:13,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've talked about a lot of the reasons that that's true.

2455
03:27:15,166 --> 03:27:22,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And this council and the school committee, and I think everyone involved is, you know, Ms.

2456
03:27:22,251 --> 03:27:30,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Ripley talked about resources, seeing every day the teachers and staff not having the resources that they're asking for to help address these problems.

2457
03:27:30,996 --> 03:27:33,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, again, that's something that for me personally, I think is,

2458
03:27:35,814 --> 03:27:38,857
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm going to keep hammering on is trying to get more resources into the building.

2459
03:27:39,237 --> 03:27:39,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2460
03:27:39,857 --> 03:27:40,118
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2461
03:27:40,678 --> 03:27:43,080
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to Jada Higgins on Zoom.

2462
03:27:43,220 --> 03:27:44,141
[SPEAKER_28]: I will unmute you.

2463
03:27:44,161 --> 03:27:46,043
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

2464
03:27:46,063 --> 03:27:51,227
[SPEAKER_28]: And I also do want to note, if there's anyone who does not feel comfortable giving their address, they can message it to the clerk privately.

2465
03:27:51,367 --> 03:27:55,310
[SPEAKER_28]: So going to Jada Higgins, if you are still there.

2466
03:27:55,330 --> 03:27:56,511
[SPEAKER_28]: I know your hand's been up for a while.

2467
03:28:02,877 --> 03:28:03,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Trying to unmute you.

2468
03:28:09,771 --> 03:28:10,732
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll come back to you.

2469
03:28:10,812 --> 03:28:14,075
[SPEAKER_28]: If you're on Zoom, your hands up and find your way back to your screen.

2470
03:28:14,596 --> 03:28:15,136

[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Chairman, members of the City Council, Mr. City Clerk.

2475

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

[SPEAKER_01]: We represent all of the Medford Public Schools custodians, security, staff, assistant principals, coordinators, directors, and others.

2477
03:28:46,444 --> 03:28:51,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot tonight about what happened 30 years ago, what happened

2478
03:28:52,239 --> 03:29:01,061
[SPEAKER_01]: When when other people were kids that and I, I wrote down some of the things were said this is a national issue this has been going on for years.

2479
03:29:02,093 --> 03:29:04,774
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been 30 years of issues.

2480
03:29:04,914 --> 03:29:06,995
[SPEAKER_01]: School violence has been around for a while.

2481
03:29:07,015 --> 03:29:09,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I was assaulted in middle school.

2482
03:29:09,335 --> 03:29:13,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, none of that is relevant to what's going on now.

2483
03:29:13,557 --> 03:29:22,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with someone said earlier, we're talking about right here, right now, and issues with the children in this community not being safe.

2484
03:29:22,180 --> 03:29:24,040
[SPEAKER_01]: No one cares what happened 30 years ago.

2485
03:29:24,520 --> 03:29:26,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not relevant to what we're talking about.

2486
03:29:30,208 --> 03:29:33,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear people comparing what's going on now to many years ago.

2487
03:29:34,111 --> 03:29:40,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I've represented employees in this city, in this school system since 2007 and worked very closely.

2488
03:29:40,977 --> 03:29:45,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the high school every week for different various reasons.

2489
03:29:46,361 --> 03:29:58,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I always do when I come here and I've come to talk about these issues in the last year, multiple times at city council, multiple times at the school committee, I've had many in-person meetings at

2490
03:29:59,335 --> 03:30:05,240
[SPEAKER_01]: the high school with central administration officials regarding security issues.

2491
03:30:06,101 --> 03:30:10,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I wanna start giving you some facts and then I'm going to give you some facts in writing.

2492
03:30:12,527 --> 03:30:15,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, there was an overdose yesterday, which is disturbing to me.

2493
03:30:17,311 --> 03:30:21,875
[SPEAKER_01]: There are guns and knives in Medford High School, and I've been saying that for years.

2494
03:30:23,077 --> 03:30:25,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And yesterday, the stabbing,

2495
03:30:27,164 --> 03:30:28,825
[SPEAKER_01]: prove that that is true.

2496
03:30:29,005 --> 03:30:31,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can bang the gavel, but that's a fact.

2497
03:30:31,245 --> 03:30:32,625
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a stabbing yesterday.

2498
03:30:33,926 --> 03:30:40,447
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hundreds of kids that roam the halls on any given day, and loiter in the bathrooms.

2499
03:30:41,527 --> 03:30:49,489
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group of kids that congregate in the bathrooms and wait for unsuspecting students to come in, and they bully them or beat them up or threaten them.

2500
03:30:49,709 --> 03:30:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens often, all the time, and the administration's aware of it.

2501
03:30:55,143 --> 03:31:03,465
[SPEAKER_01]: School employees, and I've talked to dozens of my members in the last two days, checking on them, seeing what's going on.

2502
03:31:04,545 --> 03:31:10,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of them have expressed to me, these are the employees of Medford Public Schools, that they're afraid.

2503
03:31:10,906 --> 03:31:13,726
[SPEAKER_01]: They're afraid to go to work.

2504
03:31:14,106 --> 03:31:15,647
[SPEAKER_01]: School employees are being threatened.

2505
03:31:16,067 --> 03:31:17,747
[SPEAKER_01]: School employees are being assaulted.

2506
03:31:20,008 --> 03:31:22,528
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fights and assaults every day.

2507
03:31:23,277 --> 03:31:24,218
[SPEAKER_01]: at Medford High School.

2508
03:31:24,258 --> 03:31:36,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you recently I was at a meeting, a security meeting by the way, and one of my security staff was there and twice in 20 minutes she got called away on a radio to altercations.

2509
03:31:37,226 --> 03:31:43,030
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a woman and evidently they want her to break up fights and she has no formal training.

2510
03:31:44,852 --> 03:31:46,833
[SPEAKER_01]: There's graffiti daily in the bathrooms.

2511
03:31:47,708 --> 03:31:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no documentation of this.

2512
03:31:52,030 --> 03:31:54,611
[SPEAKER_01]: The staff are just told to paint over it.

2513
03:31:55,352 --> 03:32:01,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've instructed my members, your employees, to now take pictures of it and document these things.

2514
03:32:01,455 --> 03:32:03,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into reporting in a minute.

2515
03:32:05,117 --> 03:32:13,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the problem with these assaults on staff and on students is there's a policy that the staff aren't allowed to touch the students.

2516
03:32:13,979 --> 03:32:17,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there's a fight, you're not supposed to break it up.

2517
03:32:17,800 --> 03:32:20,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is being reiterated to my members.

2518
03:32:22,982 --> 03:32:24,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about reporting.

2519
03:32:24,603 --> 03:32:26,544
[SPEAKER_01]: There's incidents every day at the high school.

2520
03:32:26,584 --> 03:32:38,588
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no formal reporting system at the high school for the incidents where students are telling my members and school employees to F themselves, F off every single day.

2521
03:32:39,929 --> 03:32:41,709
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't listen to them.

2522
03:32:42,029 --> 03:32:43,270
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no consequences.

2523
03:32:44,731 --> 03:32:55,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I talk to my members, which are your employees, about how these are being reported, they talk to their superiors and they say, okay, and that's it.

2524
03:32:55,981 --> 03:32:57,502
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not asked to fill out forms.

2525
03:32:58,343 --> 03:33:09,353
[SPEAKER_01]: So we created our own reporting form, Teamsters Local 25 Employee Work-Related Incident Report, which now our members

2526
03:33:10,831 --> 03:33:14,492
[SPEAKER_01]: effective recently, filling these out anytime there's an issue.

2527
03:33:14,552 --> 03:33:19,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not going to allow the central administration anymore to brush all these issues every day under the rug.

2528
03:33:20,253 --> 03:33:26,434
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to track them because the school committee and the school administration is not tracking them.

2529
03:33:26,494 --> 03:33:30,175
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fact that we want to talk about for a second.

2530
03:33:30,195 --> 03:33:35,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's getting late, but I want to talk about how long this has been going on.

2531
03:33:35,736 --> 03:33:36,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about

2532
03:33:37,352 --> 03:33:40,253
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to the meetings and speaking to the council and the school committee.

2533
03:33:41,333 --> 03:33:43,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought an agenda today, which I'd like to hand out.

2534
03:33:45,194 --> 03:33:47,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from exactly one year ago.

2535
03:33:47,275 --> 03:33:56,438
[SPEAKER_28]: To your point, Mr. South, I think people were trying to set context when they spoke about previous years, just as you're trying to set context now.

2536
03:33:56,837 --> 03:33:59,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is relevant, so if you give me a second.

2537
03:33:59,879 --> 03:34:01,220
[SPEAKER_28]: As was what they said before.

2538
03:34:01,360 --> 03:34:02,221
[SPEAKER_28]: As was what they said before.

2539
03:34:02,241 --> 03:34:04,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a meeting about security.

2540
03:34:04,702 --> 03:34:06,003
[SPEAKER_28]: As was what they said before.

2541
03:34:06,043 --> 03:34:07,184
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to make that clear.

2542
03:34:07,224 --> 03:34:08,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you make clear whatever you want.

2543
03:34:08,745 --> 03:34:09,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

2544
03:34:09,566 --> 03:34:10,286
[SPEAKER_28]: Vice President Bears.

2545
03:34:10,306 --> 03:34:11,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

2546
03:34:12,548 --> 03:34:19,733
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea that we shouldn't contextualize an issue and analyze it to find solutions.

2547
03:34:20,393 --> 03:34:22,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, what happened in the past is relevant.

2548
03:34:22,475 --> 03:34:23,375
[SPEAKER_08]: You're doing it right now.

2549
03:34:23,415 --> 03:34:24,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make that point.

2550
03:34:26,087 --> 03:34:32,649
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a meeting and the heading says, City of Medford School Security Issues, December 16, 2021.

2551
03:34:33,850 --> 03:34:36,071
[SPEAKER_01]: One year ago, exactly.

2552
03:34:36,451 --> 03:34:37,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a point to this.

2553
03:34:38,291 --> 03:34:39,812
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 13 bullet points on this.

2554
03:34:39,892 --> 03:34:50,516
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a meeting with top central administration officials, myself and my two stewards, Kevin and Bill, who is now retired.

2555
03:34:51,036 --> 03:34:53,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we have zero security guards.

2556
03:34:53,317 --> 03:34:55,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Mazek is retiring after 47 years.

2557
03:34:56,604 --> 03:35:02,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we still have zero security guards because that position has now been eliminated as of 2022.

2558
03:35:02,385 --> 03:35:06,246
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very relevant to what we're talking about today.

2559
03:35:06,586 --> 03:35:09,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, the city's having monitors.

2560
03:35:09,407 --> 03:35:11,227
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people that sit at the front desk.

2561
03:35:11,887 --> 03:35:18,669
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them are in their 70s, perform security guard work from monitor pay, 17.50 an hour.

2562
03:35:19,609 --> 03:35:25,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, and by the way, there's still 17.50 an hour because our contract's been expired over a year.

2563
03:35:26,209 --> 03:35:32,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, no security training is being provided to monitors who are being asked to perform security guard functions.

2564
03:35:33,014 --> 03:35:35,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a year ago to this day, this is relevant.

2565
03:35:36,296 --> 03:35:43,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They've hired four new security monitors this school year, zero training, not one speck of training, nothing.

2566
03:35:43,881 --> 03:35:44,582
[SPEAKER_01]: That's relevant.

2567
03:35:46,023 --> 03:35:53,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, it says the city never replaced Joe Miseraca school security monitor that retired before the school year began.

2568
03:35:53,788 --> 03:35:55,449
[SPEAKER_01]: We're shorthanded in the monitor group.

2569
03:35:56,032 --> 03:35:58,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relevant because today we're still shorthanded.

2570
03:35:58,152 --> 03:35:59,213
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still vacancies.

2571
03:35:59,673 --> 03:36:00,813
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not fully staffed.

2572
03:36:01,593 --> 03:36:03,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of the poor pay.

2573
03:36:03,654 --> 03:36:07,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five, the schools are unsafe due to lack of security.

2574
03:36:08,095 --> 03:36:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: No guards and no school resource officer.

2575
03:36:11,395 --> 03:36:20,938
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time last year, we had no school resource officer because he was out injured and the school committee and the administration chose not to replace him.

2576
03:36:21,298 --> 03:36:22,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had no security guards.

2577
03:36:24,403 --> 03:36:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: and no police in the school.

2578
03:36:26,724 --> 03:36:36,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Number six, after school security at door 31 has been canceled since school has been back to full-time in-person learning.

2579
03:36:37,131 --> 03:36:39,773
[SPEAKER_01]: In nice weather, the door is propped open with a cone.

2580
03:36:40,713 --> 03:36:44,996
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cold weather, it is left unlocked and anyone can walk in uncontested.

2581
03:36:45,236 --> 03:36:48,418
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I ask when you talk about security issues like that, you not be so specific.

2582
03:36:48,878 --> 03:36:50,179
[SPEAKER_28]: It makes it more vulnerable and dangerous.

2583
03:36:50,239 --> 03:36:53,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a fact we used to for many years we had security

2584
03:36:53,863 --> 03:37:02,188
[SPEAKER_01]: at the back door anytime there were school activities going on, the school committee canceled it.

2585
03:37:03,469 --> 03:37:08,312
[SPEAKER_01]: The dangerous situation is being caused by the school committee and the central administration.

2586
03:37:08,372 --> 03:37:16,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Number seven, the kids have been coming increasingly bold since the city stopped suspensions and expulsions this school year.

2587
03:37:17,077 --> 03:37:23,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Example, a student recently told Janet who's a monitor to suck his blank

2588
03:37:24,110 --> 03:37:25,871
[SPEAKER_01]: when she told them to go back to class.

2589
03:37:25,932 --> 03:37:28,333
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no discipline for that.

2590
03:37:28,373 --> 03:37:30,835
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens every day, every single day.

2591
03:37:30,855 --> 03:37:32,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to today, very relevant.

2592
03:37:32,997 --> 03:37:40,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Number eight, there's an extraordinary amount of violence in the schools, on the buses and at Playstead Park after school.

2593
03:37:40,703 --> 03:37:44,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This is due to number one through six above, not COVID.

2594
03:37:47,769 --> 03:37:53,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Number nine, anyone such as kids that don't attend Medford High School can walk right into the school in the morning

2595
03:37:54,130 --> 03:37:58,415
[SPEAKER_01]: As the students don't have to show IDs, the doors are open, everyone walks right in.

2596
03:37:58,455 --> 03:38:00,056
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one person at the front desk.

2597
03:38:00,737 --> 03:38:04,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 10, there are not metal detectors in the high school.

2598
03:38:04,581 --> 03:38:06,283
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about this for years.

2599
03:38:06,904 --> 03:38:12,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that last night after I left, people were saying from the school committee, this would take too long.

2600
03:38:13,031 --> 03:38:15,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't care how long it takes.

2601
03:38:15,779 --> 03:38:20,440
[SPEAKER_01]: When people are bringing weapons into the schools, there should be metal detectors.

2602
03:38:20,800 --> 03:38:27,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there's talk in the State House right now of rolling that out in parts of Massachusetts.

2603
03:38:28,262 --> 03:38:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 11, no training is being provided.

2604
03:38:31,903 --> 03:38:37,824
[SPEAKER_01]: As detailed in Article 23, our employees are not being provided the tools to perform their jobs to the best of their ability.

2605
03:38:38,104 --> 03:38:40,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, zero training to the new employees.

2606
03:38:41,085 --> 03:38:42,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people talk about

2607
03:38:44,015 --> 03:38:50,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard last night school committee members talking about how amazing of a job the security people and other people did.

2608
03:38:50,819 --> 03:38:54,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's obviously instinct because it's not from training and they did do a great job.

2609
03:38:55,221 --> 03:39:06,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And I commend all the teachers and staff that operated and conducted themselves in an amazing fashion yesterday to keep the kids safe, but it's not from training.

2610
03:39:07,867 --> 03:39:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 12, in years past,

2611
03:39:10,014 --> 03:39:18,479
[SPEAKER_01]: When the city has had security drills, they do not include the security monitors or custodians, even though they are the first line of defense in an emergency.

2612
03:39:20,220 --> 03:39:23,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And number 13, there's no phone in the custodial break room.

2613
03:39:24,863 --> 03:39:30,587
[SPEAKER_01]: When the radios are down, just like yesterday, they can't communicate with management as cell phones don't work in the high school.

2614
03:39:31,047 --> 03:39:35,530
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I gave this document, this is a meeting we had one year ago exactly.

2615
03:39:35,710 --> 03:39:36,911
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had meetings since then.

2616
03:39:36,931 --> 03:39:39,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken at the meeting since then.

2617
03:39:39,554 --> 03:39:41,535
[SPEAKER_01]: and exactly nothing has been done.

2618
03:39:41,595 --> 03:39:48,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Not one through 13, not one single bullet point has been addressed.

2619
03:39:48,919 --> 03:39:52,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that obviously people aren't doing their jobs.

2620
03:39:53,181 --> 03:39:56,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So you heard earlier, people should step up or step down.

2621
03:39:56,523 --> 03:39:57,203
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fact.

2622
03:39:57,984 --> 03:39:59,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an election in less than a year.

2623
03:39:59,785 --> 03:40:04,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know this community will force that issue if things aren't done correctly.

2624
03:40:05,088 --> 03:40:07,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll end with this.

2625
03:40:09,261 --> 03:40:17,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the most disturbing thing I saw last night was the lack of compassion and empathy for the families and students in the city of Method.

2626
03:40:18,128 --> 03:40:29,877
[SPEAKER_01]: You had parents that were here that were dealt with petrified students yesterday, upset families, parents that drove to the high school and sat outside for hours just to make sure their kids were safe.

2627
03:40:29,917 --> 03:40:35,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw school committee members yesterday arguing with parents at the microphone.

2628
03:40:35,681 --> 03:40:37,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw one school committee member

2629
03:40:37,418 --> 03:40:43,542
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the hand gesture and saying, blah, blah, blah from the seat, that's disrespectful.

2630
03:40:43,723 --> 03:40:50,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear the same people talking about community and being in unity and coming together to find solutions.

2631
03:40:51,408 --> 03:41:01,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, lead by example, show some sympathy and empathy to these families that were literally afraid whether their child was going to come home yesterday.

2632
03:41:02,296 --> 03:41:06,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the news every day, the shootings and stabbings all over the country.

2633
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:16,165
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a little tact and show some respect to the people that elected you to your positions.

2634
03:41:17,346 --> 03:41:35,059
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I'll say is this, there's been a lot of talk last night, a lot of talk tonight, but what everyone really wants to see in this community, especially the families and the students and people's neighbors and everybody, they wanna see action, let's hire some,

2635
03:41:35,544 --> 03:41:36,264
[SPEAKER_01]: security guards.

2636
03:41:36,304 --> 03:41:37,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bring them back.

2637
03:41:37,024 --> 03:41:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have over a dozen of them.

2638
03:41:38,445 --> 03:41:42,726
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have a security guard or more than one in every single school.

2639
03:41:42,886 --> 03:41:45,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have zero in any of the schools.

2640
03:41:46,047 --> 03:41:48,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have more school resource officers.

2641
03:41:48,368 --> 03:41:49,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have more police in the community.

2642
03:41:50,228 --> 03:41:57,030
[SPEAKER_01]: We're severely short-staffed in police and fire and DPW and teachers all over the community.

2643
03:41:57,190 --> 03:41:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Every position is short-staffed.

2644
03:42:00,491 --> 03:42:03,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fully fund these positions that matter most

2645
03:42:04,130 --> 03:42:07,393
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep the community, especially the children safe.

2646
03:42:08,734 --> 03:42:09,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see action.

2647
03:42:10,455 --> 03:42:11,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk is great.

2648
03:42:11,536 --> 03:42:12,777
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great at the water cooler.

2649
03:42:12,817 --> 03:42:14,058
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great at the coffee shop.

2650
03:42:14,418 --> 03:42:15,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see action.

2651
03:42:15,419 --> 03:42:16,840
[SPEAKER_01]: The families want to see action.

2652
03:42:17,360 --> 03:42:22,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I respectfully ask all of you to do what you can in your capacity.

2653
03:42:22,224 --> 03:42:30,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're not members of the school committee, but use your power and your influence and your skills that you have many.

2654
03:42:31,994 --> 03:42:35,418
[SPEAKER_01]: and find ways to put action in place, not just talk.

2655
03:42:35,718 --> 03:42:38,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you all for your kind attention.

2656
03:42:38,841 --> 03:42:39,602
[SPEAKER_28]: This is embarrassing.

2657
03:42:39,802 --> 03:42:41,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

2658
03:42:41,924 --> 03:42:43,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. South.

2659
03:42:43,246 --> 03:42:50,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you acknowledging the national scope of the issue and the need for significant funding, considering the massive underfunding of our city government.

2660
03:42:51,034 --> 03:42:54,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had one question, which is, who wrote this document?

2661
03:42:57,364 --> 03:43:03,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I did and I presented it to all the administration officials at Medford High School on that date for the meeting that we held.

2662
03:43:04,170 --> 03:43:04,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2663
03:43:04,410 --> 03:43:04,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2664
03:43:04,951 --> 03:43:05,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I drafted it.

2665
03:43:05,611 --> 03:43:05,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2666
03:43:06,552 --> 03:43:08,293
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go to some folks on zoom and I'll come.

2667
03:43:08,814 --> 03:43:11,596
[SPEAKER_28]: So going to Tony tanks, name and address for the record, please.

2668
03:43:12,877 --> 03:43:14,599
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi, Tony Puccio.

2669
03:43:14,699 --> 03:43:16,220
[SPEAKER_26]: Can you speak after mass?

2670
03:43:17,781 --> 03:43:21,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, you know, a lot of what I have to say is probably better said in front of the school committee, but, um,

2671
03:43:22,659 --> 03:43:26,942
[SPEAKER_26]: this is an opportunity that was presented by Councilor Scarpelli last night.

2672
03:43:26,962 --> 03:43:28,023
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm going to take advantage of it.

2673
03:43:28,123 --> 03:43:31,005
[SPEAKER_26]: And I have a feeling there's going to be a few people on the committee watching anyway.

2674
03:43:31,045 --> 03:43:38,891
[SPEAKER_26]: So I don't believe for a second, any of the school committee members actually wanted this to happen, this incident, but it happened.

2675
03:43:39,791 --> 03:43:41,633
[SPEAKER_26]: It happened under their watch.

2676
03:43:41,913 --> 03:43:46,856
[SPEAKER_26]: It happened in spite of, and in line with the policy they wrote and passed.

2677
03:43:47,997 --> 03:43:48,397
[SPEAKER_26]: It happened

2678
03:43:51,423 --> 03:43:58,491
[SPEAKER_26]: even though all the warnings that many of us have given them repeatedly, it still happens.

2679
03:43:58,871 --> 03:44:09,703
[SPEAKER_26]: The school committee went to self-defense mode and self-preservation mode last night, and it was in no way conducive to the situation that they and us, the community members, are in.

2680
03:44:10,946 --> 03:44:17,407
[SPEAKER_26]: I do commend the committee for lifting the new rules, which are obnoxiously restrictive to community participation.

2681
03:44:17,467 --> 03:44:19,328
[SPEAKER_26]: So for that, I'm thankful.

2682
03:44:19,728 --> 03:44:23,888
[SPEAKER_26]: There's no study that needs to be done that can replace time-tested methods and common sense.

2683
03:44:24,829 --> 03:44:31,910
[SPEAKER_26]: Kids need structure, they need guidance, they need discipline, and they need to experience the consequences that come from the behaviors that warrant it.

2684
03:44:33,170 --> 03:44:38,871
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the most important yet least mentioned factors I've noted while observing the discussion surrounding this trend of violence

2685
03:44:39,403 --> 03:44:42,526
[SPEAKER_26]: in schools is the lack of attention given to parental responsibilities.

2686
03:44:43,706 --> 03:44:45,028
[SPEAKER_26]: Where are the parents during all this?

2687
03:44:45,388 --> 03:44:49,451
[SPEAKER_26]: Are they being held accountable for the actions of their children, or for the most part, minors?

2688
03:44:50,292 --> 03:44:59,999
[SPEAKER_26]: If the school system is serious about correcting this climate of violence, then are there any plans to put in place that hold parents accountable for the behavior of their children?

2689
03:45:01,921 --> 03:45:05,084
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not a school's primary function to be the disciplinarian.

2690
03:45:05,344 --> 03:45:08,086
[SPEAKER_26]: Schools and faculty need to educate

2691
03:45:08,442 --> 03:45:09,482
[SPEAKER_26]: Parents need to parent.

2692
03:45:10,403 --> 03:45:13,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Parents of offenders need to be part of the solution when dispensing punishment.

2693
03:45:14,524 --> 03:45:19,926
[SPEAKER_26]: And along with punishment, there needs to be a way to track and determine if patterns are developing that can be addressed.

2694
03:45:20,986 --> 03:45:22,967
[SPEAKER_26]: There are many community members that have great ideas.

2695
03:45:23,667 --> 03:45:28,209
[SPEAKER_26]: They're not guaranteed solutions, but who knows, something might be worthy of further conversation.

2696
03:45:28,709 --> 03:45:29,690
[SPEAKER_26]: And this study won't cost $50,000.

2697
03:45:31,505 --> 03:45:42,590
[SPEAKER_26]: That plan should include immediate implementation and has to be addressed like an assembly or other means where students are made aware of the rules and clear consequences for further refractions.

2698
03:45:44,271 --> 03:45:50,994
[SPEAKER_26]: I try to be as active as I can as a vocational school graduate, a night school teacher, and more importantly, for the sake of my child's education.

2699
03:45:51,554 --> 03:45:59,618
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've heard from teachers, one of which whom, when I asked, what do you think is a good, solid way to help prevent, one good, solid way to help prevent some of this violence?

2700
03:46:00,128 --> 03:46:01,848
[SPEAKER_26]: And their answer was a pretty attainable one.

2701
03:46:02,488 --> 03:46:06,709
[SPEAKER_26]: They suggested placing cameras at the entrance points to every bathroom in the school.

2702
03:46:07,489 --> 03:46:16,151
[SPEAKER_26]: Even if it's not a full-time monitored camera, having a record of who enters and exits the restrooms would certainly make wrongdoers think twice about causing trouble.

2703
03:46:16,891 --> 03:46:22,172
[SPEAKER_26]: My own child would have benefited from this when an incident took place at several bathrooms throughout the school that affected her.

2704
03:46:22,792 --> 03:46:26,752
[SPEAKER_26]: It would have been a lot easier to identify the perpetrators.

2705
03:46:28,733 --> 03:46:29,593
[SPEAKER_26]: We've heard this before.

2706
03:46:30,270 --> 03:46:31,731
[SPEAKER_26]: Never let a good crisis go to waste.

2707
03:46:32,431 --> 03:46:35,093
[SPEAKER_26]: Medford has enough money when it comes to school safety.

2708
03:46:35,373 --> 03:46:36,955
[SPEAKER_26]: There can be no higher priority.

2709
03:46:38,155 --> 03:46:46,141
[SPEAKER_26]: As Councilors stated, funds need to be reallocated and an in-depth conversation needs to be had to figure out what is more important than safety.

2710
03:46:47,141 --> 03:46:55,167
[SPEAKER_26]: In closing, I'm left to wonder if the funds allocated to change the name of the Columbus school was enough to make the parents of the stabbing victim or the Bramley family feel any safer.

2711
03:46:56,107 --> 03:46:57,428
[SPEAKER_26]: Step up or step down.

2712
03:46:58,229 --> 03:46:58,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2713
03:47:00,725 --> 03:47:03,827
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you going to Nadine on Zoom?

2714
03:47:03,867 --> 03:47:05,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

2715
03:47:10,152 --> 03:47:11,733
[SPEAKER_33]: Nadine Moretti-Burgett-Ev.

2716
03:47:12,174 --> 03:47:16,217
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, President Morell and City Council.

2717
03:47:16,677 --> 03:47:17,138
[SPEAKER_33]: Can you hear me?

2718
03:47:18,058 --> 03:47:18,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, we can hear you.

2719
03:47:18,719 --> 03:47:19,339
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, great.

2720
03:47:19,439 --> 03:47:20,080
[SPEAKER_33]: Just want to make sure.

2721
03:47:20,100 --> 03:47:20,420
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

2722
03:47:20,780 --> 03:47:30,508
[SPEAKER_33]: I just want to say, first of all, thank you so much to Councilor Scarpelli for putting forth this resolution and for all of you listening to him

2723
03:47:31,429 --> 03:47:49,357
[SPEAKER_33]: his supporters, the parents, students, people on Zoom, people that spoke last night, we're all trying to be unified and united in fighting and being behind the mothers and families that are going through the hell they're going through, that have spoken over and over.

2724
03:47:49,377 --> 03:47:57,541
[SPEAKER_33]: And I just want to say that seeing some responses by, you know, Councilor Bears, Councilor Tseng,

2725
03:47:58,857 --> 03:48:09,802
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't feel like anybody really, except for Councilor Knight, Kerr of Yellow, supported Councilor Scarpelli in what is such a simple solution.

2726
03:48:10,502 --> 03:48:12,383
[SPEAKER_33]: It's such a huge problem.

2727
03:48:12,443 --> 03:48:18,586
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think it's not showing anybody that they're united or behind their fellow councilor.

2728
03:48:18,946 --> 03:48:24,729
[SPEAKER_33]: You can have different ideas, but I haven't seen one iota of support for him.

2729
03:48:26,784 --> 03:48:28,265
[SPEAKER_33]: I just find it mind boggling.

2730
03:48:28,345 --> 03:48:37,928
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that the only thing that should matter at this point is the safety of the students at Medford High School, period, end of story.

2731
03:48:38,628 --> 03:48:47,991
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm gonna reiterate what Tony just said, and have the words of the brave young woman last night, step up or step down, and that's it.

2732
03:48:48,531 --> 03:48:53,993
[SPEAKER_33]: So again, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for your amazing resolution and everybody else.

2733
03:48:54,753 --> 03:48:55,233
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks a lot.

2734
03:48:56,988 --> 03:49:00,390
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, going to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

2735
03:49:00,730 --> 03:49:02,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Just gonna step away from the chair briefly.

2736
03:49:05,873 --> 03:49:06,234
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello.

2737
03:49:10,016 --> 03:49:10,516
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

2738
03:49:11,657 --> 03:49:14,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, name and address for the record, Andrew.

2739
03:49:15,019 --> 03:49:15,719
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening.

2740
03:49:16,380 --> 03:49:17,580
[SPEAKER_31]: Maybe it's a bad evening.

2741
03:49:18,041 --> 03:49:20,162
[SPEAKER_31]: It's Andrew P. Castagnetti.

2742
03:49:23,433 --> 03:49:27,496
[SPEAKER_31]: What the hell happened to an abnormal world?

2743
03:49:27,516 --> 03:49:30,578
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just insanity.

2744
03:49:31,499 --> 03:49:33,100
[SPEAKER_31]: I have three simple solutions.

2745
03:49:34,821 --> 03:49:44,849
[SPEAKER_31]: The first solution is to send George Soros back to Hungary, but he is banned from his home country.

2746
03:49:44,929 --> 03:49:46,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's keep it on topic.

2747
03:49:48,146 --> 03:49:52,349
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm on topic, it's part of the problem, there's no respect, including the parents.

2748
03:49:52,849 --> 03:50:03,196
[SPEAKER_31]: Number two solution, sir, Medford High School must be policed and our laws be enforced to the fullest.

2749
03:50:05,497 --> 03:50:16,945
[SPEAKER_31]: And third and last, leaders should fall on the sword and we must hire good leaders with simple common sense, period.

2750
03:50:17,813 --> 03:50:21,354
[SPEAKER_31]: In other words, talk softly but carry a big stick.

2751
03:50:22,874 --> 03:50:23,534
[SPEAKER_31]: We need help.

2752
03:50:25,215 --> 03:50:27,835
[SPEAKER_31]: We need leaders, but we get gamblers instead.

2753
03:50:28,135 --> 03:50:29,636
[SPEAKER_31]: Please help the people.

2754
03:50:30,036 --> 03:50:31,436
[SPEAKER_31]: Protect and serve.

2755
03:50:33,817 --> 03:50:34,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andrew.

2756
03:50:35,717 --> 03:50:36,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Orlando.

2757
03:50:39,218 --> 03:50:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

2758
03:50:40,938 --> 03:50:43,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Richard Orlando, Winford Way.

2759
03:50:45,287 --> 03:50:46,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to school with Andrew.

2760
03:50:46,208 --> 03:50:48,329
[SPEAKER_09]: We never got in trouble because we were always playing baseball.

2761
03:50:48,809 --> 03:50:49,630
[SPEAKER_09]: He was pretty good too.

2762
03:50:49,650 --> 03:50:52,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, cause I've listened to all of this.

2763
03:50:52,652 --> 03:51:10,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I had some thoughts and it's when I hear the discussions about committee council, this is really about the quality of, uh, the value of quality in the city, uh, the safety of citizens, the education system.

2764
03:51:10,324 --> 03:51:13,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be nice to talk about education as opposed to the things we're talking about now?

2765
03:51:15,444 --> 03:51:20,668
[SPEAKER_09]: having a community where families want to continue to live and attract new families.

2766
03:51:21,989 --> 03:51:24,050
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what a lot of this is about.

2767
03:51:24,291 --> 03:51:29,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So organizational division is not about what we need to do.

2768
03:51:29,554 --> 03:51:32,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I had been thinking about another subject.

2769
03:51:32,677 --> 03:51:36,720
[SPEAKER_09]: The gentleman that was just up talked about what the staff puts up with.

2770
03:51:37,580 --> 03:51:41,183
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about the very real student to student bullying.

2771
03:51:41,984 --> 03:51:43,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how do you think as teacher,

2772
03:51:44,332 --> 03:51:53,758
[SPEAKER_09]: an administrator, a custodian feels when they're confronted with vulgar language, disrespected when they're told, when their class is disrupted.

2773
03:51:55,659 --> 03:52:02,724
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration and school committee, I think is also allowing bullying of the staff.

2774
03:52:04,445 --> 03:52:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so obvious what's going on.

2775
03:52:09,948 --> 03:52:12,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I think leadership

2776
03:52:13,703 --> 03:52:14,804
[SPEAKER_09]: is not a title.

2777
03:52:15,945 --> 03:52:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not about an organization you're a part of.

2778
03:52:18,667 --> 03:52:20,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about what you bring to the table.

2779
03:52:21,209 --> 03:52:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And leaders come from many different walks.

2780
03:52:24,532 --> 03:52:36,621
[SPEAKER_09]: And I challenge anybody on any of our elected bodies to step up and demonstrate leadership, regardless of if it fits into the box that their title is.

2781
03:52:37,822 --> 03:52:43,006
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you really look at, and you heard it tonight, there are many people

2782
03:52:43,700 --> 03:52:47,342
[SPEAKER_09]: in the community that is sitting and willing to help and work with you.

2783
03:52:48,023 --> 03:52:49,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So take advantage of that.

2784
03:52:49,504 --> 03:52:53,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those that choose to lead, stand up or leave.

2785
03:52:56,067 --> 03:53:02,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, one of the things I keep hearing tonight, some people don't feel comfortable talking.

2786
03:53:03,012 --> 03:53:08,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I remember a book I read years ago, and it said, who will do the hard things?

2787
03:53:09,936 --> 03:53:11,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And the answer was those that can.

2788
03:53:12,782 --> 03:53:16,364
[SPEAKER_09]: And right there, you're looking at people that can.

2789
03:53:16,964 --> 03:53:21,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And others who can't speak can work behind the scenes.

2790
03:53:22,127 --> 03:53:29,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think there are many ways to do this, but I think people need to step up and lead.

2791
03:53:30,591 --> 03:53:32,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all I have to say.

2792
03:53:32,472 --> 03:53:32,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2793
03:53:32,892 --> 03:53:38,035
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2794
03:53:38,055 --> 03:53:39,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record, please.

2795
03:53:42,930 --> 03:53:45,592
[SPEAKER_16]: John Petrella, 61 Locust Street, Method.

2796
03:53:48,395 --> 03:53:53,099
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm gonna start out with step up or step down.

2797
03:53:54,620 --> 03:53:56,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's the best way to start out.

2798
03:53:57,002 --> 03:53:59,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I went to the school committee meeting last night.

2799
03:53:59,484 --> 03:54:01,125
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been to other school committee meetings.

2800
03:54:03,387 --> 03:54:08,592
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, you go there and I listen and my stomach turns.

2801
03:54:09,913 --> 03:54:11,034
[SPEAKER_16]: I get up, I speak.

2802
03:54:11,994 --> 03:54:20,721
[SPEAKER_16]: my stomach turns and then, I mean, this is really serious stuff, okay?

2803
03:54:21,302 --> 03:54:22,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Heartfelt stuff.

2804
03:54:23,984 --> 03:54:38,616
[SPEAKER_16]: And I left the school committee meeting and I got home and my stomach turns more because it's like, it's just,

2805
03:54:39,674 --> 03:54:42,856
[SPEAKER_16]: nothing got accomplished at that meeting last night.

2806
03:54:43,876 --> 03:54:57,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, you're just, you know, people went, they spoke from their hearts, they spoke what they felt and you walk out of there and it's like, they didn't listen to us.

2807
03:54:58,203 --> 03:54:59,283
[SPEAKER_16]: They ignored us.

2808
03:54:59,343 --> 03:55:00,524
[SPEAKER_16]: They argue with you.

2809
03:55:01,564 --> 03:55:02,865
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, it's not right.

2810
03:55:03,465 --> 03:55:03,965
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

2811
03:55:04,425 --> 03:55:05,466
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not right.

2812
03:55:05,866 --> 03:55:07,627
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we're dealing with serious stuff.

2813
03:55:09,302 --> 03:55:14,323
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I came here tonight, you know, the same thing.

2814
03:55:14,663 --> 03:55:17,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping something's going to get accomplished tonight.

2815
03:55:19,365 --> 03:55:22,305
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just two stories of many.

2816
03:55:22,626 --> 03:55:23,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2817
03:55:23,586 --> 03:55:30,668
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I want to go back and just say, all right, my politics should have nothing to do with anything.

2818
03:55:31,028 --> 03:55:31,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2819
03:55:31,908 --> 03:55:32,828
[SPEAKER_16]: They really shouldn't.

2820
03:55:33,208 --> 03:55:33,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2821
03:55:34,189 --> 03:55:34,389
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2822
03:55:34,429 --> 03:55:35,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me establish that first.

2823
03:55:37,768 --> 03:55:40,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone knows what my politics are, okay?

2824
03:55:41,770 --> 03:55:47,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I disagree with her, I disagree with Zach, I disagree with this revolution stuff.

2825
03:55:48,593 --> 03:55:49,674
[SPEAKER_16]: I do, okay?

2826
03:55:50,514 --> 03:55:55,837
[SPEAKER_16]: But the school committee got elected, okay?

2827
03:55:56,697 --> 03:55:58,998
[SPEAKER_16]: And you people are elected, okay?

2828
03:55:59,779 --> 03:55:59,899
[SPEAKER_16]: And

2829
03:56:01,781 --> 03:56:03,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to see anyone fail.

2830
03:56:04,562 --> 03:56:13,084
[SPEAKER_16]: No one in this city wants to see anyone feel I've lived here my whole life and I've been privileged to live here my whole life.

2831
03:56:13,184 --> 03:56:13,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I really have.

2832
03:56:14,785 --> 03:56:15,545
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been great.

2833
03:56:16,105 --> 03:56:22,207
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, you know, I hear people talking about 20 years, uh, you know, back in the high school and on and on and on.

2834
03:56:22,267 --> 03:56:22,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2835
03:56:23,767 --> 03:56:24,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Times have changed.

2836
03:56:24,947 --> 03:56:25,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Things are different.

2837
03:56:25,928 --> 03:56:27,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand all that.

2838
03:56:27,168 --> 03:56:27,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2839
03:56:28,328 --> 03:56:28,488
[SPEAKER_16]: But

2840
03:56:31,360 --> 03:56:34,003
[SPEAKER_16]: The revolution, let's, let's, let's call it what it is.

2841
03:56:34,063 --> 03:56:37,046
[SPEAKER_16]: The revolution, the agenda, the agenda.

2842
03:56:37,086 --> 03:56:38,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I call it the agenda.

2843
03:56:39,128 --> 03:56:39,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2844
03:56:39,935 --> 03:56:46,281
[SPEAKER_16]: I was more than willing to see what happens and I wanna see everyone succeed.

2845
03:56:47,182 --> 03:56:49,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I love successful people, okay?

2846
03:56:49,745 --> 03:56:59,574
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want no one to feel, but I'm telling you, this agenda, agenda, agenda, agenda, okay?

2847
03:56:59,854 --> 03:57:01,516
[SPEAKER_16]: No discipline in the high school.

2848
03:57:01,536 --> 03:57:04,259
[SPEAKER_16]: I can go on and on, I can go on for hours, okay?

2849
03:57:05,339 --> 03:57:06,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Override two and a half.

2850
03:57:07,060 --> 03:57:09,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Half the city is broke.

2851
03:57:09,881 --> 03:57:11,102
[SPEAKER_16]: We're pushing money.

2852
03:57:11,202 --> 03:57:12,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I hear more money, more money.

2853
03:57:13,263 --> 03:57:15,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Where is our money going now?

2854
03:57:15,784 --> 03:57:17,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Where are our tax dollars going?

2855
03:57:18,305 --> 03:57:20,006
[SPEAKER_16]: No one can answer the question.

2856
03:57:21,747 --> 03:57:27,149
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to get back to the school situation because I can go all over the place here.

2857
03:57:27,489 --> 03:57:28,129
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to.

2858
03:57:31,038 --> 03:57:32,899
[SPEAKER_16]: We're feeling, okay?

2859
03:57:32,959 --> 03:57:36,741
[SPEAKER_16]: This agenda is feeling the city, okay?

2860
03:57:37,282 --> 03:57:39,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I listened to George, okay?

2861
03:57:39,463 --> 03:57:42,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I listened to Rick tonight, and I listened to Adam.

2862
03:57:43,005 --> 03:57:50,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hear common sense, things that I can compute in my mind, and this is what we need to do.

2863
03:57:51,190 --> 03:57:53,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I hear other stuff.

2864
03:57:53,571 --> 03:57:54,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's support George.

2865
03:57:54,732 --> 03:57:56,653
[SPEAKER_16]: I think George got some great ideas.

2866
03:57:57,354 --> 03:57:59,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are we not supporting him?

2867
03:58:00,958 --> 03:58:02,479
[SPEAKER_28]: We're hearing his resolution right now.

2868
03:58:05,481 --> 03:58:08,303
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a number of resolutions on the agenda we haven't gotten to yet.

2869
03:58:08,583 --> 03:58:09,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we haven't got to it.

2870
03:58:09,804 --> 03:58:14,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't there something on the agenda two weeks ago that we didn't pass?

2871
03:58:14,527 --> 03:58:17,790
[SPEAKER_16]: It failed, I believe four to three that had to do with the school.

2872
03:58:18,650 --> 03:58:19,691
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it passed.

2873
03:58:19,891 --> 03:58:21,372
[SPEAKER_28]: It passed with changes or something.

2874
03:58:21,392 --> 03:58:23,033
[SPEAKER_28]: You're welcome to watch the tape back.

2875
03:58:31,716 --> 03:58:33,837
[SPEAKER_08]: safety, social, emotional health, and support.

2876
03:58:33,877 --> 03:58:36,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, no, I understand all that.

2877
03:58:36,399 --> 03:58:37,760
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to get into that, Zach.

2878
03:58:37,840 --> 03:58:41,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, because that's just addressing the problem.

2879
03:58:41,722 --> 03:58:46,565
[SPEAKER_16]: The social emotional is, in my opinion, that's another big part of the problem.

2880
03:58:47,005 --> 03:58:49,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Discipline, that's what we should be talking about.

2881
03:58:50,247 --> 03:58:51,448
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what needs to be done.

2882
03:58:51,488 --> 03:58:54,230
[SPEAKER_16]: But we don't want to discipline anyone anymore.

2883
03:58:54,630 --> 03:58:56,311
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bad thing.

2884
03:58:57,292 --> 03:58:58,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad thing.

2885
03:58:59,313 --> 03:59:00,734
[SPEAKER_16]: We're failing, that's all.

2886
03:59:01,807 --> 03:59:03,468
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the bottom line, okay?

2887
03:59:03,548 --> 03:59:04,709
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not working.

2888
03:59:05,089 --> 03:59:10,512
[SPEAKER_16]: If your agenda or the agenda that we all want was working, I'd be up here, thank God.

2889
03:59:10,592 --> 03:59:11,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, fine.

2890
03:59:12,534 --> 03:59:13,934
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not working.

2891
03:59:14,375 --> 03:59:16,516
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not working for the city of Method.

2892
03:59:17,056 --> 03:59:17,497
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.

2893
03:59:17,857 --> 03:59:18,757
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

2894
03:59:19,218 --> 03:59:20,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Step up or step down.

2895
03:59:26,982 --> 03:59:28,183
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

2896
03:59:28,223 --> 03:59:29,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

2897
03:59:30,533 --> 03:59:40,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so my two boys are out of school now and yesterday my phone, when it was blowing up, all that I got was text messages, uh, saying, you know, aren't you glad our kids are out of here?

2898
03:59:40,860 --> 03:59:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately for me, that's not the truth.

2899
03:59:43,302 --> 03:59:46,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a seven year old second grade in seven short years.

2900
03:59:46,765 --> 03:59:48,086
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to be up at that high school.

2901
03:59:48,666 --> 03:59:53,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, uh, little girl who is really here was very instrumental in, in her beginning.

2902
03:59:53,289 --> 03:59:53,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2903
03:59:54,070 --> 03:59:58,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when we talk about leadership, it, we talked about elected, we talk about elected officials,

2904
03:59:58,942 --> 04:00:11,296
[SPEAKER_03]: We should talk about, um, you know, some of the, some of the things, you know, when an elected official goes on a zoom meeting and says a pocket knife is really not a suspendable offense.

2905
04:00:12,037 --> 04:00:13,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And look what happened yesterday.

2906
04:00:13,098 --> 04:00:16,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody got stabbed when that same elected official post pitches.

2907
04:00:19,417 --> 04:00:22,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Keep it keep it keep it to the schools, and we're not going to go through.

2908
04:00:22,920 --> 04:00:25,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, electric and electric.

2909
04:00:25,582 --> 04:00:28,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're going to do.

2910
04:00:28,604 --> 04:00:28,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2911
04:00:29,084 --> 04:00:30,125
[SPEAKER_28]: Please.

2912
04:00:30,145 --> 04:00:31,846
[SPEAKER_28]: You want to show it around.

2913
04:00:36,087 --> 04:00:44,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Giglio, Mr. Giglio, please speak into the mic, focus on the schools or I'll ask you to stop.

2914
04:00:44,952 --> 04:00:46,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Please come back to the schools.

2915
04:00:46,832 --> 04:00:49,194
[SPEAKER_28]: You wanna come back to the issue at hand, come back to the issue at hand.

2916
04:00:49,214 --> 04:00:53,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going through everyone's social media.

2917
04:00:53,736 --> 04:00:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't go with messages like this.

2918
04:00:55,437 --> 04:00:57,998
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, focus on the schools.

2919
04:00:58,098 --> 04:01:00,079
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not going through everyone's social media tonight.

2920
04:01:00,680 --> 04:01:02,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it back.

2921
04:01:04,124 --> 04:01:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: when that elected official on a school Zoom meeting says that bringing a pocket knife is not a suspendable offense.

2922
04:01:15,026 --> 04:01:15,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And look what happened yesterday.

2923
04:01:16,467 --> 04:01:19,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Is now a pocket knife a suspendable offense?

2924
04:01:22,128 --> 04:01:23,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Completely out of context statement.

2925
04:01:24,028 --> 04:01:24,308
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2926
04:01:24,328 --> 04:01:26,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear that, I'm sorry.

2927
04:01:28,449 --> 04:01:28,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

2928
04:01:29,669 --> 04:01:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I just said it's completely out of context,

2929
04:01:32,594 --> 04:01:33,695
[SPEAKER_08]: for your political ends.

2930
04:01:34,296 --> 04:01:35,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

2931
04:01:35,336 --> 04:01:43,984
[SPEAKER_08]: It's incredibly easy for people to take their own politics and map them onto any situation they want and then use it to justify or blame people for results.

2932
04:01:44,484 --> 04:01:44,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2933
04:01:44,644 --> 04:01:55,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But when people, when kids hear that taking a pocket knife to school is not a suspendable offense, what do you think might happen? 

2934
04:01:56,195 --> 04:01:57,156
[SPEAKER_08]: When people say that out of context and repeat it and repeat it over again to rile people up.

2935
04:01:57,176 --> 04:02:01,680
[SPEAKER_03]: What's out of context?

2936
04:02:01,720 --> 04:02:02,500
[SPEAKER_03]: What's out of context?

2937
04:02:02,560 --> 04:02:06,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch the video you can see for yourself.

2938
04:02:06,524 --> 04:02:09,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to send you the video tonight?

2939
04:02:10,967 --> 04:02:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely you won't watch it though.

2940
04:02:13,329 --> 04:02:14,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And you won't respond like always.

2941
04:02:14,650 --> 04:02:15,871
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all I want to say.

2942
04:02:15,891 --> 04:02:19,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Leadership starts at the top and it doesn't start with stuff like this.

2943
04:02:19,294 --> 04:02:20,455
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for listening to me.

2944
04:02:28,305 --> 04:02:30,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Name and address for the record, please.

2945
04:02:30,166 --> 04:02:31,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2946
04:02:31,106 --> 04:02:34,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor, and I'll keep it quick because I have a little one at home.

2947
04:02:35,688 --> 04:02:39,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here as a parent, but my child is not even in school yet.

2948
04:02:40,290 --> 04:02:43,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here because I'm looking at, do I want my child to go to Medford Public Schools?

2949
04:02:44,452 --> 04:02:45,912
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife asked me a question last night.

2950
04:02:46,612 --> 04:02:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, because she read and saw everything on the news.

2951
04:02:49,774 --> 04:02:54,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So in fact, Councilor Scarpelli, I may ask you a couple of things to get through the chaff.

2952
04:02:56,411 --> 04:02:58,552
[SPEAKER_04]: What we saw in the news was it was three hours.

2953
04:02:58,952 --> 04:02:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: People were in lockdown.

2954
04:03:00,092 --> 04:03:02,293
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no official communication on what happened.

2955
04:03:02,954 --> 04:03:08,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way that students could communicate to their parents was with this.

2956
04:03:09,796 --> 04:03:11,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that pretty accurate, sir?

2957
04:03:12,718 --> 04:03:14,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2958
04:03:14,558 --> 04:03:15,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate these.

2959
04:03:17,800 --> 04:03:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: What really bothered me and when I saw Councilor Caraviello this morning, first question came to my mind.

2960
04:03:25,731 --> 04:03:27,312
[SPEAKER_04]: why were people doing this?

2961
04:03:28,212 --> 04:03:40,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will respectfully disagree with you in the terms of what happened 30 years ago and so on and so forth when I was in high school and longer when you were, because I think there are things we can learn from that, especially in policy.

2962
04:03:41,577 --> 04:03:47,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, situations change, environments change, technology changes, and policies change.

2963
04:03:48,359 --> 04:03:54,001
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't mean that maybe all the changes that we have made are good, and maybe we can learn from history

2964
04:03:55,342 --> 04:03:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: and try to tweak things for the better.

2965
04:03:56,903 --> 04:04:00,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we should respect our history and not ignore that.

2966
04:04:00,625 --> 04:04:02,586
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2967
04:04:02,606 --> 04:04:06,227
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.

2968
04:04:06,308 --> 04:04:10,510
[SPEAKER_27]: It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.

2969
04:04:11,070 --> 04:04:12,331
[SPEAKER_27]: We need to focus on today.

2970
04:04:12,891 --> 04:04:19,314
[SPEAKER_27]: We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.

2971
04:04:19,854 --> 04:04:20,515
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my intent.

2972
04:04:21,235 --> 04:04:21,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, I'm sorry.

2973
04:04:21,815 --> 04:04:23,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to sound accused or that,

2974
04:04:23,558 --> 04:04:32,547
[SPEAKER_04]: but just we should keep in mind that, you know, things that were policies when I was in high school or when you were in high school, maybe you're not necessarily bad things to revisit or consider.

2975
04:04:33,749 --> 04:04:40,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think as a policy action, right, something that doesn't take a lot of money, we could figure out within a week, right?

2976
04:04:40,836 --> 04:04:45,301
[SPEAKER_04]: People do hot washes in jobs, in corporate, in the fire service,

2977
04:04:45,646 --> 04:04:48,949
[SPEAKER_04]: In the military, you do an operation right afterwards, you do a debrief.

2978
04:04:49,349 --> 04:04:50,030
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

2979
04:04:50,450 --> 04:04:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we do it better?

2980
04:04:51,331 --> 04:04:54,313
[SPEAKER_04]: In the medical community, they'll do what they call M&M rounds, right?

2981
04:04:54,393 --> 04:04:58,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, if a patient passes away, they want to figure out how do we get better?

2982
04:04:59,557 --> 04:05:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something that we should be asking the schools to get within the next week or two.

2983
04:05:06,843 --> 04:05:08,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did it take hours?

2984
04:05:09,591 --> 04:05:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: for the school to communicate to parents.

2985
04:05:13,332 --> 04:05:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't understand the purpose of a lockdown given this incident and why it was ours.

2986
04:05:18,074 --> 04:05:24,236
[SPEAKER_04]: There's difference between preserving a crime scene versus locking everyone in because you think it's an active shooter.

2987
04:05:25,296 --> 04:05:26,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna debate that.

2988
04:05:26,337 --> 04:05:28,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what that is and there may be a rationale.

2989
04:05:29,138 --> 04:05:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That rationale should be communicated to the parents, but also within a week or not even,

2990
04:05:36,809 --> 04:05:37,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did it take so long?

2991
04:05:38,050 --> 04:05:40,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'd love to see all these gotten rid of from schools.

2992
04:05:41,833 --> 04:05:50,100
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, if a student, if a parent can't know that their students are safe or their children are safe, then what other mechanism do you have?

2993
04:05:50,140 --> 04:05:50,961
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of a catch 22.

2994
04:05:52,362 --> 04:05:55,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we really can do better and this doesn't cost a nickel.

2995
04:05:56,646 --> 04:06:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So last quote that I will leave you all with, we must all fear evil men.

2996
04:06:04,889 --> 04:06:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's another kind of evil, which we must fear most, and that is the indifference of good men.

2997
04:06:11,552 --> 04:06:16,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quote, sorry, but that said, I think it rings true, right?

2998
04:06:16,535 --> 04:06:20,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in situations, we can take action, right?

2999
04:06:20,296 --> 04:06:26,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these are things that could be taken, you know, done now, because otherwise, when my wife asked me, do we send our kid to other public schools?

3000
04:06:27,140 --> 04:06:27,760
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is no.

3001
04:06:28,500 --> 04:06:31,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I will work more and send my kid to private school.

3002
04:06:32,743 --> 04:06:32,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3003
04:06:35,285 --> 04:06:37,726
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other members of the public haven't spoken yet, wish to speak?

3004
04:06:39,847 --> 04:06:41,128
[SPEAKER_28]: Either on Zoom or in person.

3005
04:06:44,250 --> 04:06:46,731
[SPEAKER_28]: Seeing none, do I have a motion on the floor?

3006
04:06:49,012 --> 04:06:50,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to read papers 22-614-2261.

3007
04:06:50,953 --> 04:06:54,735
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to dispose, sorry, we just have to dispose of this paper.

3008
04:06:54,815 --> 04:06:55,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the motion.

3009
04:06:55,776 --> 04:06:56,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

3010
04:06:56,336 --> 04:06:57,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to read 22-614-615, 616, 617, and 618.

3011
04:06:57,457 --> 04:06:59,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Merge them all together and a motion to approve.

3012
04:07:04,542 --> 04:07:05,042
[SPEAKER_27]: Great idea.

3013
04:07:05,082 --> 04:07:05,563
[SPEAKER_27]: Second that.

3014
04:07:07,884 --> 04:07:08,185
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

3015
04:07:08,345 --> 04:07:14,269
[SPEAKER_28]: So, can you go, can you do like a through like 614 through the clerk is 614 through 618?

3016
04:07:14,949 --> 04:07:15,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

3017
04:07:15,170 --> 04:07:15,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

3018
04:07:15,690 --> 04:07:15,990
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

3019
04:07:16,110 --> 04:07:20,393
[SPEAKER_28]: So, the motion is to read them, merge them, approve them.

3020
04:07:21,434 --> 04:07:21,654
[SPEAKER_28]: 614 through 618.

3021
04:07:21,774 --> 04:07:26,357
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to read them in succession.

3022
04:07:26,678 --> 04:07:28,079
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, actually, we're going to vote on it first.

3023
04:07:29,480 --> 04:07:31,841
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh did you catch that motion,

3024
04:07:38,558 --> 04:07:38,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do.

3025
04:07:39,958 --> 04:07:40,679
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, I just see.

3026
04:07:40,739 --> 04:07:44,160
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, before we move on, I do see one hand up from Mr. Curry.

3027
04:07:45,000 --> 04:07:46,780
[SPEAKER_28]: Sean Curry, name and address for the record, please.

3028
04:07:46,800 --> 04:07:53,062
[SPEAKER_28]: It's on you to unmute.

3029
04:08:01,825 --> 04:08:04,746
[SPEAKER_28]: You should get a notification to unmute, Mr. Curry.

3030
04:08:05,106 --> 04:08:07,687
[SPEAKER_28]: If your hand was raised in error or you've stepped away,

3031
04:08:09,155 --> 04:08:09,855
[SPEAKER_28]: to come back to you.

3032
04:08:09,875 --> 04:08:21,722
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so the motion on the floor is to read and merge 22-614, 22-615, 22-616, 22-617, and 22-618 and move approval.

3033
04:08:25,083 --> 04:08:27,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Merge them all into the current paper before us.

3034
04:08:27,785 --> 04:08:34,268
[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion, Vice President Bears is as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

3035
04:08:34,328 --> 04:08:35,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3036
04:08:39,893 --> 04:08:42,494
[SPEAKER_08]: and I do ask that you read them.

3037
04:08:42,514 --> 04:08:44,555
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

3038
04:08:44,575 --> 04:08:46,615
[SPEAKER_28]: And no one better motion to waive them as I read them.

3039
04:08:46,635 --> 04:08:50,397
[SPEAKER_28]: 22-614, 615, 616, 617 and 628, all the ones related to... Yes, merging them all into 613.

3040
04:08:50,537 --> 04:08:50,877

3293
04:17:37,635 --> 04:17:51,779
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Collins and Director of Health, Mary Ann O'Connor also reached out to us to say that there has been a health department policy since 2009 that we could definitely be a starting place for this that may use, could use some updates.

[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins is seconded by

3295

[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Caraviello.

3303
04:18:31,128 --> 04:18:32,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

3304
04:18:32,589 --> 04:18:33,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty simple resolution.

3305
04:18:34,791 --> 04:18:47,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who drives down South Quarter Road right now, especially in the winter where it gets dark at five o'clock, very dangerous road, 17 sets of lights out on that stretch between, especially there's I think

3306
04:18:47,830 --> 04:18:51,871
[SPEAKER_05]: five or six lights are right at the beginning of South Florida Road, where all the homes are.

3307
04:18:51,892 --> 04:18:56,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it's very dangerous on that road, pushing in the dock, animals are running out of the woods.

3308
04:18:56,613 --> 04:19:06,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've contacted DCI myself and they say they know about it, but obviously this has been going on for the last six, seven months.

3309
04:19:06,297 --> 04:19:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can get out, maybe get our state delegation involved with this also.

3310
04:19:14,040 --> 04:19:14,840
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_28]: 22-608 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_28]: Please send this request to our state delegation.

3350
04:21:10,944 --> 04:21:11,865
[SPEAKER_28]: Also Councilor Caraviello.

3351
04:21:12,230 --> 04:21:15,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you madam president for anyone who travels that route 16 bypass road.

3352
04:21:16,291 --> 04:21:18,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes by the dbw yet.

3353
04:21:18,531 --> 04:21:22,532
[SPEAKER_05]: In Medford turning into a truck overnight truck parking spot.

3354
04:21:23,833 --> 04:21:28,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Go by the end of any given night is cut trailers trailer trucks.

3355
04:21:28,874 --> 04:21:29,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Just left there.

3356
04:21:30,354 --> 04:21:32,755
[SPEAKER_05]: This is campus Park on the side of the road.

3357
04:21:33,555 --> 04:21:34,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Over there again.

3358
04:21:35,796 --> 04:21:38,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the city, our curb appeal is horrible.

3359
04:21:39,477 --> 04:21:47,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't even get into commercial street, which is another overnight truck spot for people from truck from Everett to park there for free, because they don't have anywhere to park in Everett.

3360
04:21:47,659 --> 04:21:52,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that's a major thoroughfare where people go by and see all the time.

3361
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:54,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of going by and seeing overnight trucks parked there.

3362
04:21:54,981 --> 04:21:56,341
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two campers parked there.

3363
04:21:57,362 --> 04:22:02,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the city's becoming a truck stop and a parking lot for everybody.

3364
04:22:03,740 --> 04:22:12,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And correct me if I'm wrong, this is Route 16 eastbound between Main Street and Harvard Avenue.

3365
04:22:12,604 --> 04:22:17,826
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could just amend it to reflect Route 16 eastbound between Main Street and the intersection with Harvard.

3366
04:22:17,846 --> 04:22:19,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it has an official name.

3367
04:22:20,227 --> 04:22:21,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Harvard Street.

3368
04:22:21,147 --> 04:22:21,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Route 16.

3369
04:22:22,548 --> 04:22:22,848
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

3370
04:22:23,448 --> 04:22:28,190
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by

3371
04:22:29,659 --> 04:22:31,401
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight, nodding at me.

3372
04:22:31,781 --> 04:22:33,702
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3373
04:22:38,006 --> 04:22:38,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

3374
04:22:41,689 --> 04:22:41,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

3375
04:22:42,670 --> 04:22:45,392
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

3376
04:22:45,833 --> 04:22:46,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

3377
04:22:47,974 --> 04:22:48,174
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

3378
04:22:48,335 --> 04:22:50,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Seven in favor, zero negative, motion passes.

3379
04:22:50,136 --> 04:22:52,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, motion to table papers 22610, 22611, and 22612.

3380
04:22:56,932 --> 04:23:01,814
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion of Vice President Barris to table papers 22-611, sorry, 22-610, 22-611, and 22-612 until the next regular meeting.

3381
04:23:01,834 --> 04:23:06,216
[SPEAKER_28]: Madam President, 22-612, ultimately what I'm seeing is that the mayor is using our agenda to promote

3382
04:23:18,919 --> 04:23:21,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing more than what she's spending her apple money on.

3383
04:23:21,680 --> 04:23:24,062
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have any say whatsoever.

3384
04:23:24,722 --> 04:23:28,204
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations.

3385
04:23:28,304 --> 04:23:29,885
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, all it is is a dog and pony show.

3386
04:23:29,925 --> 04:23:31,586
[SPEAKER_20]: I really think it's nothing more than campaigning.

3387
04:23:32,206 --> 04:23:33,026
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really campaigning.

3388
04:23:33,067 --> 04:23:34,647
[SPEAKER_20]: It has nothing to do with what's going on in the city.

3389
04:23:34,887 --> 04:23:36,468
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing to do with what's going on with his body.

3390
04:23:36,488 --> 04:23:37,249
[SPEAKER_20]: It's campaigning.

3391
04:23:37,929 --> 04:23:39,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't think that that should be allowed.

3392
04:23:39,250 --> 04:23:45,013
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.

3393
04:23:46,956 --> 04:23:51,861
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want on the responses we just got back on the previous offer presentation.

3394
04:23:51,921 --> 04:23:59,729
[SPEAKER_28]: So in this paper, she did write no formal vote needed, but we do plan to update you all on large scale projects, gain your feedback and answer your questions.

3395
04:23:59,769 --> 04:24:01,871
[SPEAKER_28]: We also want to make sure there is no objection.

3396
04:24:01,931 --> 04:24:04,693
[SPEAKER_28]: So we will be rethinking that position of the spending.

3397
04:24:04,733 --> 04:24:05,514
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm just repeating.

3398
04:24:05,554 --> 04:24:06,075
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just repeating.

3399
04:24:06,215 --> 04:24:06,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

3400
04:24:06,515 --> 04:24:08,577
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so Madam President, what that really is, is that's a,

3401
04:24:09,056 --> 04:24:15,699
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right?

3402
04:24:15,739 --> 04:24:21,082
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it.

3403
04:24:21,102 --> 04:24:23,683
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.

3404
04:24:23,843 --> 04:24:27,765
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's like government by committee doesn't work.

3405
04:24:27,965 --> 04:24:32,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, is that, are we considering that an official communication that our vote is not required?

3406
04:24:33,578 --> 04:24:36,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we did ask a question as to whether our voters were part of it.

3407
04:24:36,059 --> 04:24:38,280
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's basically what the chief of staff said, kind of the same.

3408
04:24:38,901 --> 04:24:40,742
[SPEAKER_28]: Not super direct.

3409
04:24:40,762 --> 04:24:42,763
[SPEAKER_08]: So not really an answer, just yeah.

3410
04:24:43,223 --> 04:24:43,523
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

3411
04:24:44,804 --> 04:24:47,965
[SPEAKER_28]: So on the motion of vice-chair and bearers to table 22-610, 22-611 and 22-612, seconded by councilor Knight.

3412
04:24:48,005 --> 04:24:49,146

[SPEAKER_28]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. Motion passes.

3417
04:25:10,912 --> 04:25:17,954
[SPEAKER_28]: We have one previous petition from public participation that's on the agenda, but she has left and we'll refile in January.

3418
04:25:18,234 --> 04:25:24,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

3419
04:25:24,275 --> 04:25:27,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Any topic under the council's purview?

3420
04:25:31,949 --> 04:25:32,990
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna try one last time.

3421
04:25:33,050 --> 04:25:34,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Sean Curry, are you there?

3422
04:25:34,071 --> 04:25:37,395
[SPEAKER_28]: His hand's still up.

3423
04:25:38,637 --> 04:25:42,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, see, I know some people may accidentally raise their hand.

3424
04:25:42,601 --> 04:25:49,889
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Farbello.

3425
04:25:49,929 --> 04:25:51,071
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3426
04:26:00,633 --> 04:26:03,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we adjourn.

[SPEAKER_05]: Before we adjourn if we can wish everybody a safe Christmas and a new year.

3428
04:26:09,635 --> 04:26:10,055
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_28]: The meeting is adjourned.
