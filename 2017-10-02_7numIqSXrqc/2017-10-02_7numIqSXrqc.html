    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=55.054s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=55.494s">Six</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=56.655s">All</a>  please rise and salute our flag.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=58.236s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=71.932s">And</a>  while you're all standing, if you could just remain standing so we can take a moment of silence for all the victims of the horrific event that happened in Las Vegas, as well as those that were injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=88.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=91.487s">Approval</a>  of the minutes of the September 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=96.651s">There</a>  a second all those in favor mr. Benedetto So we were talking about</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=114.426s">additional</a>  students that come from new developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=121.108s">And</a>  we requested our report be given to us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=125.089s">I</a>  just want more detail about what was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=128.91s">I</a>  think I said I would like <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=131.911s">units</a>  of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=143.616s">So</a>  I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=152.12s">On</a>  the motion for adoption of the minutes as amended by Mr. Benedetto, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=158.861s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=159.721s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=161.422s">I</a>  also want to take note that we have Justin Tang with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=164.062s">He's</a>  the student representative from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=166.183s">So</a>  welcome, Justin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=167.123s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=174.885s">And</a>  Justin, feel free when we're discussing any matters, if you want to interject, just raise your hand and we'll acknowledge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=180.227s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=183.51s">Okay,</a>  approval of bills transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=187.591s">Motion</a>  for approval by Mr. Skerry, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=190.911s">I</a>  have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=192.192s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=192.592s">I</a>  don't know if Kirsten's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=195.232s">Kirsten?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=196.133s">Yeah,</a>  Kirsten.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=196.873s">Kirsten's</a>  not here, but I. Oh, maybe you can help me.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=199.593s">Okay,</a>  so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features, I saw a lot of line items for that, and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=213.826s">Approval</a>  we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=219.537s">I</a>  don't know how teachers apply for that I don't know how it's allocated</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=224.474s">So</a>  in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations, a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two, the teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=239.34s">What</a>  you're seeing in that line and those line items is reimbursement for that purpose.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=246.99s">And</a>  could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=252.492s">They</a>  apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=255.472s">He</a>  reviews it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=256.213s">It's</a>  first come, first serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=257.813s">We</a>  obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=262.775s">We</a>  approve it on a first come, first serve basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=265.415s">When</a>  they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=268.956s">And</a>  now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=277.679s">I</a>  just wanted to mention that as your secretary when I go in and sign the bills I see all of the The lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed and I get to see what courses they're taking what grades they've gotten they're doing great and <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=295.969s">and</a>  so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=306.277s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=307.403s">I</a>  have a few more items. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=309.384s">My</a>  second item is on page three of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=311.744s">It's</a>  for $3,395 and it says Medford High School miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=319.006s">Does</a>  anybody have a recollection as to what, and the payment was, the vendor was Medford High School, so I was just curious what that was.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=326.448s">This</a>  is for the hockey clothing.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=328.769s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=331.81s">Hockey</a>  uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=335.194s">Okay,</a>  and the next item is number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=340.097s">An</a>  athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=346.461s">That</a>  just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=353.886s">So</a>  that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=359.603s">The</a>  individual named is the coordinator for that conference and the check is made out to the conference Strictly for her, you know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL we now belong to the Northeast Conference</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=373.379s">Okay,</a>  I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=376.901s">It</a>  just seemed worth bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=379.462s">And</a>  number four is on page 12 of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=383.624s">It</a>  says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=392.768s">So</a>  I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=397.17s">If</a>  you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=399.872s">It's</a>  on page... Page 12.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=406.474s">That</a>  was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=419.136s">Good</a>  thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=421.917s">Thank</a>  you for clarifying those questions.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=424.978s">On</a>  the motion that the bills and transfer of funds be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=428.998s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=429.919s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=430.359s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=430.999s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=434.838s">approval</a>  of payrolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=436.799s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=439.241s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=440.482s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=441.142s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=441.402s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=442.623s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=444.284s">Report</a>  of secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=445.685s">There</a>  is none. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=447.807s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=448.787s">Committee</a>  of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=449.808s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=451.832s">So</a>  we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=455.374s">You</a>  have that in your folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=459.297s">If</a>  you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=462.159s">If</a>  not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.061s">I</a>  have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=466.962s">We'd</a>  like it read, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.063s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=468.223s">Pretz</a>  has some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=471.665s">Superintendent,</a>  I was a little confused about the motion, so I had sent some inquiries over to Dr. Perala and the director of guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=493.857s">But</a>  what I found out through e-mail communication was that's something that's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=499.92s">Currently</a>  there isn't a way in Naviance to add a notation on the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=505.842s">or</a>  add an additional document, or attach a separate page. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=510.484s">So</a>  what they can do is the guidance Councilor can write a letter of recommendation on behalf of the student, providing the information about the class rank, what the student was prior to the merger, and the student can complete a brag sheet, and that can help the guidance Councilor write the personal accomplishments about the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=532.012s">but</a>  you know this is all through communications so I was wondering if you know we can I'd like to make a motion you know to invite the headmaster and the vocational director back so we can get like the final details about the class ranking because this was just me going back and forth because I was a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=551.151s">I</a>  thought it was going to be something different than what we motioned for.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=556.159s">On</a>  the minutes of the meeting of the committee of the whole the motion says that</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=574.596s">I</a>  requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=578.579s">That's</a>  not exactly what I had motioned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=581.602s">What</a>  I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=591.369s">I</a>  believe that's how I remember it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=593.831s">And</a>  I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=598.915s">And</a>  if that's not possible, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=600.836s">then</a>  I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're gonna move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=617.639s">because</a>  this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=621.243s">At</a>  least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=625.387s">It's</a>  still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=635.516s">but</a>  we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=644.063s">So</a>  I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=659.015s">So</a>  we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=665.64s">Yes,</a>  the only thing is of course the some of the kids are already getting to apply to college so there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=686.132s">kids</a>  GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=694.058s">And</a>  it says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=700.623s">I</a>  was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=706.067s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=707.948s">Why</a>  don't we get a clarification out this week? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=710.27s">When</a>  I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=715.307s">And</a>  if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=718.953s">And</a>  if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=724.442s">So</a>  I would like to lay the paper on the table.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=728.081s">She</a>  asked for a motion to have them appear if they're not able to rectify it in the next week internally.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=733.724s">Could</a>  we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=737.687s">Because</a>  of the timeliness with children's transcripts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=741.789s">So</a>  as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week, that we have a meeting at the beginning of next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=750.834s">So</a>  I need someone to second that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=752.795s">I'll</a>  second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=753.535s">There's</a>  a second by Ms.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=754.336s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=754.936s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=756.86s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=757.645s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=759.396s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=761.734s">did</a>  you have another question?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=763.235s">I</a>  know it's not an emergency matter but I just thought it would be a nice report if we could get a report on the breakdown of how many students are in each co-op shop and where they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=775.721s">It</a>  was just something really interesting but it's not an emergency report. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=780.163s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion for that.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=782.364s">I</a>  would suggest that you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=789.887s">Transitory</a>  report this early in the year.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=791.568s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=792.309s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=810.085s">And</a>  I just had one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=811.306s">I</a>  wanted to inquire about one shop in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=816.608s">It</a>  was the robotics engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=818.508s">Originally,</a>  the robotics engineering has been the traditional vocational program, and it's going to be switching over with the graduating class of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=827.972s">And</a>  just recently, there's been a development where there is <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=835.234s">there</a>  is a co-op opportunity for the robotics engineering students so I just wanted to bring that up and if it could be revisited for the future students if they were interested in the co-op plan it would be ideal and I was out this weekend <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=852.518s">going</a>  out doing the college tours, and what we saw was at Wentworth, they had the same equipment that we have in our robotics engineering shop, and my son, he's been involved in the program, he knew all the names of the machines, and in fact, we have newer machines than they have, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=871.167s">know,</a>  they have like a five access and we have a three access, but he knew all the machines and they had the sheet metal shop and it was just really fascinating to see that our Medford vocational school has that equipment that's college ready and when they shared some information about their co-ops, their students are college students going out and getting co-ops and they're starting out at $15 an hour <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=892.927s">and</a>  that's what our vocational students are doing in that particular field, so I really think it's an important, you know, to have another look at the robotics engineering program because there might be an opportunity for it to remain as, you know, the A week, B week program, and this was a new development that just came about, you know, recently for an opportunity for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=916.076s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to have that revisited.</p>

    <p>[Villard]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=984.332s">Good</a>  evening, Honorable Mayor Burke, ladies and gentlemen of the school committee, Superintendent Belson, Deputy Superintendent Nelson, we, the teachers of the McGlynn Middle School, are here in response to item number seven under the report of the superintendent, dated September 18th, 2017, entitled McGlynn Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1005.071s">After</a>  each of us watched this meeting, we came together as a staff and discussed our disappointment regarding the lack of our voice and input being included in this action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1015.654s">We</a>  feel that the McGlynn was misrepresented and our achievements overshadowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1020.495s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn and we are here because we care. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1024.356s">We</a>  are proud that the McGlynn Middle School is unique in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1029.065s">Our</a>  school houses the population of students that is most diverse in background, ability, language, and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1036.712s">Our</a>  school is home to the entire Medford Middle School EL population. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1040.855s">Last</a>  year, through our inclusion model, we serviced a population of almost 60% high-need students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1047.958s">Each</a>  day, our staff rises to and celebrates the challenge of not only educating, but also of meeting the social and emotional needs of the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1057.625s">Teachers</a>  and staff do this by creating a community of respect and of excellence. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1063.389s">We</a>  value all of our students, and we do all we can to help them excel both academically and socially.</p>

    <p>[Flint]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1072.795s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we are dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1077.83s">The</a>  teachers and staff at the McGlynn enthusiastically devote our time and resources to make the building better on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1085.303s">Students</a>  at the McGlynn enjoy a variety of staff-run extracurricular activities <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1089.921s">including</a>  Drama Club, National Junior Honor Society, Builders Club, Student Council, the interactive morning news program, yearbook, art club, a rock and roll show, talent show, chorus program, a school-wide multicultural holiday sing-along, a gold medal winning string ensemble, and numerous other activities based on student interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1114.662s">Not</a>  only do we dedicate ourselves to these extracurriculars, we have repeatedly volunteered to advise these clubs and many others, often without response or support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1124.725s">Do</a>  we desire even more extracurricular opportunities for our students? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1128.786s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1130.106s">However,</a>  permission to move forward, financing, and support continue to limit aspirations of those who wish to bring in additional programming and opportunities for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1141.107s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we want the best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1147.309s">We</a>  want every student to have the most advantages and educational opportunities possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1153.852s">This</a>  requires us to continually collaborate, communicate, and cooperate to ensure the best educational environment possible for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1163.223s">The</a>  more stable, healthy, and professional the relations between the staff are, the more we are able to provide a stable, healthy, and supportive school climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1173.011s">Therefore,</a>  it was disappointing to hear that over the summer, staffing decisions were made based on our backgrounds, talents, and relationships, without the knowledge, without the involvement, or without the input of the most valuable resources available, the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1189.016s">So</a>  as expected, the conclusions and actions, which were based on incomplete and erroneous information, do not match the stated needs outlined in the McGlynn Middle School Action Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1199.124s">We'll</a>  go into that in details, not now, but are prepared to do so in another forum.</p>

    <p>[Haas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1206.943s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care, and we ask to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1212.185s">We</a>  are a vibrant and energetic staff, and we care about each other and our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1216.966s">We</a>  maintain pro-student attitude no matter what challenges are presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1221.627s">We</a>  work together in teams, our work families, and as such, advocate for whatever program, resource, or placement is best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1230.49s">In</a>  previous years, we have come together as a staff to address building concerns which we brought to every level of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1238.713s">The</a>  concerns we have voiced through the years and today are not complaints about our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1243.455s">They</a>  are pleased to see the administration for help in the hopes that together we can make our school excel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1249.777s">When</a>  there are concerns about our school, good management practices dictate that we should be involved in the process, both in identifying the issues and determining the solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1259.758s">We</a>  are a valuable resource in which you invest. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1263.424s">We</a>  ask to be part of the solution, not demonize as part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1267.767s">Because</a>  we care, we ask to work with you and the administration to make the McGlynn the best it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1275.072s">We</a>  are the teachers of the McGlynn, and we are here because we care and want our voice to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1280.515s">We</a>  believe that education is not about competing with other schools or even each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1285.799s">It's</a>  about fostering an inclusive community, one that is committed to excellence in meeting the needs of the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1293.644s">School</a>  and learning are not a competition with a strict and inflexible finish line. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1298.408s">Education</a>  is not a prize to be won. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1300.75s">To</a>  engender this type of competition will only harm the good that our schools are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1306.595s">Only</a>  by coming together can we ensure that all students see what we know to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1311.999s">They</a>  are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1318.964s">someone</a>  else's success only to denigrate another, what values are we teaching? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1324.525s">By</a>  dictating rather than communicating, what message are we sending? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1329.607s">Reform</a>  should be made with us, not at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1332.607s">So</a>  we are the teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1340.269s">We</a>  and our students' voices deserve to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1343.27s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1370.39s">Thank</a>  you very much, teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1373.092s">We</a>  appreciate your comments and your spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1375.233s">Certainly,</a>  that means a lot to the children of this community that have chosen to go to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1380.237s">Several</a>  of them, many of them, are delighted to hear you tonight, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1384.56s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1385.54s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1387.381s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1392.665s">We</a>  respect the teachers of the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1394.966s">We</a>  respect the McGlynn school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1396.387s">We</a>  have two very fine middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1398.829s">We</a>  never said that we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1401.084s">But</a>  we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1410.328s">Several</a>  years ago, it was the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1413.109s">One</a>  school drew more students than the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1416.23s">And</a>  this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1427.338s">Now,</a>  whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1443.483s">That's</a>  not an indictment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1445.184s">That's</a>  an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1449.305s">Now,</a>  the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1454.227s">Yes,</a>  there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1462.514s">We</a>  have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1471.989s">My</a>  point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1478.396s">And</a>  I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1484.696s">Right</a>  now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1489.317s">Our</a>  goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1501.799s">So</a>  I welcome your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1503.139s">That's</a>  all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1507.52s">One</a>  of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1511.761s">everyone</a>  would collaborate and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1513.904s">So</a>  I welcome it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1515.346s">We'll</a>  come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1516.207s">We'll</a>  have a nice meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1517.468s">We'll</a>  talk about what we can do, what we can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1520.192s">Some</a>  of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1529.964s">Certainly,</a>  every budget has its limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1532.369s">You</a>  can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1536.056s">But</a>  there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1543.223s">And</a>  all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1553.267s">That's</a>  all, and that we'll work forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1555.308s">And</a>  if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1559.57s">Not</a>  to you, with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1561.53s">But</a>  we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1565.452s">So</a>  I look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1566.773s">I</a>  appreciate your coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1568.093s">I</a>  appreciate your courage in speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1570.194s">I</a>  think it's really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1571.675s">It's</a>  really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1577.959s">I</a>  applaud that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1578.64s">I</a>  think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.021s">Let's</a>  keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.941s">Let's</a>  do it.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1587.026s">I</a>  just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teacher's reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1606.364s">I'd</a>  the the reality was that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1612.625s">gotten</a>  a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1623.123s">And</a>  this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1628.726s">I</a>  still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1640.853s">And</a>  for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1652.739s">We</a>  want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1661.903s">So,</a>  this issue of friends and how do we, how do we <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1668.306s">tackle</a>  this issue so that we don't have an imbalance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1671.909s">I</a>  have been to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1673.59s">I</a>  think you guys are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1675.171s">I've</a>  had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1681.476s">I</a>  certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1685.379s">And</a>  because I have history, as many of us do here, we know <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1690.703s">that</a>  there has been sometimes where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1700.056s">From</a>  a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1706.966s">good</a>  about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1717.252s">That's</a>  why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1732.581s">I</a>  know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1737.305s">Once</a>  the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1740.567s">But</a>  the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1744.49s">Anyway,</a>  thank you so much for coming down and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1754.157s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1755.137s">So</a>  I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1761.815s">actually</a>  happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1771.481s">So</a>  it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1784.972s">A</a>  difficult thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1785.873s">I'm</a>  very sorry to hear that you felt slighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1790.476s">When</a>  my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1798.081s">So,</a>  when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1806.195s">To</a>  hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1814.382s">60%</a>  of your students in your school being high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1818.525s">That's</a>  a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1822.308s">in</a>  servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1832.394s">I</a>  would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1836.657s">We</a>  never hear of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1837.997s">The</a>  only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1849.537s">The</a>  social, emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1858.439s">And</a>  all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, you know, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1873.362s">so</a>  that parents are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1875.363s">It</a>  wasn't to say, well, the Andrews better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1880.707s">We</a>  know you're better. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1882.248s">We</a>  never even thought for a second that you weren't better. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1886.271s">It's</a>  just maybe you need a little bit more PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1889.753s">Maybe</a>  your clubs need to be published a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1893.455s">Maybe</a>  we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1898.579s">In</a>  other ways, that's how I looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1901.093s">Or</a>  if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1909.58s">Why</a>  not have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1911.621s">Maybe</a>  we need to do that and look at those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1915.044s">But</a>  it was never, never that more dedicated amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1919.747s">That</a>  is never. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1923.005s">And</a>  I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner that you thought that we had that impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1931.969s">And</a>  that's far from what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1934.531s">So,</a>  I am grateful to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1936.832s">I</a>  hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1941.754s">And</a>  if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1944.835s">You're</a>  in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1957.487s">So</a>  your input is most valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1961.711s">And</a>  I'm always willing to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1964.033s">And</a>  I'm willing to make other people hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1966.775s">Because</a>  I have a big mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1969.137s">So</a>  welcome and thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1971.959s">And</a>  I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1978.823s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1980.165s">Justin</a>  would like to add to this conversation.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1982.589s">I'd</a>  like to thank the teachers of the Midland, my teachers, for coming here and standing up for yourselves and standing up for your students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1991.381s">I</a>  think what we have here is an issue of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1995.467s">The</a>  public is more attracted to one school than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1998.11s">But</a>  we need to find out why. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2000.512s">And</a>  I can give you my perspective on why. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2002.934s">It's</a>  not that McGlynn teachers are worse than Andrews teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2005.756s">It's</a>  definitely not that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2006.837s">Because</a>  I've talked to students coming from the Andrews and to parents who have students at the McGlynn, at the Andrews, or even in the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2015.485s">And</a>  that's not their concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2017.627s">It's</a>  not that the staff at the McGlynn is poorly paired or it's <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2022.671s">that</a>  it doesn't work well, but rather that the Andrews just, they look at technology and they look at a component of who's at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2033.959s">And</a>  there's a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2039.643s">And</a>  there's also a perception that the McGlynn is a step behind the Andrews when it comes to wealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2046.207s">how</a>  we use that wealth and how that's portrayed in our socioeconomic status. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2051.069s">And</a>  what we really have to do is look at, you know, these are the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2055.17s">How</a>  do we solve these problems? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2056.49s">Not</a>  that, you know, oh, you know, the teachers are the problems or, you know, it's about working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2065.731s">You</a>  know, we shouldn't make random decisions when we don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2071.656s">If</a>  we know that teachers aren't the problem, we shouldn't shuffle them around because it doesn't really work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2078.282s">We</a>  need to identify the problems that we have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2081.885s">And</a>  that means 60% of McGlynn kids are high need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2086.449s">So</a>  how do we figure out that balance between the two schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2092.114s">And</a>  I'm sorry to say it, but I don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2095.278s">But</a>  that 60% of students are high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2098.441s">And</a>  the diversity of school leads some people to prefer the Andrews over the MacLennan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2103.826s">And</a>  it's a sad reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2106.069s">It's</a>  a sad truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2106.829s">And</a>  it doesn't mean that it is the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2110.533s">what</a>  people think, and just like Mrs. DiBenedetto said, it's about PR, and we need to make sure that people in our community understand that both schools have great teachers, and that we even out the playing field for both schools from now on.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2147.159s">I</a>  would say clearly you guys did a great job.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2163.985s">So</a>  it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2164.886s">Every</a>  year they kind of pick different schools, even though they all came from the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2168.49s">But</a>  Justin and other graduates certainly could be great spokespeople for the school, as well as you, because you did a fabulous job tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2175.598s">And</a>  we're really, really proud to have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2177.42s">You</a>  said it all.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2179.562s">I</a>  want to thank you all for coming out tonight, and it was just such great spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2184.644s">It</a>  was great hearing from all of you It was just wonderful, and you know what great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2189.246s">You're</a>  doing at the school and you know it's coming from my other colleagues is that we were just you know talking about the different the clubs and the students want to go to one school and and <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2199.37s">We're</a>  trying to find an equal balance, but we are very grateful to all the hard work that you do every day at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2206.634s">I've</a>  been out to the McGlynn when I went first term, and I had the best experience in the fourth grade class going to see the hydroponics project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2217.479s">helped</a>  organize a field trip between the McGlynn and the vocational school, and it was just fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2222.385s">I</a>  had the most fun and been to the concerts and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2226.29s">I</a>  just love it there, and it's just a great school, and thank you all for what you do every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2230.835s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2455.681s">I</a>  don't wanna go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2456.762s">I</a>  know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[WsdkVhZ-zp4_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2460.124s">Not</a>  about the action plan.</p>

    <p>[Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2461.866s">About</a>  many of the items in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2464.434s">But</a>  at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2470.317s">The</a>  issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2481.002s">That's</a>  what you need to take home.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2483.183s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2484.203s">Mayor</a>  Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlen to go over some of these concerns and <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2493.1s">come</a>  up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2501.225s">I</a>  need someone to second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2502.946s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2503.866s">Not</a>  just administration, we should be there too.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2505.948s">Well,</a>  yes, but at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2508.669s">A</a>  meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2515.367s">On</a>  the motion that a meeting be held in the next month for an action plan to be developed inclusive of the teachers comments All those in favor motion carries <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2530.413s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2530.653s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2531.713s">Thank</a>  you very much for coming out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2533.374s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2535.614s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2536.835s">Wait,</a>  hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2538.095s">Sorry,</a>  sorry, that's okay.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2539.595s">Dave</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2542.596s">I</a>  just want to speak on this because really basically you folks have to realize that you are the coaches basically in a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2550.538s">The</a>  morale for the teachers, the morale for the students, and the morale for the parents has to be upheld. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2557.199s">for</a>  the city school committee to sit there and not know that we're at 60% for special needs is unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2565.625s">I</a>  mean, you folks should have this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2567.446s">You</a>  should know that.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2567.887s">We</a>  do have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2568.747s">That</a>  wasn't implied that we didn't know about that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2571.269s">It</a>  was clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2571.77s">They</a>  put that in there.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2572.63s">OK,</a>  secondly, basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2576.793s">Why</a>  not get into the school and work with them and try to educate yourself in the respect of what's happening in the teachers and the classes and getting out there and being able to visit that school and help build them around? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2589.397s">You</a>  also mentioned the fact that there has to be, maybe you need better marketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2594.118s">You</a>  folks are the marketers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2595.659s">You're</a>  the ones who have to market that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2597.74s">The</a>  comments that were made a couple of weeks ago at the last school committee meeting was not marketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2603.281s">It</a>  was derogatory and these folks <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2606.062s">have</a>  come together loud and clear and said, hey, we need your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2611.024s">You</a>  folks create the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2612.744s">We'll</a>  execute the plan as best we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2615.385s">And</a>  they need that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2616.885s">And</a>  collectively, yes, this is a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2619.566s">But</a>  you have to take it an extra step and not wait for them to come to you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2623.367s">You</a>  have to get to them and make this happen cohesively.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2626.4s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2626.74s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2627.54s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2627.62s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2628.521s">I</a>  just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2631.161s">I</a>  think we need to keep something in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2634.482s">Up</a>  to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2643.364s">The</a>  school committee members have been to the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2646.825s">We</a>  know many, many of the faces that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2649.746s">We've</a>  gone to many different events. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2651.926s">We</a>  celebrate the McGlynn and we celebrate the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2655.467s">we</a>  it is wrong to say that we didn't know that with 60% okay that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight but we know that and we may have to look about that is there a perception because <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2671.155s">of</a>  that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2683.925s">Those</a>  students are great students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2686.087s">I</a>  know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2689.29s">But</a>  you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2694.655s">So</a>  I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2700.567s">We</a>  need to keep this into perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2704.093s">We've</a>  had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2711.135s">This</a>  year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2721.639s">Because</a>  all of a sudden we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2727.961s">Okay,</a>  nobody called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2730.244s">Not</a>  one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2737.873s">Not</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2739.595s">What</a>  I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2747.648s">And</a>  it's that how do we block up then? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2749.729s">How</a>  do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated? <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2756.234s">That's</a>  what is I've heard over and again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2759.676s">That's</a>  why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2770.003s">I</a>  need to keep it in perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2772.827s">I</a>  need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2776.471s">I</a>  appreciate the teachers coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2779.235s">I</a>  need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem we're trying to solve.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2787.805s">Throwing</a>  it out there that you maybe you need better marketing I mean we are the marketers that that before the school and that's really something that needs to be clarified Point taken in the respect of that, but I also listened to the teachers and they were telling me time and time again They tried communicating consecutively with the administration and fallen on deaf ears Those are the things that need to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2806.498s">And</a>  those are the things that just that's what I just bring to light we can we can <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2811.141s">appreciate</a>  everyone coming together we can appreciate the fact that they came together as a team but I think the reason why they came together as a team is there's been a growing frustration this just doesn't occur overnight there's a growing frustration and that's all I wanted to bring to light and that's what's where the expertise of you folks can can change that dramatically and getting involved in exactly what it is that they're frustrated with.</p>

    <p>[DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2833.591s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2835.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2835.972s">Thank</a>  you Mayberg and thank you Mr. McCullough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2838.615s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2843.996s">Those</a>  are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2854.298s">So</a>  there's a lot of different combinations that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2857.579s">So</a>  I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2861.46s">I</a>  knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2866.901s">So</a>  that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2870.885s">So</a>  just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2879.212s">They</a>  just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2889.212s">The</a>  second part about PR is, yes, we are all responsible for PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2895.195s">And</a>  as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2898.356s">In</a>  any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2901.958s">And</a>  just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2907.82s">And</a>  as far as going out and participating in the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2911.832s">I</a>  was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2918.976s">It</a>  didn't work out very well in my favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2921.417s">But</a>  I am trying to pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2927.72s">So</a>  renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and I went to parent night at the high school as a freshman parent would. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2941.946s">and</a>  sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2947.168s">And</a>  I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things, and a lot of them have school-age children and are in the buildings at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2955.351s">And</a>  for me, I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2961.213s">So</a>  as far as that goes, that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2965.575s">And</a>  by requesting a meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2969.505s">to</a>  have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2977.949s">A</a>  plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2978.489s">Just</a>  an action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2980.27s">An</a>  action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2981.63s">Sorry,</a>  it went out of my mind for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2985.432s">My</a>  motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2998.357s">and</a>  you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3009.684s">And</a>  we might come out with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3019.477s">It's</a>  just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great. <a

more often from this membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3046.622s">So</a>  thank you for bringing those concerns forward.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3049.71s">Name</a>  and address please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3052.572s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3055.394s">The</a>  teachers want to be partners in progress and I applaud them for coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3059.416s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3060.677s">What</a>  I want the teachers to know is that this very school <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3064.758s">kept</a>  the Chapter 74 board in private. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3068.16s">There</a>  were no open meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3069.38s">So</a>  the Attorney General's office determined on September 19th that this very school's Chapter 74 board failed to put the open meeting law out there for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3079.366s">So</a>  there is no participation here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3080.967s">There</a>  is no transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3082.767s">You</a>  teachers are to be commended because you put your necks on the line with the people that do the hiring and firing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3087.47s">Now</a>  there's some very fine people on this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3089.755s">but</a>  there's other people that I think deserve term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3093.338s">This</a>  is what's wrong with this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3095.18s">There</a>  is no inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3096.701s">They</a>  say there's inclusion, there's partners in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3099.103s">I</a>  don't feel like a partner in progress and the teacher's fantastic speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3103.547s">I</a>  am just very, very in awe that you would come here and do that and they need to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3110.733s">This</a>  school committee, Mr. Belson, Mayor Burke, they need to be heard and they need to work with you as partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3117.679s">don't</a>  shove them away as many in this community feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3121.682s">It's</a>  polarized and we've all been shut out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3124.063s">It's</a>  time to open the doors and be a partner in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3126.685s">Mrs.</a>  Burke, it really is time to be partners with us because we live here, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3131.168s">And</a>  I feel that you shut me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3132.989s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3140.514s">On</a>  the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3142.335s">We</a>  had a motion and we voted on that we will have a meeting within the next month and we'll reach out to you to come to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3148.243s">We'll</a>  put an agenda together so it'll be a productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3151.127s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3152.229s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
