1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:08,353
[SPEAKER_18]: superintendent has that in the same way that we ask for documents for our posted meetings to come to us, you know, not the same day.

2
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:09,554
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that is reasonable.

3
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:09,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

4
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

5
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Hays and member McLaughlin.

6
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,118
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you could shut your microphones off when you're not speaking, so there's no echo.

7
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:18,638
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

8
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:24,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so the only thought I have about that is I think the difference we're doing the process very differently.

9
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:28,623
[SPEAKER_15]: So in fact, if we're creating it as subcommittee meeting, I don't know, I mean,

10
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:32,919
[SPEAKER_15]: you superintendent attended our last subcommittee meeting.

11
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:36,220
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're creating it at a subcommittee meeting you're attending.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,741
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we can still provide it.

13
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:47,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the thing to realize member press maybes we're not last year, the way it was done was that one member took all of ours and created a composite.

14
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:49,897
[SPEAKER_15]: on their own.

15
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:59,460
[SPEAKER_15]: This time we're doing this as a group, we're doing it at a subcommittee meeting, which will be a regular subcommittee meeting that's open for people to attend.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is a very different process altogether.

17
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:11,343
[SPEAKER_15]: We can still present what we end up writing, but I think you'll be a part of the superintendent along the way too.

18
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,764
[SPEAKER_15]: .

19
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information?

20
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Does member hayes mean a committee of the whole or subcommittee?

21
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like she's talking about the committee of the whole, but she's saying subcommittee.

22
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:32,249
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm saying is according to the process we have established, the subcommittee is going to work on a composite evaluation.

23
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,970
[SPEAKER_15]: We obviously can't approve it in the subcommittee meeting.

24
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,732
[SPEAKER_15]: We would be taking it to the committee of the whole, which is where the whole committee would

25
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:43,936
[SPEAKER_22]: go over it and vote on it.

26
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:44,977
Thank you.

27
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:48,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Member McLaughlin.

28
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:51,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

29
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,118
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

30
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,879
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that I agree with all of my colleagues here.

31
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,419
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a reasonable request.

32
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:08,962
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the training from MASC and this process is hopefully going to go much more smoothly and will be much more transparent in terms of the meetings being public with the composite

33
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,497
[SPEAKER_19]: being put together.

34
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:17,762
[SPEAKER_19]: That said, I'm sure that the superintendent attends the subcommittee meetings and is also paying attention to a number of things at those subcommittee meetings.

35
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:23,445
[SPEAKER_19]: So obviously I think it would be good for her to have, you know, time alone to look at the document, what have you.

36
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:31,931
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think June 1st is reasonable for the subcommittee to add that date in there in between the time, but I also, or, and I also want,

37
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:40,066
[SPEAKER_19]: the community and the public to know obviously that this is a, you know, that these are public meetings, you know, there'll be subcommittee meetings.

38
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:46,951
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, people can and I expect will attend and will understand the process a bit better.

39
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,812
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that that would be really helpful.

40
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,073
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess I'm saying yes.

41
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:57,257
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know that we need a motion to add the June 1st in there, or do we, because we have to make a motion to approve the minutes.

42
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,439
[SPEAKER_19]: So do we need to make a motion?

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,120
[SPEAKER_19]: for June 1st.

44
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:05,342
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval as amended by member Gramps.

45
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

46
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:15,988
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval as amended by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kreatz, member Ruseau.

47
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure I have this for the minutes.

48
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,132
[SPEAKER_13]: It's as amended that on June 1st, we will have a committee of the whole or subcommittee.

49
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:30,116
[SPEAKER_24]: The superintendent will be provided the write up of the evaluation composite.

50
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:30,881
[SPEAKER_13]: thank you.

51
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,382
[SPEAKER_13]: How would that be provided?

52
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,182
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure I understand.

53
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:35,422
[SPEAKER_24]: From the committee, I'm assuming.

54
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,243
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be a draft, right?

55
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:48,906
[SPEAKER_24]: A draft that the committee, one of you I'm sure, will finalize and it will be sent along with all the paperwork we get in our Friday packet on June 1st.

56
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:54,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking at the minutes, the last time the subcommittee meets is April 24th.

57
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,268
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Monday, May 22nd.

58
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:00,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Monday, May 22nd, it says the responses are due.

59
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:04,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, and then they'll... No, May 21st, the responses are due.

60
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:05,951
[SPEAKER_13]: May 21st.

61
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at an old version of the minutes.

62
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,194
[SPEAKER_13]: I might be looking at an old version too.

63
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I'm looking at the one I just received.

64
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:11,648
[SPEAKER_19]: May I?

65
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:23,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, so I was also just going to say, yeah, so the timeline for the delivery of the material and, oh shoot, now I just lost my train of thought.

66
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,715
[SPEAKER_19]: There was something else that I wanted to mention.

67
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:28,376
[SPEAKER_22]: If it comes back to me, I'll ask again, sorry.

68
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have different, okay, you're all set, okay.

69
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval as amended.

70
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:38,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, I remembered, sorry.

71
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:54,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Just that, you know, obviously everything will be marked draft, that it's not approved until it's voted on, you know, just to be really clear that we want to make sure that we're not, you know, confusing evaluations at all, that these will be marked very clearly, draft, not approved.

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

73
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:55,921
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

74
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:57,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for approval as amended.

75
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:58,884
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

76
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:02,439
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed, minutes are approved.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,401
[SPEAKER_24]: Number five, reporter of the superintendent.

78
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:10,464
[SPEAKER_22]: First up, we have our superintendent's updates and comments, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.

79
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:15,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

80
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:27,844
[SPEAKER_14]: So hot off the press, right now while we are here in Chambers, our boys, our hockey team, they're playing inside La Conte rink right now.

81
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:31,947
[SPEAKER_14]: And the score that I received is six to one.

82
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,028
[SPEAKER_14]: We are playing against Agawam.

83
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:40,373
[SPEAKER_14]: So it looks like it's going to be a wonderful victory for Mustang Nation.

84
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:46,278
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're really proud of them for the wonderful work, sportsmanship that they're displaying right now.

85
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:47,419
[SPEAKER_14]: We wish them all the best.

86
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,861
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations thus far.

87
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's their period, but I'm very excited for them.

88
00:05:54,724 --> 00:06:03,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is my hope that you and your families were able to enjoy some fun and quality time together over February break.

89
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:11,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Our cold weather has returned as everyone is aware, we are closely monitoring the news.

90
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:21,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And, yes, the groundhog did show his shadow so tomorrow, it's still kind of up in the air.

91
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,932
[SPEAKER_14]: anywhere from one to three inches up to six inches.

92
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:30,714
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a very potentially treacherous commute in the morning.

93
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:37,037
[SPEAKER_14]: So the city has already put in the parking effect, effective 7.30 for this evening.

94
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So 7.30 tomorrow morning.

95
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, 7.30 tomorrow morning.

96
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:51,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And as of right now, Metro Public Schools is open, but we are continuing to just monitor the news and try to get accurate

97
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:57,810
[SPEAKER_14]: information in terms of how much snow we're really thinking may come to us tomorrow.

98
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:08,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I would just like to share that the Friday before February break, Friday, February 17th, was our Black History Month celebration at the high school.

99
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:14,346
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a great celebration that took place in the gymnasium.

100
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:30,414
[SPEAKER_14]: The entire high school community packed the gymnasium, and it was a wonderful celebration, our mayor spoke I got to give remarks and there was an inspirational guest speaker in the person of Mr. Brian Owens who really spoke

101
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:47,832
[SPEAKER_14]: about his great accomplishments and overcoming odds and being successful in what he, you know, from being an athlete and now being a successful businessman, and really just gave an inspirational speech to our students.

102
00:07:48,593 --> 00:08:01,297
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had many of our students in the Black Student Union, BSU, that one student shared poetry, others performed dance, fashion show, really just showing their culture.

103
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:04,278
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really wanted to thank Ms.

[SPEAKER_14]: A, and also Mr. Dello Russo working with the students in the BSU.

108
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:23,025
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a very successful event.

109
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:28,888
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had some of our students from the Black Student Union attend a leadership conference

110
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:34,033
[SPEAKER_14]: And Miss Walker was one of the presenters.

111
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:46,847
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to recognize Taliana, Talia, and Zanea, some of our young people at the high school who attended that leadership conference, and they truly have

112
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:56,456
[SPEAKER_14]: great leadership potential, and they also were very actively involved with all of the students that participated in the Black History Celebration.

113
00:08:56,997 --> 00:09:07,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations to all of them on a wonderful celebration of culture and bringing the entire school community together.

114
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I have plenty of good news to share.

115
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:21,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say a special congratulations to our Mustang girls hockey player, a junior by the name of Juliana Storetti.

[SPEAKER_14]: I did not realize some of you already here in the audience, but congratulations, and we look forward to hearing from you ourselves, from your report, but congratulations.

132
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:17,649

133
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:28,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Julia Hanratty won a Silver Key Award and Maggie Fowler won an Honorable Mention, so congratulations to both of them as well.

[SPEAKER_14]: So the Mustangs begin the MIAA Winter Tournament play today.

135
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:38,580

[SPEAKER_14]: Just so you know, earlier this month, on Wednesday, February 8th, the Roberts Elementary School hosted WBZ News meteorologist, Sarah Robleski.

141
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:09,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope I'm saying it the right way.

142
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:14,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, she came to the Roberts Elementary School.

143
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,291
[SPEAKER_14]: I almost wish she was here today to give us a really pointed direction about the weather.

144
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:20,871
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been wonderful.

145
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,872
[SPEAKER_14]: But she talked about the changing weather with our students.

146
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:28,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And she talked about climate change with the third grade classes.

147
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:38,492
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you so much to WBZ news reporter, meteorologist, Sarah W. It was an informative and fun discussion for all of our students.

148
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:44,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Also right before the February break, the Brooks Elementary School held their monthly food drive.

149
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:54,068
[SPEAKER_14]: They collected 234 bags of food, which is more than 100 bags collected last month.

150
00:12:54,909 --> 00:13:00,774
[SPEAKER_14]: The classroom with the most donations received the Can Man award.

151
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:02,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was Ms.

152
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,296
[SPEAKER_14]: McIsaac's third grade class.

153
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,058
[SPEAKER_14]: special congratulations to that classroom.

154
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:11,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Special thanks to the parent and student volunteers from Ms.

155
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Pires' class and Mr. Allen's classes, who helped to sort and bag the food items.

156
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:26,148
[SPEAKER_14]: We also want to thank our community partner, Whole Foods, for providing the bags, and the vocational school for printing the colored flyers.

157
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,890
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for that collaborative effort.

158
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:39,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I just want to recognize prior to vacation, the Andrews and McGlynn PTOs hosted a middle school skating party on Wednesday's half day.

159
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,462
[SPEAKER_14]: We do love this type of collaboration and the students who attended the skating party had blast.

160
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a few important upcoming events.

161
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:57,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Tuesday, tomorrow, February 28th by Zoom is going to be a building bridges to kindergarten session.

162
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from 630 to 730 PM on Zoom.

163
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Grade eight course selection.

164
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:10,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna just thank member Graham for reaching out to the office today, giving us some important feedback.

165
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:16,404
[SPEAKER_14]: The grade eight course selection was originally scheduled for this Wednesday, March 1st.

166
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:21,326
[SPEAKER_14]: It's being postponed until Wednesday, March 15th.

167
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,006
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from six to 8 p.m.

168
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:30,748
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a critically important event where parents will be choosing

169
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:38,555
[SPEAKER_14]: the academic course pathway that you want your child to take when they come to the high school as a ninth grader.

170
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:47,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, your student can come with you, but it's important for you as a parent to be there in looking at the classes that are being offered

171
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:50,306
[SPEAKER_14]: and thinking about where your child is.

172
00:14:50,987 --> 00:15:09,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And meeting with both Principal DeLava and Principal Fallon, who's here with us, they will be talking to parents and giving parents the importance of selecting the courses for next school year when you're rising eighth grader is a ninth grader.

173
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will definitely be putting that in the weekly update.

174
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,128
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, it's postponed until March 15th.

175
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:26,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So those of you who are watching March 15th, 6 to 8 p.m., very important day for parents of eighth graders, rising ninth graders.

176
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:31,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Thursday, March 2nd, it's Read Across America Day.

177
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:36,246
[SPEAKER_14]: The elementary schools will be hosting events and having special guest readers.

178
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:41,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, the elementary schools are beginning their scholastic book fairs.

179
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:46,279
[SPEAKER_14]: So please check with your child's PTO for dates and times.

180
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Saturday, March 4 is annual trivia night.

181
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:57,351
[SPEAKER_14]: That's for the high school NHS and NVTHS PTO groups.

184
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,937
[SPEAKER_14]: at the American Legion Hall.

185
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:08,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it's annual trivia night.

186
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:11,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it's gonna be lots of fun.

187
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,965
[SPEAKER_14]: $25 per person, and the funds raised directly benefit students, teachers, and staff at Medford High School.

188
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:24,629
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want more information, you can email the PTO for further information.

189
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:36,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Their email address is nhs.nvths.pto at gmail.com.

190
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:42,480
[SPEAKER_14]: On Sunday, March 5th, Read by the River.

191
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:51,475
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an annual literacy carnival for students in grades K through five, hosted at Tush University from one to 4 p.m.

192
00:16:53,467 --> 00:17:01,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And since February is our short month, next Monday, March 6, the school committee, we will be meeting again at 6pm here in the chambers.

193
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:10,247
[SPEAKER_14]: And tomorrow, Tuesday, February 28, is Rare Disease Awareness Day.

194
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:21,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Rare Disease Awareness Day seeks to shine a light on rare diseases and advocates for health equity for all.

195
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:29,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Over 7,000 rare diseases impact over 300 million people globally.

196
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:43,257
[SPEAKER_14]: The theme for 2023 is show your stripes, show your colors, which encourages our community to visibly come together to support those with rare diseases.

197
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:44,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

198
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

199
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:48,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I ask a question?

200
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin.

201
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:53,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Dr. Robinson.

202
00:17:53,302 --> 00:18:15,570
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to ask, maybe this can be a consideration for response at the next meeting, but for the grade eight course selection night for March 15th, if we could just let the community know how that information is gonna be available for translation and any other needs for families for that night.

203
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,251
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe at the next meeting, if you could let us know.

204
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:23,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I can definitely have that information for you for the next meeting.

205
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:24,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

206
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:26,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

207
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:35,651
[SPEAKER_24]: We have recommendation to approve travel to University of North Carolina UNC for the ethics team to compete at the Ethics Bowl National Competition.

208
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Eric Eisner, English language arts teacher.

209
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:39,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome.

210
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, everyone.

211
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:00,269
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit about the Ethics Bowl, just to start.

212
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the same brand recognition as a debate team does, or debate, traditional debate.

213
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:08,752
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ethics Bowl competition is an annual competition.

214
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 10th year of the competition.

215
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:18,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Each year in September, the national organizers disseminate 15 cases.

216
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:27,360
[SPEAKER_03]: They're morally ambiguous cases that cover an array of different topics, some of which are very big international cases, some are very local, like one was

217
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it ever okay to date your best friend's ex?

218
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:30,523
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing.

219
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the kids work for about six months preparing arguments for these cases, and then ultimately compete over at Tufts University in the New England regional competition.

220
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:49,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you previously said, they were successful this year defeating a number of different teams, ultimately winning against Lexington in the final round.

221
00:19:55,652 --> 00:20:01,535
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, they competed in a follow-up regional match against Phillips Exeter Academy and were once again successful.

222
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:11,080
[SPEAKER_03]: The past couple of years have been understandably difficult with this.

223
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:17,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We previously qualified two years ago during the first year of the pandemic, but that event had to be canceled and it wasn't held.

224
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:20,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And since then, it's been held over zoom.

225
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:22,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first year that it's been back in person.

226
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:29,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was it was wildly successful and it was good to see them sort of face to face competing against other kids again.

227
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so this is the fourth time we've qualified for nationals.

228
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:37,360
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the third time that we're actually going to get to go and attend in person.

229
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:51,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, just to recognize, we have Eamon Costello, Claire Gingo, Sonia Benapol, Andrei Deridi, and with us tonight, Abigail Sloan, Teagan Mastone, Michelle Romero, and Mateo DeVetta.

230
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:17,741
[SPEAKER_12]: So as a result of their wins, they were able to participate in the semifinal ethics for regional playoffs, which was held on February 14 Valentine's Day against Phillips Exeter Academy and who Phillips was the winner of the New Hampshire bowl Medford's team.

231
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,896
[SPEAKER_12]: was once again successful in the competition.

232
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:32,463
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, because of all of the success, they have been invited to participate in the National Ethics Bowl, as Mr. Esner just said, which will be held at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

233
00:21:32,903 --> 00:21:35,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And that will be on March 31st, 2023.

234
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:44,471
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally want to express the great pride for this team to thank Mr. Esner for all of his hard work.

235
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,732
[SPEAKER_12]: He has been with this since its infancy.

236
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:53,697
[SPEAKER_12]: When Tufts University came to us to form a partnership and it's he has been with them every step of the way.

237
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:59,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're really proud of all of you, as well as your teammates for doing all of this.

238
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:07,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Based on these consecutive victories, because we are invited to the National High School Ethics Bowl, we first of all want to

239
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,664
[SPEAKER_12]: request approval in terms of participation.

240
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:18,093
[SPEAKER_12]: There are 24 teams that are going to attend across the country, and they'll compete.

241
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:23,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do have, I believe I shared with you an itinerary of the various activities that will

242
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:25,263
[SPEAKER_12]: happen throughout the weekend.

243
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:27,044
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be able to tour UNC.

244
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:34,389
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be able to participate in a number of different events, as well as, of course, the ethics simulations.

245
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:43,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are requesting approval as well as funding for this out-of-state field trip, both of which have been approved in the past years that students have attended.

246
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:53,002
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are, of course, here to answer any questions, and most importantly, to thank such a successful group of individuals and their

247
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:55,652
[SPEAKER_12]: wonderful advisor, Mr. Esner.

248
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:56,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

249
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin.

250
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:04,475
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

251
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,236
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.

252
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:07,716
[SPEAKER_19]: That's good stuff.

253
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:08,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent information.

254
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:12,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would love to see you guys go on this trip.

255
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:23,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would love if you would come back, obviously having one, but also, you know, maybe sharing a couple of the ethical dilemmas that are discussed, because I think

256
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:27,587
[SPEAKER_19]: What's so interesting about ethical dilemmas are that there's no easy answer.

257
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,328
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the whole point.

258
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,849
[SPEAKER_19]: And that sort of what the argument is of them.

259
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:33,370
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and was any of the other ones recorded?

260
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you guys know?

261
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

262
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:36,311
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

263
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:36,811
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

264
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:37,271
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

265
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:37,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

266
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:46,915
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think at some point we informally shared some of the different simulations that were given, but I don't think it was recorded.

267
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

268
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:48,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations.

269
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:49,495
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great stuff.

270
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:50,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

271
00:23:55,248 --> 00:24:20,665
[SPEAKER_13]: member russell thank you mayor um yes congratulations certainly i was very excited um when i heard about the the earlier wins um i just have a sort of i guess it's a question probably for the superintendent i think we have a travel policy requiring the whole travel form to be filled out with the nurse's approval and all this other stuff for out of state has that been completed we are in the process of

272
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:30,537
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a form, I'm sorry if you're asking Dr. Vincent, I didn't mean to interject, but just so you know, we are in the process of having parents sign those forms.

273
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:34,638
[SPEAKER_12]: You're absolutely correct, there are forms and we're following all those procedures.

274
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't mean to interject though.

275
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:47,180
[SPEAKER_13]: And since I can't find the form off the top of my head, it could be wrong, but I thought that in the process, which is very much detailed on the form, we had to approve

276
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:52,709
[SPEAKER_13]: the form with its, and I could be wrong, and if I'm.

277
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:56,410
[SPEAKER_13]: So I could have that form for you on Monday, because we're meeting again.

00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:32,503
[SPEAKER_24]: We have report on desi grant awarded to MVTHS principal Chad Fallon.

320
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:34,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening

321
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:41,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So since 2018, Medford Vocational Technical High School has received several grants from the Skills Capital.

322
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:43,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to give you a quick rundown.

323
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:43,954
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2018, we received $500,000 for culinary arts.

324
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:46,156
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2020, we received $287,000 for our robotics and engineering program.

325
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:58,653
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2022, we applied and received $367,000 for our construction and craft laborers program.

326
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:05,279
[SPEAKER_07]: And just recently for this year, we applied for $320,000 for our metal fabrication and it was approved.

327
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,244
[SPEAKER_07]: The metal fabrication program has not had an overhaul like this in probably 15 years.

328
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:15,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're excited, a new teacher, lots of new interest in the program.

329
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,650
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember for a while, we were concerned about whether it would even continue.

330
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's good news.

331
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:30,455
[SPEAKER_07]: The funding is going to provide technology and equipment to update the fabrication and joining technologies program and offer an evening program perhaps for adults.

332
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:35,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the most recent award that I wanted to share with you tonight for the $320,000.

333
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:38,506
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful.

334
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:40,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you want to speak?

335
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:40,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

336
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

337
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:53,425
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to say congratulations also to you and your team for pursuing that grant and lending an additional $300,000 to improve the vocational programming, which is just absolutely wonderful.

338
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,189
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations.

339
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

340
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't be possible without the help of the team and for this specific grant.

341
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:11,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of our teachers, Sam Christie, our robotics and engineering teacher, and also Curtis Jackson, who's the metal fabrication teacher.

342
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It would not have been possible without them.

343
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Fallon, is this a one year grant?

344
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:19,255
[SPEAKER_07]: One year, it has to be spent by June 30th.

345
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:19,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Of 2023?

346
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but we've already pretty much spent it.

347
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:24,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, wonderful.

348
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:26,878

364
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:11,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Welcome.

365
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,665
[SPEAKER_24]: We're gonna have Dr. Edouard-Vincent announce all the students that are here.

366
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:16,326
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

367
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I wanna thank our students.

368
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:20,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that our high school advisors, Ms.

369
00:29:20,088 --> 00:29:21,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Nyland and Ms.

370
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:29,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Simone Elias are not able to be with us this evening, but we have a wonderful cadre of students here who are actively involved.

371
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:36,496
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm gonna first recognize our co-presidents, Naomi Pierre and Sophia Sanwu.

372
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:38,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just take a step forward and wave?

373
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:44,500
[SPEAKER_14]: They are not only our co-presidents, but they are also co-advisors.

374
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:57,426
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is definitely new and you'll hear about it in the presentation, but high school students advising other classmen on projects for CCSR.

375
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:00,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're really, this is really building that student leadership.

376
00:30:01,548 --> 00:30:07,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to call for Jonah Segal, who is our CCSR historian.

377
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:08,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jonah.

378
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:15,793
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like Dan Khoi Nguyen, or Dan Khoi Nguyen, please to step forward.

00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:21,175
[SPEAKER_14]: And your jacket shows it on the sleeve, wonderful.

381
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much, Dan Khoi.

382
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:27,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Baban Gill, who is our communications coordinator.

383
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:28,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Please step forward, yes.

384
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And our vice president of CCSR.

385
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:36,540
[SPEAKER_14]: So these are our future leaders of tomorrow, and Mr. Rich Farter, who is our director.

386
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,921
[SPEAKER_14]: So please present to us, thank you.

387
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:47,622
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, thank you for, oh, I'm Richard Trout, director and founder of the CCSR, and I'm very proud to be here with these wonderful students.

388
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:52,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also want to thank the school committee and the mayor for all their support through the years.

389
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:59,476
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been doing this now almost 10 years, and it's been quite a ride, and there's been a lot of support, and we really appreciate it.

390
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:03,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank the superintendent from the day she started her job.

391
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,831
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been with us.

392
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:11,594
[SPEAKER_09]: She's been the biggest cheerleader and supporter, and she's done a lot of things behind the scenes that you guys probably didn't know about, but she's there for us.

393
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:17,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank the exec team, Joan Bowen, Suzanne Galussi, and Dr. Peter Cushing.

394
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,817
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, sorry for the typo on your name.

395
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:27,560
[SPEAKER_09]: But Peter's been a particularly good advisor and supporter, and I've worked with him to coordinate central office with the program.

396
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,420
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Peter.

397
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank the students.

398
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:37,760
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be speaking in a few minutes and say a few words about their feelings about the program.

399
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can ask them questions also.

400
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,165
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mission of the program is pretty simple.

401
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:45,727
[SPEAKER_09]: It's come down to this.

402
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:49,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's changed a little bit over the years, but right now we focus on students.

403
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:58,117
[SPEAKER_09]: The mission of our program is to provide a learning experience that students can gain important skills and also attitudes.

404
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:05,150
[SPEAKER_09]: The key, I could go through a whole list, but there's three key things, and one of them is self-esteem, self-confidence.

405
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:15,873
[SPEAKER_09]: This process they go through, they create something important, and that's a sure way of increasing confidence and self-esteem, which is critical in success in life.

406
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:26,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really happy that we can do that for them, and I just want to point out, our program has students who are involved in tourism, salutatorians, and students on IEP.

407
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:33,294
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a wide range of students from all backgrounds, and they work together on projects which proves also the empathy part.

408
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:38,255
[SPEAKER_09]: This part of the program is teaching, enhancing empathy and compassion.

409
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:46,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Those things exist, but we want to enhance it, and we want students to get the high, the feeling of good feeling about helping other people.

410
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:52,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they want to do something to feel good, they won't go to drugs or alcohol, they'll go to helping people.

411
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:54,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of a key component of the program.

412
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:59,365
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that's really important is the leadership aspect.

413
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:05,866
[SPEAKER_09]: These students, particularly now, we're getting more and more students involved in leadership roles.

414
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: They become leaders, and so we like to think of them as social entrepreneurs, that when they finish school at the high school, it's only the beginning, and that who knows where they may go, and whatever they do, we hope and maybe expect that those are good things for other people because of the experience they've had.

415
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:47,686
[SPEAKER_09]: These major benefactors, there's a number of benefactors I've listed on the report, but the three major ones are the Bloomberg Philanthropies saw the program by the first donation of $50,000 from Mayor Bloomberg in 2012, and then it was followed by the Cummings Foundation, which gave us a grant for two or three years, and that carried us forward.

416
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after that, Crystal Campbell Foundation,

417
00:33:51,015 --> 00:34:05,299
[SPEAKER_09]: The Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Fund was established, and they put the money into Medford because of the Mifflin gorilla who died, Cheryl.

418
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:14,161
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, you know, Cheryl, sorry, Crystal Campbell, I'm sorry, Crystal Campbell passed away in the massacre, the Boston Massacre, at the marathon.

419
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:23,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now, the latest thing is, there's a special addendum to the report about the grant that we wrote that got us to $350,000 for 10 years.

420
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:35,038
[SPEAKER_09]: And I won't go through all that, just to let you know that when we applied, we applied for a three-year grant for $100,000, but it bumped us up because of our history.

421
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And they gave us the $350,000 for 10 years.

422
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just have now, this is the second year, there's eight more years of funding that we have for the program.

423
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not starting.

424
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,541
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still trying to raise money.

425
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still looking at opportunities for grants.

426
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:59,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had one recently awarded to us from the Method Community Career Program for $10,000 to run a summer leadership academy at the high school.

427
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:05,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to mention the faculty advisors.

428
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:11,640
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent mentioned Marine Island and Samoan Islands.

429
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:28,244
[SPEAKER_09]: At the middle school, at the McGlynn, Wendy Fields, Andrews Middle, Melanie North, McGlynn Elementary, Cindy Griffin, Rebecca Hibben, and Denise Diaz-Jardin, Brooks, Michael Coates, and Lisa Rose, and Roberts, Chanel, Gillian, and Mackenzie.

430
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:34,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the building advisors, so every building is at least one teacher advisor to work with the students.

431
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: The program is based on authentic learning, which means that we give the students a lot of decision making and what they want to do.

432
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:55,820
[SPEAKER_09]: We ask them to find something they care about, and then set a project around it, and create some kind of a project that makes it better, makes the program better, or the issue improved.

433
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:06,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you look through the website, all the projects are there for the last eight years, and you just have to look through them and see the wonderful work the students have done.

434
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:10,285
[SPEAKER_09]: with the students.

435
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:20,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's three, the basics, the basic methodology of the program is project-based learning, and from that, it's pretty self-explanatory.

436
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: We give students the opportunity to do a project they want to do, they believe in, and we help them do it by giving them advice and direction.

437
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:31,616
[SPEAKER_09]: They do the work, and that's the key to the project-based learning.

438
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:35,557
[SPEAKER_09]: We also believe in authentic learning, I just mentioned, so that it's meaningful.

439
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:38,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the third key component, there's two things in learning,

440
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:42,445
[SPEAKER_09]: that are crucial, in my opinion, is engagement and processing.

441
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:47,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And what this program does, it engages students to a high degree and makes them process to a high degree.

442
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:49,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So the learning experience is never forgotten.

443
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:52,870
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something that stays with them the rest of their life.

444
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,612
[SPEAKER_22]: And hopefully, they'll take that learning and pass it on.

445
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:07,944
[SPEAKER_09]: This past year, we were able to get the grant for Techno Leadership Academy for the summer.

446
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:14,928
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be, I already hired a coordinator that she, Simone and I, is going to coordinate the program.

447
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's going to set up the program.

448
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,230
[SPEAKER_09]: She's already got a draft of what it looks like.

449
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to go through all that, except to tell you it's two week sessions at the high school.

450
00:37:24,893 --> 00:37:27,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

451
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll have multiple experiences.

452
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:37,127
[SPEAKER_09]: through projects, we'll have speakers, we'll have people come in to work with them, we have top to tops, we may even get some mentors with us.

453
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:44,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a new program, we're in the planning stages, and I will be happy to come back later on when we have it all set up and give you an overview.

454
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:54,492
[SPEAKER_09]: The last point, I just mentioned it earlier, the second, oh, I want to mention something else.

455
00:37:54,972 --> 00:38:00,574
[SPEAKER_09]: The person that helped me with the report who did the portfolio section was Jonah, and I want to thank him

456
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:01,734
[SPEAKER_09]: for doing that.

457
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:03,235
[SPEAKER_09]: He took all the projects and put it together.

458
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:20,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the last note is that when you look at the report and you look at the addendum, just understand that was a grant that I submitted, and that's what led to the $350,000.

459
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:25,229
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I won't answer any questions, and then the students will speak.

460
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Chaudhary.

461
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:29,752
[SPEAKER_24]: From the chair, if I may, I know I think

462
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:36,635
[SPEAKER_24]: some of the emails that you received from myself and a few others just asking about enrollment in the program.

463
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,176
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know there's been some changes in management.

464
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:45,018
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you could talk a little bit about where you were the last couple of years, even through COVID and how we're doing now.

465
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:46,399
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know Ms.

466
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,560
[SPEAKER_24]: Nyland does a few different things at the high school.

467
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,881
[SPEAKER_24]: So do we have enough staffing for the program?

468
00:38:51,921 --> 00:38:54,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for asking the question.

469
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:54,823
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

470
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me give you the current, and then I'll go backwards.

471
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:04,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, we have around 250 students doing over 50 projects.

472
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:06,725
[SPEAKER_09]: That's K through 12.

473
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:11,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Last year, we had more students at the high school, particularly.

474
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:23,195
[SPEAKER_09]: The K through eight program hasn't changed much, but last spring, Mr. Skorka had decided to leave, and we had to try to scramble to get things back together again.

475
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,577
[SPEAKER_09]: When we started in the fall, I had one teacher,

476
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,870
[SPEAKER_09]: One advisor for the school, we had 70 students.

477
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:35,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we did is we set up the co-advisors.

478
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:40,537
[SPEAKER_09]: The students were given the opportunity to help other students and do projects.

479
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:44,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Since then, we hired Simone Elias, who was second advisor at the high school.

480
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,463
[SPEAKER_09]: She's starting to work with Maureen Nyland, the other high school advisor.

481
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:53,972
[SPEAKER_09]: The two advisors are now working with the students along with the two co-advisors.

482
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:57,872
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have enough support for the program.

483
00:39:57,953 --> 00:40:04,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we'd want to have more students, but we don't assign people they have to want to join.

484
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:10,715
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think next year, from this experience, we're going to get a real start and do more outreach and hopefully get more advisors.

485
00:40:11,555 --> 00:40:13,216
[SPEAKER_09]: We only get the advisors who apply.

486
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:16,936
[SPEAKER_09]: If no one applies, then it's a voluntary program.

487
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope someone does apply.

488
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so that's, that's where we are.

489
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:25,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So I look, and also I really say that fluid program.

490
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:30,379
[SPEAKER_09]: weekend students coming in now, you know, we're getting new advisors coming in now.

491
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:34,561
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a static program that starts in September and ends in May.

492
00:40:35,362 --> 00:40:35,822
[SPEAKER_09]: It changes.

493
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:38,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the projects change and the number of students change.

494
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:45,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Because some elementary programs work on little, they have like sessions, they'll have a four week session and new kids come in and they work it that way.

495
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:50,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's important to remember that elementary programs are seed programs.

496
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:51,770
[SPEAKER_09]: The projects aren't complex.

497
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:56,433
[SPEAKER_09]: They might be just, you know, having a fundraiser and our son having

498
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:59,374
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever it is, it sees for the future.

499
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:07,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets more comprehensive as they get into middle school, and then the high school is really a place where all the really powerful stuff can happen.

500
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:15,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, if you went along and saw what happened with the elementary program when we did the enslaved monument, those are elementary students.

501
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:18,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you remember that, but it was a fantastic project that elementary students did.

502
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:26,179
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can't sell them short, but we try to make it less complex at the beginning, and then as they get more mature, we try to increase the complexity.

503
00:41:27,475 --> 00:41:33,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And so answering your question, Mayor, I think we had a little setback, but we've come back and we reorganized.

504
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:38,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's also giving the students an opportunity to be leaders.

505
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:42,421
[SPEAKER_09]: These new positions that were just mentioned, the superintendent mentioned, we didn't have those before.

506
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:45,322
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have a webmaster, but the other functions were all created.

507
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:52,884
[SPEAKER_09]: And it makes us better for the program, but also the students gain leadership skills, enhanced leadership skills.

508
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,983
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter.

509
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,964
[SPEAKER_24]: So you have an outreach plan.

510
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:00,765
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's dropped from like 200 to 70.

511
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:09,187
[SPEAKER_24]: So will the outreach plan be put in writing so that we can make sure we're moving along for enrollment next year?

512
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I can give you a plan, sure.

513
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

514
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:15,009
[SPEAKER_24]: Member McLaughlin?

515
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Trotter and all the students that participate in CCSR.

516
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:26,718
[SPEAKER_19]: It is one of my favorite aspects of our district.

517
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:28,679
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's an incredible program.

518
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:47,628
[SPEAKER_19]: And I do think that, especially now when we know that there are so many behavioral health and social emotional needs in our community and with our adolescents, it's so important to be able to get outside of ourselves and think about how we can help other people and just that reward of helping others and helps us get outside of ourselves.

519
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,510
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wonder, is this book available to the public?

520
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it online at all?

521
00:42:53,752 --> 00:42:54,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can put it online.

522
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:59,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that would be great because I just wanted to share you know one of the projects the English learner give back program.

523
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:10,898
[SPEAKER_19]: I was looking through to see what was being done with students with disabilities and English and you know students who have English as a second language or families that have English as a second language in the first

524
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:29,009
[SPEAKER_19]: Page 19, the first two things I saw from 2019-2020 was the English Learner Give Back program and the reverse inclusion experience that had been happening with the access classroom at the high school, which I know several of those students that participated in, and for both the students with and without disabilities, that was such a rewarding program.

525
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:42,434
[SPEAKER_19]: And for the EL Give Back program, these videos introducing people to the district, students to the district, and the videos are uploaded in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and this year, Hindi will be added.

526
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:49,176
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just think that that's a great example of the equity that we're talking about in the district and wanting to have this outreach in the district.

527
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:55,538
[SPEAKER_19]: So I applaud all of you students and all of the advisors that are out there working so hard on this as well.

528
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:56,819
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would ask,

529
00:43:57,884 --> 00:44:00,444
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that I'm hoping to meet at some point as well.

530
00:44:01,045 --> 00:44:14,167
[SPEAKER_19]: I would ask if there can be some consideration or if there has been some consideration just in terms of outreach, what that might look like for students who are newcomers to participate in the program, right?

531
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:17,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Not just to be a beneficiary of the program, but to participate in the program.

532
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:23,409
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that might look like needing an interpreter or needing translation for some of the stuff.

533
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:25,429
[SPEAKER_19]: And the same goes for students with

534
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:41,004
[SPEAKER_19]: significant disabilities being able to participate and what that looks like for our staff to either have support, whether it be through paraprofessionals or behavior support individuals to help them be part of CCSR as well.

535
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:44,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So is that something that can be considered for the future?

536
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:53,607
[SPEAKER_09]: other staff at the high school, and that goes to the district to do that, the money and the grant might be able to cover some of the costs.

537
00:44:55,227 --> 00:45:15,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, we're open to, it's important to remember, this is a student program, and they decide what they wanna do, and we can try to advise them, but I think that'd be a great thing, not just as a project, but as a policy, make it clear in the outreach that anyone can be part of this program.

538
00:45:15,598 --> 00:45:16,338
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't agree more.

539
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:19,160
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love that the social justice piece is so embedded in this.

540
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,002
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanted to add that sometimes you need a partner to participate in the program.

541
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:30,304
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes it can be hard for some students who maybe are a little bit more isolated and don't know how to find a partner.

542
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:40,629
[SPEAKER_19]: So I love your peer-to-peer model because I think students get it better than any of us in terms of what that can feel like, that isolation and the need to have a mentor and what that looks like.

543
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:43,570
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really appreciate the thought around that.

544
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great idea.

545
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:46,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

546
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:51,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say something on that project, because this kind of symbolizes the program.

547
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:58,305
[SPEAKER_09]: When that was done, the Give Back program, it was a contest promoted by Kind Bars.

548
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:00,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a national contest.

549
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:03,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had three young ladies do the project.

550
00:46:04,271 --> 00:46:05,713
[SPEAKER_09]: They were juniors, I believe.

551
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:15,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Assembly in the auditorium, news media came, they got $1,000 a piece, and one of the girls was answering a question from a reporter.

552
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:20,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm gonna preface this by saying this one particular young lady had a real difficulty in middle school.

553
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:26,339
[SPEAKER_09]: She struggled, and the assistant principal who was a friend of mine said, I don't know how she got there, but she got through the school.

554
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:30,181
[SPEAKER_09]: She got to the high school and she joined our group, and she did really well.

555
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:33,723
[SPEAKER_09]: The reporter asked her a question, what have you learned?

556
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:35,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And she said, I learned I can do anything.

557
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:37,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the essence of the program.

558
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:41,376
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of transition without one student is worth the whole program.

559
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:44,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can just change one life, we're successful.

560
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:45,639
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

561
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:46,299
[SPEAKER_19]: You learned what?

562
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:48,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I can learn I can do anything.

563
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, exactly.

564
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,962
[SPEAKER_19]: And so also just thinking about restorative justice, right?

565
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:55,584
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking all the time about restorative justice in our district.

566
00:46:55,684 --> 00:47:04,248
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think this is a really great example of how restorative justice can work and how, you know, again, we can get outside of ourselves and think about how we can help our community.

567
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:14,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I welcome the idea of working with other people and students, staff in the schools to make it more accessible, whether it's handicapped or newcomers.

568
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:27,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a great idea, particularly if we get a really start, you know, we've been hindered with the start in September, October, because it's kind of late, you know, a lot of students are running with decisions about courses and things and we're getting into late and they don't have the afternoons free.

569
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:31,311
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an afternoon school program, so students have to be available.

570
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:39,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the idea of starting in the spring and getting the advisors hired in the spring instead of waiting until the fall will be a big help.

571
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:41,817
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

572
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:49,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Did any of the students want to speak?

573
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:52,865
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Naomi.

574
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:56,287
[SPEAKER_25]: I am a senior at Medford High, and I joined CCSAR

575
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:00,915
[SPEAKER_25]: during the beginning of my sophomore year, which is during online learning.

576
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:06,401
[SPEAKER_25]: I joined when my friend Boban asked me to join the Seeds to Feed project.

577
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,683
[SPEAKER_25]: She'll talk more about that later.

578
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:15,131
[SPEAKER_25]: But that was my first project, and I later became a portfolio during my junior year.

579
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:17,654
[SPEAKER_25]: And from there, I began to

580
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:23,769
[SPEAKER_25]: to become a co-president, and I became a part of the tech workshop project.

581
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:30,711
[SPEAKER_25]: And from there, I just helped Medford senior citizens in the nursing home become tech savvy and better with technology.

582
00:48:31,531 --> 00:48:43,253
[SPEAKER_25]: And being CCSR has taught me how to be a better person, how to better lead in my community, how to make my community a better place, and how to fix change that I see that are noticeable in my community.

583
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:44,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

584
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:44,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

585
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:45,514
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, great work.

586
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:58,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, I'm Baban Gil and I'm also a senior and I joined CCSR the beginning of my freshman, not freshman year, sophomore year, sorry.

587
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:18,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started the Seeds to Feed project with Naomi and this project really created like a huge impact towards many families in the Medford community who were unable to provide for themselves

588
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:20,296
[SPEAKER_04]: for like food.

589
00:49:21,016 --> 00:49:24,857
[SPEAKER_04]: So we grew fruits and vegetables in the Medford High School in our courtyard garden.

590
00:49:25,898 --> 00:49:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And from that, we donated them to the local community market on Mystic Ave in Medford.

591
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:45,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So we donated over 10 pounds of pears, over 20 pounds of blackberries, raspberries, and yeah.

592
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,283
[SPEAKER_24]: Wonderful, wonderful, good job.

593
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:56,862
[SPEAKER_27]: I am Sophia and I am a junior and co-president of CCSR as well as co-advisor like Naomi.

594
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:05,606
[SPEAKER_27]: And I originally joined CCSR in my freshman year because I had a friend in the program already who asked me to join her project, which Ms.

595
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:08,528
[SPEAKER_27]: McLaughlin, you mentioned that it was EL Giveback.

596
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:17,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think that when I joined EL Giveback, the idea of the program was to help English learner students help

597
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:25,021
[SPEAKER_27]: like adjust into the medford high school community and I find that like so important because I was also an English learner when I was really little.

598
00:50:25,802 --> 00:50:40,838
[SPEAKER_27]: And I didn't really have those resources available to me, but having like resources, such as this is like it helps make it helps make our Community more inclusive and so that's that we're hoping to revamp the project more this year and next year.

599
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:43,934
[SPEAKER_27]: because it's been on a little bit of a hiatus right now.

600
00:50:45,135 --> 00:50:50,137
[SPEAKER_27]: And then last year, I also was a portfolio manager, like Naomi and Baban.

601
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:54,199
[SPEAKER_27]: And this year, I was co-president.

602
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:01,803
[SPEAKER_27]: And I am also continuing the PENPAL project, which has a PENPAL exchange between the high school and elementary students.

603
00:51:02,203 --> 00:51:04,584
[SPEAKER_27]: And it helps form like intergenerational friendships.

604
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:05,765
[SPEAKER_27]: And it also gives like

605
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:13,874
[SPEAKER_27]: writing support to students, it helps them develop their language skills, and it also gives them a role model to look up to.

606
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:14,814
[SPEAKER_27]: Wonderful.

607
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

608
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:24,757
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Dan Khoi Nguyen, and I'm a senior right now, and I've been in the CCSR since I was a freshman.

609
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:32,860
[SPEAKER_31]: My job is to handle the website, so throughout the year, I post more about current projects and

610
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,682
[SPEAKER_31]: the history and like about us as the organization.

611
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:45,107
[SPEAKER_31]: And at the end of each year, I post the portfolio, which is the projects from K to 12, all the students, every single one.

612
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:53,211
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think it's just a great way to see all like the tangible and like evident ways that we've helped out the community.

613
00:51:53,912 --> 00:52:01,376
[SPEAKER_31]: And for me, I think it's just been a great opportunity to see my passions and my interests to connect with helping out

614
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,961
[SPEAKER_31]: people and the community.

615
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:05,703
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

616
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:06,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

617
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:06,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

618
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:07,083
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

619
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:11,947
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Jonah.

620
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:13,388
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a sophomore.

621
00:52:13,988 --> 00:52:16,810
[SPEAKER_16]: I joined the CCSR as a freshman.

622
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,853
[SPEAKER_16]: I was looking for some engaging extracurriculars and CCSR really

623
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:30,994
[SPEAKER_16]: I was attracted to it because it had a very, you know, relaxed, self-paced environment.

624
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:38,557
[SPEAKER_16]: So I partnered with another student leader who was also a freshman, and we created the TCSR Park and River Cleanups.

625
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:43,840
[SPEAKER_16]: And so this is an ongoing project where we've been cleaning up our environment.

626
00:52:44,785 --> 00:52:53,912
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the CCSR is great because it's kind of a crossroads of both helping the world and helping myself as an individual.

627
00:52:53,972 --> 00:53:06,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Because through cleaning up the environment, I've learned really important life skills like project planning, community outreach, communicating with external organizations.

628
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,124
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been in frequent contact with the Mystic River Watershed Association, the DPW.

629
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,741
[SPEAKER_16]: and budgeting.

630
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:18,785
[SPEAKER_16]: We wrote and were awarded a $2,000 Tufts community grant last year.

631
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:29,193
[SPEAKER_16]: And so through this experience, it really just taught me to be a leader, which is why I ran for the historic position.

632
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:33,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I really just thought this taught me I could do more for my community, and I'm looking to do just that.

633
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:43,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, thank you for joining us.

634
00:53:43,475 --> 00:53:44,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

635
00:53:44,435 --> 00:53:48,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanna say my bucket is so full right now.

636
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:49,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

637
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Demos says that all the time too, but my bucket's really full.

638
00:53:52,782 --> 00:53:54,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I am so proud of all of you.

639
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:57,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for being courageous and coming up here and speaking.

640
00:53:58,687 --> 00:54:07,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Future historians and, I don't know, media tech and advisors and Councilors, you're doing the wonderful work that needs to happen.

641
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,016
[SPEAKER_14]: There were great things happening at Medford High School.

642
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:14,800
[SPEAKER_14]: and those great things are also happening with this wonderful CCSR team.

643
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,662
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations, and I'm very proud of all of you.

644
00:54:17,682 --> 00:54:18,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

645
00:54:19,244 --> 00:54:19,864
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely.

646
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:23,307
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor?

647
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:24,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin?

648
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:34,897
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I also just wanted to say thank you to all the students and to let you know that the school committee is here as well for any help or outreach or anything like that that you need.

649
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:35,398
[SPEAKER_19]: This is such a

650
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:52,434
[SPEAKER_19]: great program and I don't think I've heard so much clapping in the school committee chambers in one night in a long time, so it feels really good, I have to say, just for all the good news, but I would like to make a motion for an outreach plan for the CCSR that is inclusive and

651
00:54:53,274 --> 00:55:06,083
[SPEAKER_19]: and thoughtful around the diversity, equity and inclusion aspect of outreach for the program and how we can, we and experts in the community and others can help support that.

652
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Any timeline to that?

653
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:14,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say, I guess maybe I would ask Mr. Trotter what he would think would be reasonable.

654
00:55:14,368 --> 00:55:21,293
[SPEAKER_22]: May I go first?

655
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:22,336
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

656
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:23,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometime in May.

657
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:24,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

658
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:24,860
[SPEAKER_22]: May 15th?

659
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:25,861
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

660
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:26,642
[SPEAKER_21]: May 15th.

661
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:27,023
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfect.

662
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:27,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfect.

663
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

664
00:55:28,165 --> 00:55:31,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion for member McLaughlin seconded by... I need the language.

665
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:34,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

666
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:36,416
[SPEAKER_19]: The language is that by May 15th,

667
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:54,638
[SPEAKER_19]: 2023, the CCSR will provide an inclusive outreach plan that considers students of all backgrounds and abilities for meaningful citizenship.

668
00:55:58,194 --> 00:55:59,814
[SPEAKER_24]: especially at the high school level.

669
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:01,315
[SPEAKER_24]: At the high school level.

670
00:56:01,335 --> 00:56:02,015
[SPEAKER_24]: To keep the numbers up.

671
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:03,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, for all of them.

672
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:08,136
[SPEAKER_19]: For all, the high school level, obviously, but all of the levels to, yes, to increase our outreach.

673
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:15,818
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's such a great program that, you know, so that we can see an increase in membership and support of all of our students.

674
00:56:16,918 --> 00:56:26,241
[SPEAKER_09]: On that point, it's important that we work together with Superintendent, because I have to work with Peter, so we have to plan together.

675
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

676
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:29,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, sounds great.

677
00:56:29,206 --> 00:56:40,448
[SPEAKER_19]: So do we want, do we want to add to the motion that, you know, that CCSR will work with central administrate an amendment to the ocean, the motion that they'll work with central administration, um, to, you know, ensure an outreach plan that's reasonable.

678
00:56:41,128 --> 00:56:41,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

679
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:42,529
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfect.

680
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:46,369
[SPEAKER_24]: May I read it?

681
00:56:46,749 --> 00:56:47,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

682
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:55,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the motion is to receive a plan by May 15th, 2023, um, from the CCSR and central administration.

683
00:56:58,209 --> 00:56:59,729
[SPEAKER_21]: and central administration, thank you.

684
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:08,291
[SPEAKER_13]: That will provide an inclusive outreach plan that considers students of all backgrounds and abilities for meaningful citizenship to increase outreach.

685
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:11,612
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that right?

686
00:57:13,052 --> 00:57:13,812
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

687
00:57:15,953 --> 00:57:16,293
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

688
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by Dr. Graham.

689
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:20,373
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

690
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:20,954
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

691
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:21,934
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

692
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:22,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

693
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:27,175
[SPEAKER_18]: We have motion to suspend the rules and take item seven,

694
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,252
[SPEAKER_18]: and out of order to hear from Beth Kelly and track parents.

695
00:57:32,853 --> 00:57:33,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Item six.

696
00:57:34,794 --> 00:57:35,535
[SPEAKER_24]: Six.

697
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:42,320
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to suspend the rules to take item six by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

698
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,080
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

699
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:43,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

700
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:44,681
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

701
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,643
[SPEAKER_24]: We have presentations of the public not to begin before seven.

702
00:57:48,784 --> 00:57:55,929
[SPEAKER_24]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

703
00:57:56,784 --> 00:57:58,945
[SPEAKER_24]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

704
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:04,248
[SPEAKER_24]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue.

705
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:12,132
[SPEAKER_24]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

706
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:18,615
[SPEAKER_24]: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH, public comment and presentations to the public.

707
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:24,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Pursuant to that policy, public comment and presentation to the public, any resident in the audience may give

708
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,904
[SPEAKER_24]: be given permission to speak for up to three minutes.

709
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,825
[SPEAKER_24]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

710
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:36,627
[SPEAKER_24]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and Medford Street address where they reside.

711
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:41,549
[SPEAKER_24]: A welcoming, inclusive committee is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

712
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:45,190
[SPEAKER_24]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

713
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:50,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Employees in Medford Public Schools are exempt from this residency requirement of this policy.

714
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:53,393
[SPEAKER_24]: The voice of our employees is welcome on all matters before the body.

715
00:58:54,121 --> 00:59:02,188
[SPEAKER_24]: when a non-Metro resident employee is participating in public comment or submitting a presentation to the public, they will include their home address and identify themselves as an employee of the Metro Public Schools.

716
00:59:02,928 --> 00:59:04,269
[SPEAKER_24]: With that being said, Ms.

717
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:12,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Kelly and track parents, I know track athletes, you're here to talk about the state of equipment and the coaching position.

718
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:13,317
[SPEAKER_24]: So welcome.

719
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

720
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to the committee for

721
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:22,074
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting us and allowing us to speak tonight.

722
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:23,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

723
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:25,536
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Beth Kelly.

724
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:31,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I reside at 32 Chardon Road, and I've been a Medford resident for over 25 years.

725
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the mother of two boys, Will, who's a current junior at the high school, and Paul, who graduated in the class of 2021.

726
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:45,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had the privilege of watching both of our sons participate in both indoor and outdoor track.

727
00:59:46,471 --> 00:59:48,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a combined six years and counting.

728
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:52,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I share with you tonight is not isolated to this season.

729
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:56,715
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a sad history of neglect of the track team.

730
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:04,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But first let me share with you how great this team is and how fortunate our sons have been to be a part of it.

731
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:08,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So our girls team won the JBL championship this season.

732
01:00:14,749 --> 01:00:17,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And our boys finished third in a very close competition.

733
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:27,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So our team sent one of their largest groups of athletes in recent years to compete at the Division Two state championships and broke four school records at that meet.

734
01:00:33,794 --> 01:00:40,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's remarkable about this team is not just their athletic skill, but their ability to compete with some of the best schools in the states.

735
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Schools with much more funding, better equipment and resources and much more support from their districts.

736
01:00:47,683 --> 01:00:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Coach Donlan pretty much single handedly developed this team into the championship caliber team that it is today.

737
01:00:55,086 --> 01:01:01,368
[SPEAKER_02]: He performs just outrageous feats every week, coaching nearly 80 student athletes in multiple events.

738
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:09,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sprinting, jumping, hurdling, throwing, distance running, and on top of that, he's coordinating meets and transportation.

739
01:01:10,072 --> 01:01:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: He's maintaining a team website that keeps both the athletes and the parents informed.

740
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:18,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's doing that really by himself with very little support.

741
01:01:18,694 --> 01:01:25,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Most track teams at other schools have both a boys and a girls coach, in addition to multiple assistant coaches.

742
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: In Medford, we have one coach for both boys and girls.

743
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:34,037
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, the track team has faulty and ancient and absent equipment.

744
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:37,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really disappointing and unnecessary.

745
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So we learned recently that Coach Donlan is stepping down from his role.

746
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:46,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This news was shocking and disheartening for many of us.

747
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So our athletes really depend on track for their physical, social, and emotional health.

748
01:01:51,865 --> 01:01:54,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some, it'll be an important part of their path to college.

749
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,501
[SPEAKER_02]: The spring season will be here in a very few short weeks.

750
01:01:58,641 --> 01:02:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really imperative that high quality coaches be in place for the start of the season.

751
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:08,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need new equipment and resources for these coaches to be successful.

752
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:12,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we risk them becoming overwhelmed and frustrated and walking away.

753
01:02:13,527 --> 01:02:18,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need more than just a temporary fix and more than just a warm body that can supervise the athletes.

754
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:24,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Our athletes need and deserve coaching, mentoring and instruction, not just supervision.

755
01:02:25,097 --> 01:02:30,359
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a strategic plan for the future and for the sustained growth and development of the program.

756
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as good as this track team is, we see the potential and know it can be great, but we need your support.

757
01:02:38,183 --> 01:02:43,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight with us, we have some athletes and some parents that would like to share their experiences and observations.

758
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:57,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

759
01:02:59,060 --> 01:02:59,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

760
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Just your name and address for the record, please.

761
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,182
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, sorry.

762
01:03:02,202 --> 01:03:04,443
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just asking about my, sorry.

763
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,264
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Richard Charles.

764
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:09,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on Auburn Street, and I am one of the captains of the track team.

765
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:15,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big issue that we've been having for years, since I've been running since my freshman year, is our equipment.

766
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:18,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Our equipment is very aged and very old.

767
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:21,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, one of our events is 55 meter.

768
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,692
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that to do well, you need good starting blocks.

769
01:03:26,252 --> 01:03:30,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And for our starting blocks to operate properly, we need people standing on the blocks.

770
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:34,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And for regular blocks, you usually don't need people standing on it.

771
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:38,499
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you, and you set up your blocks, and then you just go out.

772
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:44,522
[SPEAKER_01]: But for our blocks to actually work properly, we need someone standing on said blocks for them to stand still.

773
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you try the blocks on your own, they will usually

774
01:03:47,544 --> 01:03:52,626
[SPEAKER_01]: fall back or they would, they're hard to move, they're hard to adjust, they're a hassle to deal with.

775
01:03:52,807 --> 01:04:03,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been something that some of our runners have been needing because my, my trackers are, they have a lot of potential and a lot of talent and I want them to be able to reach that talent.

776
01:04:04,032 --> 01:04:09,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they get, if they miss like certain times, like for stage or nationals or for a certain meet,

777
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:13,392
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had a bad start or because of this or because of that.

778
01:04:14,013 --> 01:04:15,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hate to see that.

779
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:17,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hate to see them not be able to reach what they can get.

780
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:20,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a senior, so I'm going to be leaving soon.

781
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:29,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hate to see some of these younger kids not make it to what they are capable of making, because I've had that feeling a lot.

782
01:04:29,242 --> 01:04:36,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been close to some things in the past, but I've failed sometimes because of our equipment, but also because

783
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:37,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't able to make it.

784
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:39,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hate to see that for them.

785
01:04:39,227 --> 01:04:43,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hate to see that just because of some technicality, because we have bad blocks or something like that.

786
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:49,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually when we go to other meets or other schools, they usually have better condition equipment.

787
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,750
[SPEAKER_01]: They have better blocks that usually don't need to be stood on.

788
01:04:54,770 --> 01:05:02,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to see us have that finally, and for us to finally be able to do better in certain events.

789
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:19,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my name is Maria Colombo.

790
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I live on 18 Wildwood Road, and I am a senior.

791
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:26,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been on the track team since my freshman year.

792
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:30,530
[SPEAKER_06]: At first, I was only on the team to keep in shape for soccer in the fall and spring.

793
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the environment that Coach Donlan had developed soon changed the way I saw the sport.

794
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:42,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I played soccer for years, and while yes, my teammates were often supportive, it never compared to how track members rallied together to cheer each other on.

795
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:49,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Running can be a painful and often lonely activity, especially in distance when you have to run one or two miles around a track.

796
01:05:50,186 --> 01:06:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet I've never felt that that was the case on Medford, oh God, on the Medford track team to the sheer amount of energy that my teammates bring to each and every event.

797
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:09,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it's our track team's unique support system and love of track that ultimately led to the girls becoming this year's GBL champions.

798
01:06:10,953 --> 01:06:14,035
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, not everything can be fixed with a positive attitude.

799
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:20,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Donovan has gone above and beyond for my teammates not, but at a certain point, there's only so much one person can do.

800
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a distance runner for the past four years.

801
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:30,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we were not affected by broken equipment, the lack of coaches has often disadvantaged us heavily.

802
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:37,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever since my freshman year, distance has been sent out of the gym or Hormel to complete their workouts on their own.

803
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:45,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Donovan has tried to watch and critique as many workouts of ours as possible, but he can only do that when we are in the gym with him.

804
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:49,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And even then, he has about 60 other kids that he has to coach.

805
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:57,375
[SPEAKER_06]: This has turned into a safety issue on a few occasions in which we lose a kid on our runs and we have to retrace our steps to find him.

806
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:11,267
[SPEAKER_06]: When Donovan can't, the upperclassmen have always stepped up when it comes to keeping track of their teammates and their events, teaching new people techniques, and making sure that everyone makes their event during the chaos of meets, but they shouldn't have to.

807
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:15,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Track is one of the most successful sports Medford has.

808
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:23,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Coach Donlan, parents and students of Medford High have put so much time and effort into this team, and we've had trophies, medals and ribbons to show for it.

809
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:27,782
[SPEAKER_06]: But at a certain point, there is only so much we can do, and we need help.

810
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:36,805
[SPEAKER_06]: This team deserves good coaches, it deserves functional equipment, and it deserves the funding that matches the effort everyone else has put into it.

811
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:37,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

812
01:07:51,778 --> 01:07:53,999
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, hello, my name is Will Kelly.

813
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,139
[SPEAKER_29]: I live on 32 Chardon Road.

814
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,001
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a junior at Medford High, and I've been a sprinter on the track team for four seasons.

815
01:08:02,301 --> 01:08:17,806
[SPEAKER_29]: Recently, I competed in the D2 State Championship, broke one of the school records myself, and... And that school record also just qualified me for Nike Indoor Nationals.

816
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:26,227
[SPEAKER_29]: So I just want to start off by saying how important track is to my life.

817
01:08:27,147 --> 01:08:31,368
[SPEAKER_29]: It's something that I look forward to every day after school.

818
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,629
[SPEAKER_29]: The team and the sport in general just has a great energy to it.

819
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:39,029
[SPEAKER_29]: I've met a lot of friends, including athletes on opposing teams as well.

820
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,370
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's just a very enjoyable for me.

821
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,091
[SPEAKER_29]: And I really wish to continue it in college as long as the rest of my high school career goes well.

822
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:56,918
[SPEAKER_29]: So one of the reasons I enjoy it so much was because I'm a sprinter and I'm one of the top athletes on the team, which means I get a lot of attention from coach.

823
01:08:57,959 --> 01:09:00,883
[SPEAKER_29]: But sadly, that's not true for a lot of the other athletes.

824
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:06,088
[SPEAKER_29]: I've gotten a lot of attention, which has been crucial for my development as an athlete.

825
01:09:06,888 --> 01:09:15,713
[SPEAKER_29]: So my previous coach, Coach Dahlman, he is giving me specific workouts with carefully timed rests, rest periods, paces that are frequently adjusted.

826
01:09:16,454 --> 01:09:24,398
[SPEAKER_29]: He was always looking out for me, but while he was looking out for me, he wasn't paying attention, as much attention to the other athletes who also need help as well.

827
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:35,448
[SPEAKER_29]: So he was the only, he was only one man, which, which made it really difficult to manage everybody's workout at the same time, especially in the chaos of the gym and the chaos of meets.

828
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:40,432
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, so the sad truth is not everyone is getting the attention and coaching that they need to succeed.

829
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:46,397
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, as one of the top athletes, I can certainly say that coaching helps and I was a freshman once too.

830
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:53,023
[SPEAKER_29]: So I know how difficult and confusing it can be, um, when you don't have the type of support that I have right now.

831
01:09:53,904 --> 01:09:53,984
[SPEAKER_29]: Um,

832
01:09:55,509 --> 01:10:01,376
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm scared to see what our spring season is going to look like if we don't get the proper coaching that we need.

833
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:04,120
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to look disorganized.

834
01:10:04,861 --> 01:10:07,123
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel like we're going to lose a lot of our numbers as well.

835
01:10:09,611 --> 01:10:16,077
[SPEAKER_29]: So yeah, for me, it's a very important year as well, the spring season, as I'm trying to get recruited to run in college.

836
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:24,466
[SPEAKER_29]: And so it's important that I, for me personally, it's important that I get proper coaching.

837
01:10:24,526 --> 01:10:30,992
[SPEAKER_29]: Track means something to a lot of people, especially me, and I would hate to see the season wasted for everybody.

838
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:40,366
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know, oh, we have one.

839
01:10:46,173 --> 01:10:46,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome.

840
01:10:48,697 --> 01:10:55,466
[SPEAKER_24]: We're just gonna put, I'll press the little face on the, so we can turn that on, unless Mr. McLaughlin can.

841
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:00,132
[SPEAKER_24]: Perfect, thank you.

842
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,213
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Cece Colombo.

843
01:11:02,873 --> 01:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I live on 18 Wildwood Road.

844
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:05,695
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister, she just went.

845
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a freshman at Medford High.

846
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:13,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is my first year on the team, but I've already learned to love the sport.

847
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:21,967
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it also started off as something to do in the off season just for soccer, which I played for Medford High this past fall.

848
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:29,435
[SPEAKER_05]: As I compare my experience with the soccer and track teams, some significant differences come to mind.

849
01:11:30,756 --> 01:11:39,301
[SPEAKER_05]: With soccer, we had a varsity and a JV team with three coaches in total, and sometimes even three coaches just for varsity when JV wasn't playing.

850
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And having this staffing made a huge difference.

851
01:11:43,904 --> 01:11:46,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of the difference it made was the responsibility to go to practice.

852
01:11:47,844 --> 01:11:51,505
[SPEAKER_05]: We were expected to go every single day so that we could become better as a team.

853
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:58,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And at track, there's so many kids that not everyone can even be accounted for, just by one coach.

854
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:00,707
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not his fault.

855
01:12:02,248 --> 01:12:06,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But this led to many kids not showing up to practice because they don't think it's mandatory.

856
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:15,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And also on rare occasions, there'd be times when our coach would not be available and they would have to fall upon the upperclassmen to run the practice.

857
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:23,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there were to be more coaches, I think that they would be able to fill in for each other and keep like the practice culture intact.

858
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:31,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Another problem when it comes to the athletes not being accounted for is getting home from away meets.

859
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:40,711
[SPEAKER_05]: In the soccer season, we would always have to tell one of the coaches when we were not riding home on the bus and everyone would be accounted for.

860
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:50,473
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes at away meets for track, the coach would have to ask us for clarification that our friends were either on the bus or got a ride home from someone else.

861
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't our coaches fault because there were too many kids for one or two people to keep track of, but that shouldn't be our responsibility either.

862
01:12:58,626 --> 01:13:01,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I love track and being.

863
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:06,965
[SPEAKER_24]: Geez, sorry.

864
01:13:07,825 --> 01:13:08,225
[SPEAKER_24]: It's okay.

865
01:13:08,966 --> 01:13:12,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I was just gonna say it's channel five as I was following the weather, sorry.

866
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:15,609
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's okay.

867
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:23,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I love track and being a part of a team with these people, and I've had a great past few months, and track is, it's the best part of my day.

868
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:34,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just, it was just the lower funding that took away from that experience, and I think that in the following years with the proper funding, we can have a great team, and I can't wait to see where we go.

869
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:50,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Cooper Sue.

870
01:13:50,371 --> 01:13:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on 93rd Street and I'm a freshman at Medford High School.

871
01:13:54,814 --> 01:13:57,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also my first year at track.

872
01:13:59,317 --> 01:14:07,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Like other people, I also thought this would just be like a conditioning sport to get me ready for soccer and lacrosse, but it's much more than that.

873
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great community to be in.

874
01:14:11,004 --> 01:14:12,346
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're in it, it's just really good.

875
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:15,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can talk to the upperclassmen.

876
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:23,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, there's not many sports where you can talk to the upperclassmen and gain insight from them as much as you do in the track.

877
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:28,507
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about my freshman experiences as we do this.

878
01:14:30,775 --> 01:14:32,656
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start track, there's a lot that you don't know.

879
01:14:32,736 --> 01:14:38,399
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things like strides and paces that are hard to keep up with.

880
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a lot of events this year.

881
01:14:42,382 --> 01:14:47,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that comes a lot of learning and a lot of technique, especially if it's your first time.

882
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:52,447
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I would do hurtling and high jump and long jump.

883
01:14:53,868 --> 01:14:55,569
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes a lot of technique.

884
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:57,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what would happen is,

885
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:10,587
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time I would like do jumps with other people, but coach couldn't like always oversee it and give us like all of the teaching and technique that we need.

886
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:14,650
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would be off and we would just be like, are we jumping high enough?

887
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we doing this well enough?

888
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:19,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I felt like I wasn't improving.

889
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:21,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like go on my own time to.

890
01:15:22,595 --> 01:15:30,442
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like go on YouTube and look up tutorials and go to other kids on other track teams and be like, is this how I should be hurdling?

891
01:15:30,882 --> 01:15:32,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that should be the case.

892
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:45,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we had more coaches, um, or more assistants to help, uh, we wouldn't need to go up to other teams or ask them for their support on how to like do a hurdling.

893
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:46,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

894
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:58,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when we would like their times invitationals and like people would look at our handoffs, and we had a coach I was like maybe you should hand off like this and you're like oh well.

895
01:15:59,178 --> 01:16:01,420
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we should, but it just never occurred to us.

896
01:16:02,961 --> 01:16:08,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that because I'm an underclassman, we have upperclassmen and they help a lot.

897
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:14,630
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are times when I was like being taught by them how to do things with new ways to run.

898
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:17,832
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a form to running and all of this.

899
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:19,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really good.

900
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, these are good upperclassmen, but I also feel like it shouldn't be their job to coach.

901
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:25,778
[SPEAKER_00]: They should just enforce the rules.

902
01:16:26,659 --> 01:16:29,284
[SPEAKER_00]: or keep up to standard with them that the coaches set.

903
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:35,615
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there's only like one or two, it's very hard to keep everything and maintain it.

904
01:16:36,952 --> 01:16:43,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to talk about broken equipment, and specifically the high jump and the hurdles, because that affects me.

905
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:51,423
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the high jump, there is the mat, and then there's a bunch of mats on top.

906
01:16:51,863 --> 01:16:58,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hooks on the loops are falling off, and it doesn't really hold down the bottom mats as well.

907
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:03,352
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you jump, the mats can move, and that could become a safety hazard if it moves.

908
01:17:04,272 --> 01:17:06,273
[SPEAKER_00]: and someone gets injured because they hit the floor.

909
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:14,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with the hurdles, there are a lot of broken hurdles and they're like plastic pieces on the sides that could like cut someone.

910
01:17:14,995 --> 01:17:27,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when you're setting stuff up and you're trying to find hurdles that are like suitable to use, you can go up and it like wastes your time for practice and then you lose your hurdling practice time.

911
01:17:29,148 --> 01:17:34,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And also during our meets, we would not have enough hurdles that were usable.

912
01:17:34,771 --> 01:17:39,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to use our older flimsy hurdles during the meets just because we didn't have enough for four lanes.

913
01:17:40,814 --> 01:17:51,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that if we had more hurdles and more funding and more coaches, that would really help and benefit for the next years to come.

914
01:18:12,765 --> 01:18:16,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, my name is Jacob Stegerl, and I'm here to talk about what it's like at the track meet.

915
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,912
[SPEAKER_30]: I've been running since my freshman year, and I'm now a junior.

916
01:18:22,552 --> 01:18:24,213
[SPEAKER_30]: And meets are where PRs are run.

917
01:18:24,334 --> 01:18:27,936
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's like where you see where you're at, how much you've improved, and what else you can improve on.

918
01:18:28,977 --> 01:18:30,018
[SPEAKER_30]: And meets are really hectic.

919
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:32,359
[SPEAKER_30]: There are some of these things called quad meets.

920
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:36,703
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, you can have four teams, one gym, you guys all been inside the Met pre-gym probably, like 200 kids.

921
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:43,255
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's really hard for our one coach to be able to talk to every single person, see what every single person is doing and how they can improve.

922
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:47,256
[SPEAKER_30]: As well as this, our tracks are like different sizes.

923
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:50,557
[SPEAKER_30]: Normally, like professional tracks are an even distance, but ours vary.

924
01:18:50,637 --> 01:19:00,399
[SPEAKER_30]: So 150 meters, 107, meaning the starting and finish lines are different every week, which is hard for newer athletes because how are you going to run well if you don't even know where you're beginning?

925
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:07,967
[SPEAKER_30]: I personally experienced this last indoor season.

926
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:09,889
[SPEAKER_30]: I missed my event like twice.

927
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:13,092
[SPEAKER_30]: I ended up running two miles and 600 wasn't fun.

928
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:15,233
[SPEAKER_30]: I was like, I only got 20 minutes, two miles.

929
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:15,754
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not good.

930
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:19,877
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, also meets don't go through at the same speed.

931
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:26,663
[SPEAKER_30]: There's different officials, um, like different amounts of teams or squad meets, dual meets, all different things.

932
01:19:26,684 --> 01:19:27,104
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

933
01:19:28,192 --> 01:19:37,179
[SPEAKER_30]: And by having multiple coaches, there'll be more educated voices available for athletes to speak to about their events, how they should pace it, how they can improve their form, and what they can do better next time.

934
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:43,164
[SPEAKER_30]: And personally, although a lot of my improvement is due to Coach Donovan's effort, I'd say a large amount of it is also from the help of my peers.

935
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:49,328
[SPEAKER_30]: My own personal research would be online through YouTube, or Will's older brother who taught me not to run on my heels my freshman year.

936
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:58,191
[SPEAKER_30]: I've noticed that as well that due to our lack of coaches available, many athletes go through the entire season with only a handful of talks with their coach on how to improve.

937
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:03,674
[SPEAKER_30]: I remember my freshman year where the coach of our opposing team taught me how to throw the discus better against his own athletes.

938
01:20:04,195 --> 01:20:06,076
[SPEAKER_30]: I PR'd that year.

939
01:20:06,216 --> 01:20:08,997
[SPEAKER_30]: Our team is a great one and full of talented, caring athletes.

940
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:13,540
[SPEAKER_30]: For the sake of our program now and long after we all graduate, we need the support of our coaches.

941
01:20:27,858 --> 01:20:30,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Tracy Nash.

942
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:33,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I live at 12 Fifth Street here in Medford.

943
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:38,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have two children in the Medford system.

944
01:20:39,085 --> 01:20:46,729
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am the proud father of a daughter who is on the girls team that won the GBL.

945
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:55,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was also part of the record breaking relay team.

946
01:21:02,193 --> 01:21:09,739
[SPEAKER_08]: On a personal note, I've watched my daughter find a place and a home.

947
01:21:10,419 --> 01:21:13,782
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just sports.

948
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:24,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And the legacy of the eight years that this coach provided to this school almost single-handedly

949
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:26,907
[SPEAKER_08]: is miraculous.

950
01:21:27,648 --> 01:21:35,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we are all looking for is just the support to make sure that this legacy continues.

951
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,862
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a great team.

952
01:21:38,207 --> 01:22:03,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And as part of that legacy, looking at the structure of track coaching, the hiring practice, how those coaches are supported, and making sure that the mistakes of the past are recognized, that the accomplishments are given, and a pat on the back for the people who

953
01:22:04,406 --> 01:22:30,446
[SPEAKER_08]: again, went through and sacrificed and making sure that those patterns are not repeated, making sure the hiring practice involves a good swath of people, making sure that the athletes, the coaches that are leaving are involved in that process so that an educated, the best person

954
01:22:31,135 --> 01:22:39,723
[SPEAKER_08]: available is there, not only for the Xs and Os, but to help support all of these young adults.

955
01:22:40,824 --> 01:22:45,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we're here for, is to support these children.

956
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:47,811
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're not children, they're young adults.

957
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:53,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, help with that structure, help with the support.

958
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:58,040
[SPEAKER_08]: No coach should have to sacrifice that much.

959
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:00,964
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be a team effort.

960
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:06,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys have that power within you to help supply that support.

961
01:23:07,234 --> 01:23:07,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do.

962
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:09,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

963
01:23:18,848 --> 01:23:24,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, Vivian Sue, 93rd Street, and I am a newbie track mom.

964
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:31,858
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an oldie track soccer mom and an oldie lacrosse mom, but I am a newbie track mom.

965
01:23:32,559 --> 01:23:43,608
[SPEAKER_17]: And Cooper talked about how track was really supposed to be something to keep him in shape, but just like some other folks here, other athletes have talked about how it's become more than that.

966
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:50,927
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it's also interesting because it's been a really great experience for the entire family.

967
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:52,688
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just for the athletes.

968
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,309
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really the entire family.

969
01:23:54,329 --> 01:24:02,832
[SPEAKER_17]: The track culture is one where everyone cheers and supports and helps others.

970
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:08,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Cooper talked about upperclassmen interacting with younger ones and helping them.

971
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:11,556
[SPEAKER_17]: That does not happen on other sports teams.

972
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:12,656
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's remarkable.

973
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:18,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that type of thing really is due to good leadership, right?

974
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:19,808
[SPEAKER_17]: It's learned from there.

975
01:24:20,828 --> 01:24:28,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are really excited because these athletes are really hardworking, right?

976
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:31,055
[SPEAKER_17]: They work to meet their own goals and beat their own goals.

977
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:35,818
[SPEAKER_17]: They work to meet states and get to nationals.

978
01:24:36,499 --> 01:24:42,363
[SPEAKER_17]: And they bring Medford a lot of pride and a lot of honor, and they deserve to be supported.

979
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:51,051
[SPEAKER_17]: When I attended my first track meet, being a newbie mom, I had no idea what was going on.

980
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:55,753
[SPEAKER_17]: And I arrived and it was like watching Cirque du Soleil, right?

981
01:24:56,213 --> 01:24:58,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Events everywhere simultaneously.

982
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:03,856
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's impossible for one to two coaches to be present

983
01:25:04,477 --> 01:25:07,699
[SPEAKER_17]: at every event that's happening simultaneously.

984
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:18,244
[SPEAKER_17]: And equally so, if you're not present watching your athlete perform, then how are you supposed to properly critique and coach next time?

985
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:20,265
[SPEAKER_17]: You just can't, right?

986
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:24,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Then there's the safety issue of how are you supposed to know where all of your kids are?

987
01:25:25,628 --> 01:25:27,189
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't, right?

988
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:28,990
[SPEAKER_17]: And especially when you're leaving.

989
01:25:29,895 --> 01:25:35,018
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why they have to depend on each other to be like, hey, who went home with whom and do we have everybody?

990
01:25:35,098 --> 01:25:36,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, please, please.

991
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:41,762
[SPEAKER_17]: The great thing is that these kids are so wonderful and they're so well-behaved.

992
01:25:41,802 --> 01:25:46,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you imagine if we had unruly kids, misbehaving kids, kids trying to run, we don't have that.

993
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:52,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And it works again because we have great leadership and there is a great respect for our coach.

994
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:58,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think the kids just gather together, they see what's needed and they do what's needed.

995
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:02,869
[SPEAKER_17]: but they need to be able to focus just on their job of performing.

996
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:08,456
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't run an effective program with faulty equipment.

997
01:26:09,617 --> 01:26:15,503
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm trying to figure out the proper chain of command when things are broken, right?

998
01:26:16,084 --> 01:26:20,269
[SPEAKER_17]: So during this season, we had a broken curtain.

999
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,676
[SPEAKER_17]: for at least three days.

1000
01:26:23,036 --> 01:26:23,796
[SPEAKER_17]: What does that mean?

1001
01:26:23,856 --> 01:26:26,457
[SPEAKER_17]: That means that nobody can run around the track.

1002
01:26:27,037 --> 01:26:29,218
[SPEAKER_17]: That means we can't host our own meets.

1003
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:35,181
[SPEAKER_17]: That means we have to go elsewhere, which means a bus, which means money, right?

1004
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:41,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's so silly that we can't host meets at our own high school because a curtain is broken.

1005
01:26:41,183 --> 01:26:47,246
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have to say, Mr. DeLava responded immediately as soon as he found out.

1006
01:26:48,266 --> 01:26:49,727
[SPEAKER_17]: But why did it take so long?

1007
01:26:50,526 --> 01:26:50,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Right?

1008
01:26:51,226 --> 01:26:57,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do we have faulty high jump and hurdles and blocks?

1009
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,409
[SPEAKER_17]: It should not be.

1010
01:27:00,269 --> 01:27:07,151
[SPEAKER_17]: If our kids want to be the best and to compete with the best, it's got to start with basic equipment.

1011
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:12,932
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually had 55 boys and 34 girls for a total of 89 athletes on one team.

1012
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:24,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Most sports, as you know, have a boys and a girls team.

1013
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:30,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Varsity and JV and assistance, right?

1014
01:27:30,716 --> 01:27:33,118
[SPEAKER_17]: So why should indoor track be any different?

1015
01:27:33,518 --> 01:27:34,499
[SPEAKER_17]: It really shouldn't be.

1016
01:27:35,019 --> 01:27:49,550
[SPEAKER_17]: We really need to have boys, girls, varsity, and a varsity, junior varsity, and assistance for both in order to have enough coaching, in order to have

1017
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,301
[SPEAKER_22]: enough supervision.

1018
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,463
[SPEAKER_22]: We're really proud of our team.

1019
01:27:57,284 --> 01:28:10,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford should be really proud of the honor and of the awards and the breaking of records and going to states, going to Reggie Lewis, going to the track at New Balance.

1020
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:12,371
[SPEAKER_17]: That's newsworthy for Medford.

1021
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:19,595
[SPEAKER_17]: I spoke with our AD and Mr. Maloney,

1022
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:29,295
[SPEAKER_17]: said, because of our numbers, we will have a boys team and a girls team, a boys coach and a girls coach, an assistant for both.

1023
01:28:30,316 --> 01:28:32,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would love to believe that that is going to be true.

1024
01:28:32,977 --> 01:28:36,960
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just gonna put it on record right now that this is what was said.

1025
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:48,207
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also know that we had another coach that was supposed to be with this team and he was not at practice and he did not end up going to any meet because I was at every meet.

1026
01:28:49,096 --> 01:28:52,577
[SPEAKER_17]: And that position was not replaced, even though the need was there.

1027
01:28:53,878 --> 01:29:01,141
[SPEAKER_17]: So my fear is, even though we understand the need, that the positions won't be filled.

1028
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:05,302
[SPEAKER_17]: And the kids deserve to have the best.

1029
01:29:06,823 --> 01:29:10,324
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that we all want what's best for the kids.

1030
01:29:10,644 --> 01:29:14,526
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm really happy to be presenting here, because I know we're all on the same page for that.

1031
01:29:14,986 --> 01:29:16,487
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a matter of making it happen.

1032
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:17,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1033
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,661
[SPEAKER_24]: Miss Sue, yes.

1034
01:29:19,401 --> 01:29:27,286
[SPEAKER_24]: When were you told there'll be, I'm assuming you're talking for the next season, which will be outdoor, one boys coach, one girls coach, and then assistants.

1035
01:29:27,306 --> 01:29:30,548
[SPEAKER_17]: He was actually talking about indoor track for next year.

1036
01:29:31,848 --> 01:29:33,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Indoor track for next year.

1037
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:35,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Indoor track for next year, right.

1038
01:29:35,831 --> 01:29:38,912
[SPEAKER_17]: To be able to support the numbers, right.

1039
01:29:38,972 --> 01:29:43,735
[SPEAKER_17]: And I was also told about new equipment that was going to be ordered this summer for high jump.

1040
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:44,596
[SPEAKER_24]: For indoor.

1041
01:29:44,976 --> 01:29:46,857
[SPEAKER_17]: For indoor, that's the hope.

1042
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,871
[SPEAKER_24]: So is there any difference between outdoor track?

1043
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:53,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have coaching in line?

1044
01:29:55,334 --> 01:29:55,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

1045
01:29:56,094 --> 01:29:56,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Outdoor.

1046
01:29:57,455 --> 01:29:59,376
[SPEAKER_24]: So spring track.

1047
01:29:59,436 --> 01:29:59,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1048
01:29:59,896 --> 01:30:05,079
[SPEAKER_17]: So many of our athletes are going to be competing and participating in spring track.

1049
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:08,420
[SPEAKER_17]: But as far as I know, we do not have a coach yet.

1050
01:30:11,262 --> 01:30:11,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?

1051
01:30:14,103 --> 01:30:14,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1052
01:30:14,623 --> 01:30:15,884
[SPEAKER_22]: We do not have a coach yet.

1053
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:22,925
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have, from what I understand, this is very new information.

1054
01:30:22,945 --> 01:30:26,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's only been about a week, so I don't even believe anything's been posted yet.

1055
01:30:27,509 --> 01:30:40,098
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll try to find, at least to have the opportunity to get more information, but we will definitely work on the posting for, definitely the numbers warrant it.

1056
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:46,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I didn't realize that, but to get the male coaches for the boys team,

1057
01:30:46,863 --> 01:30:49,564
[SPEAKER_14]: girls team try to just bring on.

1058
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:54,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to not just have a coach based on all the testimonials that were shared today.

1059
01:30:54,385 --> 01:31:01,668
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's such a great testament to both Donlan and Donlan senior, Donlan Q squared, I should say.

1060
01:31:03,408 --> 01:31:15,192
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, whoever the individuals are that are going to apply to those positions, I don't know if it's staff or whether it be bringing in totally new people, interviewing them,

1061
01:31:16,039 --> 01:31:21,821
[SPEAKER_14]: and trying to have student voice and parent voice and coaches voice as well.

1062
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:29,844
[SPEAKER_14]: So that we can bring on people who really want to do it because sometimes you can find someone and it's just not a right match.

1063
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:31,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to do it the right way.

1064
01:31:31,857 --> 01:31:35,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate that because I think it definitely has to be the right match.

1065
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,322
[SPEAKER_17]: And it definitely has to be someone who is well-versed.

1066
01:31:39,422 --> 01:31:43,965
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not just supervision, a warm body, somebody who can just be there.

1067
01:31:45,025 --> 01:31:46,626
[SPEAKER_17]: We really want people to coach.

1068
01:31:47,167 --> 01:31:53,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And then when we compete against other schools that have multiple coaches that are coaching, we're at a disadvantage.

1069
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:59,895
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would like someone with a positive track record of success that they're actually winning.

1070
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,302
[SPEAKER_14]: that's gonna be something we need to do definitely.

1071
01:32:05,822 --> 01:32:10,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, and my understanding was that the position was posted two Wednesdays ago.

1072
01:32:11,846 --> 01:32:17,591
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if Dr. Cushing or someone else can look to see when it was posted, I'm not sure.

1073
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:31,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's what Mr. Maloney told me, was that as soon as Mr. Donlan gave his notice, that notice went out to look and search for a new coach, particularly for spring, because the spring season is upon us.

1074
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,582
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Graham, and then Member McLaughlin.

1075
01:32:38,723 --> 01:32:39,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1076
01:32:40,485 --> 01:32:52,114
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to ask that on Monday's agenda, an immediate action plan be presented to us to stabilize the spring season, address equipment issues, what that cost will be.

1077
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:53,696
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank you all for coming.

1078
01:32:53,716 --> 01:33:01,041
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I mentioned to Beth via email that no request has ever come to the committee to fund broken equipment.

1079
01:33:02,202 --> 01:33:02,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're all

1080
01:33:04,483 --> 01:33:15,368
[SPEAKER_18]: obviously concerned about safety, but also overwhelmingly, we have been asking the administration to tell us what they need since I've been on the committee for four years.

1081
01:33:15,448 --> 01:33:20,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is an example of something that is needed that hasn't been brought to our attention.

1082
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,570
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for doing that.

1083
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:22,931
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry that you had to do it.

1084
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:26,093
[SPEAKER_18]: our internal processes should be better than that.

1085
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:29,035
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to work on that.

1086
01:33:29,115 --> 01:33:36,619
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to ask that this be on the agenda next week with a pretty comprehensive plan about what we will do in the near term.

1087
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:43,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think I will probably also fashion a motion in a broad

1088
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:53,576
[SPEAKER_18]: way to talk about athletics, staffing and coaching in general, but I can't like on the fly, think about what those asks are.

1089
01:33:53,596 --> 01:33:56,237
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will submit that formally later.

1090
01:33:56,337 --> 01:33:56,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1091
01:33:57,358 --> 01:33:59,459
[SPEAKER_24]: Second member Graham, member McLaughlin.

1092
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:01,840
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1093
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:04,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all for the presentation tonight.

1094
01:34:04,441 --> 01:34:13,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was excellent and also just such a good example for the community of what civic discourse really looks like in terms of coming forward, telling us what's going on,

1095
01:34:13,686 --> 01:34:21,516
[SPEAKER_19]: respectfully, thoughtfully, you know, sharing stories and real examples of safety concerns and things that we can wrap our minds around and really understand.

1096
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:28,626
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you all so much for doing that, especially the students, Cece, Connor, Will, Jacob.

1097
01:34:29,298 --> 01:34:33,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Cooper, I think, and I'm sure I missed some others, but thank you guys all for coming out tonight.

1098
01:34:33,201 --> 01:34:35,603
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a really great example of leadership.

1099
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:38,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sure your parents were all super proud.

1100
01:34:39,065 --> 01:34:44,129
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just funny seeing people that you've known since kindergarten get up here and be leaders.

1101
01:34:44,209 --> 01:34:48,232
[SPEAKER_19]: So I found that really moving and remarkable and a great example for the community.

1102
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:49,113
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for that.

1103
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:55,738
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, I responded to an email about this specifically around

1104
01:34:56,792 --> 01:35:01,354
[SPEAKER_19]: the school committee's responsibility in terms of what our abilities are.

1105
01:35:01,794 --> 01:35:17,061
[SPEAKER_19]: So ours are to approve the budget, right, that we then send to city council that, you know, then approves or doesn't approve what we put forward to hire and supervise and evaluate the, not supervise, hire and evaluate the superintendent and to set policy.

1106
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:20,563
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't hire personnel.

1107
01:35:20,783 --> 01:35:26,806
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna make sure that people know that, that the school committee cannot be involved in the hiring process, the posting, any of that process.

1108
01:35:27,106 --> 01:35:35,290
[SPEAKER_19]: But what we can do and what is so important here is really understanding what the budget needs especially are, especially if they're not being brought to our attention.

1109
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:45,836
[SPEAKER_19]: If we don't know about this, having students on the ground, parents on the ground that really can see and experience what you guys see and experience to share this with us so that we know when budget season is upon us, which is,

1110
01:35:46,676 --> 01:36:04,234
[SPEAKER_19]: upon us that when department chairs come to us and tell us some of the things that they say they need but may or may not mention some of the things that we've heard about that's our opportunity to say well what about this and how does that affect that so this is a really good opportunity for that and I'm sure in the budget process you'll see some

1111
01:36:05,255 --> 01:36:08,197
[SPEAKER_19]: response to some of what we were hearing here tonight.

1112
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:15,322
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's always posted so people know which departments are coming, if they're coming before us when or what the process will be this year, it depends.

1113
01:36:16,242 --> 01:36:24,448
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, I think that this is a really great example and I would agree with my colleague that this should be on the agenda for next week.

1114
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:32,034
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that we don't need a motion to put something on the agenda and that another agenda will be fashioned, but particularly around the safety of our students.

1115
01:36:32,134 --> 01:36:33,635
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, can I just say that like,

1116
01:36:34,095 --> 01:36:35,456
[SPEAKER_19]: This coach sounds so amazing.

1117
01:36:35,476 --> 01:36:35,997
[SPEAKER_19]: What is it?

1118
01:36:36,017 --> 01:36:43,243
[SPEAKER_19]: 89 kids and they got to they won the championship and broke a record like and he was one for records and one coach.

1119
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:44,624
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, he's here.

1120
01:36:44,964 --> 01:36:45,885
[SPEAKER_24]: He's here.

1121
01:36:46,005 --> 01:36:46,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Where?

1122
01:36:46,665 --> 01:36:51,429
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm going to put that's amazing.

1123
01:36:51,449 --> 01:36:55,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I said we're going to try to roll back in.

1124
01:36:55,592 --> 01:36:56,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1125
01:36:56,273 --> 01:36:57,154
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1126
01:36:58,567 --> 01:36:58,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1127
01:36:59,048 --> 01:37:06,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry to hear that someone that's done such a remarkable job is leaving, but I hope you know how valued you are, especially hearing the students' testimony tonight.

1128
01:37:07,617 --> 01:37:12,402
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you again, and we look forward to hearing about all the future wins.

1129
01:37:12,882 --> 01:37:13,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1130
01:37:14,264 --> 01:37:16,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I invite one more parent to speak?

1131
01:37:16,887 --> 01:37:17,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1132
01:37:25,646 --> 01:37:26,627
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Michael Kelly.

1133
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:27,889
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 32 Chardon Road.

1134
01:37:27,929 --> 01:37:28,529
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm Will's dad.

1135
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:34,596
[SPEAKER_23]: And I had a longer list of things to say, but I think it's all been said.

1136
01:37:34,636 --> 01:37:35,538
[SPEAKER_23]: These kids are amazing.

1137
01:37:37,179 --> 01:37:39,342
[SPEAKER_23]: They've almost made me cry over there.

1138
01:37:40,643 --> 01:37:44,908
[SPEAKER_23]: What I can offer that I haven't heard yet is just a little bit about how

1139
01:37:46,523 --> 01:37:48,184
[SPEAKER_23]: stipends seem to work.

1140
01:37:48,264 --> 01:37:58,051
[SPEAKER_23]: I compared all the GBL coaching stipends across the league and some other towns as well and we pay our assistant coaches at the rock bottom.

1141
01:37:58,851 --> 01:38:05,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Our athletic director said the coaches haven't had a raise since 2010 and I know that that's a contractual thing and that's not

1142
01:38:05,936 --> 01:38:12,820
[SPEAKER_23]: part of this conversation, but it may be relevant in terms of how difficult it might be to hire staff.

1143
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,801
[SPEAKER_23]: But I also think we can be perhaps more creative.

1144
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:16,482
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if we're not

1145
01:38:20,424 --> 01:38:29,129
[SPEAKER_23]: paying a wage that's competitive, at least we can hire enough people so that the workload is spread appropriately and that people can do their job without being overwhelmed.

1146
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,852
[SPEAKER_23]: And perhaps there might be other ways to allocate some resources.

1147
01:38:33,932 --> 01:38:36,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe there's a partnership we could have with Tufts.

1148
01:38:37,254 --> 01:38:49,001
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we could use some of the stipend money to hire alumni who are home for college breaks and spring breaks to do like a coaching clinic on the high jump for an hour on a weekend, just as a way to like,

1149
01:38:50,622 --> 01:38:53,245
[SPEAKER_23]: get the needs met, even if it's not on a day-to-day basis.

1150
01:38:54,165 --> 01:39:00,151
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe there's some local running clubs we could partner with or even somebody like Dave McGilvery, a local Medford runner.

1151
01:39:01,653 --> 01:39:08,580
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would rather see the money sort of spent on our team and being able to host meets.

1152
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:10,141
[SPEAKER_23]: Last year we couldn't host a meet because

1153
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:13,628
[SPEAKER_23]: No, we hosted meets, but our discus cage was broken.

1154
01:39:14,228 --> 01:39:19,151
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you can't host the event that you're supposed to host, you forfeit all points to the other team.

1155
01:39:19,731 --> 01:39:29,735
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was just another sort of series where if we were paying for the equipment, we wouldn't be paying for the buses and we would be competing on our home turf.

1156
01:39:30,156 --> 01:39:37,479
[SPEAKER_23]: And students who are coming to compete against us wouldn't ride a bus all the way to find out that they can't throw the discus because we don't have a discus cage.

1157
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:44,551
[SPEAKER_23]: So the last thing I'll say is, if I can separate my pages.

1158
01:39:47,218 --> 01:39:58,748
[SPEAKER_23]: Our athletes outlined a number of ways in which good coaching is beneficial and is necessary, from safety supervision to event-specific guidance of how, when, and where to show up for a race at the Reggie Lewis Center in Boston.

1159
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:09,556
[SPEAKER_23]: They've shown you how special their team is and can be, and the parents have provided a list of shortcomings and needs and creative ways to think about reallocating resources and scaffolding for the kids.

1160
01:40:10,257 --> 01:40:13,219
[SPEAKER_23]: So please, do what you can to advocate for the future of Medford Track.

1161
01:40:13,259 --> 01:40:14,180
[SPEAKER_23]: The kids are really worth it.

1162
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:14,901
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1163
01:40:15,201 --> 01:40:16,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike, could you stand up there?

1164
01:40:21,787 --> 01:40:22,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1165
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:28,652
[SPEAKER_13]: If you would not mind sending your analysis, you can find our email addresses on the website.

1166
01:40:29,793 --> 01:40:39,600
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did find the date when the postings, where we posted for three different positions for track nine days ago, two assistant coaches and one co-ed head coach.

1167
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:43,983
[SPEAKER_13]: So somebody nine days ago got the message.

1168
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:46,485
[SPEAKER_23]: And is that internal or is that external?

1169
01:40:46,605 --> 01:40:47,546
[SPEAKER_23]: That's external, yeah.

1170
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:57,633
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are also a whole host of other athletic positions that are posted, some of which date back to November, January,

1171
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:17,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So October, so I think, I mean, I don't know the specifics of coaching and the availability of potential hires, which is sort of a key element of this, but if we are paying rock bottom, does it really matter how many people are out there?

1172
01:41:17,659 --> 01:41:24,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't know, I mean, does anybody go looking for a job looking for the lowest possible pay?

1173
01:41:24,602 --> 01:41:25,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a thing?

1174
01:41:25,243 --> 01:41:26,203
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean,

1175
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:37,685
[SPEAKER_13]: We could get into a long analysis and maybe we will have something like that on the agenda next week, but this has been the Medford way.

1176
01:41:38,145 --> 01:41:39,286
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to raise taxes.

1177
01:41:39,726 --> 01:41:40,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And guess what?

1178
01:41:40,406 --> 01:41:41,847
[SPEAKER_13]: The money doesn't come from thin air.

1179
01:41:42,448 --> 01:41:46,290
[SPEAKER_13]: So we haven't had a raise since 2010.

1180
01:41:47,491 --> 01:41:50,652
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just offensive that that's even a thing.

1181
01:41:51,953 --> 01:41:55,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm really sorry that you all have to

1182
01:41:56,656 --> 01:41:58,918
[SPEAKER_13]: received the very short end of the stick on this.

1183
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:21,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's shocking that Coach Donlon, I mean, I don't know anything about, I only know Coach Donlon from my first experience meeting him at the Day on the Hill that the School Committee Association does where we go meet the legislators and his class, he brought a couple of classes over a couple of years and it was clear his students were

1184
01:42:23,348 --> 01:42:26,589
[SPEAKER_13]: enjoyed him as a teacher and it was an absolutely wonderful time.

1185
01:42:27,129 --> 01:42:37,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't even know he did coaching at the time, but yeah, if we're not gonna pay anybody, we need to give up the idea that we're gonna actually provide something.

1186
01:42:38,014 --> 01:42:41,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, everybody thinks taxes aren't the answer.

1187
01:42:41,635 --> 01:42:42,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Then what's the answer?

1188
01:42:42,795 --> 01:42:47,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Because rock bottom and no raise since 2010.

1189
01:42:47,137 --> 01:42:51,879
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just, if I was allowed to swear, I'd be swearing right now.

1190
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:53,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Ridiculous.

1191
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

1192
01:42:55,581 --> 01:42:55,881
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1193
01:43:01,482 --> 01:43:01,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham.

1194
01:43:03,183 --> 01:43:07,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Just one more thing I was hoping you can add to your presentation next week.

1195
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:21,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Superintendent, could you give us a rundown of all the stipends paid to track coaches over the last three years by season so that we have an understanding of like, what I don't have an understanding of is this,

1196
01:43:22,634 --> 01:43:23,635
[SPEAKER_18]: an issue this year?

1197
01:43:24,135 --> 01:43:25,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Has it always been the same issue?

1198
01:43:25,516 --> 01:43:26,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Were there never assistant coaches?

1199
01:43:26,897 --> 01:43:32,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Were there assistant coaches at some point in time that stopped being assistant coaches?

1200
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:38,765
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's the history of payment of stipends for these positions, I think is my question.

1201
01:43:38,805 --> 01:43:40,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, three years.

1202
01:43:40,926 --> 01:43:42,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thanks.

1203
01:43:42,107 --> 01:43:42,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

1204
01:43:43,168 --> 01:43:50,032
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just wondering if that is something that the superintendent is doing or something that the director of athletics would be doing.

1205
01:43:50,072 --> 01:43:50,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So how I would

1206
01:43:51,832 --> 01:43:57,035
[SPEAKER_19]: respectfully ask that maybe the director of athletics could give us that information and share information with us.

1207
01:43:57,095 --> 01:44:04,318
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would ask the superintendent's thoughts on that in terms of a reporter coming to talk with us.

1208
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, just listening to everything, I'm actually very curious myself.

1209
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:18,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to wish the track team success the day they were going to Reggie Lewis.

1210
01:44:19,529 --> 01:44:21,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was great energy.

1211
01:44:21,511 --> 01:44:24,673
[SPEAKER_14]: They have this great song that they play.

1212
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:27,155
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like their fight song, their winning song.

1213
01:44:27,395 --> 01:44:30,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a great, great time.

1214
01:44:30,717 --> 01:44:35,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I will definitely take this on as a project.

1215
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,703
[SPEAKER_22]: I can definitely work in collaboration with the athletic department, but we should

1216
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:52,568
[SPEAKER_14]: financial side of the house, we should have a track, a record of the stipends going back on the previous three years and how many coaches.

1217
01:44:52,588 --> 01:45:07,452
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe there's always been two or three from my recollection as a track runner and one who follows it a bit, but we did have one coach, I believe on leave this past winter, right?

1218
01:45:08,513 --> 01:45:12,474
[SPEAKER_24]: So all the data points, motion is on the floor.

1219
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:25,276
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Donlon, I'm not going to put you on the spot to come up to the podium, but I do know how wonderful of a person you are and a coach, and it goes to show with 89 students that you've mentored for years.

1220
01:45:25,336 --> 01:45:37,561
[SPEAKER_24]: So I hope that you tune in on next Monday is our next meeting and that we can do right by the program and hopefully get you back to support these kids and coach the way you've coached for 10 years.

1221
01:45:44,653 --> 01:45:48,874
[SPEAKER_24]: So motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1222
01:45:48,934 --> 01:45:49,834
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1223
01:45:49,854 --> 01:45:50,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1224
01:45:50,734 --> 01:45:51,575
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1225
01:45:52,615 --> 01:45:58,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion is passed 7-0 to have this on the agenda for next Monday and hopefully solve the problem and move forward.

1226
01:45:59,317 --> 01:45:59,637
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1227
01:46:00,137 --> 01:46:00,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for joining us.

1228
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:03,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1229
01:46:03,918 --> 01:46:07,278
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to revert by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1230
01:46:07,318 --> 01:46:08,179
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1231
01:46:08,379 --> 01:46:08,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1232
01:46:08,799 --> 01:46:09,679
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1233
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to revert is approved.

1234
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,580
[SPEAKER_24]: Recommendation to approve proposed

1235
01:46:13,996 --> 01:46:17,459
[SPEAKER_24]: school year 2023-2024 calendar, Dr. Peter Cushing.

1236
01:46:24,804 --> 01:46:27,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1237
01:46:27,326 --> 01:46:41,316
[SPEAKER_11]: As you look at the updated calendar, I do need to make one note that I believe the Eid listed in April, that that is actually the evening

1238
01:46:42,435 --> 01:46:45,136
[SPEAKER_11]: the ninth and that the blue date should be on the 10th.

1239
01:46:45,256 --> 01:46:51,117
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll make that fix once I confirm with a member of the Islamic community.

1240
01:46:51,937 --> 01:46:53,878
[SPEAKER_11]: But I believe it starts at sundown on the ninth.

1241
01:46:54,918 --> 01:46:58,999
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's the only edit that I see right now in this draft calendar.

1242
01:46:59,099 --> 01:47:05,580
[SPEAKER_11]: But if anybody has any other suggestions, additions, or anything else along those lines, I'm here to take them.

1243
01:47:08,801 --> 01:47:09,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

1244
01:47:10,186 --> 01:47:14,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank the assistant superintendent for his efforts.

1245
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:22,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the calendar and everybody's, most people's mind is just like, it's a calendar, how hard is it?

1246
01:47:22,317 --> 01:47:26,101
[SPEAKER_13]: But a lot of these holidays change every single year and

1247
01:47:27,922 --> 01:47:36,191
[SPEAKER_13]: unless you happen to be somebody who's observant of them, or even if you are, there is actual effort involved to figure out when those holidays are.

1248
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:41,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also just can't miss an opportunity to say how proud I am of this calendar.

1249
01:47:42,278 --> 01:47:46,782
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not believe there are any other communities that are recognizing and

1250
01:47:47,623 --> 01:47:57,707
[SPEAKER_13]: properly treating our students and staff with the respect that we have treated Christian holidays since, you know, since we've been a school system.

1251
01:47:59,027 --> 01:48:08,730
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we are recognizing that for many Chinese families, there is one holiday a year, and it will now be treated appropriately in our calendar.

1252
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:12,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And for many of our Muslim

1253
01:48:13,402 --> 01:48:19,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Members of our community, you know, I forget which one of these Eids, but one of them is as big a deal as Christmas.

1254
01:48:20,109 --> 01:48:27,837
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've always just expected them to come to school and come to work and figure it out in the evening.

1255
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:32,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, can you imagine if we all just suddenly decided Christmas was a school day?

1256
01:48:32,182 --> 01:48:34,825
[SPEAKER_13]: People would burn our houses down.

1257
01:48:36,505 --> 01:48:40,107
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't even celebrate Christmas other than for toys and stuff.

1258
01:48:40,307 --> 01:48:47,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm really, really proud of this calendar and that we're providing the respect to all of the members of our community.

1259
01:48:48,211 --> 01:48:52,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to thank this committee and the administration.

1260
01:48:55,635 --> 01:48:55,956
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1261
01:48:56,436 --> 01:48:58,157
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion for approval of the 2023-2024 school year?

1262
01:48:58,177 --> 01:49:00,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve the 2023-2024 school year calendar.

1263
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:07,271
[SPEAKER_24]: by Member Graham, seconded by Member Hays.

1264
01:49:08,511 --> 01:49:09,311
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1265
01:49:09,651 --> 01:49:09,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1266
01:49:10,012 --> 01:49:10,812
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1267
01:49:11,232 --> 01:49:13,993
[SPEAKER_24]: That's five in favor, two absent.

1268
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:15,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion is approved.

1269
01:49:16,333 --> 01:49:17,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Next up we have update- Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1270
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:18,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1271
01:49:19,794 --> 01:49:25,156
[SPEAKER_24]: We have update on the 10-point action plan at Medford High School, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent.

1272
01:49:33,965 --> 01:49:47,599
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can definitely say, after listening to our wonderful student leaders, our CCSR students and our student athletes who were speaking today, truly, my bucket is full.

1273
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:55,107
[SPEAKER_14]: When we can just see the right things happening, students being strong student leaders

1274
01:49:56,789 --> 01:50:10,665
[SPEAKER_14]: This 10 point action plan was implemented as a result of what transpired at the high school in December, and I'm here to give you an update.

1275
01:50:13,328 --> 01:50:16,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And Dr. Cushing, I'm not sure I shared one of the documents with you, Dr. Cushing.

1276
01:50:17,492 --> 01:50:20,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping you can screen share that.

1277
01:50:21,735 --> 01:50:33,926
[SPEAKER_14]: On a weekly basis, I've had it linked to my Friday communications, the 10 point action plan.

1278
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:45,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm here today to just inform the committee of all the things that have been happening, what's working, and where are the areas that we do need to see additional growth.

1279
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you need me to reshare it?

1280
01:50:56,251 --> 01:50:56,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, thank you.

1281
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:02,452
[SPEAKER_22]: So the first area on the 10-point action plan

1282
01:51:13,766 --> 01:51:19,372
[SPEAKER_14]: The first area on the 10-point action plan is our school resource officer.

1283
01:51:19,392 --> 01:51:26,240
[SPEAKER_22]: Our school resource officer, thank you.

1284
01:51:28,604 --> 01:51:37,129
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am pleased to report that we now have two full time school visas officers working at the high school.

1285
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:46,135
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Officer Conway and Officer Patia both working at the high school and Chief Buckley.

1286
01:51:46,995 --> 01:52:07,979
[SPEAKER_14]: has two other additional SRO officers that have also been trained to be school resource officers, and they will eventually be cycled through between the middle school and the high school so that they are exposed to more students, and students are also exposed to them.

1287
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:13,900
[SPEAKER_14]: So Officer Poitier is a female school resource officer, and Officer Conway is a male.

1288
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:22,406
[SPEAKER_14]: and Chief Buckley shared that one of the other school resource officers that was trained is an officer of color.

1289
01:52:22,907 --> 01:52:31,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And so really trying to be intentional and inclusive of the school resource officers that will be supporting all of our students.

1290
01:52:31,734 --> 01:52:36,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And so for that immediate action and support, very, very grateful.

1291
01:52:37,478 --> 01:52:39,299
[SPEAKER_14]: to the partnership with Chief Buckley.

1292
01:52:40,839 --> 01:52:48,360
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was point number one, and Officer Poitier came on in January.

1293
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:54,542
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was the first bullet.

1294
01:52:55,122 --> 01:53:05,724
[SPEAKER_14]: For bullet number two, what we ended up doing at the high school, having clear and consistent protocols for bathroom occupancy,

1295
01:53:07,552 --> 01:53:12,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we have blue and red language or tags.

1296
01:53:13,154 --> 01:53:23,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I had shown them back in January, but when students are going to use the restroom in their inner classroom, they will be given a blue tag.

1297
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:30,321
[SPEAKER_14]: We also have the eHall pass system, which is the online system as well.

1298
01:53:31,241 --> 01:53:35,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is, that system is working, it's being used.

1299
01:53:36,603 --> 01:53:51,090
[SPEAKER_14]: The red house is for students that will be going to a different part of the building, it could be the nurses office, it could be to go see guidance or maybe going down to the library for something but students when they're traveling in the hallway.

1300
01:53:51,730 --> 01:54:05,704
[SPEAKER_14]: They are carrying either a red or a blue pass, so it's easily identifiable and you can speak with them and they will show you, I have this pass, this is where I'm going and I'm returning.

1301
01:54:05,764 --> 01:54:08,107
[SPEAKER_14]: So that has, that was implemented.

1302
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:19,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I met January and then as of February 3rd, everyone is aware of the new process.

1303
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:24,934
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, I feel it's now, it's just, it's part of the routine.

1304
01:54:24,994 --> 01:54:27,477
[SPEAKER_14]: It's part of what happens at Medford High School.

1305
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:29,799
[SPEAKER_14]: So bullet number three,

1306
01:54:33,543 --> 01:54:40,246
[SPEAKER_14]: clear and consistent protocols for students, for student identification, check-in and hallway presence.

1307
01:54:40,826 --> 01:54:51,550
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the shifts that did take place in January, in the past, students used to report to the three different floors, the house offices.

1308
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:56,452
[SPEAKER_14]: And so now when students are checking in, they report at the main office.

1309
01:54:57,432 --> 01:55:02,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Cushing, can you, I'm using your screen share, thank you.

1310
01:55:04,673 --> 01:55:06,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I was on number three, thank you.

1311
01:55:08,034 --> 01:55:20,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So for student identification, check-in, and holiday presence, again, the tags that are being used, check-in is taking place in the main office, and student identification is handed out.

1312
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:32,765
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to give you the key highlights of what has transpired, and then I will also talk about the areas that we've identified where we need to continue to do some additional work.

1313
01:55:34,506 --> 01:55:41,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Bullet number four point number four was the bullying prevention reporting and investigation.

1314
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:44,604
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, in January.

1315
01:55:46,255 --> 01:55:49,137
[SPEAKER_14]: We have assemblies for our students.

1316
01:55:50,838 --> 01:56:02,146
[SPEAKER_14]: The students know that they are expected to report something to an adult or to the assistant principal or to a guidance Councilor or an adjustment Councilor.

1317
01:56:03,066 --> 01:56:04,928
[SPEAKER_14]: There's paperwork that can be used.

1318
01:56:05,108 --> 01:56:09,891
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have been fully informed about that and can use those documents.

1319
01:56:12,737 --> 01:56:15,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Number five, the anonymous reporting system.

1320
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:28,625
[SPEAKER_14]: By the end of January, we had all students in grade six through 12 that have been trained in the anonymous reporting system and staff are also aware of that.

1321
01:56:29,405 --> 01:56:42,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And next week at the March 6 meeting, Stacey Shulman will be presenting specific data on what has happened with that, but it is up and running.

1322
01:56:42,769 --> 01:56:44,049
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been used.

1323
01:56:45,769 --> 01:56:46,270
[SPEAKER_14]: And so...

1324
01:56:48,130 --> 01:57:07,378
[SPEAKER_14]: she will be able to give some specifics to what we've seen thus far, but this is now again an opportunity for students to report anonymously and not have to worry about, you know, someone saying that, you know, they're snitching or they're telling on them and for fear

1325
01:57:08,759 --> 01:57:13,743
[SPEAKER_14]: of any kind of problems that could arise.

1326
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:21,070
[SPEAKER_14]: So the anonymous reporting system, I'm very excited about that, and that's through our partnership with Sandy Hook Promise.

1327
01:57:22,632 --> 01:57:24,914
[SPEAKER_14]: On point number six, the student handbook.

1328
01:57:26,776 --> 01:57:31,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, the real student and faculty staff meetings,

1329
01:57:32,661 --> 01:57:37,523
[SPEAKER_14]: student sessions, listening sessions, advisory meetings.

1330
01:57:38,344 --> 01:57:49,488
[SPEAKER_14]: The students are aware of what the handbook says, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable, and we're continuing to work through that with them.

1331
01:57:50,789 --> 01:57:58,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Point number seven, reminding families that counseling support is available.

1332
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:18,354
[SPEAKER_14]: We know that social, emotional well-being and health is critically important and that students respond, whether it's impulse control or whatever challenges they may be facing.

1333
01:58:19,654 --> 01:58:26,276
[SPEAKER_14]: We can definitely refer to families and students

1334
01:58:28,787 --> 01:58:32,189
[SPEAKER_14]: to all of the counseling supports that are available.

1335
01:58:33,129 --> 01:58:46,579
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you go to the website, there is a listing of additional outside counseling if families were to choose not to have their student

1336
01:58:47,259 --> 01:59:00,161
[SPEAKER_14]: participate in counseling, whether it's with a school psychologist, an adjustment Councilor, a guidance Councilor, if they choose to have outside counseling, but that is available to all of our families.

1337
01:59:03,715 --> 01:59:12,617
[SPEAKER_14]: We have been working collaboratively with Mr. Michael Welch, who is a retired superintendent and former high school principal.

1338
01:59:12,637 --> 01:59:21,120
[SPEAKER_14]: He has been working at the high school level and that has been going very well, providing consult, meeting with staff.

1339
01:59:23,007 --> 01:59:27,489
[SPEAKER_14]: meeting with the administrative team, providing guidance and support.

1340
01:59:27,949 --> 01:59:38,394
[SPEAKER_14]: So that has been a very positive experience having Mr. Walsh as a consultant and giving us feedback on the high school.

1341
01:59:39,735 --> 01:59:46,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Number nine, administering a confidential school culture and climate survey.

1342
01:59:47,438 --> 01:59:48,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Creshen,

1343
01:59:50,089 --> 01:59:51,810
[SPEAKER_11]: So working with Ms.

1344
01:59:51,830 --> 01:59:56,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, who also was instrumental in helping with the calendar, I do want to make sure everybody does know that.

1345
01:59:57,332 --> 02:00:01,393
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be partnering with the Board of Health.

1346
02:00:01,633 --> 02:00:04,594
[SPEAKER_11]: They ran a survey at the McGlynn several years ago.

1347
02:00:05,115 --> 02:00:14,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we'll probably just need a lead time of another 10 days to two weeks based on our conversation the other day with Penny Finioli.

1348
02:00:14,938 --> 02:00:16,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize if I mispronounce her last name.

1349
02:00:17,659 --> 02:00:26,084
[SPEAKER_11]: but just so that you guys have a, that the committee has an up-to-date on the spot update of the survey.

1350
02:00:26,304 --> 02:00:34,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll look at that federal education department survey, see if there's anything to pare down.

1351
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:39,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe right now it's 79 questions, but they're all very good questions.

1352
02:00:39,532 --> 02:00:40,693
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just long.

1353
02:00:40,933 --> 02:00:44,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll take a look and go through that with her.

1354
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:45,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1355
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:58,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you want to finish your read through or did you want to take questions?

1356
02:00:58,101 --> 02:01:01,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, let me, member McLaughlin, is that okay?

1357
02:01:01,082 --> 02:01:08,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm on, and Dr. Cushing, you can stay there because I just have to go to number 10 and then we can take all the questions at once.

1358
02:01:11,505 --> 02:01:27,021
[SPEAKER_14]: So point number 10, we have posted for the communications director position that was posted on, I believe, the February 17 right before February break.

1359
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:30,845
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're in the process now of gathering

1360
02:01:31,425 --> 02:01:42,376
[SPEAKER_14]: resumes and looking at candidates who would be interested in coming to join the STEM team and supporting the work that we're going to do.

1361
02:01:43,457 --> 02:01:46,380
[SPEAKER_14]: But that is where we are.

1362
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:54,828
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to at least give those first 10 points and then I wanted to just make a

1363
02:01:58,809 --> 02:02:03,494
[SPEAKER_14]: A few, a few points about what were key positives and then what were the key areas.

1364
02:02:04,475 --> 02:02:09,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, one of the great positives is now having to assign those at the high school.

1365
02:02:14,085 --> 02:02:23,927
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, I was very happy to have and it's just wonderful having two additional support people in the school to help us.

1366
02:02:25,228 --> 02:02:37,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Check-in process has really expedited, you know, students realize that they have to report to the main office and so we're seeing a significant

1367
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:44,716
[SPEAKER_14]: decrease in the amount of late arrivals, and students are getting to classes much quicker.

1368
02:02:44,736 --> 02:02:53,682
[SPEAKER_14]: The anonymous reporting system is in place, it has been used a few times, and again next week, Ms.

1369
02:02:53,722 --> 02:02:55,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Sherman will talk about that.

1370
02:02:57,098 --> 02:03:05,645
[SPEAKER_14]: At the high school level, I believe there was one report, and at the middle school level, I'm not sure if it was one or two reports, but a few came in, I think, at that level.

1371
02:03:06,166 --> 02:03:12,011
[SPEAKER_14]: But just allowing us to have that opportunity to respond very quickly and address it anonymously.

1372
02:03:13,411 --> 02:03:20,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And the hall pass system has really, the blue and red tags, that has really, really worked very well.

1373
02:03:21,473 --> 02:03:37,237
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of the challenges that we found when we implemented the hall passes, we also implemented bathroom monitors and hall monitors, and we asked staff to support us

1374
02:03:39,614 --> 02:03:49,869
[SPEAKER_14]: at the high school in addition to the building that we have so we have hired additional building managers we're still trying to hire at least one more.

1375
02:03:54,739 --> 02:04:06,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes because we have staff that are helping with closures, if we have people who are absent, some staff have consistently asked to be part of the rotational schedule.

1376
02:04:07,027 --> 02:04:15,513
[SPEAKER_14]: And some, because it is, although they're being compensated, they need to volunteer to say they want to take on that additional task.

1377
02:04:15,993 --> 02:04:20,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So sometimes we do not have some coverage issues.

1378
02:04:21,357 --> 02:04:23,939
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is something that we're watching.

1379
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:38,723
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been an ask of students and we're trying to see at this point in time we have two students at a time using the bathrooms, no more than two.

1380
02:04:38,743 --> 02:04:46,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So the students have been asking and we are considering possibly increasing that number

1381
02:04:46,525 --> 02:05:02,396
[SPEAKER_14]: to three students being allowed to go into the restrooms at one point in time, but it's something that we are just monitoring because we don't want to go and rip the band-aid and end up with some of the challenges that we faced before.

1382
02:05:02,977 --> 02:05:13,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is something that we're looking at because it's been working fairly well and the students are respecting the total number of people in the bathrooms at a time.

1383
02:05:15,051 --> 02:05:38,523
[SPEAKER_14]: The check-in process sometimes, although check-in is taking place in the main office, because it's now taking place in the main office as opposed to the house offices, sometimes there was a slight delay for the assistant principals that are in each of the houses to be able to quickly check in.

1384
02:05:40,284 --> 02:05:42,285
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was a slight delay

1385
02:05:43,385 --> 02:05:46,406
[SPEAKER_14]: because it's no longer happening in the respective offices.

1386
02:05:46,426 --> 02:05:51,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to work on that piece, which is a glitch.

1387
02:05:52,189 --> 02:06:02,274
[SPEAKER_14]: And then this is the final piece that I wanted to say, which is a challenge, but it's something new that didn't happen at Medford.

1388
02:06:02,854 --> 02:06:05,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So we did pass out the student IDs.

1389
02:06:06,536 --> 02:06:10,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would probably have to say when I'm in the hallways,

1390
02:06:12,447 --> 02:06:21,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I would probably say, I don't even think it's 50% of active involvement.

1391
02:06:21,993 --> 02:06:26,436
[SPEAKER_14]: The students who wear their IDs, I will say to them, great job.

1392
02:06:26,456 --> 02:06:39,484
[SPEAKER_14]: If I see them wearing it, but a lot of the students will say, I don't have my ID, I left it at home, it's in my binder, it's in my locker, but they respond respectfully.

1393
02:06:39,844 --> 02:06:41,025
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that it's a new,

1394
02:06:43,203 --> 02:06:47,007
[SPEAKER_14]: was a new protocol that we put in place.

1395
02:06:48,888 --> 02:07:01,140
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is the one area that I can clearly say, and I know we have our student reps here, that the students are not consistently wearing their ID all day.

1396
02:07:01,961 --> 02:07:03,462
[SPEAKER_14]: But I can say that,

1397
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,521
[SPEAKER_14]: In behaviors, the students are respectful.

1398
02:07:10,602 --> 02:07:14,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I see students in the hallway, and they're saying, where are you going?

1399
02:07:14,604 --> 02:07:16,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you on your way to a class?

1400
02:07:16,765 --> 02:07:24,608
[SPEAKER_14]: They respond, when I speak with them, they do respond respectfully, and then they will make sure that they're moving in the right direction.

1401
02:07:25,048 --> 02:07:34,733
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanna be fully transparent, because I know that that was something where people were asking specifically, what's going to happen if someone doesn't wear an ID?

1402
02:07:35,833 --> 02:07:44,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And we wanted the students to wear the ID, but we also wanted to see a change in behaviors.

1403
02:07:44,959 --> 02:07:52,804
[SPEAKER_14]: And so seeing the significant change in behaviors, that was most important to me.

1404
02:07:54,185 --> 02:08:07,722
[SPEAKER_14]: And so although we're not having full participation with the IDs, at this point in time, the students are, I feel, comporting themselves in a respectful manner.

1405
02:08:11,557 --> 02:08:16,843
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel such a significant difference from talking with students what they said to me themselves.

1406
02:08:17,444 --> 02:08:29,418
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it is something that, you know, we're going to continue to work with, but if, if you're walking in the halls and member Graham member Graham member McLaughlin was with me right before break.

1407
02:08:32,697 --> 02:08:40,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Students were going to class, they were doing what they needed, they were being students, but not everyone had their ID on.

1408
02:08:40,323 --> 02:08:54,273
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to make that known to the committee that that is the one area where I feel if they're in school, they're doing their work, they're reporting to class,

1409
02:08:57,934 --> 02:09:00,616
[SPEAKER_14]: that's something that we're aware of.

1410
02:09:01,196 --> 02:09:05,879
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was such a significant shift to take place in the middle of the year.

1411
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,961
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to look at other options.

1412
02:09:09,642 --> 02:09:23,011
[SPEAKER_14]: There's gonna be a lot of things that we're doing with like food service and trying to think about other things where if you need your ID and you can have it, like your ID is used for other things, then everyone would need to have it on them.

1413
02:09:24,432 --> 02:09:26,093
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have not ruled that out.

1414
02:09:28,334 --> 02:09:34,419
[SPEAKER_14]: But at this point in time, that's the one area that we're not seeing consistent implementation.

1415
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:35,840
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1416
02:09:38,162 --> 02:09:52,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Noah?

1417
02:09:52,652 --> 02:09:53,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Graham wants to share.

1418
02:09:55,470 --> 02:09:57,552
[SPEAKER_26]: So there are just a couple things that I wanted to talk about.

1419
02:09:57,572 --> 02:09:57,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Sit down.

1420
02:09:57,972 --> 02:09:58,212
[SPEAKER_26]: Sit down.

1421
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Relax.

1422
02:10:00,534 --> 02:10:01,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Speak in.

1423
02:10:01,415 --> 02:10:01,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Let us hear it.

1424
02:10:02,476 --> 02:10:04,497
[SPEAKER_26]: So there are just a couple things that I wanted to bring up.

1425
02:10:04,557 --> 02:10:06,339
[SPEAKER_26]: The first one being the bathrooms.

1426
02:10:06,939 --> 02:10:16,107
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that the plan that was put in place is a great idea in theory, but in practice, we see that it quickly falls apart due to the lack of consistency.

1427
02:10:17,828 --> 02:10:23,491
[SPEAKER_26]: I find that regularly when I want to use the bathroom, I'll find myself, it feels like a scavenger hunt almost.

1428
02:10:24,052 --> 02:10:39,761
[SPEAKER_26]: There are five bathrooms that are available, excluding the three close to the cafeterias that are shut down right now, but a lot of times there's only like one or two open and then you'll get to the one that's open and there's a long line because it's the only bathroom that's open in the school.

1429
02:10:41,221 --> 02:10:49,186
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think we need to look at how we're incentivizing our staff to want to fill the role of bathroom monitors, like what we're offering.

1430
02:10:50,486 --> 02:10:52,067
[SPEAKER_26]: And also the IDs.

1431
02:10:52,087 --> 02:10:56,049
[SPEAKER_26]: I had never received an ID because I missed picture day.

1432
02:10:56,550 --> 02:10:59,551
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know that there are quite a few students who missed picture day as well.

1433
02:11:01,232 --> 02:11:11,034
[SPEAKER_26]: But over the loudspeaker in the morning for maybe three weeks, they said, oh, students who didn't receive an ID will be receiving a temporary ID next week.

1434
02:11:11,414 --> 02:11:16,196
[SPEAKER_26]: And then next week would come, and they would say, oh, students will be receiving their temporary IDs next week.

1435
02:11:16,636 --> 02:11:18,736
[SPEAKER_26]: And then next week would come, and then they would say it again.

1436
02:11:19,276 --> 02:11:25,018
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think a couple of weeks ago, they just kind of stopped saying it, and nobody ever got their IDs.

1437
02:11:25,518 --> 02:11:26,638
[SPEAKER_26]: So yeah.

1438
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:29,779
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1439
02:11:33,116 --> 02:11:35,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Edwards, do you want to respond to that, or do you want Member McLaughlin?

1440
02:11:39,641 --> 02:11:48,067
[SPEAKER_14]: At last count, when I had the number of IDs, that students who never took school class pictures, it was 97 students.

1441
02:11:48,127 --> 02:11:50,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So over 1,100 students had ID pictures.

1442
02:11:54,751 --> 02:11:56,353
[SPEAKER_14]: And we ordered backup.

1443
02:11:56,654 --> 02:12:00,378
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had IDs for like over 1100 students.

1444
02:12:01,299 --> 02:12:11,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So the number was very small and I was told that the students that didn't have IDs that their pictures were being taken on the computer and they were going to have.

1445
02:12:13,775 --> 02:12:32,457
[SPEAKER_14]: It wouldn't be the same exact idea because even new students that are enrolling if they're moving, you know, you move from New Hampshire to Massachusetts, then you wouldn't have taken pictures, and the photography vendor, when they tried to see if we could get the vendor to come out again.

1446
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:35,400
[SPEAKER_14]: the vendors were booked months in advance.

1447
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:46,487
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was the reason why we could not do like, you know, another picture day and say, okay, these 97 students are, you know, it could be 105 by now.

1448
02:12:47,347 --> 02:12:57,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was the information that I had, but we did get duplicate IDs made for the students, but I can definitely follow up on that.

1449
02:12:58,615 --> 02:12:58,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1450
02:13:04,057 --> 02:13:11,188
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe in the meantime, if we can't get a professional photographer, we could just get somebody with a, you know, camera, cell phones take great pictures.

1451
02:13:12,028 --> 02:13:14,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Media Tech, we could maybe do that.

1452
02:13:14,489 --> 02:13:21,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because I also spoke with Mr. Spagnola, who's from Graphic Design or Media Tech, either, or we have the two departments.

1453
02:13:22,691 --> 02:13:29,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And he also was interested in trying to design like a temporary ID.

1454
02:13:30,953 --> 02:13:35,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think it's important if it's 97 students, we get them IDs as soon as possible.

1455
02:13:35,475 --> 02:13:36,095
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'm not sure.

1456
02:13:36,115 --> 02:13:40,416
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry if I took your comment, Member McLaughlin, but all you.

1457
02:13:40,436 --> 02:13:40,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1458
02:13:41,541 --> 02:13:45,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you and thank you for letting us know.

1459
02:13:46,224 --> 02:13:53,529
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that, you know, so this was something that was brought up as well a couple of months ago, because we said, you know, school committee also needs IDs.

1460
02:13:54,650 --> 02:14:02,175
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was mentioned that, oh, you know, the way that it was, the process was that there was a picture day and that was how they had gotten the IDs.

1461
02:14:02,275 --> 02:14:06,298
[SPEAKER_19]: But obviously we're gonna have staff that might come in mid year, we're gonna have,

1462
02:14:06,878 --> 02:14:13,501
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, students that might transfer over, we're going to have school committee members, what have you, that will need IDs throughout the year.

1463
02:14:13,541 --> 02:14:15,201
[SPEAKER_19]: So a process would be really helpful.

1464
02:14:15,221 --> 02:14:29,487
[SPEAKER_19]: I do think that what we had said with the school committee was that we would send a headshot, you know, most of us have a headshot that can be used for IDs, but that, you know, we should be also modeling that behavior when we're going into the schools as well.

1465
02:14:29,567 --> 02:14:31,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was one thing.

1466
02:14:31,688 --> 02:14:35,350
[SPEAKER_19]: If we could do that for school committee as well, that would be helpful.

1467
02:14:35,370 --> 02:14:35,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Just let us know

1468
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:40,231
[SPEAKER_19]: to whom we should send the headshot and when we can pick them up.

1469
02:14:40,271 --> 02:14:41,611
[SPEAKER_19]: This was done a couple of years ago.

1470
02:14:43,372 --> 02:14:45,552
[SPEAKER_19]: I lost mine, to be honest, so my apologies.

1471
02:14:46,293 --> 02:14:47,413
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'll try not to do that again.

1472
02:14:47,433 --> 02:14:52,734
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the other was for Dr. Cushing, the question I had about the survey.

1473
02:14:52,754 --> 02:14:54,715
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Cushing.

1474
02:14:58,556 --> 02:14:58,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1475
02:15:00,563 --> 02:15:07,505
[SPEAKER_19]: Essentially, I know you guys said you were gonna look over the survey options with Department of Public Health, I mean the Board of Health.

1476
02:15:08,946 --> 02:15:12,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Will you show us that before you guys, is that the process that you're gonna go through?

1477
02:15:12,587 --> 02:15:15,968
[SPEAKER_19]: You're gonna sort of one iteration where you and Ms.

1478
02:15:15,988 --> 02:15:21,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Bowen are working on it and then you'll bring a version of that to school committee before it goes out?

1479
02:15:21,090 --> 02:15:25,571
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we have an opportunity to see it and or offer any feedback?

1480
02:15:32,277 --> 02:15:33,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to share it with you.

1481
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:45,731
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I would say is that so we for the previous survey that we worked on that what we really wanted to do is, you know, we want to make sure that it's able to be replicated.

1482
02:15:46,249 --> 02:15:47,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a clear and consistent format.

1483
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:50,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Our Likert scale was expansive.

1484
02:15:50,772 --> 02:16:03,622
[SPEAKER_11]: So in partnering with the Board of Health and using the tool that they have, the only thing I would say is it's published by the federal government and it's pretty comprehensive.

1485
02:16:03,782 --> 02:16:05,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no problem forwarding it to you this evening.

1486
02:16:06,344 --> 02:16:07,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can take a look.

1487
02:16:07,564 --> 02:16:09,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know about further edits.

1488
02:16:10,086 --> 02:16:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And at this point, we wanna get it out and have it be done well.

1489
02:16:15,391 --> 02:16:17,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I guess thank you for that.

1490
02:16:18,433 --> 02:16:18,973
[SPEAKER_19]: information.

1491
02:16:19,013 --> 02:16:32,383
[SPEAKER_19]: And I guess one of the things I'm thinking of is, you know, there have been examples in the past where surveys have gone out where they might not have been inclusive of all schools and or all students, or potentially culturally sensitive.

1492
02:16:32,523 --> 02:16:43,671
[SPEAKER_19]: And so just making sure that, you know, that is a factor, I'm assuming the Board of Health will have been more thought of that in terms of a community response, but not necessarily in terms of a student response.

1493
02:16:43,711 --> 02:16:46,013
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to make sure that we're thinking about that.

1494
02:16:46,193 --> 02:16:46,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1495
02:16:49,397 --> 02:16:49,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hays.

1496
02:16:50,658 --> 02:16:52,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I had a question about the survey also.

1497
02:16:52,438 --> 02:16:55,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this still the same, the panorama survey that we were?

1498
02:16:55,419 --> 02:17:01,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can load it in through panorama to be able to use their survey metrics.

1499
02:17:02,162 --> 02:17:08,925
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Board of Health has money available to also have a comprehensive analysis of this.

1500
02:17:09,505 --> 02:17:16,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be able to partner it with some surveys that have been done previously.

1501
02:17:17,546 --> 02:17:23,145
[SPEAKER_11]: and be able to get some longitudinal data when we administer this, not just this year, but moving forward as well.

1502
02:17:23,601 --> 02:17:31,704
[SPEAKER_15]: So my understanding, I had talked to some, I talked last week about the survey prior to vacation was that there was a survey ready to go.

1503
02:17:32,224 --> 02:17:35,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this now a different survey than was ready to go?

1504
02:17:35,785 --> 02:17:39,526
[SPEAKER_15]: There was talk of doing it the week before vacation and then it got pushed out a little bit.

1505
02:17:40,226 --> 02:17:41,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was gonna be done this week.

1506
02:17:42,447 --> 02:17:45,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this still the same survey or are we talking about a different survey now?

1507
02:17:45,848 --> 02:17:51,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a different survey that what it does is the survey that we had worked on has

1508
02:17:51,963 --> 02:17:53,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say some challenges to it.

1509
02:17:54,143 --> 02:18:00,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this will offer us an opportunity to really use a tool that has been designed by experts.

1510
02:18:01,545 --> 02:18:05,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And many of the questions are similar, but they're a little bit more narrowly tailored.

1511
02:18:06,426 --> 02:18:12,747
[SPEAKER_11]: They're more focused and the answers that students can choose from are more narrowly tailored as well.

1512
02:18:12,767 --> 02:18:13,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1513
02:18:13,367 --> 02:18:16,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just like to put my concern out there that in late December,

1514
02:18:17,685 --> 02:18:23,807
[SPEAKER_15]: there was an email sent out to families that this survey would happen in the first two weeks of January.

1515
02:18:24,367 --> 02:18:26,468
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it kept getting pushed and pushed and pushed.

1516
02:18:26,648 --> 02:18:30,749
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am concerned now that we're missing critical information that we need from the students.

1517
02:18:31,209 --> 02:18:37,831
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this was that we're now talking about mid March before it goes out and then it has to be analyzed.

1518
02:18:37,891 --> 02:18:39,912
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're getting pretty late in the year.

1519
02:18:39,972 --> 02:18:47,294
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just would like to put out there that I'm really concerned about how long it's taken to get the survey out there and getting the critical information that we need from the students.

1520
02:18:51,365 --> 02:18:51,905
[SPEAKER_22]: member Ruseau.

1521
02:18:53,627 --> 02:18:54,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1522
02:18:56,168 --> 02:19:04,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless the thought is that the ID thing will be a temporary thing, then we should just be buying equipment to make IDs on the fly when we need them.

1523
02:19:04,615 --> 02:19:06,296
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that when new staff comes in,

1524
02:19:07,512 --> 02:19:10,693
[SPEAKER_13]: It can take a long time before we can get them IDs.

1525
02:19:11,073 --> 02:19:17,296
[SPEAKER_13]: And the proper time to get them an ID is the morning they show up, their first day, maybe by the end of the day.

1526
02:19:19,057 --> 02:19:23,618
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other, so that's more of a statement.

1527
02:19:23,878 --> 02:19:27,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what an ID machine costs, but it can't be as much as a car or something.

1528
02:19:28,499 --> 02:19:29,800
[SPEAKER_11]: We're pricing them out.

1529
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:36,545
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an alternative from the photography studio from the high school.

1530
02:19:36,845 --> 02:19:44,090
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we'd like to do is we'd like to have an option in the human resources office and an option in the parent information center as students come in.

1531
02:19:44,530 --> 02:19:56,498
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're still fleshing out that plan, but the plan is to budget into the next fiscal year to be able to have those IDs available to be printed as new staff and as new students come in.

1532
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:02,062
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing with the ideas is this is going to be a long term cultural change for students not used to being wearing them.

1533
02:20:02,522 --> 02:20:08,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And so one thing that we've had initial conversations about is about pushing it down to the middle schools.

1534
02:20:09,454 --> 02:20:27,731
[SPEAKER_11]: as well, so that it builds that muscle memory for students to be able to realize that, I mean, for most jobs you work at, you need to have an ID, it's just on the street, most people may not realize this, you need to have your license on you at all times to be able to properly identify, but just so everyone's aware.

1535
02:20:28,411 --> 02:20:29,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I agree.

1536
02:20:29,552 --> 02:20:29,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1537
02:20:32,401 --> 02:20:34,042
[SPEAKER_13]: I did have a question about the 50%.

1538
02:20:34,242 --> 02:20:52,731
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's not a, that's not like a, nobody did a calculation, but is there a sense that this has gone up or down since it began or has it been kind of pegged that the students that are gonna wear their IDs have been wearing them and the rest of the students that weren't going to, whether they don't have an ID because they didn't get a picture or they just,

1539
02:20:53,871 --> 02:20:56,012
[SPEAKER_13]: don't feel like it or they don't like their photo.

1540
02:20:56,272 --> 02:20:57,913
[SPEAKER_13]: My own daughter didn't like her photo.

1541
02:20:58,133 --> 02:21:13,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I hope she's wearing it, but, you know, I mean, we've all seen the memes of, you know, the funny memes that people go into the DMV and, you know, this is the picture they have to live with forever.

1542
02:21:13,742 --> 02:21:15,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Now imagine being a teenager.

1543
02:21:16,623 --> 02:21:18,705
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like torture if you,

1544
02:21:19,784 --> 02:21:23,307
[SPEAKER_13]: had to have your picture taken and then have it walk around showing it to everybody.

1545
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:29,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Adolescence isn't really known as the most fun time for a lot of people.

1546
02:21:29,473 --> 02:21:37,080
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think being able to get a new ID photo, which will be resolved when we can actually do that on site.

1547
02:21:39,946 --> 02:21:49,633
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I was gonna ask the students, our student representatives before they left, but I'd hazard that less than one student a day forgets their iPhones or their cell phones.

1548
02:21:50,174 --> 02:21:54,197
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't think it is that students can't remember to do that one thing a day.

1549
02:21:55,558 --> 02:21:57,740
[SPEAKER_13]: It's that it's not important to them.

1550
02:21:58,750 --> 02:22:06,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we'd be woefully underselling students' ability to do things if we said that they just aren't able to have their IDs.

1551
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:13,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of times society likes to think that teenagers don't have capabilities that they are vastly capable of.

1552
02:22:13,476 --> 02:22:15,417
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my point, yes, exactly.

1553
02:22:15,557 --> 02:22:27,422
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing too is, for those of you who may not know how the school ID picture goes now, is generally speaking, right now we have three different contractors doing school pictures.

1554
02:22:27,922 --> 02:22:32,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally speaking, the iPad is turned around so the student can approve their picture or not.

1555
02:22:33,204 --> 02:22:34,605
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's turned back around.

1556
02:22:34,725 --> 02:22:36,486
[SPEAKER_11]: So the student has the moment there.

1557
02:22:36,586 --> 02:22:42,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I honestly don't know what the per unit cost is going to be for IDs and printing badges and things like that.

1558
02:22:42,948 --> 02:22:48,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But it can't be too exorbitant that a student wants to have one freebie.

1559
02:22:49,931 --> 02:22:54,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it's every week, maybe we have to implement whatever the fee is.

1560
02:22:55,654 --> 02:22:59,077
[SPEAKER_11]: to have a student have a picture that represents them, I'm all for it.

1561
02:22:59,498 --> 02:23:00,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

1562
02:23:00,339 --> 02:23:06,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I had one other question, but I forgot what it was, and it's getting late, so if I remember, I'll ask it.

1563
02:23:07,127 --> 02:23:07,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1564
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:10,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham?

1565
02:23:11,274 --> 02:23:11,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1566
02:23:13,055 --> 02:23:31,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually have a lot of questions based on this and I'm wondering because I think most of my questions are about what have we observed that demonstrates that this thing that we said we were going to do is working.

1567
02:23:34,932 --> 02:23:45,406
[SPEAKER_18]: It's less about did we do the things we said we would do that's important, but did they work, I think, is the question that I have and it's like I can happy to send you a whole list of questions but.

1568
02:23:45,902 --> 02:23:49,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I think in fairness, like it's gonna take some time to answer them.

1569
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:51,005
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm wondering if it makes sense.

1570
02:23:51,685 --> 02:24:04,052
[SPEAKER_18]: And probably my colleagues have other questions as well for us to share with you what some of our questions are that we'd like to see answered in the next time that this comes up and maybe not on Monday, but the following meeting.

1571
02:24:05,332 --> 02:24:10,135
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think a lot of the questions I had was, how long are the waits in the bathroom?

1572
02:24:10,875 --> 02:24:14,256
[SPEAKER_18]: the question that came up like, why do students not know which bathrooms are open?

1573
02:24:14,396 --> 02:24:15,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Why aren't enough bathrooms open?

1574
02:24:15,776 --> 02:24:34,801
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's just, there's a lot of really tactical questions that came up for me as I was reading these things that I'm happy to send you if we can put this on the agenda again in two weeks, because I think that's, I think this is an ongoing conversation and it's a culture change and you know, it's all the things that take time.

1575
02:24:34,861 --> 02:24:36,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So rather than,

1576
02:24:37,495 --> 02:24:43,116
[SPEAKER_18]: try to ask you really specific questions tonight that in fairness, you probably can't answer tonight.

1577
02:24:43,236 --> 02:24:49,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that might make more sense, but I don't know if my colleagues agree with that approach or if you'd rather me just ask them tonight.

1578
02:24:50,538 --> 02:24:56,160
[SPEAKER_24]: And maybe we can send our questions by say the 13th, which is two weeks from now to be addressed on the 20th.

1579
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:01,941
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be a full three weeks for the, and a full week for the superintendent to get us another type of.

1580
02:25:02,748 --> 02:25:04,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1581
02:25:04,089 --> 02:25:05,710
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that works.

1582
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:08,011
[SPEAKER_24]: Cause I, yeah, I want to digest myself.

1583
02:25:08,651 --> 02:25:09,511
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, okay.

1584
02:25:09,872 --> 02:25:10,172
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1585
02:25:10,312 --> 02:25:11,552
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for the update.

1586
02:25:11,973 --> 02:25:12,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1587
02:25:12,493 --> 02:25:19,016
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, we're going to move on to, I believe we're going to table continued business, which is number eight.

1588
02:25:19,056 --> 02:25:20,397
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it's going to be a number seven.

1589
02:25:20,857 --> 02:25:21,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, please.

1590
02:25:22,818 --> 02:25:27,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Continued business based on February six committee, the whole meeting, the Medford school committee shall develop their goals.

1591
02:25:27,561 --> 02:25:32,243
[SPEAKER_24]: The remainder of the year moving forward, the Medford school committee will develop their goals and objectives for an 11 month cycle.

1592
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:35,201
[SPEAKER_24]: starting in January and ending in November of a calendar year.

1593
02:25:35,701 --> 02:25:36,681
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1594
02:25:39,903 --> 02:25:40,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1595
02:25:41,484 --> 02:25:42,105
[SPEAKER_20]: I have information.

1596
02:25:42,145 --> 02:25:45,347
[SPEAKER_19]: So are you suggesting that this, did you say this was being tabled?

1597
02:25:45,827 --> 02:25:47,268
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe somebody was going to table it.

1598
02:25:49,209 --> 02:25:52,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, because we have a new business that's going to take a while.

1599
02:25:53,592 --> 02:25:53,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1600
02:25:53,912 --> 02:25:56,894
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a motion on the floor by Member Mustone to table this?

1601
02:25:57,014 --> 02:25:57,194
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1602
02:25:57,214 --> 02:25:57,915
[SPEAKER_24]: Till next Monday.

1603
02:25:58,095 --> 02:25:59,135
[SPEAKER_19]: Till next Monday.

1604
02:25:59,355 --> 02:25:59,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1605
02:25:59,896 --> 02:26:00,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Second.

1606
02:26:00,933 --> 02:26:01,273
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1607
02:26:01,373 --> 02:26:01,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1608
02:26:02,554 --> 02:26:03,234
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1609
02:26:03,254 --> 02:26:03,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1610
02:26:04,214 --> 02:26:04,954
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

1611
02:26:05,655 --> 02:26:07,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Continued business is tabled.

1612
02:26:07,635 --> 02:26:08,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Now onto new business.

1613
02:26:09,076 --> 02:26:17,999
[SPEAKER_24]: First reading recommendation, which we spoke about earlier in the meeting minutes of the strategic planning subcommittee held on February 9th, 2023.

1614
02:26:18,179 --> 02:26:19,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Graham chaired.

1615
02:26:19,799 --> 02:26:20,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Hays is a member.

1616
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:21,920
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Ruseau is a member.

1617
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:26,782
[SPEAKER_24]: Proposed policy for dedication and naming of school buildings, facilities, and grounds.

1618
02:26:28,899 --> 02:26:35,921

1662
02:30:46,754 --> 02:30:47,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1663
02:30:48,274 --> 02:30:50,035
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the policy that we,

1664
02:30:51,770 --> 02:31:05,434
[SPEAKER_18]: um worked on in our subcommittee meeting at the beginning of February um and it reflects I think uh all the things that the MASC recommends that our um naming policy reflect.

1665
02:31:06,075 --> 02:31:07,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Um I just have two amendments to offer.

1666
02:31:08,015 --> 02:31:15,297
[SPEAKER_18]: One is that um the policy number for lack of a better term because their letters um is policy FF.

1667
02:31:15,577 --> 02:31:17,338
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where it would sit in our policy handbook

1668
02:31:18,112 --> 02:31:25,038
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a legal reference can be added for Mass General Law, Part 1, Title 7, Chapter 43, Section 33.

1669
02:31:26,359 --> 02:31:39,569
[SPEAKER_18]: And I did speak with Attorney Greenspan earlier today to confirm that that was the appropriate reference that goes with this policy, because it was not clearly listed on the MASC model policy either.

1670
02:31:41,846 --> 02:31:49,810
[SPEAKER_18]: happy to take any questions that people have about what we put together, but I would otherwise recommend this past first reading.

1671
02:31:53,612 --> 02:32:00,595
[SPEAKER_13]: The FF is actually already on there, but could you repeat the national law so I can write that in my thing?

1672
02:32:00,795 --> 02:32:01,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

1673
02:32:02,176 --> 02:32:06,098
[SPEAKER_18]: National law, part one, title seven, chapter 43, section 33.

1674
02:32:10,302 --> 02:32:10,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1675
02:32:10,822 --> 02:32:12,463
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't happen to have it, do you?

1676
02:32:13,184 --> 02:32:15,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, do we have that?

1677
02:32:15,425 --> 02:32:16,566
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I have it?

1678
02:32:16,846 --> 02:32:19,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Just the law or a summary of it.

1679
02:32:19,448 --> 02:32:20,208
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, what is it?

1680
02:32:20,329 --> 02:32:21,049
[SPEAKER_19]: What's the question?

1681
02:32:21,489 --> 02:32:22,670
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't hear you.

1682
02:32:22,690 --> 02:32:23,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1683
02:32:23,691 --> 02:32:27,173
[SPEAKER_19]: The question through the chair is, do we have a summary?

1684
02:32:28,014 --> 02:32:31,096
[SPEAKER_19]: We got the law citation, is there a summary of what the law says?

1685
02:32:31,496 --> 02:32:33,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you know for the public certification?

1686
02:32:33,357 --> 02:32:47,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so that confers the responsibilities of the school committee in broad terms, which does include responsibility over school buildings as a sort of broad umbrella.

1687
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:49,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1688
02:32:50,802 --> 02:32:51,442
[SPEAKER_24]: Member Ruseau.

1689
02:32:51,862 --> 02:32:54,463
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually pretty short, I can read it if that would be helpful.

1690
02:32:54,484 --> 02:32:55,604
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, please.

1691
02:32:56,064 --> 02:33:00,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, so I won't read the whole long Mass General Law, how to get to it.

1692
02:33:00,286 --> 02:33:02,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Section 33, school committee, powers and duties.

1693
02:33:03,587 --> 02:33:15,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and subject to any laws which limit the amount of money that may be appropriated in any city for school purposes, the school committee, in addition to the powers and duties conferred,

1694
02:33:15,692 --> 02:33:43,314
[SPEAKER_13]: and imposed by law on school committees may provide when necessary temporary accommodations for school purposes may make on repairs, the expenditures for the regular appropriation for the school department shall have control of all school buildings and grounds connected there with and shall make all reasonable rules and regulations consistent with law for the management of the public schools of the city for conducting the business of the committee.

1695
02:33:43,414 --> 02:33:44,535
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think the most important

1696
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:53,105
[SPEAKER_13]: section of that very long sentence, that's Rick, one really long sentence is, shall have control of all school buildings and grounds.

1697
02:33:54,566 --> 02:33:56,808
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the piece that is used.

1698
02:34:00,111 --> 02:34:01,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to approve the first reading.

1699
02:34:01,832 --> 02:34:02,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Second.

1700
02:34:04,495 --> 02:34:08,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to approve the first reading by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

1701
02:34:09,339 --> 02:34:10,219
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favor?

1702
02:34:11,761 --> 02:34:14,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we vote on the amendment or approve it as amended?

1703
02:34:14,881 --> 02:34:16,282
[SPEAKER_24]: approved as amended.

1704
02:34:16,302 --> 02:34:18,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, as amended.

1705
02:34:19,104 --> 02:34:20,726
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, all those in favor as amended.

1706
02:34:20,746 --> 02:34:22,147
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

1707
02:34:23,888 --> 02:34:24,489
[SPEAKER_24]: Any opposed?

1708
02:34:25,730 --> 02:34:26,931
[SPEAKER_22]: First reading has passed.

1709
02:34:33,956 --> 02:34:36,038
[SPEAKER_22]: We have condolences.

1710
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:42,103
[SPEAKER_24]: We have an announcement to make about school.

1711
02:34:43,779 --> 02:34:44,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1712
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:48,482
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford public schools will be closed.

1713
02:34:51,003 --> 02:34:56,807
[SPEAKER_14]: In light of this this storm is truly unpredictable.

1714
02:34:58,081 --> 02:35:14,714
[SPEAKER_14]: But due to the significant amount of surrounding communities that are also closed, we're really concerned about our staff coming in and taking care of their own families and children because many of our staff live in the surrounding communities.

1715
02:35:15,235 --> 02:35:23,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And so they would now not have childcare and it definitely could end up being a significant impact.

1716
02:35:23,642 --> 02:35:24,462
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have not,

1717
02:35:25,783 --> 02:35:38,667
[SPEAKER_14]: put it out yet, but we'll be putting it out on the media and sending out a communication that tomorrow the Medford public schools will be closed due to the timing of the storm with the morning commute.

1718
02:35:39,287 --> 02:35:51,930
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition, the governor did ask for DCF involved families that DCF will be closed tomorrow.

1719
02:35:51,970 --> 02:35:53,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So we already received notification that

1720
02:35:54,771 --> 02:35:58,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of our most vulnerable families would not be receiving transportation to school.

1721
02:35:59,235 --> 02:36:15,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was going to be an excused absence, but just in light of, again, so many of our surrounding communities that have already closed, it would be, I could see it being a significant hardship for the district for us tomorrow.

1722
02:36:15,888 --> 02:36:19,351
[SPEAKER_14]: So there will be no school for the schools tomorrow.

1723
02:36:19,997 --> 02:36:24,280
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, and I'll just add, I mean, the morning commute from three to nine is when we're expecting the most snow.

1724
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:30,364
[SPEAKER_24]: We're only gonna see two to four, but it is gonna be during the commute.

1725
02:36:30,384 --> 02:36:36,068
[SPEAKER_24]: City Hall will be closed till 10 a.m., and as Dr. Edouard-Vincent said, the schools will be closed.

1726
02:36:36,088 --> 02:36:41,191
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have a delayed start option due to the MBTA, so I'm making that decision.

1727
02:36:41,231 --> 02:36:45,514
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll try to run the school committee meeting and make those decisions as we work.

1728
02:36:45,634 --> 02:36:49,577
[SPEAKER_19]: So for those who stayed on long enough to watch, that was their reward.

1729
02:36:50,353 --> 02:36:51,134
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a reward.

1730
02:36:51,154 --> 02:37:00,240
[SPEAKER_24]: Keep everybody in suspense, because we want to be thoughtful and we want to make sure we're following the weather, because weather does tend to change.

1731
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:07,825
[SPEAKER_24]: If it changes from now until 7 in the morning, we make our best decisions, but we get held accountable either way.

1732
02:37:07,885 --> 02:37:09,667
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's a tough decision to sometimes make.

1733
02:37:11,787 --> 02:37:14,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Last, we have three condolences that I'd like to read.

1734
02:37:14,889 --> 02:37:23,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Leonard Mortel, father-in-law of Joanne Mortel of our Human Resource Office.

1735
02:37:23,874 --> 02:37:31,699
[SPEAKER_24]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Richard A. Eliberty Jr., son of former school committee member, Mary Eliberty.

1736
02:37:32,420 --> 02:37:38,823
[SPEAKER_24]: And the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Birmingham, former Senate President

1737
02:37:40,171 --> 02:37:42,273
[SPEAKER_24]: and co-author of the Education Reform Act of 1993.

1738
02:37:42,393 --> 02:37:45,816
[SPEAKER_24]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1739
02:37:55,505 --> 02:37:55,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1740
02:37:57,087 --> 02:38:04,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Our next regular meeting is Monday, next Monday, March 6, 2023, here in all the memorial chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

[SPEAKER_24]: by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Mustone.

1742
02:38:09,621 --> 02:38:11,206
[SPEAKER_22]: Meeting is, all those in favor?

1743
02:38:11,226 --> 02:38:11,467
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1744
02:38:11,868 --> 02:38:12,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Meeting is adjourned.
