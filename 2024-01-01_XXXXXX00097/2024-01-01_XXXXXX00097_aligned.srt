1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:43,198
All right.

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,400
Welcome to our end of the year wrap up podcast.

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,821
It's me, Danielle.

12
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,181
Hey, guys, it's Chelly.

13
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,442
And we're welcoming Chelly back.

14
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:58,284
Before we get into it, we're just going to start with our usual introduction.

15
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,705
So we'll share our name, pronouns.

16
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:06,487
And then instead of like maybe our favorite restaurant, maybe we can reflect on any new restaurants we tried this year in Medford.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,550
Okay.

18
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:08,751
All right.

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,791
You might have to go first on this.

20
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:11,132
It's always my hardest question.

21
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:11,692
Yeah.

22
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,173
I don't think it's going to be a shocking one.

23
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:13,573
So yeah.

24
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:14,414
My name is Danielle.

25
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:15,474
She and her pronouns.

26
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,817
Um, I did try El Tacuba.

27
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:25,780
I think everyone was like really, really excited anticipating the opening of this restaurant for years.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,641
Um, and I thought it was great.

29
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,102
I thought it was a great margarita.

30
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:32,344
Um, we went for like appetizers.

31
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,366
We had like one of each of the tacos that didn't have meat in them.

32
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:37,967
Um delicious.

33
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:54,039
I think we got some advice before going that it's not a place to bring your kids because of like you know what's on the menu and definitely our kids are very picky so they enjoyed, well one of them enjoyed the tortilla chips but I think it's a good date night spot or like pre-theater outing.

34
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,360
Um yeah what about you?

35
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,642
Yeah I'm gonna have to ditto that.

36
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,225
I also tried to Cuba um

37
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:15,175
I agree that it's a perfect date night spot, although I went and hyped up the miss a tough moms and we did a couple of glasses of wine and we did some apps and it was the perfect blend of.

38
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:19,984
like close to home, relaxing.

39
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,144
It was a great ambience, great atmosphere.

40
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:24,545
So I think we're lucky to have them.

41
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:29,906
Yeah, I mean, I feel like they've gotten a lot of mention on the podcast and yeah, exciting.

42
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:33,987
Yeah, I think Medford is ready for Tacuba-esque spaces.

43
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:34,487
Bring it on.

44
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,988
Yeah, and ready for their coffee shop to open too.

45
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:41,969
Yes, coffee first, wine later.

46
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:47,551
Great, so we are hoping to kind of recap the year, both personally and for the podcast.

47
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:53,532
So I think people have noticed, we've been hearing a little bit less from Chelly this year.

48
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:54,973
So Chelly, you want to talk about why?

49
00:02:55,353 --> 00:03:00,594
Yeah, you may have noticed that I have been less present than last year.

50
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:06,616
Is it already, is it a year and a half ago at this point?

51
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,272
In May, I started a master's program at Tufts in the urban policy department.

52
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:21,994
And so I have been both tied up, but also happily engaged at Tufts.

53
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,094
I'm pursuing a master's in public policy.

54
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:30,736
And so while I have wanted to be here, it has not been, there are only so many hours.

55
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,957
So yeah, I'm very much looking forward to

56
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:35,238
next semester.

57
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:42,202
I'm about halfway through and looking to wrap up in August so yeah we'll see we'll see how the next couple months go.

58
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:56,572
Yeah well and congratulations and um you know we've missed you but also very happy for you yeah it's a big thing graduation yeah graduation maybe it doesn't feel like it but right around the corner yeah yeah any other sort of highlights of the year for you?

59
00:03:56,932 --> 00:04:01,475
I mean I still I also gave time I'm still a coalition coalition member

60
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:07,515
at the Center for Translational Research at Harvard.

61
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:11,658
We're essentially an equity committee, and we review methodology.

62
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:19,964
And researchers come to us with their thinking around research design, and we chew on it and offer feedback.

63
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:23,206
And we also invite folks to come back for further discussion.

64
00:04:24,327 --> 00:04:27,890
So that has been an excellent networking opportunity.

65
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,332
And also I'm a person who has PhD hopes in the mix and research design hopes.

66
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:42,154
And so it's been a good opportunity for me to think about design that has worked well for others and pieces that I could or should adopt.

67
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:44,434
So yeah.

68
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:48,616
So also school is probably not going, or hopefully not going anywhere for me.

69
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:49,836
Yeah.

70
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:56,278
So then there's one thing that you have been involved in that maybe we can look out for more about in January.

71
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:56,958
Do you want to talk about that?

72
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:57,778
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm happy to rep Dr. Ravi Shankar.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,401
He and I met over the summer.

75
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:08,224
He is the author of a memoir of his own memoir called Correctional.

76
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:16,068
I was supposed to be shopping for like econ books and quant books, but those are not as interesting as Correctional for me.

77
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,169
And I saw his book in the Tufts bookstore.

78
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,151
He is a professor at the English department.

79
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,244
I was sort of immediately drawn to it.

80
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:39,681
with my Indian Medford, West Medford hats on, I saw in him another South Indian discussing racism and anti-blackness in the Indian community.

81
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:42,343
And I was like, oh my god, I need to meet him right now.

82
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:48,607
And lo and behold, our very own Reverend Wendy was like, well, he's going to be here next week.

83
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:49,207
I'll introduce you.

84
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:50,008
And I was like, get out.

85
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,649
And she was, no, I'm dead serious.

86
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:52,610
He's going to be here next week.

87
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,411
And so Wendy made the connection.

88
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:11,109
kind of have been connected by way of two different Tufts departments, the English department, kind of surrounding journalism stuff, which makes Medford Bites even more relevant in that space.

89
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,091
But also, he is part of the Tuppet department.

90
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:23,893
Tufts is involved in sort of education and bachelor avenues for formerly incarcerated.

91
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:26,714
And so, yeah, I've been learning a lot.

92
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,316
look out in early January.

93
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:34,438
We are planning to launch a series of conversations around the book correctional.

94
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,622
So I imagine Medford Bites will post details as soon as they're available.

95
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:44,104
But yeah, come see me, come meet Dr. Shankar.

96
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:45,585
I think it'll be a good time.

97
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:47,647
Definitely exciting stuff.

98
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,168
Yeah.

99
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:54,511
I think for me the highlights, there's a lot of highlights of the year that are about the podcast.

100
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:55,772
I think like personally,

101
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,911
So it's been like a lot of ups and downs this year.

102
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:09,914
I think, you know, I think working with the Charter Study Committee has been really fun, learning a lot about our city and kind of how it runs.

103
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:17,137
And just, I think, getting to know different people in the city through the podcast and also through that work has been really cool.

104
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:25,359
Um, we did, we were at the farmer's market this summer, which was like, it's not something that I ever expected to do, but it was really fun.

105
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,999
Like kind of just interacting with people.

106
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:35,681
It's really cool to like be out in the community and have people who I've never met, like talk to me about the podcast.

107
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:36,201
Like I love it.

108
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,461
Um, so that was really fun.

109
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:45,563
Um, I think too, just prioritizing self care this year in a different way.

110
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:52,044
For me, for my family, that's been a work in progress as always.

111
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,985
Yeah, I think you make a great point.

112
00:07:55,005 --> 00:08:02,747
I think maybe this is the first year I've seen where folks who you and I don't know personally know about the podcast.

113
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:10,769
And one piece that's been on my mind just kind of globally is like, is your community folks you know because you already knew them?

114
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,950
Or is your community people at large who you can

115
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:21,478
Create opportunities to get to know so I imagine the charter work functions in that way for you.

116
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:25,362
Yeah, certainly being at school.

117
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,565
having access to a plethora of sort of perspectives has done that for me this year.

118
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:39,209
Yeah, I think it's been really interesting sometimes how Medford can, for me at least, through all this stuff, can feel like a small town.

119
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:39,609
So small.

120
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:51,276
You know, like going into the square, seeing people you know, or like people that you newly know, and I just realized one person on the Charter Study Committee is like almost my neighbor, and I wouldn't have known that.

121
00:08:54,117 --> 00:09:00,440
We went around the neighborhood like hand delivering some of our Christmas cards and we like ran into him and I was like, oh wow.

122
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:13,967
So yeah, I think it's, you know, I think the podcast started in COVID when we were sort of like forced to be hyper local all the time, you know, maybe like confined to our own homes, our own like small parts of Medford.

123
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,027
And there's definitely some

124
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:35,465
Like nice outcomes meeting you, you know, just be at being able to just really connect with the folks that were like physically close to so yeah, I think it's also interesting in the years that the podcast has been around Medford has seen kind of an influx of just new folks here in Medford people are choosing

125
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:52,255
the space yeah definitely good numbers yeah once i'm so some highlights for the podcast this year we surpassed our 100th episode i sort of stopped keeping counts i'm not sure which one it was but um we definitely surpassed the 100 mark

126
00:09:54,116 --> 00:10:04,499
We did have this was like our second year of covering the municipal election so we got to talk to a lot of the candidates running for city council school committee mayor.

127
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,540
I think those are some of our most engaging and popular episodes.

128
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,881
And, you know, I think it's really exciting to see some new faces on the school committee and in the city council.

129
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:34,393
and you know we are keeping our current mayor which uh you know seems like a hopeful thing um yeah and then so also we were there was a story about us in the globe this year that featured that talked about the podcast but um highlighted a class that

130
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:42,100
I was having that the library was hosting for me to kind of teach kids about podcasting, which was really fun.

131
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,343
And then so that was like, I think, in the winter.

132
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:51,588
And then this fall, we did a class for adults, which was equally as cool, though.

133
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:56,672
I think my tech skills, the gaps show with the adults more.

134
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:02,237
We did also raise money for the GSA again, which is why we're at the farmers market selling some hats.

135
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:02,397
So

136
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,903
That's always really fun, like a nice way to engage with the community.

137
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:17,675
And I think a really fun part of that that I didn't anticipate, it didn't sound fun when I thought about doing it initially, but I drove around delivering some of the hats that were shipped to me.

138
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:23,322
And so it was like really cool to sort of like take a little tour of the city and see, you know, who was like kind of supporting the GSA.

139
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,082
Absolutely.

140
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:26,423
Yeah.

141
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:30,423
And so as people know, one of the platforms the podcast is on is Spotify.

142
00:11:30,463 --> 00:11:33,764
And so Spotify does their famous wrapped thing at the end of the year.

143
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:42,786
So it shared some fun statistics with us, which was that in 2023, 73% of our listeners found us.

144
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:46,947
So that feels like a big increase for this calendar year.

145
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,328
They also let us know that we were being streamed in six countries, the US being the most popular one, obviously.

146
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:57,892
And that our listenership increased by 42%.

147
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,435
I don't know.

148
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:02,076
I'm not a great math person.

149
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:03,478
These don't add up to me totally.

150
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,281
And that we were the top 10 podcast for 121 of our fans, top 5 for 92.

151
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:09,744
And for 45 of our followers, we were the number one podcast that they streamed.

152
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,810
Shout out to all 45, that is amazing.

153
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,671
So yeah, thank you.

154
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:22,053
And this is like only our podcast, or I mean, sorry, our Spotify stats.

155
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:28,096
So we always appreciate like a review or a rating on Apple podcasts as well.

156
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,839
As I, I don't know, this might surprise people, but people that know me probably won't.

157
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,481
I don't really know how to use, like how to like find some of these things through those apps.

158
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,443
But so it's nice that Spotify just gives them to us.

159
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:43,584
Yeah.

160
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:44,104
Hey.

161
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:50,378
Um, I mean, I think we're looking forward to some great episodes in the new year.

162
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:58,081
Maybe like all of you just trying to move with compassion, be our best selves, love our kids.

163
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,912
Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, and we're always looking for new ways.

164
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:15,136
Yeah, looking for new ways to engage with the community, get feedback, kind of keep this show something that is influenced by the community for the community.

165
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:19,258
So, yep, as always, reach out, stay connected.

166
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,919
We want to hear your thoughts and ideas.

167
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:26,381
We'd love to host as many folks as possible.

168
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:31,202
What I always tell people is that's the way we get new people to talk to on the show.

169
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:37,424
We'll talk to one person and then they'll say, oh you should really talk to this person and that person and this person is doing something really cool.

170
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:44,446
So yeah, if you're interested in being on the podcast or know somebody that you think we should talk to, send them our way.

171
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:56,755
Yeah, one thing, so at dinnertime we started this thing with our kids where we talk about like the best part of their day, the worst part of their day, and then something that they would change about their day if they could.

172
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,037
I'm used to a Rose and Thorn, but I like the change piece.

173
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah, actually I think it was Cole's first grade teacher that introduced that idea to us.

174
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,224
But I don't know, do you have anything that you would change about the year?

175
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,946
That I would change about the year.

176
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:16,454
That's a really good question.

177
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:30,978
I think I'm just trying to be reflective and understand my own patterns and what my behavior means for others positively or negatively and just get more in charge of emotions and just cause and effect.

178
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,060
Just putting on my grown woman pants.

179
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,240
Yeah.

180
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,220
I don't know if I have control of much more.

181
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:43,503
Yeah, I know what we can control, what we can't control.

182
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:46,425
Yeah, no, I like that.

183
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,867
I think I would choose that too.

184
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:50,869
I think that like self-reflection is always important.

185
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,795
some concrete things like, I don't know, I started reading at night before I go to bed.

186
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:01,618
There might have been too much graduate school reading for me.

187
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,582
Reading, yes, if my kids could exercise at school that would be dope.

188
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:12,208
Yeah, reading for pleasure as a way to kind of relax, maybe some more mindfulness, being present.

189
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,932
I think I'm getting too much into my professional

190
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:19,655
voice here, but yeah.

191
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:26,084

00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:30,169

All right.

195
