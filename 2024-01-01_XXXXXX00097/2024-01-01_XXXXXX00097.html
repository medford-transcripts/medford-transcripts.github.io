    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=410.028">I</a>  think for me the highlights, there's a lot of highlights of the year that are about the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=414.571">I</a>  think like personally, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=416.67">So</a>  it's been like a lot of ups and downs this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=418.971">I</a>  think, you know, I think working with the Charter Study Committee has been really fun, learning a lot about our city and kind of how it runs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=431.415">And</a>  just, I think, getting to know different people in the city through the podcast and also through that work has been really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=437.957">Um,</a>  we did, we were at the farmer's market this summer, which was like, it's not something that I ever expected to do, but it was really fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=445.379">Like</a>  kind of just interacting with people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=447.539">It's</a>  really cool to like be out in the community and have people who I've never met, like talk to me about the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=455.701">Like</a>  I love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=456.721">Um,</a>  so that was really fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=459.162">Um,</a>  I think too, just prioritizing self care this year in a different way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=466.783">For</a>  me, for my family, that's been a work in progress as always.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=473.225">Yeah,</a>  I think you make a great point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=475.005">I</a>  think maybe this is the first year I've seen where folks who you and I don't know personally know about the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=483.247">And</a>  one piece that's been on my mind just kind of globally is like, is your community folks you know because you already knew them? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=490.789">Or</a>  is your community people at large who you can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=495.733">Create</a>  opportunities to get to know so I imagine the charter work functions in that way for you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=501.498">Yeah,</a>  certainly being at school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=507.382">having</a>  access to a plethora of sort of perspectives has done that for me this year.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=512.325">Yeah,</a>  I think it's been really interesting sometimes how Medford can, for me at least, through all this stuff, can feel like a small town. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=519.229">So</a>  small. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=519.629">You</a>  know, like going into the square, seeing people you know, or like people that you newly know, and I just realized one person on the Charter Study Committee is like almost my neighbor, and I wouldn't have known that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=534.117">We</a>  went around the neighborhood like hand delivering some of our Christmas cards and we like ran into him and I was like, oh wow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=540.62">So</a>  yeah, I think it's, you know, I think the podcast started in COVID when we were sort of like forced to be hyper local all the time, you know, maybe like confined to our own homes, our own like small parts of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=554.567">And</a>  there's definitely some</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=557.388">Like</a>  nice outcomes meeting you, you know, just be at being able to just really connect with the folks that were like physically close to so yeah, I think it's also interesting in the years that the podcast has been around Medford has seen kind of an influx of just new folks here in Medford people are choosing</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=577.185">the</a>  space yeah definitely good numbers yeah once i'm so some highlights for the podcast this year we surpassed our 100th episode i sort of stopped keeping counts i'm not sure which one it was but um we definitely surpassed the 100 mark <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=594.116">We</a>  did have this was like our second year of covering the municipal election so we got to talk to a lot of the candidates running for city council school committee mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=604.519">I</a>  think those are some of our most engaging and popular episodes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=609.84">And,</a>  you know, I think it's really exciting to see some new faces on the school committee and in the city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=619.482">and</a>  you know we are keeping our current mayor which uh you know seems like a hopeful thing um yeah and then so also we were there was a story about us in the globe this year that featured that talked about the podcast but um highlighted a class that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=635.174">I</a>  was having that the library was hosting for me to kind of teach kids about podcasting, which was really fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=642.74">And</a>  then so that was like, I think, in the winter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=646.824">And</a>  then this fall, we did a class for adults, which was equally as cool, though. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=651.608">I</a>  think my tech skills, the gaps show with the adults more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=657.733">We</a>  did also raise money for the GSA again, which is why we're at the farmers market selling some hats. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=662.277">So</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=664.298">That's</a>  always really fun, like a nice way to engage with the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=667.983">And</a>  I think a really fun part of that that I didn't anticipate, it didn't sound fun when I thought about doing it initially, but I drove around delivering some of the hats that were shipped to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=677.715">And</a>  so it was like really cool to sort of like take a little tour of the city and see, you know, who was like kind of supporting the GSA. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=684.082">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=686.162">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=686.483">And</a>  so as people know, one of the platforms the podcast is on is Spotify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=690.463">And</a>  so Spotify does their famous wrapped thing at the end of the year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=693.804">So</a>  it shared some fun statistics with us, which was that in 2023, 73% of our listeners found us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=702.806">So</a>  that feels like a big increase for this calendar year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=708.167">They</a>  also let us know that we were being streamed in six countries, the US being the most popular one, obviously. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=714.188">And</a>  that our listenership increased by 42%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=717.932">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=720.475">I'm</a>  not a great math person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=722.236">These</a>  don't add up to me totally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=723.798">And</a>  that we were the top 10 podcast for 121 of our fans, top 5 for 92. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Fe69utl3tZ7P7NdQOB3KH?t=727.401">And</a>  for 45 of our followers, we were the number one podcast that they streamed.</p>
