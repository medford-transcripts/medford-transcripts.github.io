00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:03,534
Welcome to this evening's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:07,356
Chair Jackie McPherson is not in attendance this evening.

3
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:10,519
So I will be chairing the meeting in progress.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,121
I'd like to call the meeting to order.

5
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,963
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:21,847
This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

7
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:25,510
No in person attendance of members of the public will be permitted.

8
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:33,281
but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

9
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:45,287
A reminder that anybody who would like to listen or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included in the meeting agenda posted on the City of Medford website.

10
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:55,292
If, despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the City's website as soon as possible.

11
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:02,650
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting tonight, all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

12
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:20,885
Additionally, project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website medfordma.org by navigating to boards and commissions, selecting community development board and clicking on current CD board filings, which is under CD board meetings.

13
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:24,608
Danielle will provide a link to the CDB page in the chat.

14
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,130
Danielle, I believe you've already sent that through.

15
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:32,374
Yes, thank you for that.

16
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:35,196
So let's kick off with roll call attendance.

17
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:38,639
Jackie McPherson.

18
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:42,161
Peter Calvis.

19
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:44,763
Here.

20
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:46,825
Ari Fishman.

21
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:48,146
Present.

22
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,388
Pam Mariansky.

23
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:51,208
Here.

24
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:53,350
Sally Akiki.

25
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:54,371
Present.

26
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:57,844
Sherrod, but Richard Rhea.

27
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:03,827
And myself, Emily had him in present.

28
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:06,669
Danielle, can you please introduce any staff on the call?

29
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:17,094
Yes, myself, Daniel Evans, senior planner in the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability and also present is Alicia Hunt, the director of Planning, Development, Sustainability.

30
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:18,955
Great, thank you.

31
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:23,320
We're going to kick off the evening with 290 Salem Street.

32
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,463
This is a continuance from April 3rd.

33
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:37,412
This is a site plan review and special permit to allow the construction of a three-story mixed-use building to contain seven residential units above ground floor commercial space.

34
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:44,417
A quick note on timing for any of those, anybody joining the call, we expect to only have a quorum until 7 p.m.

35
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,999
and expect to continue to the next meeting.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,181
So I just wanted to provide that heads up in advance.

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:50,543
questions.

38
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:52,384
Can the staff please make any introductory comments?

39
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:59,946
Yes Um, as you're all aware, this was continued a few times while we worked.

40
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,487
Um well, staff worked with the architect team to make some revisions.

41
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:08,328
Um there's been a few iterations that have gone back and forth.

42
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,488
Um and.

43
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,453
you know, tweaks that need to be made.

44
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:27,761
So while we have quorum tonight, tonight is an opportunity to give some direct feedback so that we can get to the finish line.

45
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:31,684
Great, thank you, Danielle.

46
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,648
So I would like the applicant to bring up the most recent

47
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:42,133
changes on the screen, and then I'm actually going to open to the board for feedback.

48
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:53,475
My intent with this is to maximize the direction that you receive from the board so that the applicant can engage on those specific topics rather than a wholesale presentation.

49
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:59,436
Can the applicant please bring up the most recent documents?

50
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,357
I have host disabled participations screen sharing.

51
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,818
Can the host please enable screen sharing?

52
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:10,207
done.

53
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,291
All right.

54
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:15,872
Well, good evening board.

55
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:16,993
And thank you very much.

56
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,175
My name is, as you guys know, Jacob Levine.

57
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm the architect behind this project, working with the client today.

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,362
Our lawyer Adam is out.

59
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:32,967
So I'm going to just kind of be doing the little bit of introduction to keep things quick note.

60
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:37,371
I was hoping to open it to the board first, because I think there's some specific

61
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:51,142
Feedback we were hoping to really focus in on um, I welcome, you know your other other comments But I think in the interest of time because we do have that 7 p.m quorum cut off Um so we can kick things off with the board and then go from there.

62
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:52,704
Is that suitable for the applicant?

63
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:55,106
Absolutely Great.

64
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:56,206
Okay.

65
00:04:56,226 --> 00:05:06,415
So with that i'd like to open discussion, uh up to the board i'm curious for other board members feedback Before I offer my own

66
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,128
All right, seeing none, I'll jump right in.

67
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,431
Thank you so much for the revised drawings.

68
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:33,297
I really do appreciate the continued efforts as well as the iterative process that you've engaged with, whether it's with us, the board, or with city staff.

69
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:44,886
From my recollection, there were two specific items that we were hoping to, that I was hoping to talk about this evening.

70
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:55,669
I think the larger one is the corner treatment, but potentially the more straightforward one is that back corner with the yellow VW bug.

71
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:09,220
So I'm hoping that you could offer a little bit of clarification here, because when I look at this rendering, I'm seeing vegetation in the middle of the parking area.

72
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,243
And then when I look at the plan, it doesn't exactly line up.

73
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,264
So I'm curious

74
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:26,262
You know what the actual condition is here Okay, it could just be a perspective issue but um wanted to get some clarity there

75
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,588
I appreciate that.

76
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:38,934
I think it might just be a perspective issue, like maybe up here, you could see a little bit clearer than I'm trying just to the landscape is on the perimeter of the site.

77
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:46,538
And if you kind of look at our proposed site plan, you know, it's all vegetated with bigger trees in the corners.

78
00:06:47,458 --> 00:07:03,503
So I think something that we discussed in one of our prior meetings was this building not feeling as well grounded, I think would be a good phrase for it, meaning the back end of it is floating up.

79
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:16,188
And so a couple of solutions that we looked at were essentially to open the model, to use a screen in the back of the

80
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:25,176
building to help ground it, so when I mean screen, we were discussing back here actually using a green screen.

81
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:37,927
Typically everywhere else, I shouldn't say typically everywhere else, we have a six-foot tall wood fence, and then back here would actually be a taller trellis fence that I would feel like would tie well with the vegetation.

82
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:45,714
We looked at potentially having screening on the Park Street side as well.

83
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:47,675
So that would be over here.

84
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:58,424
But we've gotten some feedback from the town members themselves, citizens that they're a little bit worried of the pulling in and out of Park Street.

85
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,987
So if we were to put a fence, essentially,

86
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:14,817
You know, if I was to put a fence down here and if you think about the cars coming in and out of Park Street, I would be afraid that you're going to kind of lose the visibility coming down Park Street.

87
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:21,522
So, for me, I thought the best solution was to actually have that green fence down on this back wall.

88
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:22,563
So that protects.

89
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:32,751
the parking lot down in here and then using this vegetation along the perimeter as the screen for the parking at the ground level.

90
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:41,718
When you're looking down Park Street, essentially, it's all going to be filled in with landscape, but it's not necessarily a solid mass wall at this point.

91
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:52,306
I think the idea that the building being raised off the ground like this, it hits in two ways.

92
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:59,211
I still think maybe there's something that we can do with the structure a little bit more to make it a little bit more ornament or a little bit more heavy.

93
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:10,220
But unfortunately, until I get my structural engineer during the construction documents to help me size these members, I don't want to just make up some tree-oriented,

94
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,121
you know, structural column that in reality isn't going to be anything like that.

95
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,941
It's going to be more of like a two by two.

96
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:27,524
But I think it's a really helpful perspective because I think based on the plans that you had shared, because when we see that that first elevated floor, there's no

97
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,485
There's no like atmospheric element to it.

98
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,227
So we don't realize like where it lines up with the parking below.

99
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,849
So I think that was a misunderstanding on my part.

100
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,313
I had assumed that the back of the building was the back of the parking.

101
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:42,674
Oh, I see.

102
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:43,735
Yeah.

103
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,536
So this is a really helpful perspective.

104
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:47,218
I appreciate you pulling us into the model.

105
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah.

106
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,424
From that side perspective, it, it still feels like it's floating.

107
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,907
Um, and now that I understand that,

108
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,262
the back of the building is not the back of the parking.

109
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:07,407
Previous solutions that I've kind of been thinking about don't work.

110
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,809
So, okay.

111
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,991
Are there any other thoughts by other board members?

112
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,355
Was I the only one that maybe had this one misunderstanding?

113
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:23,018
I did not.

114
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:33,726
quite want to chime in on that but I did want to chime in on the curtain wall in the corner.

115
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:41,010
I do like the new curtain wall treatment, the new corner treatment that's not quite the solid curtain wall.

116
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:52,017
I think that's a while giving a lot of natural light to those units on the corner, I think it's a bit more nuanced of a treatment and I think it's not going to result

117
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:58,145
in as much of the solar glare concerns coming down Salem Street that we were looking at last time.

118
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:58,786
So thank you for that.

119
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:09,592
Thank you for that, Peter.

120
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,093
I appreciate it.

121
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:14,455
Still thinking about this back corner,

122
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,936
Yeah, I don't know.

123
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,242
I mean, Emily, the challenge or board member, excuse me.

124
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,242
The challenge I have is where this facade starts, it comes right into where the spaces are, right?

125
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,622
Parking's already tight.

126
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:42,522
You got it.

127
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:50,324
So I looked at, well, maybe if you took this column and you put it more under here to kind of ground that corner of the building, would that help?

128
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:54,165
But now I'm kind of more in the middle of a parking spot.

129
00:11:54,985 --> 00:12:00,386
So that's why I think maybe there's something that can be done with these columns down the line.

130
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:08,840
to help kind of ground it a little bit more rather if they're like a teed off or just a little bit more masked, that might help.

131
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,982
But, you know, having that wall would be all the way back here.

132
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:21,224
I think I understand where the confusion kind of happened, but in the landscape, I think would do a good job kind of hiding that.

133
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:26,365
But you're the one, you like the five points of architecture, right?

134
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,185
Pilote, ribbon windows.

135
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:28,866
I do, but

136
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:42,750
You know, the application of PLOC is not simply to enable parking.

137
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:53,294
It's to embed like a lightness in the building and the conflict between the massing of the front, which is very, very heavy and settled.

138
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:59,317
And I think aligned with the neighborhood, I think that fits in very well.

139
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:05,024
I appreciate the modern touches you've made to that.

140
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:18,627
The back embodies the lightness, but it's the contrast between the two that I think creates the unease in terms of that back corner.

141
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:24,208
If this whole building was on pillars, I think this would be a different conversation.

142
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:32,308
I'm not suggesting you do that, because I think that the commercial space is a huge asset to this area of Medford.

143
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,911
But yeah, I mean, it's not.

144
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:42,236
Yeah, does that make sense?

145
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:49,281
The conflict between the weight and the lightness is, I think, where this unease.

146
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:51,603
I want to get some other voices in here.

147
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,065
So Sally, do you want to chime in, please?

148
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:04,605
Adding the trellis on the back, I don't think it's the best idea on the long term because then it's maintenance.

149
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:06,965
It may fall apart.

150
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:08,586
I don't think it's the best idea.

151
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:16,688
But maybe try to add the trellis longitudinally from the column towards the edge.

152
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,248
So perpendicular to what you were suggesting.

153
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,529
Or any other element.

154
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,430
It's not necessary to be a trellis.

155
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:38,550
This would create a wall, a vertical wall, which would balance, quote unquote, this lightness that feels unease that Emily is talking about.

156
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:45,132
So maybe going perpendicular to the wall that you were suggesting rather than putting a trellis on the side.

157
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:52,953
Pam?

158
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,946
Oh, you're still on mute.

159
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:01,706
Yeah, I'm glad to see the sun going back to that front corner.

160
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,647
I'm glad to see it's not just all glass.

161
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:05,947
It's not like a whole glass curtain.

162
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:11,448
Yeah, it seems like it would work better for residential use if there's a little more privacy.

163
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:19,390
Yeah, and again, I'm not an architect or trained in any of this, but it looks a little like

164
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,031
Different than the rest of the building.

165
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:36,576
And again, I'm not a trained architect, but if there's a way to pull in some of the elements on the rest of the building, I don't know if it's like that gray siding or even like those more square sort of panels.

166
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,978
It just seems like that's sort of like these white, it looks like more corporate to me.

167
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:44,520
If you were to block off the rest of it, it just sort of looks like a corporate building.

168
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:55,947
If there were a way to kind of soften those white squares and kind of tie in some of the colors or elements from the rest of the building, I think it would look less sort of disjointed to me.

169
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:57,568
Again, sorry if I'm not using

170
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,501
the right words to describe everything.

171
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,563
It was supposed to be the same color.

172
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,383
Yeah.

173
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:03,684
Okay.

174
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:04,304
Sorry.

175
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:06,165
I can try harder.

176
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:06,866
Okay.

177
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:12,530
No, I think even that would help it just less of a separate element that was put on there.

178
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,892
Like in this model.

179
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:15,533
Yeah.

180
00:16:15,553 --> 00:16:15,713
Okay.

181
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,293
I hear you 100%.

182
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:18,015
Thank you.

183
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:22,798
And Pam, you might not be an architect, but that's a very valid, thoughtful comment.

184
00:16:22,878 --> 00:16:24,159
So thank you for speaking up.

185
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,441
And thank you, Sally, for your previous comment.

186
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:27,602
Peter.

187
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:34,039
Uh, yeah, I just have kind of a clarifying question, question for the discussion.

188
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,600
It's kind of, I feel, I feel bad.

189
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,180
I feel like this is the engineer in me.

190
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:46,803
I'm like regarding the back, are we talking about just kind of how it, how it looks and how it feels or is there some functional aspect there?

191
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:51,784
Cause I'm just trying to like separate in my mind what, what we're talking, what the discussion is about.

192
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:58,806
Like, is there, because I don't know, to me in the level of what I need to,

193
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:10,089
pay attention to, is it about there being some problem with the use and occupancy of the building, or is it about how it relates to the rest of the neighborhood?

194
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,970
And I'm just having trouble looking at that.

195
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,950
I would say it's more the latter.

196
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,731
Okay.

197
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,832
Compatibility with size, scale, and design of other structures in the neighborhood.

198
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:20,032
Okay, cool.

199
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:20,432
That's fine.

200
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:28,295
I mean, engineering-wise, I'm assuming the applicant is going to bring in a structural engineer who's going to verify the structural integrity of the building.

201
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,611
So that's not up for discussion at this point.

202
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:32,952
Yeah, that's fair.

203
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:35,854
I was just trying to clarify what discussion was.

204
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:36,594
Yes.

205
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:37,515
Yeah.

206
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:54,567
Yeah, I think Sally could be onto something in terms of rather than looking east-west with that.

207
00:17:56,874 --> 00:18:08,983
screening, maybe it's a north-south, not a full divider as you're showing in your rendering, but maybe it's aligned with the outer edge of the parking space along Park Street.

208
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,544
Yeah.

209
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:20,011
I don't know.

210
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:24,814
I'm actually on the camp of, I very much like the building kind of floating back there.

211
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:31,089
So I have to also wrap my head around a problem to find a good solution.

212
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,770
Sure, and I appreciate that.

213
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:47,237
I think while design is subjective, we are working to make sure that from a size scale design perspective, there is some compatibility with the neighborhood.

214
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:54,681
So that's why we're trying to give you this direct feedback, whether it's

215
00:18:57,218 --> 00:19:05,824
You know, move the screening so it's aligned with the parking markings.

216
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,006
Maybe it's more robust vegetation.

217
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:32,919
I mean, is that something that is going to kind of hold us up?

218
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:49,489
Or is there a way that we can try to get approval in the next meeting, and this is something that we're going to work with in the construction document design development phase of things?

219
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:55,433
Or we need to figure out all this stuff

220
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:02,783
I mean, like you just said, please, I hope you know how much respect I have for all of this.

221
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:05,326
And this project is really important to me and my firm.

222
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:10,433
But it is somewhat subjective, and I just don't want to continue to

223
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,661
to try to find solutions for problems.

224
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,465
When you start adding more things, like all of a sudden we have a wall that's east to west.

225
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:23,187
Well, all of a sudden that's a wind problem now, right?

226
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,889
Because it's just the way that the building fits.

227
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:31,893
And that new wall is going to have a four foot foundation to it because it's 10 feet tall.

228
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:33,734
And I just cost the client $40,000 to build that wall.

229
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,850
feedback like that is really helpful for this group.

230
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:57,123
You know, understanding, because at the end of the day, I think, and I'm not going to speak for the board, but my priority is to increase the number of housing units in Medford, as well as, you know, the amount of viable commercial space.

231
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:04,209
So at the end of the day, I don't think that this is something where we can't come to a path forward.

232
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:16,811
But given our process, this is something that we do have to confirm within this body prior to moving on, because any significant changes would have to come back because of the special permit process.

233
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:24,196
And Danielle, I don't know if this is a good time for you to provide more insight, or maybe you've had your hand up for a while.

234
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:28,358
Thank you, through the chair.

235
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:44,951
When the board approves this, you'll be approving control documents and you can add conditions, but generally you want them to be very specific and it's hard to

236
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:55,943
condition design changes as it's subjective, and sometimes it's not clear what we're looking for.

237
00:21:56,043 --> 00:22:05,689
So I would want pretty complete final elevation drawings to be the control documents.

238
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,473
Different material changes could be de minimis,

239
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:22,474
I think the level of detail that we're looking at is not something that can be could hold off.

240
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:36,378
Some ideas that I had was looking at the Park Street elevation is pulling the sign band, where it says Salem Place.

241
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:38,664
there's no.

242
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:38,724
Um.

243
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:41,665
Bottom band that for treatment could somehow be pulled to the back.

244
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:44,286
It just feels like it kind of just cuts off.

245
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:45,427
Um.

246
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:55,030
And it's just somehow to, like anchor it back there, and I do appreciate seeing the model because when I was looking at it land view, there's no, um.

247
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:11,680
the site plan, so I couldn't see where the building ended and where the parking began, so it wasn't clear.

248
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:18,190
And even looking at the model, it's still not clear, like, what is the landscaped space?

249
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,171
What is the actual

250
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,023
travel path of the car entering and exiting.

251
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:28,107
So that parking space that's in the front, how is that maneuvering out?

252
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,608
Cause that doesn't make any sense to me.

253
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,449
I had thought that that was under the building.

254
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:39,116
If that's not under the building, then that's problematic.

255
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:44,441
Is it aligned under the building or is it actually out closer to the street?

256
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:45,682
I can't tell.

257
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:49,672
Under the under the building.

258
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:55,658
Yeah, it's a line to the corner to the building and then it's maybe a quarter of the way underneath it itself.

259
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,103
So, it is under the building on the.

260
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:05,649
East West side, could you just pivot it again?

261
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,749
Sure.

262
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:18,438
You see how it's hard, from this perspective, it's hard to see that that corner of the building, that it drops down and aligns with that edge of the parking space.

263
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:19,639
Gotcha.

264
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,140
Yeah.

265
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,841
So that's my edge of the building.

266
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:29,247
Okay.

267
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:35,151
Well, that's some good feedback, thinking about wrapping this ribbon and maybe it does come down to have some way.

268
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:36,152
Yeah.

269
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:36,653
I think that

270
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:43,502
I mean, also considering some of the comments you've made in terms of, you know, like how deep does that foundation need to go?

271
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:48,206
You know, at what expense would it be to, you know, this project?

272
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:51,988
Because those are things that, you know, we do need to consider in addition to design.

273
00:24:52,008 --> 00:25:01,034
And, you know, by no means do we want to, you know, burden this project unnecessarily, but I think that could be a reasonable solution.

274
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:06,138
Realizing that we have five minutes left,

275
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:12,508
I want to open this back up to other members of the chair, as well as the applicant, if there's anything else you want to share.

276
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:25,639
All right, seeing none.

277
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:38,838
public comment.

278
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:41,441
Um do you think it makes sense to open it to public comment?

279
00:25:41,461 --> 00:25:44,824
To the chair.

280
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:48,767
I'm not sure if there's anybody here if they have for four minutes.

281
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:52,671
Um yeah, three minutes, but otherwise, um.

282
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:55,753
Any of the public is welcome to email

283
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:05,723
design specific changes.

284
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:08,644
The zoning board did grant the variances for the setback.

285
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:10,685
So we have our envelope that we're working with.

286
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:20,589
So now we're looking at the site plan review criteria, which is the design, which is very much what is under the board's purview.

287
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:22,590
Great.

288
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,321
Can I add one last comment?

289
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:34,186
So we did go through and update the fenestration for Daniels, and I think it looks dynamite.

290
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,148
So I do appreciate that.

291
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:37,909
I think that brought a lot of balance.

292
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:43,994
I just have to make one last argument for keeping this light and airy.

293
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:47,637
And you have the school right around the corner and little kids around.

294
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:57,283
we just want to make sure we have good visibility and a really functional way that people come in and out of this building, deliveries, whatever it might be.

295
00:26:57,303 --> 00:27:02,586
Because this is going to be a busy, with Salem Street, that's going to be busy.

296
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:12,152
I just really want to make sure that we're not detrimentally adding a vertical element here that's going to cause an accident and harm.

297
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,514
I really appreciate that point.

298
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:31,874
How about, since we are going to continue this regardless, at the next meeting, I'd love to see a rendering that reflects those sightlines with, if possible, with streetscape context.

299
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:43,620
So even if it's just a screenshot from Google Maps with a very rudimentary overlay of

300
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:48,612
You're using review for this, though.

301
00:27:48,632 --> 00:28:01,896
Just place the person in the parking spot and then out on the street and show us if that concern is valid, because it may be.

302
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:10,178
And I'd really appreciate some background on that, because I think it is a valid concern.

303
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:13,399
I just want to go from there.

304
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:21,136
Yeah, if you know, something blocking it, and then show something not blocking it.

305
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:23,739
And then we can go from there.

306
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:33,747
I just, I just trying to get Okay, we just really are trying hard not to just continue to kick the can down the road.

307
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:35,368
Yep.

308
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:39,872
You know, one time after another for for my for my clients standpoint.

309
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:40,452
Yep.

310
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:41,333
And I appreciate that.

311
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,275
And I would say work, you know, hand in hand with city staff.

312
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,002
And Danielle, if there's any interim discussions that need to happen, let us know.

313
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:51,343
Peter?

314
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:54,145
You're on mute.

315
00:28:56,286 --> 00:29:01,389
Just doing my clerk job and reminding us that we need to move on in like a minute.

316
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,270
Yeah.

317
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:10,415
So realizing that, can I get a motion to continue to a date certain, which I believe is May 1?

318
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:14,598
May 1 without prejudice?

319
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,193
Can I have a second?

320
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:20,494
Second.

321
00:29:20,514 --> 00:29:22,156
Okay, thank you.

322
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,098
And then I would like to recognize the applicant.

323
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:28,360
Just for one last comment, it seems like.

324
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,220
Thank you.

325
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:34,204
Just to be clear, this is the only thing that I'm going back to the drawing board for is this corner.

326
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:39,588
We're okay with the other corner facade for now and some other things.

327
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:41,189
Is that right?

328
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:42,730
Just studying this?

329
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:53,750
I can talk to you offline about all that too, and be in communication with the chair as well.

330
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,670
Right, good.

331
00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:56,532
Thank you guys so much for your time tonight.

332
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,574
Thank you, we appreciate your work on this.

333
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:06,460
You had a motion to call vote, you didn't vote.

334
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:07,801
Oh shoot, we didn't vote.

335
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:09,563
Shit.

336
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:14,627
Pam left, are we...

337
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,020
just vote.

338
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:17,980
Okay.

339
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:21,322
Um, I don't think you have to be a member.

340
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:23,822
You didn't have to be a member to continue.

341
00:30:24,203 --> 00:30:25,243
You have to be a member.

342
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:37,107
You have to be voting eligible to, uh, approve the case, but to continue a case, you don't have to have quorum and you don't have to be eligible otherwise to vote on the case.

343
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:38,227
Okay, good.

344
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:38,707
Okay.

345
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,808
So let's vote to continue it.

346
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:43,709
And we have, uh, Sherrod on the line.

347
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:44,649
Sherrod is here now.

348
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,430
Yes.

349
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,410
Okay.

350
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,821
So we're going to do a roll call vote.

351
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:50,801
Jackie McPherson.

352
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:53,362
Peter Calves.

353
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:55,342
Yes.

354
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:56,923
Ari Fishman.

355
00:30:57,663 --> 00:30:57,943
Yes.

356
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,184
Pam Mariansky.

357
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:03,385
Sally Akiki.

358
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:04,905
Yes.

359
00:31:06,206 --> 00:31:07,846
Sharad Bhadracharya.

360
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:08,806
Yes.

361
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:11,227
And myself, Emily Hedeman is a yes.

362
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,188
Thank you for waiting for us to make it official.

363
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:17,378
Thank you, guys.

364
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:18,859
We'll see you in a couple weeks.

365
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,260
Have a nice evening.

366
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:26,746
Thanks, Alicia.

367
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:27,406
Appreciate that.

368
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:30,089
All right.

369
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:36,474
So the next item on our agenda is the proposed new South Street local historic district.

370
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:39,237
I'd like to ask the staff to make introductory comments.

371
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:42,002
Yes.

372
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:48,585
Um, so I received a request from Chair Bader, who is on the call.

373
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:55,828
The Local Historic Commission, is it the Medford Local, now I'm messing it up.

374
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,202
It's a local district historic district commission.

375
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,682
Yes.

376
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,965
They're interested in creating a new local historic district on South Street.

377
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:25,097
And one of the steps under state law to create a new local historic district is they prepare the study and I'll let Mr. Bader go into it into more detail, but this is before you to make a recommendation to city council.

378
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:26,447
Correct.

379
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,172
And I have a presentation if that's appropriate.

380
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,354
That would be great.

381
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,296
I'll make you a co-host.

382
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,378
Can I share my screen?

383
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,121
You should be able to now.

384
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:44,125
Oh.

385
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:52,924
Anyway, sorry.

386
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,304
So share screen, yes.

387
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:58,165
Sorry.

388
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,526
I haven't given a presentation in some time.

389
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:04,326
Oops.

390
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:06,067
Just a minute, please.

391
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:13,028
Oh.

392
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:17,069
OK.

393
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,301
Can you see my screen?

394
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:26,524
Yes.

395
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:28,365
OK.

396
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:39,835
So here is, let's see, slideshow.

397
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:41,897
Here we go.

398
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:44,899
OK, play from start.

399
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:45,259
OK.

400
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,901
Can you see my screen now?

401
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:47,601
Yes.

402
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:48,382
Still see my screen?

403
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:49,603
For both South Beach District?

404
00:33:52,968 --> 00:34:08,799
Okay, so the Historic District Commission, there are two historic districts in Medford, one the Simon's Historic District on High Street, and the other, the

405
00:34:10,566 --> 00:34:14,687
Hilltop, it's historic district behind the library.

406
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:19,449
These were created in 1985, and there have been no historic districts created since then.

407
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:32,094
Now, there's a big problem there, because there are a lot of historic buildings in South Street that go back before the Civil War, and they need to be protected, and they're very...

408
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:43,276
We've gone through the entire process with the Mass Historical Commission, with public hearings, and so on.

409
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:48,738
And I just want to run through my presentation at the hearings here tonight.

410
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:52,659
So this is what South Street looked like in 1880.

411
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:57,040
You can see that grandfather's house is there.

412
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,541
That 21 Touro that there was a lot of discussion on about 10 years ago is right there.

413
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,704
There are a whole bunch of houses, uh, starting here, running down through here, all, all pre civil war.

414
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,586
These are all going to be in the new historic district.

415
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:27,373
Um, there are, um, this house here, which appears to be on Manning street, but actually has a Walnut street address.

416
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:31,396
And then there are a couple of buildings on the other side of South street that we want to protect.

417
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:33,797
Uh, I think there's 31 and this one here is 23.

418
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,872
Anyway, let me go through the buildings very quickly.

419
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:43,174
As I said, we targeted pre-Civil War buildings.

420
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,995
There are Victorian buildings in this area.

421
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:55,860
There are actually probably at least 20 of them, but we didn't target Victorian in this particular round of the South Street Historic District.

422
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:04,764
It could be expanded later, but we're focusing on pre-Civil War buildings for this particular iteration of the Historic District.

423
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:11,235
So this is a house built in 1845 by a sea captain.

424
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:26,019
In the slides that follow, an asterisk will reflect houses that are associated with Medford's historic shipbuilding history.

425
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:26,899
23 South Street.

426
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,040
We can talk about this a little later.

427
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,061
The developer who owns this building has a few concerns.

428
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:44,995
Another very early house, the Manning Foster house, the Luther Turner house.

429
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:50,480
Mr. Turner was also, I believe, associated within the shipbuilding industry.

430
00:36:52,382 --> 00:37:00,629
A somewhat later house, but also a beautiful one, right on South Street.

431
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:04,232
An 1851 house, again, in that same block of South Street.

432
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:19,105
54 South Street, now you may be familiar with the 54 South Street in that there was a lot of, a developer bought the entire property and wants to, and probably is, building a second building right next to it.

433
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,385
There was a lot of discussion about that.

434
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:29,127
This would put both of those, put the entire lot under Historic District Commission control.

435
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:33,828
16th South Street, another beautiful building, a little later, 1912.

436
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,734
Another pre-Civil War building.

437
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:45,358
It's, you know, it's kind of altered a lot, but it's in the same block, so I think it's important.

438
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:49,900
It is in a historic building and it is in the same block, so I think it's important to include it.

439
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,923
The, an 1840 building that, where the,

440
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:02,419
It was built by someone with the last name of James.

441
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,263
A person named John Chardy, who was an American poet of the 20th century, also grew up there.

442
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:17,868
Again, as someone associated with the shipbuilding industry, 1822, a quite early building.

443
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:22,290
And 114, of course, grandfather's house.

444
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:29,690
Then on Toro Ave, we have 11 Toro that was built in 1840.

445
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:32,174
It doesn't look like much, but it was built in 1840.

446
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:37,982
Okay, this is the house that there was much

447
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,983
It was much to do about 10 years ago.

448
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:48,869
Tufts University owned it for years, as they did the grandfather's house.

449
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:55,836
They wanted to develop the entire lot, and the community rose up against that.

450
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:01,822
And this would protect that lot and this house indefinitely.

451
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:08,866
Let's see, this is the oldest house in the district, on Walnut Street.

452
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:16,192
Mr. Bradbury was also associated with the strip building industry.

453
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:18,914
Another very old house.

454
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:21,256
Oh, 15 Walnut, right.

455
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:32,505
This house is really on Manning Street, but it somehow, for some reason, has the address of, I worried about this for quite a while, while I was preparing for this meeting.

456
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,837
15 Walnut is the actual address of this house.

457
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:45,961
Okay, so taking all that together, we have proposed a historic district that includes all the buildings that I just showed you.

458
00:39:46,941 --> 00:40:00,387
It starts at Grandfather's House, runs down South Street, jogs up a little bit on Touro Ave to include 21 Touro, which is the house I was talking about, runs all the way down South Street,

459
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:04,410
And it has this beautiful block right here.

460
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,692
This is like one of the gems of Medford is this block right here.

461
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:23,325
And this is the lot that was acquired by the developer that's been in front of the Historical Commission and the Zoning Board for months or possibly even years.

462
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,228
All this will be protected.

463
00:40:29,233 --> 00:40:34,755
And as I say, 23, a developer has some concerns, but it's a very, very old house.

464
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:37,356
31 is also an old house.

465
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:42,558
And that is the extent of the proposed historic district.

466
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:55,422
I should mention that in one of the hearings, the owner of this little house right here, six to eight men, expressed concern and said, why is my house going into the historic district?

467
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:57,863
And well, it was for real, sorry,

468
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:11,234
It was for reasons of continuity, but the owner said quite correctly, well, this is just a generic 20th century triple-decker.

469
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:15,375
Why does it have to be in a historic district?

470
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,736
And the commission agreed.

471
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:21,977
We modified the maps to exclude this building.

472
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:26,779
Oops, I keep doing that.

473
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:37,244
Uh, and, uh, and so this little, I think we tried to be responsive to, to, uh, to residents concerns.

474
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:43,065
Now, uh, again, uh, this is what South street looked like in 1880.

475
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:50,967
Uh, you can see, as I mentioned, you can see a grandfather's house all the way down and, um,

476
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:57,033
So let's just have a look at what does Mass General Laws 40C require?

477
00:41:57,573 --> 00:42:02,934
Well, first of all, the Historic District Commission itself has to initiate the process.

478
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,675
We did that in late 2022.

479
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:10,076
We have to submit a preliminary report to the Mass Historical Commission.

480
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:12,416
We did that in July of last year.

481
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:16,177
We have to get approval by the Mass Historical Commission.

482
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:20,818
There was actually a quite lengthy hearing, and they approved it unanimously.

483
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:23,283
Then we held public hearings.

484
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:28,124
Normally there's only one public hearing, but we held two because of certain concerns.

485
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:32,886
And as I say, on the basis of those hearings, we did remove one house.

486
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:37,267
And then consultation with the Community Development Board, that's you.

487
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:41,148
Then we follow up with vote of City Council.

488
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,789
It has to be approved by a two-thirds vote of City Council.

489
00:42:46,162 --> 00:42:51,825
And finally, the city bylaws would be revised with the approval of the Attorney General.

490
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:56,967
So, what does it mean to be an historic district?

491
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:07,491
Well, first of all, the design, any design, okay, so I should start out by saying that we don't, everything is grandfathered.

492
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:12,314
In your house, we don't require anyone to change anything about any house.

493
00:43:13,954 --> 00:43:15,335
We only govern the,

494
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,963
the historic district commission only has control over changes.

495
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:29,828
Now as to changes in an existing building or construction of a new building, design is one of the most important considerations.

496
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:37,992
The design of an addition or a change to a house has to be in keeping with the historic nature of the house.

497
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:45,377
In the case of a new building, such as the one being built on 54 South Street, it has to be

498
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:49,659
in keeping with the historic character of the neighborhood.

499
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:58,360
That does not mean that it has to be, if you will, a Victorian design.

500
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:03,862
I think a lot of you seem to be very knowledgeable architecturally.

501
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:09,903
It merely has to be harmonious with the buildings that are already there.

502
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:15,724
My favorite example of this is the public library in Arlington.

503
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:17,460
Where a new.

504
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:32,586
a new wing, basically the size of the old, the entire old building was attached to a Victorian, a modern wing was attached to a Victorian house, to a Victorian building, and I think very successfully.

505
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:39,508
That's the kind of thing we're looking for, for a new, any new construction.

506
00:44:39,588 --> 00:44:46,490
It's not necessarily Victorian design, although that would be fine, but simply something that is compatible with the

507
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:50,586
the Victorian nature of the neighborhood.

508
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:54,229
Then we're also, wait a second, come on.

509
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,492
We're also looking for materials.

510
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:03,096
Materials have to be in keeping with the existing house, except for practical reasons.

511
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:15,567
For example, it is not really practical, for example, to require window sills to be made out of wood.

512
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:21,770
That means if you do that, you really have to replace them every 10 to 20 years.

513
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:23,691
People don't want to do that.

514
00:45:23,992 --> 00:45:29,416
They want to put in a artificial material that looks as much as possible like wood.

515
00:45:30,216 --> 00:45:31,157
That's actually fine.

516
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:41,985
Similarly with parts of the building that touch the ground, we do allow artificial materials that resemble the original materials.

517
00:45:42,785 --> 00:45:46,228
So there's no absolute prohibition on any material.

518
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:52,290
And we work very hard with residents to make sure their needs are met.

519
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,632
Oh, okay, so I should say that's it.

520
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:01,173
Everything else on the website is website only.

521
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:05,274
Everything is considered in account a case-by-case basis.

522
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:09,156
There are no absolute prohibitions of anything.

523
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:15,998
We've never approved the demolition of a house, but there's nothing that would prevent us from doing so.

524
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,222
Okay, one more.

525
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:24,863
Okay, how are historic districts administered?

526
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:28,965
Well, with the historic commission, we're all volunteers.

527
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:42,911
The way we control what happens in the district is that if you want to make a change, if you want to get a building permit anywhere in the district, no matter what you want to do, it has to go through us.

528
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:46,353
And we have to issue a certificate of appropriateness

529
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,075
for you to even get a building permit.

530
00:46:55,037 --> 00:47:06,943
The commission meets once a month and sometimes the residents or developers want a quicker meeting.

531
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:11,386
We do everything possible to accommodate that kind of request.

532
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,931
Uh, we've sometimes had somebody say, you know, I can't wait a month.

533
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:16,572
I want, I want this happen next week.

534
00:47:16,953 --> 00:47:19,694
We have gone ahead and scheduled a meeting, uh, the following week.

535
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:25,937
Um, as I say, we can't be totally flexible because we're all volunteers, but we do our best.

536
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:33,501
And, uh, we have actually never said no to anyone, not while I've been in the 10 years that I've been chair.

537
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:34,682
Um,

538
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:43,697
We try to work with people and we come up with solutions that work either for the developer or for the homeowner.

539
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:47,678
That's it.

540
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:52,960
Okay, questions, comments?

541
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:59,381
I do have one question to kick us off.

542
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:04,003
I do appreciate you going into detail about the little

543
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:10,689
little tooth cut out on Manning Street, the building that was removed from the district.

544
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,109
Yep.

545
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:18,532
Have you done a comprehensive analysis of every building in this district to confirm?

546
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:18,612
Yes.

547
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:19,472
OK.

548
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:21,773
Yes, there are.

549
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:27,975
The Massachusetts Historical Commission maintains an inventory of what are called Form Bs.

550
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:30,256
Form B is a building is a

551
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,272
It's typically a 10 to 20 page document describing a historic building.

552
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:41,473
There are Form Bs for every building in the proposed historic district.

553
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:43,034
OK.

554
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,955
When we started out, there were three buildings that did not have Form Bs.

555
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:48,216
We commissioned them.

556
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:51,497
Those Form Bs are now available.

557
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,898
And yes, we have analyses.

558
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:59,020
And we can make every Form B available to the board if you wish.

559
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:00,001
OK.

560
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:11,846
And then apologies if you if you covered this and I missed it, but how what's the what was like the the owner notification process that.

561
00:49:11,966 --> 00:49:12,427
Oh, sure.

562
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:14,387
Well, that's specified in the statute.

563
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:21,430
There needs to be 14 days written notice by US, you know, US mail.

564
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:24,852
And so we set out

565
00:49:29,527 --> 00:49:33,070
We had two hearings, both of them had a 14 day notice.

566
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:38,095
And, you know, what was attendance like for those hearings?

567
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:47,103
We had probably, probably 20 at each 20 people at each hearing.

568
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:52,708
So including so a significant portion of the residents, and

569
00:49:53,981 --> 00:50:00,463
and a certain number of butters or just concerned residents of Medford.

570
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:11,646
And I should say that approval was really overwhelmingly positive.

571
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:13,046
Most people thought this was fine.

572
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,044
Um, a few people have expressed concerns.

573
00:50:16,984 --> 00:50:18,966
Uh, I talked about six to eight Manning.

574
00:50:18,986 --> 00:50:27,231
That's the one we carved out and the developer of 23, um, also expressed concerns, uh, because you know, he's a developer.

575
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:28,372
He wants to be able to do what he wants.

576
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,975
Uh, and I, and I said, look, we, we've worked with developers.

577
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,497
I've been on this commission for 20 years.

578
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:36,018
We work with developers.

579
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:38,680
We, we, we find solutions.

580
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,461
We're not, you know, it's, it's.

581
00:50:43,078 --> 00:50:51,104
It's literally true that we've never said no to anyone, but the fact that we could say no kind of motivates them to work with us.

582
00:50:51,664 --> 00:51:09,537
And we found solutions for every developer, particularly a good example of a solution where we spent months, literally months, probably five, four or five meetings working with a single developer on a single building with seven hillside.

583
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:12,259
It's the building behind the library.

584
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:21,384
He wanted the developer who took a gigantic Victorian house and wanted to make it even bigger and convert it into condominiums.

585
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,007
And, you know, it was a very successful project.

586
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:30,533
And I think a good example of how we can work with developers if they're motivated to work with us.

587
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:32,455
Great.

588
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:38,080
I'd like to open this up to any comments from the board.

589
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:43,087
I have a question if I may.

590
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:44,387
Sure, Ali.

591
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:52,249
So Mr. Bader, how does this overlay with the zoning and the area because you're providing a lot of flexibility.

592
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:53,309
Yes.

593
00:51:54,089 --> 00:52:01,550
And thus we're losing somehow the benefits of having a historic district with all this flexibility.

594
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:08,972
Well, we don't, we, the developer has to, we have no, the

595
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:21,163
Our controls are, first of all, our controls are totally laid on top of the controls of the zoning board.

596
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:30,285
And anything that requires zoning, we don't have the power to grant a zoning variance.

597
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,586
You have to go to the zoning board for that.

598
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:38,008
If you want to do something that either the zoning board approves or is already

599
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:46,889
allowed by the existing zoning, then you come to us and we decide whether the design of materials are appropriate.

600
00:52:49,855 --> 00:52:50,657
Does that answer your question?

601
00:52:51,818 --> 00:53:00,139
Yeah, partially, because the zoning, I believe, in this area, for instance, doesn't really allow for, let's say, three-story building.

602
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:01,120
I don't believe so.

603
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,800
Alicia and Daniel, please correct me if I'm wrong.

604
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,841
So I'm trying to understand, then, what is the added value of this?

605
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:20,103
Oh, the added value is that the historic character of the neighborhood is preserved.

606
00:53:21,294 --> 00:53:23,516
Um, you know, you don't have to do that.

607
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:31,543
You can build, you know, a totally modern ugly brick apartment building on any, on, on most of these lots.

608
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:43,993
And there would be enough if they were, if the zoning board approved it, or if it was already conforming to existing zoning, they'd go ahead and demolish the building and build and build something hideous.

609
00:53:45,775 --> 00:53:47,236
Uh, residents don't want that.

610
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:52,736
that is most residents of the district and actually of others and residents of Medford generally.

611
00:53:54,917 --> 00:54:12,886
Just to clarify, you know, it might be hideous or, you know, abhorrent from a design perspective, but I think maybe the thing to focus on is that by adopting this historic district, it would preserve the neighborhood.

612
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,821
the specific elements of the neighborhood that have been identified.

613
00:54:19,442 --> 00:54:19,602
Yes.

614
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:22,823
You know, preserving neighborhood character can sometimes get into touchy territory.

615
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:23,744
Yes.

616
00:54:23,904 --> 00:54:27,205
You know, in terms of, you know, equity.

617
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:30,407
So I think that's definitely something for us to be mindful of.

618
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:35,609
That being said, this is largely already a residential neighborhood.

619
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,551
So, you know, I'm okay with that.

620
00:54:40,872 --> 00:54:44,193
But, you know, I recognize that Alicia had her hand raised.

621
00:54:45,214 --> 00:54:45,914
I'm assuming it's

622
00:54:46,193 --> 00:54:47,574
It's related to Sally's comments.

623
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:49,315
I wanna pass it over to you.

624
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:51,456
Thank you, Madam Chair.

625
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:55,819
I mostly wanted to provide like a technical clarification on it.

626
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:00,622
Zoning tends to talk about the dimensions, right?

627
00:55:00,662 --> 00:55:13,569
The setbacks, the heights, the widths, and the historic district talks about the materials of the building, the colors and the materials of it, and that the zoning

628
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,492
would never talk about what is your building made out of?

629
00:55:18,153 --> 00:55:19,534
What are the materials it's using?

630
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:30,322
That is something you do in site plan review, but not in zoning, especially not in a residential district where we're allowing single family homes.

631
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:41,952
We would never be talking about, the zoning board would never speak to what does the building really look like that's actually not truly in their purview.

632
00:55:42,852 --> 00:55:45,554
unless they're going from that.

633
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:49,816
Some of the requests that comes in is two and a half stories versus three stories.

634
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,817
And that affects the look of things.

635
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:56,339
And that, I could imagine, might kind of be the one place where it crosses a little with the historical.

636
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:56,559
Yes.

637
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:07,585
Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say, is that massing can become a design issue, can become a design question, and is therefore under our jurisdiction.

638
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:11,607
If the massing is inappropriate for the neighborhood,

639
00:56:12,442 --> 00:56:14,063
That's a concern for us.

640
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:20,968
Just in order to close basically what I've just started basically.

641
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:25,110
I am with having this as a historic district.

642
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,753
I live at South Street and this is what I enjoy about South Street.

643
00:56:31,515 --> 00:56:34,557
On the contrary, I'm concerned with this flexibility.

644
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,202
that we are having, like is it too flexible?

645
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:52,267
So maybe based on your experience, Mr. Bedder, you can just give me an example where we were not too flexible or we were able to achieve what is best for the neighborhood.

646
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:57,309
Like for instance, one of the buildings right across my street, they've already added a floor.

647
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:00,751
Let me pull up from your slide basically the name of the building.

648
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:01,591
Sure.

649
00:57:03,072 --> 00:57:03,692
What's the address?

650
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:05,948
It's 31 South Street.

651
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:09,250
They've already started construction and they've added a floor.

652
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:10,911
Yeah.

653
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:11,691
Sorry.

654
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:13,292
31 South Street.

655
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:13,292
31?

656
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:13,632
31, yeah.

657
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:32,000
So for instance, in this case, how we could have made things different in order to preserve the aspect, even though they did a nice job, honestly, but.

658
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:45,092
Yeah, well, we would have to, we typically have an architect on the commission, and he or she will typically evaluate

659
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:51,612
better than a layman can, what the massing, how the massing will affect the general look of the neighborhood.

660
00:57:53,133 --> 00:58:07,480
If the massing is appropriate for the historic area, that is, basically in layman's terms, and I'm a layman, if it were something that could have been built at the period that the original house was built.

661
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:13,743
So would, could this house have been built with three stories?

662
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:24,941
Probably not, but would, is it really going to alter the look of the neighborhood?

663
00:58:26,022 --> 00:58:27,403
You know, that would be a judgment call.

664
00:58:30,926 --> 00:58:41,734
I wouldn't be concerned about the, you know, we try to, we want to preserve the nature of the house and the nature of the neighborhood.

665
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:53,886
That doesn't mean that we are against development because the last people who would be opposed to development are the Victorians themselves, right?

666
00:58:55,647 --> 00:59:03,313
And we want to recognize that and to have a... We're not creating a museum.

667
00:59:04,434 --> 00:59:10,919
We are preserving the historic nature of the neighborhood and we're allowing it to grow organically.

668
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:12,140
I think that's the best way to put it.

669
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:22,017
Chairperson Bader, would it be fair to say that the flexibility you're alluding to does not extend beyond what zoning allows?

670
00:59:22,257 --> 00:59:31,584
It just means that you're not going to unnecessarily withhold permission to do work?

671
00:59:32,805 --> 00:59:36,768
Well, we have only two criteria.

672
00:59:36,788 --> 00:59:38,809
We have design and materials.

673
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,732
If the design and materials are correct,

674
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:43,595
It's okay with us.

675
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:44,615
Anything else?

676
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:46,776
If you want a zoning variation, you go to the zoning board.

677
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:46,856
Yes.

678
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:50,397
Does that answer your question?

679
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:54,858
The answer is mine.

680
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,018
Thank you.

681
00:59:56,138 --> 00:59:57,979
Awesome.

682
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,599
Peter, I see that you have your hand up.

683
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,740
Yes, thank you.

684
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,201
I just wanted to voice my appreciation at the

685
01:00:11,678 --> 01:00:24,721
I guess, to use a word from the Historical District Commission's own processes, the appropriateness of this district.

686
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:36,803
I, like Emily alluded to, run in a lot of the times, have concerns about preserving neighborhood characters, just running into

687
01:00:37,828 --> 01:00:45,750
running into equity issues and housing supply issues, but this looks like it was done very, very conscientiously, and I appreciate that.

688
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,830
Well, thank you.

689
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:54,372
Sharad, I see your hand going up and down, so I want to make sure to give you some space to contribute.

690
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:55,992
I had a question.

691
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,112
Yeah.

692
01:00:57,492 --> 01:01:04,814
My question is, Bill, why do we need another historic district to begin with, and why can't we just go

693
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:08,901
property by property, like one by one houses only.

694
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:17,407
I think it's a big chunk of the neighborhood that's taking up the historic commission, and there are a couple of exclusions there.

695
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:22,930
So if you want to make a historic district, have no exclusion of the entire neighborhood.

696
01:01:23,731 --> 01:01:34,358
Or if you're going to have exclusions, just focus on the few houses which we do have information of the historic nature, like going through all of the slides, you had a few information of the

697
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:39,041
a grandfather house, a sea captain's house, and a few.

698
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:42,403
And a few didn't have a lot of historic information.

699
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:47,005
So why are we even considering them to be part of the historic commission?

700
01:01:47,045 --> 01:01:53,388
So my thinking is we can choose one by one houses and not have an entire district.

701
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:58,611
The Massachusetts Historic Commission strongly frowns on that.

702
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:02,093
Can you give us some of our background into why?

703
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:07,793
Yes, they want to preserve neighborhoods, not single buildings.

704
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:26,136
So the only way they would approve a single building is if there is a single, there's sort of an island of history that is in the middle of a bunch of houses that are totally unrelated.

705
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:32,717
So for example, if everything on South Street except grandfather's house

706
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:38,830
And say 21 Turrell, which is another beautiful historic house.

707
01:02:40,352 --> 01:02:43,356
If all those buildings had been demolished and replaced with, you know, 50s ranch houses,

708
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:55,918
We would certainly go after 21 Toro and Grandfather's House as single house historic districts.

709
01:02:56,378 --> 01:03:01,039
And the Mass Historical Commission permits that.

710
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:11,082
But in the case of where there is actually a historic neighborhood in place, they want the historic district to actually be as inclusive as possible.

711
01:03:12,642 --> 01:03:16,624
I also have a point of inquiry, maybe.

712
01:03:16,704 --> 01:03:17,144
I guess it is.

713
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:24,270
Sure, I think you brought up a good point, which Trevors and Bader may be able to clarify.

714
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:32,474
So you have this collection of slides, most of which have an address, sometimes there's a name for the house and a year and a photo.

715
01:03:34,115 --> 01:03:43,500
If there's not historical information featured on the slide, does that mean that there's no historical information available for that property?

716
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,170
You had mentioned.

717
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,771
Well, there are four Bs for all 17 properties.

718
01:03:50,272 --> 01:03:55,293
There are 17 properties in this district, proposed district, and they all have four Bs.

719
01:03:55,633 --> 01:04:04,656
A four B is a document of 10 to 20 pages listing all the owners of the house and little bits of biographical information about each owner.

720
01:04:04,676 --> 01:04:07,557
It also discusses the architectural

721
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:23,944
design of the original house, then the history of the architectural changes as far as we know, and a general recommendation of whether this house preserves its historic nature or not.

722
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:26,065
So it might be fair to say that the

723
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:29,686
The information presented on the slides is just a brief excerpt.

724
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:30,627
Oh, god, yes.

725
01:04:30,727 --> 01:04:31,347
Significant.

726
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,369
This is one picture and one name and one address.

727
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,049
OK.

728
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:39,331
There's, as I say, 10 to 20 pages available about each house.

729
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:46,634
A lot of them are available on a database that's run through the Mass Historical Commission.

730
01:04:47,315 --> 01:04:49,796
And for any that are not there, I'm happy to send them to you.

731
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:51,477
OK.

732
01:04:52,437 --> 01:04:54,418
Danielle, I see your hand is raised.

733
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:02,566
Yeah, and there was the 32-page report that outlines these as well.

734
01:05:04,147 --> 01:05:07,750
Macris.net, you can always look up your house.

735
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,433
My last house had a Form B on it.

736
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:12,094
It was really interesting to learn about.

737
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:16,839
It wasn't in a local school district, but it had a Form B, which I thought was nice.

738
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,340
What's it called?

739
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,042
Macris, M-A-C-R-I-S.net?

740
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:21,803
Yes.

741
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:22,544
Nice.

742
01:05:23,328 --> 01:05:26,189
And the entire city is not inventoried.

743
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:32,991
So I noticed that Ryan Hayward from the Medford Historical Commission is also on the call.

744
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:42,613
Their commission is methodically going through and trying to get the entire city inventoried.

745
01:05:43,433 --> 01:05:48,815
But there's funding necessary for that, because you hire someone to do it.

746
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:59,351
Yes, and we that is the Historic District Commission are the beneficiaries of that.

747
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:06,636
Most of these buildings already had Form Bs.

748
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:09,358
We only had to commission three out of the 17 buildings.

749
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,824
So we're grateful to the Mass Historical Commission for commissioning those Form Bs.

750
01:06:18,345 --> 01:06:18,485
Great.

751
01:06:21,462 --> 01:06:25,363
Alicia, I just got the right URL.

752
01:06:25,403 --> 01:06:26,463
I can drop that in the chat.

753
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:27,324
Sure.

754
01:06:32,265 --> 01:06:35,006
The mhc.neededtogo before it.

755
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:37,467
The joys of Google.

756
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:38,647
OK, cool.

757
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:39,987
I always Google it, I feel like.

758
01:06:40,027 --> 01:06:41,668
Or I have a Google Arts.

759
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:43,268
I love it.

760
01:06:44,148 --> 01:06:48,530
Oh, and through the chair, I originally had my hand up because I wanted to speak to the zoning.

761
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:48,590
OK.

762
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,652
general residential and apartment one, which actually does allow for a great deal of density.

763
01:06:56,093 --> 01:06:58,118
So there's nothing that would preclude

764
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:10,756
to have some density condos, apartments within a form of a building that could look more in keeping with the times.

765
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:17,000
It would be how does it present where door placements are and things like that.

766
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,841
So it can be done sensitively.

767
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:28,386
And it wouldn't be in conflict with our goals for housing production.

768
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:29,547
Exactly.

769
01:07:30,335 --> 01:07:31,395
That's a helpful clarification.

770
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:32,095
Thank you, Danielle.

771
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:32,796
Yeah, yeah.

772
01:07:33,736 --> 01:07:45,619
As I say, you know, we have most of the meetings that we we have as a at the commission are people who want to build additions to their houses and be able to house more people.

773
01:07:45,879 --> 01:07:51,001
And I understand that, you know, that is one of the goals of one of your this board.

774
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:58,923
And there's absolutely nothing that well, not absolutely nothing it has to be done and compete in in

775
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:04,407
keeping with the character of the neighborhood and the buildings.

776
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:16,777
But really, there's absolutely nothing stopping people from building additions to their houses that could even be bigger than the house itself.

777
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:22,202
As long as it is in coordination with zoning as well.

778
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:24,764
In coordination with zoning.

779
01:08:25,244 --> 01:08:27,446
And I should point out, by the way, that the most

780
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:32,611
most famous house in this, uh, what'd I do with it?

781
01:08:33,391 --> 01:08:42,354
Uh, the most famous house in this district, uh, grandfather's house is actually a good example of this.

782
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:46,735
The original house is this thing right here, uh, in the back.

783
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:53,317
This, this thing here is actually an addition that dwarfs the original house.

784
01:08:54,357 --> 01:08:54,457
Um,

785
01:08:55,379 --> 01:08:59,682
And no, I mean, the Victorians would do that.

786
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:10,650
And that is exactly the kind of thing we would allow if it's historically, if it's appropriate with design and materials.

787
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,351
That's fascinating.

788
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:13,251
Thank you for sharing that.

789
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:17,794
I feel like I need to take a long walk along South Street.

790
01:09:19,436 --> 01:09:22,798
Yeah, the house in the back is probably the one that's referred to in the poll.

791
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:25,274
That's very cool.

792
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:29,556
I want to make sure that we're capturing all board comments.

793
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:32,818
Give another opportunity for hands.

794
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:38,741
Otherwise, I am looking for a motion to recommend or not recommend approval.

795
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:42,763
You should probably, pardon, you should probably open for public comment.

796
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:43,863
Oh, okay.

797
01:09:44,103 --> 01:09:45,004
I did not see.

798
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:46,324
But it would be appropriate.

799
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:50,246
Okay, I do not see that in my chair notes, but that is a good correction.

800
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:53,488
At this time, I'd like to open to public comment.

801
01:09:56,891 --> 01:10:01,792
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

802
01:10:02,813 --> 01:10:07,374
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

803
01:10:08,195 --> 01:10:15,657
As a reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments if that is unfortunately not part of the public record.

804
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:24,360
However, if you're having audio or other technical issues, you can enter that into the chat to just give me and staff a heads up.

805
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,069
And we'll go from there.

806
01:10:28,111 --> 01:10:32,696
Danielle, have you received any previously sent emails or letters?

807
01:10:34,675 --> 01:10:36,436
Um, no, I have not.

808
01:10:36,516 --> 01:10:42,900
And it's not a public hearing, so it's not, you're not compelled to open public comment, but of course you can receive public comment.

809
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:54,668
The public hearings are held, but I have not received anything except from the, except from member Hayward of the Medicare Soul Commission who supports this.

810
01:11:01,773 --> 01:11:03,614
I do not see any hands raised.

811
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,742
So at this point, I'm going to close the public comment.

812
01:11:11,945 --> 01:11:16,308
Offer it up one more time to the board for any comments or feedback or questions.

813
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:26,294
If none, I'm going to look for a motion to recommend approval or to not recommend approval.

814
01:11:29,136 --> 01:11:30,937
I set a motion for approval.

815
01:11:32,438 --> 01:11:33,439
Do I see a second?

816
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:34,700
I, Peter, second.

817
01:11:35,757 --> 01:11:36,057
Awesome.

818
01:11:36,517 --> 01:11:36,997
Thanks, Peter.

819
01:11:37,558 --> 01:11:46,941
And because this is a remote meeting, I'm going to do roll call vote.

820
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:49,182
Jackie McPherson.

821
01:11:51,383 --> 01:11:52,043

822
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:53,304

829
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:07,227
I abstain, please.

830
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:11,228
And myself, Emily Hedeman, is a yes.

831
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:18,251
Can someone remind me who seconded the motion?

832
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:19,691
Peter did.

833
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:20,471
OK.

834
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:23,652
Sorry, I don't have Clem here to take notes.

835
01:12:23,692 --> 01:12:26,633
That was good to ask questions.

836
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:33,355
Well, Chairperson Bader, thank you so much for coming and presenting about the historic district.

837
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:35,667
So the motion passes?

838
01:12:35,747 --> 01:12:36,328
Is that right?

839
01:12:36,908 --> 01:12:38,610
The motion passes, yes.

840
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:44,695
Best of luck as you move this forward, the work that you and the commission do.

841
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:45,816
Thank you.

842
01:12:46,316 --> 01:12:51,020
And thank you for listening, and thank you for giving us our approval, and we will move forward.

843
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:59,267
And we will have a meeting with the city council as soon as possible.

844
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:01,455
And I encourage everyone to attend.

845
01:13:01,495 --> 01:13:08,421
And if you wish to send your comments to members of the city council, you should, of course, do that too.

846
01:13:09,562 --> 01:13:09,762
All right.

847
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:10,783
Thank you, Chairperson Bader.

848
01:13:11,003 --> 01:13:11,604
Have a nice evening.

849
01:13:11,704 --> 01:13:12,064
Bye-bye.

850
01:13:12,164 --> 01:13:15,827
You too.

851
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:22,072
So with that, our next item is approval of minutes.

852
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,235
I don't believe I saw any in the meeting folder.

853
01:13:26,798 --> 01:13:28,479
I'm sorry.

854
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,941
I did not receive any minutes.

855
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:37,785
Um And I. Wasn't able to prepare them in Clem's absence.

856
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:39,366
Okay.

857
01:13:40,627 --> 01:13:50,173
Okay Um, I'm going to propose that we postpone the zoning overhaul updates to the next meeting, primarily because we're missing a significant number of board

858
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:09,287
Um, so with that, looking for, oh, actually, um, yeah.

859
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:12,629
Danielle or Alicia, do you have anything else that we should cover in this meeting?

860
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:14,110
Any other updates?

01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:15,231
No.
