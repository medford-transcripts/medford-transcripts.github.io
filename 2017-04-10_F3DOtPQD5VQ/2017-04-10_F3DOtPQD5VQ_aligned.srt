00:00:04,127 --> 00:00:04,828
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:09,231
Medford is proud to support Team HEMO at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, June 4th.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:14,915
Our community has come together to raise awareness and join in the fight against pediatric cancer.

4
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:17,377
I'm buzzing my hair for kids with cancer.

5
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:20,479
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO!

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,783
About five years ago, I started hearing commercials on the radio about this great cause.

7
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:39,325
I think three, four years ago, I had a student who was personally affected, losing a younger sibling, Hemo, and kind of motivated me to do it that year.

8
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:42,947
I decided to buzz in Hemo's honor.

9
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,308
I am donating to team Hemo.

10
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,210
Medford is buzzing for Hemo.

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,151
At Medford, we raise our hats for Hemo.

12
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,413
Medford is buzzing for Hemo.

13
00:00:55,148 --> 00:01:04,552
We are so proud of our McGlynn students who are buzzing off of HEMO and special thanks to Mr. Petrellis and Mr. Kuzmitz who organizes this event every year.

14
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,733
Way to go, McGlynn!

15
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:07,694
I donated to Team HEMO.

16
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,735
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

17
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:12,496
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

18
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:14,437
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

19
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:16,498
And I'm donating for HEMO.

20
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:18,580
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

21
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:23,506
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

22
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:34,558
I'm buzzing my head for kids with cancer.

23
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:35,639
I'm Anthony Petralos.

24
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,461
I'm a fifth grade teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School, and I'm the team captain of Team HEMO this year.

25
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:46,724
This is our fourth year in the One Mission Buzz-Off, which is held at Gillette Stadium, June 4th this year.

26
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:53,128
Four years ago, a third grade student in our school, HEMO of DuFourage, passed away of a real form of spinal cancer.

27
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:55,329
We do it for their family every single year.

28
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,069
We get t-shirts.

29
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:56,849
We organize.

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,611
We get about 15, 20 different people to join the team.

31
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,790
We're cutting like knives in a fist fight
