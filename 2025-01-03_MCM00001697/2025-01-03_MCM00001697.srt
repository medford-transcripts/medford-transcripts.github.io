00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:06,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening everyone welcome to the Thursday, January 2nd, 2025, meeting of the Medford Zoning Appeals.

2

[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie Thompson?

11
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:22,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Present.

12
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:27,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we had anybody else from the board join.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis do you want to start with the first case.

14
00:00:41,453 --> 00:00:45,935
[SPEAKER_14]: First case is 85 Elm Street case number a dash 2024-25.

15
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:55,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Applicant and owner 835 Elm Street LLC to demolish and convert a legal nonconforming motor vehicle repair station to a 3 unit townhouse style residential building a single family to.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's Andre sorry single family to zoning district requiring a variance for frontage lot with.

17
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:05,069
[SPEAKER_14]: and usable open space for the city method zoning ordinance chapter 94.

18
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,753
[SPEAKER_14]: When I let someone in, I lose my screen.

19
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:27,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapter 94 table, the table of dimensional requirements, a variance as to parking pursuant to chapter 94, 6.1.3, a variance as to one pursuant per chapter 94, 11.42, or alternatively, a special permit to change non-conforming use as set forth in chapter 94, 5.21.

20
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:33,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

21
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

22
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:39,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Chairman Thompson and board members.

23
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:41,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Kathleen Desmond of Reading for the applicant.

24
00:01:42,074 --> 00:02:03,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here this evening with Petitioner Richard Baldessari, Manager of 8385 Elm Street, LLC, Project Engineer Jack Sullivan of Sullivan Engineering, LLC, Project Architect Zeke Brown of Lisa Architects, and Landscape Engineer Jay Olmsted of Olmsted Design.

25
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:12,631
[SPEAKER_09]: The proposal before you this evening is to convert an existing gas station repair shop to a three-unit attached single-family dwelling.

26
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:18,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Each of the units roughly containing 1,900 square feet of living area.

27
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Zeke will further provide you with the exact square footage.

28
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:30,976
[SPEAKER_09]: By way of background, the subject parcel is located within the SF2 district and is a generous size containing approximately 10,080 square feet of land.

29
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:34,760
[SPEAKER_09]: A 1,264 square foot building currently is on the site and houses the repair shop.

30
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,360
[SPEAKER_09]: The gas station repair shop is a pre-existing structure in use.

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:58,546
[SPEAKER_09]: The petitioner has continued to maintain its fuel storage license, and I provided the board with that, and uses the property on occasion to repair vehicles as overflow from its other Medford location on Hicks Avenue in Medford.

32
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:05,669
[SPEAKER_09]: As recently as a couple weeks ago, repairs for Salt Trek and Plow were made at the site, and a number of snowblowers were also repaired.

33
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:20,016
[SPEAKER_09]: As to the physical attributes of the site, the property, while generous in size, is not capable of being subdivided into two buildable lots, as neither lot would meet the ordinance requirement as to width, which is 50 feet.

34
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:24,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Any subdivision would create two nonconforming lots in violation of the merger doctrine.

35
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:39,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Parcel is also hampered by a 12-foot drainage easement that runs diagonally across the first one-third of the front area of the property, requiring any building to be set back a minimum of 34 feet from the street.

36
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:49,931
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the drainage easement, the property is also challenged by the topography to the rear of the yard, which is significantly lower in elevation to that of its neighbors.

37
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:53,812
[SPEAKER_09]: The project is proposed will install a retaining wall system

38
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:59,041
[SPEAKER_09]: that will help prevent further erosion from the neighbor's property onto the subject property.

39
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:13,290
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're asking for relief tonight is first a variances to lot frontage and width of approximately 8.77 feet, which does not impact the compliance with setback requirements.

40
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:24,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We are also seeking a variances to usable open space as there is considerable open space on the property, but it does meet the dimensional requirements of open space.

41
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:27,803
[SPEAKER_09]: We are also seeking a variance to parking

42
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:38,839
[SPEAKER_09]: As the parking spaces, although while set back beyond the setback requirement still remain in the front yard due to the fact that the structure has to be beyond the drainage easement.

43
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:50,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And also a use variance or alternatively a finding in accordance with section 5.21 of the ordinance, which would call for a substitution of a non-conforming use.

44
00:04:51,033 --> 00:05:00,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to let them present and then I can go back to each one of these variances requested and provide you with a rationale for the requests based on the information provided.

45
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:04,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I'll turn it over to Jack Sullivan.

46
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dennis, I'll share my screen.

47
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that worked fine.

48
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:28,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Kathleen.

49
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,551
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, my name's Jack Sullivan.

50
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the project engineer, and I'm the owner of the Sullivan Engineering Group.

51
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:42,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to give a quick overview, a lot of this information Kathleen already gave in her introductory statement.

52
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:46,284
[SPEAKER_15]: But basically, we have an existing site.

53
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,347
[SPEAKER_15]: It's zoned in the SF2 zoning district.

54
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:55,989
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two existing curb cuts on Elm Street that provide access to this lot.

55
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,611
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an existing one-story concrete block building on the property now.

56
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,672
[SPEAKER_15]: It's approximately 15 feet, 6 inches high.

57
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:15,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Kathleen stated, there's a 12-foot wide drain easement that runs across the site, basically the front third of the site.

58
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:39,393
[SPEAKER_15]: And as she stated, the lot's relatively flat until you get to the rear of the site, where we have some steep topography on the back left-hand corner of the site, and there's an existing retaining wall with a maximum height of about seven feet at the back of the property that provides some slope challenges to this property.

59
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:49,125
[SPEAKER_15]: When we go to the proposed condition on the right hand side of the site plan in front of you, we're going to retain the two existing curb cuts.

60
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:52,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, if we can zoom in a bit.

61
00:06:53,171 --> 00:07:00,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, we're going to retain the two existing curb cuts, so no new curb cuts in Elm Street.

62
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:07,056
[SPEAKER_15]: And there'll be a circular drive that provides access to the site to service the three units.

63
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:15,058
[SPEAKER_15]: As you can see, we're situating the proposed building to the rear of the existing drain easement.

64
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:17,479
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to do that.

65
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,820
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to keep the building structure itself outside that easement area.

66
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:29,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the rear of the lot, we'll be constructing a new retaining wall system.

67
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:36,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So that plays into what Attorney Desmond was saying during the introduction of the meeting.

68
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:43,404
[SPEAKER_15]: By providing that retaining wall, there's existing erosion that's taking place along the rear of this site now.

69
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:53,390
[SPEAKER_15]: So this retaining wall, although a significant cost to the applicant, will provide a stable structure to the rear of this property.

70
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:03,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Each unit will have a one car garage and there'll be an associated one car parking space in front of each unit as well.

71
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:14,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think at this point, I'll turn it over to the architect to get into some of the architectural features of this property.

72
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:31,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Before you do, Jack, we can just point out to the board, we put a couple of photos here that kind of show the topography and the fact that at the back of the lot, you know, we've got this this hill essentially that runs up the back of the lot.

73
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can get a sense as to what the topography challenge is.

74
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:45,348
[SPEAKER_15]: And to add to that, that wall on the back, it's not a structural wall.

75
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:48,389
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a loose stone wall that's in really poor condition.

76
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:58,434
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been some failure to that wall that the owner's been trying to deal with over the years, and there's been some erosion onto this property.

77
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:04,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So by adding a fully engineered structural wall at the back of the site will be a big improvement.

78
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:12,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, we can hand it over to Zeke to go through his plans.

79
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Zeke Brown.

80
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy, you want to let me do screen share?

81
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be easier.

82
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:20,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

83
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to?

84
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:26,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll just replace current share.

85
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:32,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll stop sharing.

86
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:34,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

87
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you touch the seat, you're in control.

88
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm in control.

89
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me scroll down here.

90
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are the photos Kathy was just pointing out.

91
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:59,962
[SPEAKER_02]: As she said, we've designed a three-unit townhouse structure to sit on the lot.

92
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Unit 1 and unit 3 are about 2,600 square feet, and the middle unit's a little bit smaller based on the balcony and the way the entrance sequence works.

93
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:22,078
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll just walk you through the floor plans to give you an idea of how it works.

94
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:28,263
[SPEAKER_02]: As Jack mentioned, we have a circular drive that comes in from Elm Street like this.

95
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:37,412
[SPEAKER_02]: There's car parking underneath at the lowest level of the unit, and adjacent to that are the entry doors.

96
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You come in, there's a long entry hall and stairs go up.

97
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,511
[SPEAKER_02]: In the back here, we've got some storage rooms.

98
00:10:47,071 --> 00:11:00,597
[SPEAKER_02]: They're essentially basement spaces and they're concrete foundation walls that are built to help buttress and terrace the backyard to make the retaining wall a little bit lower.

99
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: As you come up, you basically come in the door, you go straight up the stairs,

100
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:20,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Into each unit has a big living, dining, kitchen area, pushed more to the rear of the property.

101
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:25,717
[SPEAKER_02]: In the front of the second floor is a bedroom on each unit.

102
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,519
[SPEAKER_02]: You continue up the stairs again.

103
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it here.

104
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:44,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Land in the back and each unit has two bedrooms and bathrooms en suite on the upper levels.

105
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the exterior elevations.

106
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:57,514
[SPEAKER_02]: The building is designed to look like a two-family.

107
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It has two peaked roofs facing Elm Street.

108
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:11,178
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to minimize the mass by pushing and pulling as much as we could so it didn't just feel like a giant thing.

109
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:16,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to point out one piece here, if I can.

110
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,540
[SPEAKER_02]: The existing garage,

111
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:24,852
[SPEAKER_02]: at 15.5 feet is more or less at that height.

112
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:34,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit closer to the property line than what we're proposing, the side yard property line.

113
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:44,137
[SPEAKER_02]: The eave of the building here is about 12 feet above where the existing garage is.

114
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:58,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a story taller than the existing garage, but the slope of the roof here would end up minimizing any shading problem with the neighboring property.

115
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to point that out.

116
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:06,262
[SPEAKER_02]: The rear continues around the back.

117
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:14,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got stepped terraces happening in the back for rear yard.

118
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:19,287
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I will leave it to Jay Olmstead.

119
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:21,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, he is logged in.

120
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:29,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, is Jay logged in?

121
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,288
[SPEAKER_09]: He had a previous meeting.

122
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: He thought he would be here by 645.7.

123
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell from mine whether he has logged in at this point.

124
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:47,599
[SPEAKER_14]: If he's in, he's not in as himself.

125
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:48,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that make sense?

126
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's a few iPads, iPhones.

127
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:51,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

128
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:56,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like someone's, maybe this is him in the, looks like someone's entering.

129
00:13:58,168 --> 00:13:59,088
[SPEAKER_14]: The waiting room.

130
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, did somebody just put someone in because I didn't.

131
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:06,230
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see.

132
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,430
[SPEAKER_16]: I got the one with the 781 number.

133
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:14,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't ask if that's them.

134
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:23,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the person who just came in at phone number 781-874 started with that.

135
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:28,266
[SPEAKER_14]: If you are the landscape architect, please let us know.

136
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:45,382
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, I can go through what we're looking for for relief and the rationale for it and then move back to Jay.

137
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:50,006
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me say, in terms of the landscape plan,

138
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,304
[SPEAKER_09]: and Jay can go through this in further detail.

139
00:14:54,244 --> 00:15:10,598
[SPEAKER_09]: What is really going on here and the cost is probably going to be in excess of $100,000 to properly set this retaining walls in the rear of the property so that we can be prevented from moving forward the erosion.

140
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,303
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see from the pictures and my client has indicated that there's frequently

141
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:30,273
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it slides from the, from the neighboring yards into the yards, because there isn't really anything of meaningful weight to hold that earth back.

142
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:33,457
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, the building itself.

143
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:39,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is a three-unit building, we'll also help support that.

144
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:44,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay can explain what he has for flowers and landscaping in this area.

145
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:57,009
[SPEAKER_09]: But essentially, it's a tiered landscaping so that the landscaping is between the foundation of the building and the retaining walls to try to keep all that land stable.

146
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, go on.

147
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,224
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go ahead.

148
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:17,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just point out that Jay made a big effort to provide adequate screening from the street in this buffer zone here.

149
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: To give a bit of privacy as well as along the border of both the side yards, which I think is a good neighbor move.

150
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think that he's had the ability to join us as of yet.

151
00:16:43,444 --> 00:17:00,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of what we're looking for relief and the rationale behind that, first, the property clearly has attributes pertaining to drainage, topography, and lot width that create a hardship.

152
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:06,580
[SPEAKER_09]: My client estimates that the cost of demolishing the existing dwelling

153
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:16,040
[SPEAKER_09]: which is existing, non-conforming, will run approximately $40,000 just in the demolition of what's existing.

154
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:28,784
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to that, previous to the filing of this complaint, and I think the board is aware, that he did in fact spend significant funds to clean up the site so that the site is clean.

155
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:35,607
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to those costs, the installation of the retaining walls alone

156
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:50,754
[SPEAKER_09]: will be in excess of a hundred thousand dollars to to set those correctly so that you no longer have the issue both with the neighbors abutting the property and the subject property as to erosion.

157
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:56,016
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition you know there will also be a cost which is more

158
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:04,917
[SPEAKER_09]: more easily worn by three units than a single unit in this case.

159
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:13,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Because under the SF2 district, I think it's important to recognize that two families are not allowed either.

160
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Those also would require a use variance.

161
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:27,232
[SPEAKER_09]: But in that instance, you would be in a situation where they would have to bear the cost of maintenance of both the landscaping and the retaining wall, which is

162
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,165
[SPEAKER_09]: is more easily dealt with by a three-family property.

163
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:42,733
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the topography and the drainage and how that relates to parking, I think we've provided six spaces.

164
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:54,602
[SPEAKER_09]: The requirement is five, but I think realistically, when you're looking at the fact that you're gonna have a driveway in front of each of those units, that you're gonna have a parking space

165
00:18:55,523 --> 00:19:01,547
[SPEAKER_09]: for each, and it's also more in keeping with an SF2 district requirement of two parking spaces.

166
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:08,071
[SPEAKER_09]: The variance is required because, again, although we're beyond, well beyond the 15-foot setback.

167
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:16,976
[SPEAKER_09]: required because of the drainage easement which runs along the property.

168
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:23,880
[SPEAKER_09]: The building has to be set back 34 to 40 feet from the front end of the property.

169
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And as indicated and as the pictures show,

170
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:38,852
[SPEAKER_09]: The back topography is difficult to deal with, and we've only got, when you push the building back that far, you've only got 15 feet, which is the rear yard setback.

171
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:51,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So the topography of the rear yard, in addition to the placement of the building due to the drainage, is why we're seeking the variance as to parking.

172
00:19:52,924 --> 00:20:00,508
[SPEAKER_09]: With respect to use, again, I think, and if, could you go down to the end of the slides for me?

173
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:03,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

174
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,712
[SPEAKER_09]: One up from that with the listing, the, keep going.

175
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: One more, there we, permitted uses, there we go.

176
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:22,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, in terms of the size of the lot and also the uses, I think that everyone has the.

177
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:30,450
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding or the first thing that comes to mind is that in the SF2 district you're limited to single-family houses.

178
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is not necessarily the case with respect to those uses and the uses that are as a right child care center which would create much more traffic and much more noise in the neighborhood.

179
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,254
[SPEAKER_09]: The church is also a

180
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:53,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And as of right use, there may still be dimensional requirements that they would have to comply with.

181
00:20:54,782 --> 00:21:03,293
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the most part, with the size of this lot, those as of right uses would be a potential that really wouldn't be fitting with the neighborhood.

182
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:21,422
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to that, you've got uses permitted by special permit, which include private recreational club or lodge, public entertainment or recreational facility, and adult-use marijuana cultivation, manufacturing, processing, and independent laboratory.

183
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:28,365
[SPEAKER_09]: With respect to the special permit analysis, whether those are more detrimental to the neighborhood.

184
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:54,556
[SPEAKER_09]: would clearly be the case just didn't in terms of you know number of visits of noise and traffic so when you're looking at the SF to district I think it's important to remember to that this isn't just a homogeneous district that there are also other potential uses that could go into that space given the size of the line that would be incompatible with the existing use or are you playing compatible.

185
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:05,658
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this is a situation where you're not going from a use that was permitted to a non-conforming use.

186
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:23,468
[SPEAKER_09]: This is essentially, even if the board considers it to be a use variance, it's a non-conforming use to a non-conforming use, but a use that is residential in nature, it adds one unit

187
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:30,892
[SPEAKER_09]: over what would be allowed if you could subdivide the lot, but you can't subdivide the lot and create two buildable lots.

188
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:45,722
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also provides the applicant and those who live there with the ability to do the necessary retaining wall work and whatnot that is required to really clean this property up and keep, you know,

189
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,703
[SPEAKER_09]: birth from falling forward into the subject property.

190
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:54,305
[SPEAKER_09]: As to width and frontage, we're seeking those variances.

191
00:22:54,505 --> 00:23:10,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Those variances will be required with respect to any project that came in here, and it's the reason why the subject lots can't be subdivided because they don't meet the width requirement of the district.

192
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:14,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And so with respect to the use variance, I think that

193
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,770
[SPEAKER_09]: The hardship is the fact that you can't

194
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:31,793
[SPEAKER_09]: subdivide the lots, you've got significant costs related to getting this project, any project, to a point where you take care of the physical attributes of the property.

195
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:45,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And in terms of substantial detriment, it's residential use, which is similar to the use that is, you know, is compatible with the neighborhood.

196
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:56,942
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a priority, certainly, for providing additional housing, and this would provide the neighborhood with three single-family units of reasonable size.

197
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:09,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think when Zeke spoke with respect to the square footage of each, just so that we're all aware, that would include the garage space as well as the basement space.

198
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:16,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So that figure of 2,600 feet includes storage and garage space in addition to the living space.

199
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:29,912
[SPEAKER_09]: The other benefit with the three-family is that you have the property sprinkled, which you wouldn't have if you were going to construct a single-family home on the site.

200
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:37,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So in essence, that's the rationale for the variances that we're seeking, and I'm not sure if

201
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:45,931
[SPEAKER_09]: If Jay is on the call as of yet, I don't think he is.

202
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's searching for the link.

203
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:52,558
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll certainly take questions and he'll be available to take questions from the board.

204
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:01,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

205
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:09,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to qualify Andre the rude during the call under just could you call present and all I do to the roster.

206
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you present.

207
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:20,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you and for the board while we wait for the other person to join there any questions you want to try to address now.

208
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:27,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have a question or two.

209
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:30,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear a little bit more about the drainage easement.

210
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:36,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just explain where that goes and what it's for?

211
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see it looks like it clips the property next door a little bit.

212
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:49,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering just to understand why or why you can't build over it.

213
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:57,256
[SPEAKER_15]: I can take that one, Jack Sullivan.

214
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:07,960
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually, it's officially a 12 foot wide drainage easement, but there's a sewer, the sewer service runs through that area.

215
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,601
[SPEAKER_15]: And this easement was created in 1935.

216
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:13,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's an old easement.

217
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:19,385
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a large sewer main that runs through that easement.

218
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:29,317
[SPEAKER_15]: And with the building code, you can build up to an easement line, but you can't build any permanent structure within an easement.

219
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:48,646
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you start looking at where this easement exists on the property, the only usable area to actually build a structure and meet a front setback and stay out of the easement itself would be to the rear of this 12-foot easement.

220
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:51,008
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope that answers it.

221
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just an old easement.

222
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,172
[SPEAKER_15]: A large sewer main runs through there.

223
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,474
[SPEAKER_15]: and we have to stay out of it.

224
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:06,578
[SPEAKER_15]: We can put pavement surfaces above it, we can park over it, but you can't build any physical structures within it.

225
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:08,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, that's very helpful.

226
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:12,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And does this sewer line serve the neighborhood?

227
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to tie into it?

228
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:15,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

229
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:16,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

230
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:21,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

231
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:23,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andrew.

232
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have any other questions?

233
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at this time.

234
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I did, but I'm forgetting it right now.

235
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

236
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:38,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody else from the board have a question that they want to address before we go forward?

237
00:27:38,258 --> 00:27:45,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, so I was wondering the T1 exhibit photo.

238
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:50,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering, do you have a photo without the tree?

239
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:51,290
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not that one.

240
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,373
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the, I think at the bottom is labeled T1.

241
00:27:58,745 --> 00:27:59,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this one.

242
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:06,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering, would you happen to have a photo without the trees surrounding the house?

243
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:17,074
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this was a computer rendered photo, sort of a compilation of

244
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: photos we took of the site and what we thought the landscape would end up looking like.

245
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't have one without the trees removed.

246
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:45,096
[SPEAKER_11]: The trees that's currently in the photo, would they be the same proportion as reflected in this photo?

247
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,560
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a little hard for me to answer.

248
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Jay has entered the building.

249
00:28:59,142 --> 00:28:59,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

250
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:01,562
[SPEAKER_09]: He can answer that question if he's on.

251
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:03,443
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe he's been admitted.

252
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:03,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

253
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm here.

254
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:05,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

255
00:29:05,663 --> 00:29:06,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Jay.

256
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

257
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:12,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I just joined and I just wanted to, the question was, I came in the middle of it.

258
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So please ask the question again.

259
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:35,947
[SPEAKER_11]: So once this proposal is hypothetically, if it's approved and established, would the photos, the trees in the photos, actually, the actual trees planted actually is reflected in the photo as exhibits?

260
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:37,508
[SPEAKER_03]: The size at day one?

261
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:40,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's the size proportion.

262
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say that they are accurate.

263
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:47,619
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably mostly the ones to the right that are a little bit shorter.

264
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one?

265
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, yes.

266
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:55,882
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be accurate for what would be proposed there.

267
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:03,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And the trees surrounding the neighbor's house would be proposed?

268
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:08,787
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference is that that front tree would not be there because we would want to give

269
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:16,576
[SPEAKER_03]: clear sight lines along Elm Street for cars coming into and out of the driveway.

270
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:24,699
[SPEAKER_03]: The trees that would be further back along the property line would also be evergreen trees, arborvitae trees.

271
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to your plan, Jay, and you can talk about that a little.

272
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:42,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to, well, why don't you do screen share Jay?

273
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me, um, you don't have that pulled up.

274
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:58,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

275
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to pull that drawing up.

276
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

277
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it.

278
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have it pulled up now.

279
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:25,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

280
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:30,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you do the screen share, Jay, and then you can talk about.

281
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

282
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:46,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rendering that we were looking at was basically in this location on LG, if you can see my cursor looking towards the building.

283
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:51,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And these trees were generally accurately represented.

284
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:58,971
[SPEAKER_03]: My point, there will be some shrubs here so that people coming in and out will be able to see down Elm Street and not be blocked.

285
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:10,578
[SPEAKER_03]: But this line of trees here would be evergreen trees that would be narrow and columnar arborvitaes, the actual species, if you're familiar with that tree.

286
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And 89 Elm Street is to the left.

287
00:32:20,285 --> 00:32:21,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It is this property up here.

288
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

289
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:24,346
All right.

290
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:32,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rotated the view and I rotated the view slightly from the first survey image.

291
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:34,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

292
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:36,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

293
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:41,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mary.

294
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I see Mike has a question.

295
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

296
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to better understand

297
00:32:50,436 --> 00:33:00,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The financial hardship aspect of this, so it does sound like the work to the retaining wall is substantial.

298
00:33:00,642 --> 00:33:12,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us a little bit more about why, say, two attached townhomes would not be economical, but three is?

299
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney Desmond, I think you're on mute.

300
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:44,045
[SPEAKER_09]: With respect to the two attached townhomes versus the three, you know, there's a lot of demolition costs because you're working with

301
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:54,674
[SPEAKER_09]: an existing building that has to be demolished and brought back to a situation where you can bring that into developable property.

302
00:33:55,755 --> 00:34:02,342
[SPEAKER_09]: The vestiges of that, that's at least $40,000 to $50,000, just the demolition costs with respect to that.

303
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:05,265
[SPEAKER_09]: include the grading or anything of that nature.

304
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:24,300
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to that, you have the walls in the back and the landscaping plan, and Jay can speak to this, but in addition to the retaining wall piece of this, you've also got a tiered landscaping plan here that will also have a cost of maintenance in addition to

305
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,162
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the retaining wall itself.

306
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:44,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you've got two homeowners versus three homeowners that would be available, first of all, to take even after absent the initial cost, which is at least $100,000 just for the retaining wall piece of it, that there's going to be maintenance costs that are going to have to be shared.

307
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:54,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, in terms of spreading that cost out amongst the owners, you know, three makes more sense than two in terms of

308
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,213
[SPEAKER_09]: of maintaining that wall and maintaining the landscaping.

309
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:13,925
[SPEAKER_09]: You're in the vicinity of probably $250,000, because these are estimates, just to get the property to a point where you can actually construct the property and not have to worry about land slipping forward.

310
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:18,920
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, continued erosion on the property.

311
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:34,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the other thing with respect to the three-family versus the two is that when you look at the dimensional requirements, and I know that some of the neighbors' comments have to do with the size and whatnot,

312
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:50,386
[SPEAKER_09]: But in actuality, in this instance, we are taking the lot line and it's not at the seven and a half, which is what you would have with a two family or say you were going to put two singles on the property.

313
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:59,473
[SPEAKER_09]: We're 14 feet away on both sides from that particular property and the overall block coverage on the property

314
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:12,561
[SPEAKER_09]: is only 28.7% of the lot, whereas if you have a two or a single family, your lot coverage ability is 40% of that lot.

315
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:19,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of this creating a bigger structure, it's not really the case.

316
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:24,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, much of this is vertical in terms of living space, but even in terms of vertical,

317
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:38,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Your story height is only 33.6 feet, which is well within what would be permitted for a two and a half story, and your height is 33.6 feet.

318
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:54,382
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of the one versus the two, it helps the developer in the initial with dealing with the cost, because they've also already cleaned up this property from its use as a gas station.

319
00:36:55,482 --> 00:37:00,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to put the time and the effort and the money into dealing with the back portion of the lot.

320
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But going forward, it also assists with maintenance.

321
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:06,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And in terms of dimensions of the property,

322
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:11,731
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not really creating anything larger than you would or could as of right.

323
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not as of right, because a two-family isn't allowed as of right.

324
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:18,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So you would also need to use variance for a two-family.

325
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:23,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not creating any increased dimensions.

326
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:29,930
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, you may actually be shrinking what a building could be in this instance with a two-family.

327
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:31,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

328
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:39,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my other question is, to maintain the existing use, what has to happen to the retaining wall to the back?

329
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:41,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like there's already some erosion.

330
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:46,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there any repairs needed just to maintain the existing use?

331
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:55,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if they were going to, you know, you would probably

332
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,314
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to.

333
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:59,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 1,200 square foot building.

334
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:02,136
[SPEAKER_09]: You're well within the requirements.

335
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:15,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's difficult to say whether you would take on the retaining wall repairs in conjunction with the original building, because you don't really need to do that at this point.

336
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:24,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether you sought to do it, I suppose at some point it could get to a critical mass where you would need to do something.

337
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:42,023
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, in this instance, by changing it and actually taking on this work, you know, you're also benefiting the abutters to the south of the property that are on that top wall, because they don't have to worry about their earth sliding down into the property as well.

338
00:38:42,804 --> 00:38:53,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I probably didn't mention this before, but in terms of the use, there is available to the board, you know, the substitution of a nonconforming use rather than

339
00:38:55,246 --> 00:39:17,992
[SPEAKER_09]: variance in this instance the board the the applicant has kept his fuel license open and he does use it as overflow for his existing business it's not open to the public in the sense that he's customers are coming in off of the street but it is still operating as a repair shop to an extent and he's kept his license in place.

340
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:24,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that instance, you could under 5.2.1 substitute a non-conforming use.

341
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:37,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And this certainly in that instance would be a non-conforming use that is more in line with the residential makeup of the neighborhood.

342
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:38,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

343
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

344
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:42,736
[SPEAKER_16]: City Planner, Danielle Evans.

345
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:45,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

346
00:39:45,057 --> 00:39:46,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Danielle Evans.

347
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:46,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

348
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:55,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to speak to the issue of the existing or the old, the pre-existing nonconforming use.

349
00:39:55,628 --> 00:40:08,059
[SPEAKER_01]: The building commissioner and I had discussed this at length and we determined that it lapsed and they didn't have any of those pre-existing protections to be able to change from one use

350
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:17,979
[SPEAKER_01]: from one non-conforming use to another non-conforming use, you would have to reinstate the non-conforming, which I think you can do by special permit in the ordinance.

351
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,883
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, tinkering with some cars overflow, it's been closed.

352
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:30,307
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the previous use, it has lapsed as far as the city is concerned.

353
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:40,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that I, I necessarily agree with that interpretation, but, you know, I understand that's the city's position.

354
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:50,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, any other questions from the board.

355
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:59,773
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I do have, I just want to go back into the height so.

356
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:03,778
[SPEAKER_16]: In an SF2, we see a two and a half story house.

357
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:06,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, Attorney Desmond, you mentioned the height.

358
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:16,548
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe the peak on this is 35 feet, 6 inches, based on the architectural diagrams, if you take a look at those.

359
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:25,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, but height is measured under the ordinance by the difference between average between the street grade and the mean.

360
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:31,335
[SPEAKER_09]: So that 33.6 feet is what the ordinance requirement is.

361
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:34,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you looked at any house and you measured it from the peak,

362
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: to that point you would you may very well be over that 35 feet but the way it's measured it is at the average grade of the street to the to the mean point of the um ridge so i i think that's that's the different in it i'm not disagreeing in terms of what the highest point of the roof is uh but in terms of what the ordinance

363
00:41:56,689 --> 00:42:07,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Has he calculated as and probably in comparison to other properties, it would not be far off of what what the height limitation is even at the top.

364
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,173
[SPEAKER_09]: It's point 6 at the top.

365
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:16,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Most point houses in that neighborhood there to 2 and a half stories.

366
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there any shadow analysis done with that roof design?

367
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:25,414
[SPEAKER_09]: There wasn't a shadow analysis done on that.

368
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:28,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've seen the comments from the neighbor and the concerns.

369
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:36,483
[SPEAKER_09]: But with respect to, can we go back to the first page of the site plan?

370
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:42,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So that house sits to the east of this particular structure.

371
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was trying to get to the top.

372
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I can move it.

373
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:48,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I can move it.

374
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,154
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this one, right?

375
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:54,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I could.

376
00:42:55,054 --> 00:42:56,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the northerly.

377
00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:57,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the east.

378
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:04,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so this, this structure here, which is the house adjacent to the property.

379
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:11,554
[SPEAKER_09]: She is east of the existing structure, so she would have the morning sun at this point.

380
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:19,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wouldn't be until the afternoon that there was any possible impact from our particular site.

381
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:31,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, as opposed to the setbacks for a single and a 7 1⁄2 feet, we have moved that off 14 feet.

382
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:34,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of shade, I don't anticipate that there would be

383
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:35,763
[SPEAKER_09]: an issue with that.

384
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:50,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Our landscape architect did take a look at it today when that comment came in about the sunlight and he did observe and I think we have two pictures at the end Zeke that show that there are a couple of trees

385
00:43:52,115 --> 00:44:04,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Both in in her backyard this so this is the tree in our backyard, but also in her backyard that that will probably create more of the shade issue than our building was would.

386
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:07,408
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, I think the building itself is set back.

387
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:11,670
[SPEAKER_09]: almost 10 feet off of the site of her building.

388
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:27,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, shade from that building, I would, at least in the morning hours to noon, I think, where she sits easterly of our property, it would seem that she would have the sun and that it may be an issue in the afternoon, late afternoon.

389
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:29,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we're 14 feet off the property line.

390
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you can see, the structure is significantly off of where her structure ends.

391
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:44,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

392
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:45,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the board?

393
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:51,575
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we will move to public comment.

394
00:44:51,975 --> 00:45:00,997
[SPEAKER_16]: If anybody on the call would like to speak, please raise your hand on Zoom, or if you can raise your hand on your screen, I'll try to grab you.

395
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:07,099
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you can use the React raise hand button, that way we'll see you.

396
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:10,240
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also email Dennis McDougal

397
00:45:11,093 --> 00:45:16,416
[SPEAKER_16]: D-M-A-C-D-O-U-G-A-L-L at medford-ma.gov.

398
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,282
[SPEAKER_16]: We have anybody from the public that would like to speak.

399
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:47,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis, do you have any other emails or new ones in addition to the 1st, 1 that you received?

400
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:48,313
[SPEAKER_16]: That's on the record.

401
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:53,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope the 1 that we received was submitted was sent to the board.

402
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:58,240
[SPEAKER_14]: For their review, maybe I don't know.

403
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we go off the screen share.

404
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:04,625
[SPEAKER_14]: We might be able to.

405
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:09,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just in case.

406
00:46:09,148 --> 00:46:11,310
[SPEAKER_14]: The time for any additional emails.

407
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:17,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So far, nothing is coming.

408
00:46:19,624 --> 00:46:24,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

409
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mike.

410
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:26,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a second?

411
00:46:28,628 --> 00:46:28,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

412
00:46:30,428 --> 00:46:31,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mary.

413
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:33,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Trani.

414
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:41,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim?

415
00:46:43,128 --> 00:46:43,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

416
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:44,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

417
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:45,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew LaRue.

418
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

419
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:48,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee.

420
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:49,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

421
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Caldera.

422
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:51,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

423
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:53,275
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie Thompson, aye.

424
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:57,317
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

425
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,318
[SPEAKER_16]: What's everybody think?

426
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:05,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I've asked.

427
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:17,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually like to see a picture of that structure without all the trees, just to compare.

428
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:38,164
[SPEAKER_11]: to what the house really is like, that structure is really like, because of the proximity, the closeness, proximity to that house, because with the picture of that trees, all the trees surrounding it, it's difficult to have that conception of that building.

429
00:47:46,506 --> 00:47:51,128
[SPEAKER_16]: To the applicant, do you guys have any other content that would show another representation of the building?

430
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:55,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Without the surrounding landscaping.

431
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:05,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not, I'd have to rework the rendering in order to demonstrate what Mary's asking.

432
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:12,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the question the proximity to the adjacent property?

433
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:32,700
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think I'd like to just see the actual, the closer reflection of the actual building without the trees.

434
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:41,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Zeke, you have, it's not a rendering, but there is a picture of the front facing, isn't there, of the structure without the trees?

435
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:44,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let me just, I'm sharing again.

436
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:51,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's jumping ahead here.

437
00:48:56,628 --> 00:49:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the rendering that I did, the computer-generated rendering.

438
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:15,195
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the full front facade and a portion of the side, and I'll move to the architectural drawings, which isn't a 3D rendering.

439
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:25,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me get to those.

440
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:28,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the front.

441
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: The red lines are the approximate location of the existing garage building there now.

442
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:39,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the front of the building.

443
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:43,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a gable roof on two sides here.

444
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a balcony in the middle.

445
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:48,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Projecting Betty windows.

446
00:49:48,097 --> 00:49:49,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, sorry for the interruption.

447
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:52,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to see the picture beat.

448
00:49:52,918 --> 00:49:55,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's it's really between.

449
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:01,781
[SPEAKER_11]: The left from my perspective, the left side of the house to the neighboring property.

450
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:09,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, so the so the trees actually blocked that I wasn't able to see it.

451
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So you go back to T1.

452
00:50:13,105 --> 00:50:14,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm going there.

453
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:21,888
[SPEAKER_11]: See, without these trees, then we would have a better view.

454
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:23,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the property.

455
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:23,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

456
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:26,789
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see the neighbor's house.

457
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:30,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, in relation to that, the distance.

458
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:44,793
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's hard to get those to be deadly accurate when you're doing this because you're taking a photograph and you're merging that with an architectural,

459
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:53,623
[SPEAKER_02]: rendering, so the perspective starts to get a little bit warped, but you can see where the house sits.

460
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:57,568
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the roof line.

461
00:50:58,905 --> 00:51:03,410
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way the photo is, it's a little bit elongated.

462
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to model that separately and put that in here in order to make it very precise.

463
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:20,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But the white behind the trees is where her house is or where that house is.

464
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:35,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this picture is elongated, the distance between that neighboring house and this proposed structure, the space between that, would that be smaller?

465
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:50,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the space, as Kathleen pointed out earlier, the front face of our structure is about 10 feet behind the rear face of the neighbor's structure.

466
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:54,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put that up in the site plan just so you can.

467
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,891
[SPEAKER_02]: The red is the proposed building.

468
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:58,473
[SPEAKER_02]: If I draw a line straight across, this is the neighbor's building.

469
00:52:21,603 --> 00:52:24,084
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 12 feet, might be 15 feet.

470
00:52:25,205 --> 00:52:31,568
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the easement is about 12, this looks like it could be about a 12-foot difference.

471
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:39,712
[SPEAKER_02]: The front face of our building is about 12 feet behind the rear face of the neighbor's property.

472
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:40,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

473
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:44,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are the trees?

474
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:54,669
[SPEAKER_11]: In relation to these pictures and the T1 pictures that were shown, where were the trees in relation to this exhibit?

475
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: My trees are here in this picture.

476
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:07,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me just move them around.

477
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:10,755
[SPEAKER_02]: They occupy this zone here.

478
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:28,233
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in this area, and the rendering is taken from here, and it looks that way.

479
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You're standing in this point right here.

480
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:32,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

481
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,575
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense, yes.

482
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

483
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:43,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I think also if the issue is the trees, the height of the trees, or the composition of the trees,

484
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:48,367
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the applicant isn't wedded to those.

485
00:53:48,447 --> 00:53:59,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's something different that the board would rather see rather than the trees in that instance, that's certainly doable, not something that there would be an objection to.

486
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:10,478
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, I think it's important to point out with respect to the relation of the building that you've got the 14 feet side yard setback that we have on these units.

487
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And in addition to that, there's probably another,

488
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,362
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 or 15 feet on the side yard from her house.

489
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:24,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got probably between the two properties, conservatively speaking, probably 20, 24 feet.

490
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Factoring in both side yard lot line, side yard setbacks.

491
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:35,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

492
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:43,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Andrew.

493
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:55,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I think, you know, the residential use makes sense along this street.

494
00:54:55,693 --> 00:55:02,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the use variance, you know, I would be inclined to be supportive.

495
00:55:04,098 --> 00:55:10,222
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whether it's two or three units, you know, I don't think we're equipped to kind of get into the finances of it.

496
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that

497
00:55:13,705 --> 00:55:15,727
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to correct you real quick.

498
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:18,749
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the option for the special permit for the use change.

499
00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:23,132
[SPEAKER_16]: The variances are dimensional open space and parking only.

500
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

501
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:31,857
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would say that the.

502
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:46,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The landscaping plan that what concerns me about that in terms of the butters is less the building itself and more of the Arborvitae, which could grow very tall, 40 to 60 feet tall.

503
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:54,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a good, makes good sense to put those all along the border by the butters.

504
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:58,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that could be, those could become really,

505
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:00,117
[SPEAKER_06]: huge.

506
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:11,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to see something either just the fence, the six-foot fence, or something that's maybe a little less overwhelming than that.

507
00:56:19,131 --> 00:56:21,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay, do you want to speak to that in terms of options?

508
00:56:22,514 --> 00:56:23,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I allowed to respond?

509
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:30,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify that the arborvitaes that we selected there, their final height will be 15 to 18 feet.

510
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Naturally, they're not going to be the 60-foot tall arborvitaes.

511
00:56:36,374 --> 00:56:37,915
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different species.

512
00:56:39,056 --> 00:56:46,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But we may also be open, if preferred, to do a fence if there's concern about that too.

513
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:54,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my, from my reading of the landscape plan is that there is, it says six foot fence and then there's also Arborvitae, is that right?

514
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are we talking one of these?

515
00:56:56,661 --> 00:56:57,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

516
00:56:57,561 --> 00:56:57,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

517
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:08,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's good to know it's the smaller species.

518
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:14,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to hear that, but, um, still it might be worth talking to the abutter about whether, uh,

519
00:57:18,373 --> 00:57:21,634
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a preference for other kinds of landscaping.

520
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

521
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:26,337
[SPEAKER_03]: We could put shrubs that don't get as tall.

522
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:33,320
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get as tall as the, no higher than the fence and keep it lower so for that, certainly.

523
00:57:36,102 --> 00:57:36,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andrew.

524
00:57:37,302 --> 00:57:38,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Jay.

525
00:57:38,563 --> 00:57:39,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike, go ahead.

526
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:41,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

527
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:42,705
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of thoughts.

528
00:57:44,086 --> 00:58:06,373
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of Butter's comment, I don't really think the board should overreact to that because this is a conforming side yard setback and conforming height.

529
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:11,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So the idea that essentially you could build a single family home

530
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:15,489
[SPEAKER_07]: same position on a side yard, same height.

531
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:26,514
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea that a light concern would be grounds to refuse something, I just don't find compelling.

532
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:27,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a slippery slope.

533
00:58:29,775 --> 00:58:40,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, clearly the lot's unusual for some of the reasons Attorney Desmond laid out with the easement and the topography.

534
00:58:44,437 --> 00:59:07,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets down to the same concern I had when a similar project was brought before the board two years ago, which is the intent of the zoning ordinance, as I consider it, is that in a single-family district, the residential uses should predominantly be single-family

535
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:08,926
[SPEAKER_07]: homes.

536
00:59:09,206 --> 00:59:12,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is a lot that's almost a double lot.

537
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it would need a variance no matter what.

538
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:17,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it can't be subdivided.

539
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:29,275
[SPEAKER_07]: But the use that is most consistent with the district and the intent of the zoning ordinance, as I see it, it would be two units.

540
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:32,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So whether it's attached or detached,

541
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:57,242
[SPEAKER_07]: don't have as strong opinions about, but I think the three units, the burden is really on demonstrating that there is some exorbitant cost that hasn't already been incurred that isn't something you'd have to incur no matter what that would prevent the development of this parcel for the alternate use.

542
00:59:58,282 --> 01:00:04,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And still not, I appreciate more financial details than last time around, but I'm still not,

543
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:14,287
[SPEAKER_07]: really hearing anything compelling to indicate that it's uneconomic to build two units there, but three units gets you over the top.

544
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:25,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you want me to speak to that or whether

545
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:33,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the chair, I'd certainly love to hear more from Attorney Desmond.

546
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:40,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to ask the question up front, but if there's additional details, I would certainly appreciate those.

547
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:54,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, well I do think that, well first off with respect to the zone itself and the applicability of the SF-2 and what's permitted in a substantial derogation.

548
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: While I understand that the SF-2 from a residential perspective is a single family and not a

549
01:01:05,096 --> 01:01:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: a district of multis or even twos.

550
01:01:08,178 --> 01:01:20,105
[SPEAKER_09]: The other uses that are permitted in the district for what are larger parcels including child care centers, churches, non-profit clubs by special permit.

551
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:27,809
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole litany which I've put up and included in the preparation that includes other uses that aren't SF2

552
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:49,507
[SPEAKER_09]: single-family home district so it's not a homogeneous grouping and and you know this is a parcel that would be given to one of those types of uses if you know if if it can't work economically and the developer has been you know before this board on on a

553
01:01:50,009 --> 01:02:04,719
[SPEAKER_09]: couple of separate occasions, and the numbers just don't work, especially when you put into effect what you're going to have to do with a retaining wall system, which is a whole civil engineering piece of it.

554
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:12,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay can speak to that a little bit more than I can in terms of what's involved in it and Jack, but the cost at a minimum

555
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:17,574
[SPEAKER_09]: It is $100,000 to just do that piece of it.

556
01:02:18,094 --> 01:02:32,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't include any of the additional work that would need to be done, landscaping, demolition of an existing garage structure that don't support a duplex.

557
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:41,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And going further in terms of maintaining that cost, you know, you're going to have repairs over the years to rectangles.

558
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,180
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to deal with the landscaping.

559
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:53,703
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bigger cost for a two-family, which again requires a use variance, as opposed to spreading it out between three units.

560
01:02:55,344 --> 01:03:07,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, in terms of lot coverage and whatnot, just in terms of compatibility with the neighborhood, 40% is what is permitted for singles and twos ordinarily.

561
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:12,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're back to 35%, which is the restriction on the ordinance.

562
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:18,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And this itself is only at 28.7 in terms of lot coverage.

563
01:03:19,135 --> 01:03:25,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of the initial developer costs, if it worked, it would have happened.

564
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:36,893
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't work given the work that you need to do to the back area of the lot to maintain the earth and from the abutting land slipping into it.

565
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:47,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't work in terms of the demolition costs and the costs that they have already incurred with respect to the cleanup, which I know has come before the board previously.

566
01:03:48,452 --> 01:03:56,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of costs just associated to those that aren't normal construction costs, the numbers just don't work with it too.

567
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:07,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want more detail, I suppose we can go back and, you know, attempt to get every penny that is going to be part of that construction.

568
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:14,152
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are the expenses that are unusual and unique to the property that you wouldn't have to do.

569
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:23,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the other thing with the tiered landscaping, right now that fence or what is a retaining wall on the back is seven feet in height.

570
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So to bring that height

571
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Back down to within the ordinance requirements.

572
01:04:30,443 --> 01:04:35,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Jay has set forth some tiered landscaping and Jay, maybe you can speak to that a little bit.

573
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:44,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I think I believe the audience is to maintain retaining walls 5 feet or less.

574
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:47,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been able to do that.

575
01:04:48,687 --> 01:05:00,896
[SPEAKER_03]: The existing retaining walls would have to be removed and the soil stabilized while new retaining walls are constructed and secured with proper footings and all of that.

576
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:10,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a significant cost, mostly on the back of the property, to maintain the adjacent properties as is in kind.

577
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:21,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jamie, just a few thoughts to wrap my comments.

578
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:34,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in terms of what I consider as part of the cost already incurred, I do not consider, I do not think that should be part of our consideration.

579
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:43,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Maintenance costs of a property once developed, I don't think is something we should be considering.

580
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:54,245
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the actual cost to change the condition of the lot and structures and that's really relevant here in terms of the

581
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,571
[SPEAKER_07]: burden of financial hardship.

582
01:05:58,312 --> 01:06:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, you know, just want to throw out there that if the ordinance in terms of its height restrictions on a retaining wall,

583
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:14,939
[SPEAKER_07]: is adding a lot of cost to the project.

584
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the topography of this lot, I certainly would be open to consider a version of the project where there's some dimensional relief granted there.

585
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:37,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mike.

586
01:06:38,013 --> 01:06:39,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the board?

587
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:49,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

588
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair awaits motion.

589
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Could be.

590
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sorry go ahead Kathleen.

591
01:06:59,503 --> 01:07:12,691
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a question of costs and if we could come back with additional costs or what it is, if the itemization would make a difference in this, I certainly would, you know, welcome the opportunity to do that.

592
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:25,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, you know, increasing the size of a retaining wall in that instance is just, you know, in terms of landscaping and in terms of what it's going to look like and in terms of cost of the additional retaining wall piece bringing the height in.

593
01:07:26,274 --> 01:07:33,960
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think that that's also a consideration which, you know, we didn't take into account because, you know, we're trying to keep down the variances.

594
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:39,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

595
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:43,227
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll bring that to the board then do.

596
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:49,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we open to considering a continuance to provide additional information?

597
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:53,335
[SPEAKER_16]: And if so, what specific information areas do we want to cover?

598
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:02,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, we have questions on the financial side of things.

599
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:10,586
[SPEAKER_16]: My concerns with regards to the height of the building, obviously, the setback of 14 feet, things like that.

600
01:08:10,646 --> 01:08:15,171
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to get that information covered in the meeting and discussed because it was raised.

601
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:17,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not have additional questions there.

602
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:33,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Any additional thoughts from the board?

603
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Attorney Desmond, I would put that to you.

604
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to step back, gather that information and come back?

605
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:52,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Or do you want us to proceed with the vote today?

606
01:08:52,982 --> 01:08:54,483
[SPEAKER_16]: You're still on mute.

607
01:08:56,544 --> 01:08:57,124
[SPEAKER_16]: You're still on mute.

608
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:13,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there's also the question of Mary Lee's question of a rendering and whether or not that's determinative to her in terms of making a decision on the matter.

609
01:09:13,406 --> 01:09:28,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that were the case, I'd like the opportunity to provide that to her if that's something in her decision-making that is of consequence.

610
01:09:33,413 --> 01:09:34,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary, can you speak to that?

611
01:09:34,413 --> 01:09:40,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you want to see an updated rendering with better representation of the properties adjacent?

612
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:42,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I would.

613
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:43,716
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be very helpful.

614
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:57,021
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would also like to state that I am inclined and also in agreement with Mike's point at this time.

615
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like that opportunity if that is the case.

616
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

617
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll motion to continue 85 Elm Street to the next regular meeting of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

618
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:21,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a second?

619
01:10:22,959 --> 01:10:23,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

620
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:25,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

621
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:26,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Andre Leroux?

622
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:28,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

623
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:29,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Tarani?

624
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:30,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

625
01:10:31,286 --> 01:10:31,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Calderon?

626
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:32,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

627
01:10:33,404 --> 01:10:36,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee, I, Jamie Thompson.

628
01:10:36,505 --> 01:10:40,867
[SPEAKER_16]: I. Okay, we are continued on 85 Elm Street.

629
01:10:41,147 --> 01:10:41,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

630
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:42,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody for your time.

631
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:43,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

632
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:44,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

633
01:10:44,068 --> 01:10:44,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good night.

634
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:45,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for the folks here.

635
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:46,649
[SPEAKER_14]: They're online.

636
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the meeting will be continuing until January 30th.

637
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,891
[SPEAKER_14]: You can use the exact same code to log on.

638
01:10:54,411 --> 01:11:00,253
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, any other questions to come up and then questions in the interim, please email me at the McDougal at Metro dash.

639
01:11:00,273 --> 01:11:00,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

640
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

641
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:13,224
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could bring us to the next case.

642
01:11:13,244 --> 01:11:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: 970 Fellsway, case number A-2024-26.

643
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:28,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Applicant and owner of the Davis Companies Incorporated to divide the property at 970 Fellsway into two separate parcels, which will involve the demolition of a section of a non-component structure, thus requiring a special permit per the city of Medford Zoning Orders Chapter 94-5.3.

644
01:11:31,457 --> 01:11:33,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Dennis, do we have a representative from the applicant?

645
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:37,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hi Mr. Chair and members of the board.

646
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:39,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.

647
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:41,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.

648
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for seeing us this evening.

649
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:52,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a brief presentation that I can share and run through quickly.

650
01:11:52,237 --> 01:12:02,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm accompanied by Pat Gallagher from Gulsunen Stores, who will assist me in going through the presentation and just running through the technicality of the request.

651
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:08,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will kick it off and do at least just a brief update for everyone.

652
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Can everybody see my screen?

653
01:12:21,787 --> 01:12:22,107
[SPEAKER_00]: We can.

654
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:23,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

655
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:27,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right, so so, yes, thank you again.

656
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:28,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.

657
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:29,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone.

658
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hearing us this evening.

659
01:12:31,742 --> 01:12:46,015
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here specifically to discuss the self storage parcel and go through a specific request just with the nature of that parcel as to kick things off.

660
01:12:46,035 --> 01:12:47,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go through a quick project status update.

661
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:59,641
[SPEAKER_00]: since we last saw each other in the spring and having gone through the comprehensive permit process last year and just letting everybody know sort of where we sit at the moment.

662
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:17,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from a permitting perspective, after completing the comprehensive permit process and having that permit issued by the Medford ZBA in May of 2024, we proceeded with some additional permitting requirements for the project.

663
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: In June, we had our endorsement approved by the community development board, which is related to the presentation this evening, just in the specific of splitting the existing lot and to do separate parcels 1, which would be governed by the comprehensive permit.

664
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:49,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or covered under the comprehensive permit, I should say, for the residential building and then the self storage parcel where the existing self storage building exists and will will remain post demolition and construction of the new residential building.

665
01:13:50,882 --> 01:14:06,788
[SPEAKER_00]: In July, we commenced our application process we filed and then in November, we filed the special permit application that we are discussing this evening and over the course of the months.

666
01:14:08,188 --> 01:14:16,213
[SPEAKER_00]: following our July submission through the fall, through November, through December, we have been working with MEPA and through our filing process there.

667
01:14:16,573 --> 01:14:31,402
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed up with our single environmental impact report in early December, and we'll be continuing that permitting process as we embark into the new year and in through the next couple of months here, hopefully closing that process out.

668
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:39,852
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in the March timeframe is the target, but continuing to work with me, but nonetheless to see that to the end.

669
01:14:41,594 --> 01:14:45,378
[SPEAKER_00]: From a logistical perspective, we are also planning to.

670
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:56,709
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, commence the demolition of the, um, of a portion of this building, which is again related to why we are here this evening.

671
01:14:57,509 --> 01:15:03,054
[SPEAKER_00]: The warehouse building, which is to be demolished for the residential building to be constructed.

672
01:15:03,615 --> 01:15:13,144
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been performing our due diligence there with hazardous materials testing, design, utilities coordination, and are planning to engage with the city

673
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:23,433
[SPEAKER_00]: With the fire department in a coordinated effort to seek a demolition permit and coordinate the takedown of that building in the early part of this year.

674
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:34,043
[SPEAKER_00]: We will commence that coordination process and hopefully beginning that takedown sometime in the, in the, in the March timeframe and then additionally, with respect to the residential building.

675
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:53,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we have, since completing the comprehensive permit, continued and advanced our design with our design team through the fall, taking a break for some pricing exercises, and then recommencing our design effort this winter.

676
01:15:53,976 --> 01:16:02,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect that to take us through much of the first half of 2025, but are excited to continue designing the residential building.

677
01:16:02,942 --> 01:16:04,244
[SPEAKER_00]: To a much more detailed place.

678
01:16:04,404 --> 01:16:16,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So, with that project status update, I will turn it over to Pat Gallagher to run us through the special permit filing summary and some of the details here that we are to discuss this evening.

679
01:16:18,205 --> 01:16:20,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

680
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick Gallagher from Wilson and stores.

681
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:24,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mr. chair and members of the board.

682
01:16:24,331 --> 01:16:27,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you all and Happy New Year.

683
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:33,139
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to, I think, just step back and to emphasize that.

684
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,705
[SPEAKER_04]: As you'll see, we're not here to change any of what was approved in the spring through the comprehensive permit.

685
01:16:43,585 --> 01:16:47,427
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't made any changes to the site plan, site layout.

686
01:16:48,128 --> 01:16:53,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I would characterize this almost in the nature of a technical request for relief.

687
01:16:55,112 --> 01:17:13,652
[SPEAKER_04]: that we are seeking in connection with the demolition of the existing structure, really for the purposes of confirming that the self-storage building that will remain on the easterly part of that lot will remain zoning compliant.

688
01:17:14,872 --> 01:17:22,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, the existing structure, which as you'll recall, occupies most of the lot, is non-conforming.

689
01:17:23,316 --> 01:17:28,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It's currently about a 230,000 square foot structure.

690
01:17:28,339 --> 01:17:34,321
[SPEAKER_04]: It occupies almost 68 percent of the lot.

691
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:39,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the zoning ordinance, as a non-conforming structure, there's a mechanism,

692
01:17:40,204 --> 01:17:47,388
[SPEAKER_04]: to make alterations through the issuance of a special permit, and that's under Section 5.3 of the ordinance.

693
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:49,469
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little bit of an unusual case.

694
01:17:49,809 --> 01:18:01,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally, a special permit for alteration of a non-conforming structure would seek to expand or to make the existing structure larger in some way.

695
01:18:01,214 --> 01:18:03,956
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually looking to make the structure smaller.

696
01:18:05,397 --> 01:18:07,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But nonetheless, we think that this is

697
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:18,203
[SPEAKER_04]: a necessary piece of relief for us to get, again, just to tick and tie and make sure that the structure is staying zoning compliant.

698
01:18:19,184 --> 01:18:20,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Pat, if you can go to the next slide.

699
01:18:27,629 --> 01:18:35,533
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're seeing here is the A&R plan that we had before the Community Development Board in June,

700
01:18:36,256 --> 01:18:46,982
[SPEAKER_04]: John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): And in our plan being an approval not required plan, and this is simply to divide what was previously one large lot into two separate lots.

701
01:18:47,602 --> 01:18:59,148
[SPEAKER_04]: John Vars, Applicant OLIV, PB – He, Him, His): This is the same as the plan that was previewed with this board prior to approval of the comprehensive permit plan comprehensive permit for.

702
01:18:59,978 --> 01:19:03,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The multifamily project that will be going forward on a lot to.

703
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:10,507
[SPEAKER_04]: As shown on the and our lot 3 is the easterly lot where the self storage useful remain.

704
01:19:11,628 --> 01:19:16,311
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason there is no 1 shown on the plan is because the existing a lot.

705
01:19:18,033 --> 01:19:23,456
[SPEAKER_04]: was depicted as lot one on the existing as a record plan.

706
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:31,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot one that anyone's missing or that they were hiding on there.

707
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:36,464
[SPEAKER_04]: This was endorsed as not requiring approval under the subdivision control law.

708
01:19:37,425 --> 01:19:43,789
[SPEAKER_04]: In June, we haven't recorded this A&R plan yet, but we'll do so before starting demolition.

709
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Pat, if you can go to the next slide.

710
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this will look familiar to you all.

711
01:19:55,682 --> 01:20:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: This is depicting on the right-hand side, the 40B project that was approved, or on the left-hand side, I'm sorry, the 40B project on the right-hand easterly side, what will remain as a self-storage property.

712
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:18,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the plan is to demolish the existing building up to the line that's shown here.

713
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:32,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why we are demolishing to that point, it was very deliberately thought through where we drew the lot line and where the

714
01:20:33,344 --> 01:20:34,645
[SPEAKER_04]: demolition line would be.

715
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:41,407
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for that is we wanted to maintain the status quo in terms of that existing nonconformity.

716
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:46,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So under the zoning ordinance, there is a 50% maximum lot coverage.

717
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:51,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, the building is, as I mentioned earlier, almost 68%, 67.9%.

718
01:20:54,753 --> 01:21:00,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're proposing to do is to demolish so much of the building that the

719
01:21:01,055 --> 01:21:09,463
[SPEAKER_04]: resulting building footprint on the newly created lot 3 would also equal 67.9 percent.

720
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:19,173
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeking to maintain exactly the existing non-conforming lot coverage ratio that is currently on the entire site.

721
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, and that's shown how to go to the next slide.

722
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:34,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, again, this will be a plan that will look familiar to the board, but this is just another illustration of what we are proposing to do.

723
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and.

724
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:51,093
[SPEAKER_04]: under the zoning ordinance, this type of change is permitted through a special permit so long as the change is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing non-conforming structure.

725
01:21:51,133 --> 01:21:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the key point here is that we are not making any changes to the self-storage building along the Fellsway frontage.

726
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,182
[SPEAKER_04]: To the extent it's currently within

727
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: the front yard set back there.

728
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:07,271
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no changes along Fells Way.

729
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: The only changes to the building will be the demolition.

730
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for that reason, we feel that the demolition and maintaining the existing status quo is not substantially more detrimental than what is there today.

731
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'm happy to take any questions from the board.

732
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

733
01:22:29,962 --> 01:22:30,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Patrick.

734
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:32,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions from the board?

735
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, we will go to public comment.

736
01:22:51,962 --> 01:22:57,584
[SPEAKER_16]: If anybody on Zoom would like to ask a question or comment, please raise your hand.

737
01:22:58,764 --> 01:23:04,026
[SPEAKER_16]: You can also submit a comment to Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

738
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:10,589
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's D-M-A-C-D-O-U-G-A-L-L at medford-ma.gov.

739
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Not seeing any hands raised on Zoom.

740
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:33,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis, do you have any emails currently or did anything come in that hadn't been submitted to the board yet?

741
01:23:37,885 --> 01:23:38,665
[SPEAKER_14]: No, nothing has come in.

742
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:41,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

743
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:43,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair awaits a motion.

744
01:23:44,828 --> 01:23:47,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

745
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a second?

746
01:23:51,771 --> 01:23:52,271
[SPEAKER_16]: I second.

747
01:23:53,432 --> 01:23:53,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

748
01:23:55,313 --> 01:23:55,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Caldera?

749
01:23:58,303 --> 01:24:14,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I. I. I. I. I. I. Any thoughts from the board on this.

750
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:22,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I agree with attorney Gallagher's characterization here I think this is a.

751
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:25,644
[SPEAKER_07]: really a technical relief being sought.

752
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:33,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is required, but I think it clearly meets the no substantial detriment standard.

753
01:24:33,426 --> 01:24:39,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm comfortable granting the special permit in this case.

754
01:24:40,348 --> 01:24:41,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll put it this way.

755
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:44,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike.

756
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:48,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Chair, can we just stop sharing the screen so we can see everybody?

757
01:24:49,671 --> 01:24:49,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

758
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:50,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can do that.

759
01:24:53,989 --> 01:24:54,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

760
01:24:55,209 --> 01:24:56,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll just throw in my 2 cents.

761
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is an easy 1 very.

762
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Straightforward doesn't change anything.

763
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:06,272
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew this was happening in regards to a program.

764
01:25:06,312 --> 01:25:07,772
[SPEAKER_06]: We reviewed extensively.

765
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:11,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

766
01:25:15,354 --> 01:25:16,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other comments or questions from the board.

767
01:25:21,974 --> 01:25:23,535
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

768
01:25:24,476 --> 01:25:25,657
[SPEAKER_16]: There awaits a motion.

769
01:25:26,398 --> 01:25:36,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll motion to find that the proposed alteration is not substantially more detrimental and to approve the special permit.

770
01:25:37,827 --> 01:25:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

771
01:25:39,688 --> 01:25:40,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Michael and Andre.

772
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Tarani?

773
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:43,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

774
01:25:44,512 --> 01:25:44,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee?

775
01:25:44,992 --> 01:25:46,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

776
01:25:47,154 --> 01:25:47,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Andre Leroux?

777
01:25:48,315 --> 01:25:48,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

778
01:25:49,296 --> 01:25:49,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Caldera?

779
01:25:50,477 --> 01:25:50,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

780
01:25:51,373 --> 01:25:54,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie Thompson, I thank you everybody for your time.

781
01:25:55,696 --> 01:25:56,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, take care.

782
01:25:57,097 --> 01:25:57,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

783
01:25:58,378 --> 01:26:07,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Artie, just for Attorney Gallagher, if you could draft a, like do a draft of this decision and forward that to me, that would help expedite getting it through the process.

784
01:26:08,484 --> 01:26:09,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to do so.

785
01:26:10,705 --> 01:26:11,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everyone.

786
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:16,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everyone.

787
01:26:17,129 --> 01:26:19,891
[SPEAKER_16]: And Dennis, could you move us to the next case?

788
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:20,692
[SPEAKER_16]: 7 Grant.

789
01:26:22,788 --> 01:26:26,391
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 grant Avenue case number a dash 2024-27.

790
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:33,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Applicant and owner Michael lane her hand to build a single family drawing and newly created a lot requiring a variant test a lot with a lot area.

791
01:26:34,175 --> 01:26:38,578
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a lot for the city methods on the chapter 94 table be able to mention requirements.

792
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

793
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:44,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

794
01:26:44,577 --> 01:26:50,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, good morning, Mr. chair members of the board attorney Michael Cabral for the applicants Michael and Elaine Horahan.

795
01:26:51,519 --> 01:26:53,820
[SPEAKER_12]: This is 7 grant of.

796
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:01,122
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a large single family lot of 9500 square feet by way of some brief background.

797
01:27:01,682 --> 01:27:02,803
[SPEAKER_12]: We did go before.

798
01:27:03,563 --> 01:27:08,545
[SPEAKER_12]: community development, I believe it was back in September, we proposed an A&R plan.

799
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:23,712
[SPEAKER_12]: That plan was endorsed, dividing this into two separate lots now with the existing house being on 5,000 square feet and thus leaving 4,500 square feet for the new lot.

800
01:27:26,694 --> 01:27:27,534
[SPEAKER_12]: May I share my screen?

801
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:44,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so we have 7, we have Brandt Ave here at the top.

802
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:47,282
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the existing structure here.

803
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:51,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And this leaves the 5,000 square foot conforming lot here.

804
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:57,325
[SPEAKER_12]: The dotted line here would be the new separating line between the lots.

805
01:27:58,006 --> 01:28:00,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Lot number 2 here is the newly created lot.

806
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:03,808
[SPEAKER_12]: This is now a vacant lot here.

807
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:08,691
[SPEAKER_12]: our clients proposing to put a single family structure on the lot.

808
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:15,617
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an SF2 zone, 5,000 square feet is required, but the single family is allowed as of right.

809
01:28:16,017 --> 01:28:24,644
[SPEAKER_12]: The variance that are required here would be for lot width because again we're short 500 square feet and the lot width here

810
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:27,287
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, requires 50 feet.

811
01:28:27,788 --> 01:28:30,491
[SPEAKER_12]: We only have, uh, it's 46 feet in change.

812
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:33,215
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need about six feet of lot width as well.

813
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:35,177
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are the deficiencies.

814
01:28:36,138 --> 01:28:40,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, historic, these, these actually have been two lots and

815
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:50,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Briefly, this is my client's deed showing lots 11 and 14, and that actually carries over to the assessor's plan as well.

816
01:28:50,674 --> 01:28:55,136
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the assessor's plan, lots 11 and 14.

817
01:28:55,176 --> 01:29:00,758
[SPEAKER_12]: The assessor actually even has the lots as originally constituted, 47.50 as one lot, 47.50 as the second.

818
01:29:00,778 --> 01:29:02,999
[SPEAKER_12]: The uses would actually be keeping in conformity

819
01:29:09,741 --> 01:29:18,405
[SPEAKER_12]: with the neighborhood as well, because as you can see just on this block alone, I don't believe there are any 5,000-square-foot lots here.

820
01:29:19,085 --> 01:29:25,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And even across, I looked before the hearing here, there's only one 5,000-square-foot lot across the street here.

821
01:29:25,888 --> 01:29:27,428
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest of these are all under 5,000.

822
01:29:27,689 --> 01:29:29,509
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, most are around 4,500.

823
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:41,318
[SPEAKER_12]: closer to 4,000 around here, which would be in conformity with the newly created lot that our clients are proposing at this time as well.

824
01:29:41,358 --> 01:29:52,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, they would be dimensionally conforming for a front yard, conforming on both setbacks here, actually giving a buffer to this neighbor as well of a few more feet.

825
01:29:52,547 --> 01:29:53,207
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 13 feet here.

826
01:29:54,568 --> 01:29:57,409
[SPEAKER_12]: on the side yard, where only seven and a half would be required.

827
01:29:57,849 --> 01:30:00,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Our client's going to continue to reside at the property as well.

828
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:10,512
[SPEAKER_12]: They've lived here for over 30 years, so they've had this lot in the state for quite a while, but they're looking to make the highest and best use of the lot.

829
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:14,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, it is an oddly shaped lot, sort of based on, again,

830
01:30:15,133 --> 01:30:16,874
[SPEAKER_12]: the lots in the neighborhood as well.

831
01:30:17,315 --> 01:30:23,519
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably the largest lot in the neighborhood, clearly being two lots at one point in time.

832
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:28,922
[SPEAKER_12]: So this would restore the lots to what was close to what the original configuration is.

833
01:30:29,363 --> 01:30:39,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, the reason we kept this one larger is that the 5,000 square feet would keep the existing lot here as conforming so that no additional relief

834
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,231
[SPEAKER_12]: would be needed for the existing house lot.

835
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:46,053
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see here there is an existing deck pool here.

836
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:52,936
[SPEAKER_12]: All this would be taken off to make sure that this existing structure meets the side yard setbacks on here.

837
01:30:57,818 --> 01:31:01,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm happy to answer any questions the board has as well or get into

838
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:09,852
[SPEAKER_12]: the nature of the variances, hardships, anything else the board would like to hear or know about the property.

839
01:31:11,653 --> 01:31:12,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Attorney Cabral.

840
01:31:14,714 --> 01:31:15,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions from the board?

841
01:31:26,317 --> 01:31:27,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is Andre.

842
01:31:28,766 --> 01:31:31,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if you could just speak a little bit about why you're setting.

843
01:31:32,547 --> 01:31:36,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the proposed new dwelling would be set so far back.

844
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:47,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't say exactly other than the lot line here does come into.

845
01:31:48,895 --> 01:31:50,116
[SPEAKER_12]: This lot a bit here.

846
01:31:50,516 --> 01:32:06,589
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to meet the setback, with the closest portion being 7.6 feet here, I'm wondering if it would actually not meet the side yard setback if it was brought up towards the street a bit as well.

847
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Originally there was parking here in the front.

848
01:32:11,252 --> 01:32:12,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that there was a concern of

849
01:32:13,474 --> 01:32:15,016
[SPEAKER_12]: the planning board and building commissioners.

850
01:32:15,056 --> 01:32:20,341
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've made the single drive aisle instead and had parking down this side.

851
01:32:21,422 --> 01:32:21,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you.

852
01:32:21,923 --> 01:32:28,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andre.

853
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the board?

854
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:33,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike, go ahead.

855
01:32:36,419 --> 01:32:41,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Attorney Cabral, could you talk a little bit about the hardship here?

856
01:32:42,213 --> 01:32:43,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, certainly.

857
01:32:43,275 --> 01:32:44,057
[SPEAKER_12]: So again,

858
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:51,743
[SPEAKER_12]: The lot certainly being oversized, we would characterize that as being the oddly shaped lot here.

859
01:32:52,244 --> 01:32:59,126
[SPEAKER_12]: The hardship being that single families are allowed in the district relative to other lots here.

860
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:06,069
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be approximately the same size or even larger than a lot of the single family lots in the neighborhood.

861
01:33:06,089 --> 01:33:07,450
[SPEAKER_12]: They would be deprived of use.

862
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:12,973
[SPEAKER_12]: of the lot for its highest and best use as a single family.

863
01:33:12,993 --> 01:33:17,416
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was kept as is, it's really an underutilized lot.

864
01:33:17,857 --> 01:33:21,539
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that the city's looking for additional housing units as well.

865
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:32,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly would benefit our client financially into their retirement as well, having lived here for over 30 years and looking to remain in the city as well.

866
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, the

867
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:55,265
[SPEAKER_12]: lot being 4,500 square feet, certainly significant relative to the neighborhood and certainly in conformance with the neighborhood as well when looking at both properties on the same block and around the neighborhood also.

868
01:33:57,218 --> 01:33:57,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

869
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:00,160
[SPEAKER_07]: And then next question.

870
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:08,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So prior to the A&R being endorsed from a zoning standpoint, was this considered one or two lots?

871
01:34:09,846 --> 01:34:12,848
[SPEAKER_12]: From a zoning perspective, it would have been considered one lot.

872
01:34:13,609 --> 01:34:13,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

873
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:16,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And then last question.

874
01:34:17,011 --> 01:34:22,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the Community Development Board endorses an A&R, are they

875
01:34:26,612 --> 01:34:30,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they endorsing the buildability of the

876
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,633
[SPEAKER_07]: of each of the lots, or are they just endorsing something else?

877
01:34:35,073 --> 01:34:54,456
[SPEAKER_12]: No, just endorsing it as to that these two lots meet the minimum necessary for frontage to be considered a lot on a public way in Medford, but it does not give any opinion or determination as to the buildability or zoning compliance of the lot itself.

878
01:34:54,836 --> 01:34:59,657
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a separate consideration that must be come before the zoning board for determination.

879
01:35:00,097 --> 01:35:00,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

880
01:35:02,311 --> 01:35:03,658
[SPEAKER_16]: And Danielle, I see your hands raised.

881
01:35:05,152 --> 01:35:06,313
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to address that question.

882
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Daniel Evans, senior planner.

883
01:35:08,074 --> 01:35:14,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to chime in that the Community Development Board is actually obligated to endorse it.

884
01:35:14,599 --> 01:35:23,326
[SPEAKER_01]: If it meets minimum frontage, it fronts on a way and has reasonable and adequate access to the lots, then they must be endorsed.

885
01:35:23,906 --> 01:35:33,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and even, you know, we have this, you know, the conceptual where the footprint would be and where the parking spaces would be, but I don't think that

886
01:35:35,495 --> 01:35:39,418
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential development would be married to that.

887
01:35:39,478 --> 01:35:49,205
[SPEAKER_01]: They could change it and should also add that it's very possible that this could be by right at the end of the fiscal year.

888
01:35:50,225 --> 01:36:01,073
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rewriting the zoning and on the table is definitely reducing minimum lot sizes across the board to at least bring them closer in line with the existing built environment.

889
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems silly to

890
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:14,124
[SPEAKER_01]: not be able to divide a lot and build on it if that is the development pattern throughout the neighborhood, which has shown not to be detrimental.

891
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:26,486
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something for you to take into consideration, but just some background information of where the city is going as far as the lot sizes.

892
01:36:31,447 --> 01:36:31,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

893
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:36,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Any additional questions from the board?

894
01:36:36,429 --> 01:36:44,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we'll move to public comment.

895
01:36:45,732 --> 01:36:49,233
[SPEAKER_16]: If anybody from the public would like to speak on this, please raise your hand on Zoom.

896
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:54,934
[SPEAKER_16]: You can email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

897
01:36:55,295 --> 01:37:00,296
[SPEAKER_16]: D-M-A-C-D-O-U-G-A-L-L at medford-ma.gov.

898
01:37:07,595 --> 01:37:21,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. chair just add as well that client has proposed a relatively modest dwelling here on the lot getting to I think Mr. LaRue's question as well so this is partially to sort of decrease some of the density here as well leaving the large

899
01:37:22,807 --> 01:37:26,748
[SPEAKER_12]: front yard, as well as a 20 foot rear yard as well.

900
01:37:27,468 --> 01:37:38,351
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, our client being in this lot living here, giving the buffer more to this neighbor, the structure would be roughly, I believe around here.

901
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:40,811
[SPEAKER_12]: So giving the buffer to this neighbor as well.

902
01:37:41,212 --> 01:37:46,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So not as to build up on any of the neighbors to the rear or to the side.

903
01:37:50,594 --> 01:37:50,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:37:51,959 --> 01:37:57,761
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not see any hand raised Dennis did you receive anything in the mail or was there anything received prior to the meeting.

905
01:38:01,102 --> 01:38:03,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing received prior to the meeting and nothing in my inbox.

906
01:38:05,323 --> 01:38:07,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

907
01:38:07,964 --> 01:38:09,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair awaits a motion.

908
01:38:10,485 --> 01:38:13,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

909
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Mike do we have a second?

910
01:38:17,827 --> 01:38:18,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

911
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:19,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Mary.

912
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Torani?

913
01:38:22,253 --> 01:38:24,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Michael there.

914
01:38:24,095 --> 01:38:26,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, under the room.

915
01:38:26,417 --> 01:38:28,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Mary Lee.

916
01:38:28,339 --> 01:38:31,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Jamie Thompson.

917
01:38:31,122 --> 01:38:31,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

918
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,065
[SPEAKER_16]: What's everybody think.

919
01:38:34,085 --> 01:38:43,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.

920
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:51,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that these variances are reasonable.

921
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:54,143
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't deal with any setbacks.

922
01:38:54,203 --> 01:38:57,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really just the lot area and lot width.

923
01:38:58,331 --> 01:38:59,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And given the fact that this

924
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:08,389
[SPEAKER_06]: has been historically two lots, I think gives me a lot of confidence.

925
01:39:08,469 --> 01:39:30,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say in terms of the hardship, I agree with the attorney about there being a highest and best use that currently is not possible to achieve given the current zoning regulations and that I see no detriment to the neighborhood with this.

926
01:39:33,598 --> 01:39:34,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andre.

927
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:39,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Mike.

928
01:39:41,203 --> 01:39:42,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

929
01:39:44,105 --> 01:39:48,008
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, philosophically, I mostly agree with Andre.

930
01:39:49,549 --> 01:39:57,634
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the law and the precedent, my concerns are twofold.

931
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:01,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So, prior to the ANR,

932
01:40:02,657 --> 01:40:09,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an oversized lot that probably merged under the merger doctrine or something.

933
01:40:10,341 --> 01:40:16,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And having an oversized lot in and of itself isn't a hardship.

934
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:29,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with the ANR, the subdivision, the now second lot, is

935
01:40:31,937 --> 01:40:41,642
[SPEAKER_07]: non-conforming, is under the minimum dimensional requirements, and it's a self-created hardship.

936
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:44,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So there isn't a need to subdivide the lot.

937
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:50,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a choice, choice made with knowledge that the lot isn't buildable.

938
01:40:50,606 --> 01:40:57,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the highest and best use under the current zoning ordinance of this new subdivided lot is nothing.

939
01:41:01,423 --> 01:41:02,384
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my concern.

940
01:41:02,404 --> 01:41:08,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the ordinance itself can't be the hardship.

941
01:41:09,529 --> 01:41:12,932
[SPEAKER_07]: City is exploring changing the area.

942
01:41:14,873 --> 01:41:24,920
[SPEAKER_07]: But under the current ordinance, which is what we have to make this decision under, the intent is that 5,000 is the minimum area.

943
01:41:30,857 --> 01:41:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: the applicant created a lot that is less than that.

944
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, there was no alternate way to split it to have two conforming lots, but that's why they merged under the merger doctrine.

945
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:54,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I don't think it meets the statutory requirements to grant a variance.

946
01:41:59,756 --> 01:42:00,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mike.

947
01:42:05,358 --> 01:42:06,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other comments from the board?

948
01:42:07,358 --> 01:42:07,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Questions?

949
01:42:21,042 --> 01:42:21,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

950
01:42:22,243 --> 01:42:23,783
[SPEAKER_16]: So I

951
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:32,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I am in a similar space to both Andre and I could think it's from a neighborhood perspective.

952
01:42:32,465 --> 01:42:41,192
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a in line with the use of the neighborhood, but I'm challenged by the existing zoning requirements.

953
01:42:42,293 --> 01:42:48,117
[SPEAKER_16]: It is creating a hardship that the at will by the split.

954
01:42:56,898 --> 01:43:00,700
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree the highest, where I was looking for highest and best use.

955
01:43:11,267 --> 01:43:16,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one is challenging me.

956
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Andre, go ahead.

957
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:20,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I just add a little bit more.

958
01:43:21,012 --> 01:43:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know,

959
01:43:22,832 --> 01:43:40,642
[SPEAKER_06]: From my vantage of working with different communities across the state, I know that the variances in Massachusetts, there's a wide range in how municipalities administer variances and interpret hardship.

960
01:43:46,896 --> 01:43:57,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very, very high standard and if we were to, there are some communities which almost don't allow any variances and there are other communities which allow

961
01:43:58,406 --> 01:44:01,587
[SPEAKER_06]: all kinds of variances depending on how they interpret it.

962
01:44:02,108 --> 01:44:13,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is, so we have, so my point here is that we have a little bit of subjectivity that we can, you know, use.

963
01:44:13,332 --> 01:44:25,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think given some common sense that I think that this makes a lot of sense to, you know, that interpret this as a,

964
01:44:28,327 --> 01:44:32,429
[SPEAKER_06]: a hardship because this lot is very different than all the other lots in the neighborhood.

965
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it is essentially preventing a home from being built where a home should be in this neighborhood.

966
01:44:43,475 --> 01:44:49,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So just not to kind of get in our own way, I would be supportive of these variances.

967
01:44:56,203 --> 01:44:56,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Andrew.

968
01:45:00,282 --> 01:45:07,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, the history of the lots, and trying to find a hardship in this situation is the difficult part.

969
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:21,387
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the history of the property, obviously the initial intent of the property, and potentially the future intent of the property are growth and development.

970
01:45:23,907 --> 01:45:26,228
[SPEAKER_16]: The merging of the lots,

971
01:45:28,612 --> 01:45:34,135
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like, you're better on this side of it than I am.

972
01:45:34,736 --> 01:45:39,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you consider the merger of the lots the hardship?

973
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:43,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that was not an intended action by the owner.

974
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:56,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know the full history of the lot, but merger doctrine,

975
01:45:57,942 --> 01:46:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: has to do with lots that were held in common ownership.

976
01:46:01,084 --> 01:46:25,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so, uh, I don't remember off the top of my head the exact, um, amount of time or whatever that needed to elapse before this happened, but essentially since together or since separate, they weren't, uh, buildable after, you know, whichever zoning change was passed to set the dimensional requirements, they just merged.

977
01:46:25,437 --> 01:46:26,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, um,

978
01:46:27,657 --> 01:46:50,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's certainly opinions from the court that indicate that merely waiting to build and then having suddenly becoming nonconforming is in of itself a hardship.

979
01:46:50,273 --> 01:46:56,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what happened in Raya versus Board of Appeals of North Reading.

980
01:46:57,903 --> 01:47:00,484
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 1976.

981
01:47:03,045 --> 01:47:10,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, I totally understand Andre's perspective on this.

982
01:47:11,229 --> 01:47:16,791
[SPEAKER_07]: There is some amount of subjectivity in these decisions.

983
01:47:16,851 --> 01:47:21,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think the closest case law I'm aware of

984
01:47:22,888 --> 01:47:29,270
[SPEAKER_07]: on that specific question is the Raya versus Board of Appeals North Reading.

985
01:47:37,433 --> 01:47:50,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did not have any, from what I know, we've had no letters of support or lack or against from the community.

986
01:47:51,037 --> 01:47:52,598
[SPEAKER_16]: And we didn't have any public feedback here.

987
01:47:54,406 --> 01:47:54,467
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

988
01:47:54,547 --> 01:48:02,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's.

989
01:48:17,258 --> 01:48:23,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to make a motion unless Jim and Mary want to jump in with their opinions first.

990
01:48:24,284 --> 01:48:25,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

991
01:48:25,865 --> 01:48:33,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I tried to Google it and try to get a visual perspective, but it was all blurred.

992
01:48:33,671 --> 01:48:34,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't see anything.

993
01:48:34,912 --> 01:48:44,760
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am inclined to really agree with what Mike was saying because

994
01:48:46,016 --> 01:48:57,238
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, this, this originally this plot was non-conforming and then it was conformed.

995
01:48:57,718 --> 01:49:10,240
[SPEAKER_11]: But once they're making a request due to this hardship, self-created hardship, and once, if it's approved, then it becomes non-conforming.

996
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't make much sense.

997
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:20,422
[SPEAKER_11]: in terms of the, for the benefit of the community.

998
01:49:22,502 --> 01:49:32,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And also when I try to really just take a look at what this picture is, I couldn't see it on Google.

999
01:49:39,807 --> 01:49:43,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Chair, would it help if I brought back up the overhead

1000
01:49:45,650 --> 01:50:12,554
[SPEAKER_12]: of the image to show where the existing structure is located relative to the lot line, because that may give some assistance as to why the existing structure is located on the lot, where it is, if that would help Mary sort of conceptually understand the lots and where the existing structure is relative to the lot lines.

1001
01:50:14,852 --> 01:50:17,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I can pull it up on Google Maps, Mary.

1002
01:50:17,733 --> 01:50:21,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if you want, I can share my screen if you need to see that.

1003
01:50:21,814 --> 01:50:29,257
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's definitely in line with the rest of the homes in the neighborhood.

1004
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:38,600
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, Mr. Chair, this is the existing structure here being set back

1005
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:59,404
[SPEAKER_12]: So being closest to this lot line here, giving the bulk of the setback and open space in the lot to this side, clearly being this would have been the second lot, so to speak, that was proposed.

1006
01:51:00,808 --> 01:51:11,037
[SPEAKER_12]: at the time that these lots were created, again, being 4,750 square feet per lot on here.

1007
01:51:11,077 --> 01:51:25,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can see the existing structure set more towards this side of the lot, clearly anticipating at some point that this vacant lot would have been built upon, but it just certainly wasn't at the time.

1008
01:51:29,378 --> 01:51:32,619
[SPEAKER_12]: as the board said, came into common ownership at that point.

1009
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:48,543
[SPEAKER_12]: In theory, we could have tried to restore these to the existing 4750 to 4750, but now you're creating a situation where we're asking now for an additional variance for the existing house lot.

1010
01:51:48,603 --> 01:51:58,625
[SPEAKER_12]: So trying to keep this existing lot in conformity with all current zoning dimensional requirements, and that's just leaving the

1011
01:51:59,685 --> 01:52:12,035
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, lot area around here and lot width, as the board knows, and we've been before the board before on this, but lot width tends to be a continuing issue for whether it's single families or two families.

1012
01:52:12,635 --> 01:52:21,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, again, that just leaving really a shortage of 500 square feet on the newly created lot here.

1013
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:25,224
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope that that helps sort of orient

1014
01:52:26,305 --> 01:52:31,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, the board as to where the existing structure does sit relative to the overall lot size.

1015
01:52:32,967 --> 01:52:35,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, let me just share my screen.

1016
01:52:35,587 --> 01:52:36,507
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got it on.

1017
01:52:37,808 --> 01:52:38,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Google maps here.

1018
01:52:38,668 --> 01:52:41,389
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1019
01:52:41,409 --> 01:52:41,969
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be great.

1020
01:52:43,149 --> 01:52:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So that helps.

1021
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:45,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

1022
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:54,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay, I think that that that the blur is what I saw the 1 on the left.

1023
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:55,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1024
01:52:56,503 --> 01:53:02,428
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're going to take the deck and then pull out and this will be the 4,500 square foot.

1025
01:53:02,468 --> 01:53:02,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1026
01:53:02,988 --> 01:53:15,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1027
01:53:20,303 --> 01:53:20,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Jim, go ahead.

1028
01:53:21,544 --> 01:53:22,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree with Andre.

1029
01:53:23,733 --> 01:53:34,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a house would do well on that lot and would complement the neighborhood and better use for the land that exists.

1030
01:53:43,501 --> 01:53:44,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Jim.

1031
01:53:44,201 --> 01:53:45,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Mary.

1032
01:53:47,545 --> 01:53:50,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So what will be the ramifications?

1033
01:53:50,226 --> 01:53:50,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I missed that.

1034
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:58,548
[SPEAKER_11]: What will be the ramifications of the non-conforming lot for a building of a new structure?

1035
01:54:00,108 --> 01:54:08,391
[SPEAKER_16]: So the structure that's proposed on the lot is conforming with the setback requirements.

1036
01:54:11,034 --> 01:54:20,601
[SPEAKER_16]: To the city planner Evans point that, you know, in the future, if it does not develop them, you know, those setbacks and those development options may change.

1037
01:54:21,282 --> 01:54:24,444
[SPEAKER_16]: But as it's being presented to us today, the building would be.

1038
01:54:25,345 --> 01:54:30,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Compliant with zoning it's the area and the lot with that are our concerns.

1039
01:54:33,912 --> 01:54:34,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1040
01:54:36,248 --> 01:54:45,493
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's strictly the size of the lot in square footage and the front yard width and the width of the lot, the new lot.

1041
01:54:45,513 --> 01:54:54,638
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, any other questions from the board?

1042
01:54:54,658 --> 01:55:00,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Chair awaits a motion.

1043
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:10,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to motion to approve the variances for lot width and size and area.

1044
01:55:11,354 --> 01:55:11,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1045
01:55:13,296 --> 01:55:14,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1046
01:55:15,797 --> 01:55:16,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee.

1047
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:17,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1048
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Under the rule.

1049
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:20,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1050
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:20,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1051
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:20,721
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1052
01:55:21,721 --> 01:55:22,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie Thompson.

1053
01:55:32,287 --> 01:55:32,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everybody.

1054
01:55:34,548 --> 01:55:36,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis, could you go over the next steps for them?

1055
01:55:43,691 --> 01:55:48,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I apologize.

1056
01:55:48,153 --> 01:55:54,275
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought I heard some sirens and I was getting kind of spooked and then the light in the side room went off and I'm the only one here.

1057
01:55:54,615 --> 01:55:57,717
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm not going to lie to you, I didn't really hear what happened.

1058
01:55:58,577 --> 01:56:01,118
[SPEAKER_14]: My throat started because I got a little

1059
01:56:02,162 --> 01:56:02,442
[SPEAKER_14]: scared.

1060
01:56:03,843 --> 01:56:08,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, we did approve, um, the variances for seven grand to have.

1061
01:56:09,927 --> 01:56:10,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1062
01:56:10,188 --> 01:56:13,390
[SPEAKER_16]: What was the vote?

1063
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:13,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, 41.

1064
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:14,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1065
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:17,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one was, uh, Mike.

1066
01:56:18,373 --> 01:56:18,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1067
01:56:18,633 --> 01:56:18,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1068
01:56:19,174 --> 01:56:19,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

1069
01:56:20,397 --> 01:56:23,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's the reality, I think.

1070
01:56:23,618 --> 01:56:32,180
[SPEAKER_14]: They just put in these new lights and the sensors are very, very active, but I shouldn't be able to set it off in my office.

1071
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:34,281
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I kind of went a little off.

1072
01:56:34,521 --> 01:56:36,141
[SPEAKER_14]: So, all right.

1073
01:56:36,161 --> 01:56:44,964
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Attorney Cabral, if you could write up a draft decision and get it to me, the sooner you get that, the sooner I can check it out and get everything done and we can get this in.

1074
01:56:45,024 --> 01:56:49,625
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, as you all know, then once the decision has been signed and filed in the clerk's office,

1075
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:55,850
[SPEAKER_14]: That creates a 20 days appeals period and upon the completion of that 20 days appeals period, they can get their permit.

1076
01:56:57,191 --> 01:56:58,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, as long as there's no appeal, I should say.

1077
01:57:00,692 --> 01:57:01,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Will do.

1078
01:57:01,872 --> 01:57:02,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all.

1079
01:57:03,693 --> 01:57:03,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1080
01:57:04,653 --> 01:57:05,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy New Year.

1081
01:57:06,594 --> 01:57:08,395
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy New Year, and thank you for your time.

1082
01:57:11,616 --> 01:57:13,617
[SPEAKER_16]: We have one other case, 612-614 Main Street.

1083
01:57:15,909 --> 01:57:16,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

1084
01:57:16,289 --> 01:57:29,700
[SPEAKER_14]: 612213 Main Street, case number A-2024-28, applicant and owner Keith Fallon to convert a commercial unit and existing structure with two additional residential units to a residential unit, creating a three-unit residential structure in a general residence district.

1085
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:34,444
[SPEAKER_14]: It was not allowed for the City of Medford zoning ordinance, chapter 94, table A, table of use and parking regulations.

1086
01:57:37,006 --> 01:57:37,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis.

1087
01:57:37,607 --> 01:57:40,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1088
01:57:40,209 --> 01:57:41,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Keith Fallon.

1089
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:42,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the owner.

1090
01:57:43,922 --> 01:57:45,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Keith.

1091
01:57:45,543 --> 01:57:46,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.

1092
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:47,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1093
01:57:47,625 --> 01:57:48,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

1094
01:57:48,766 --> 01:57:50,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry you had to stay so late.

1095
01:57:51,729 --> 01:57:55,732
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is an existing two-family building with a commercial unit attached to it.

1096
01:57:56,452 --> 01:58:01,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm looking for a special permit to change the commercial unit into a residential unit.

1097
01:58:02,097 --> 01:58:05,420
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in keeping with the characteristics of the neighborhood.

1098
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,883
[SPEAKER_13]: There's very few, if any, commercial buildings in this area.

1099
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:17,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I have letters of support from my two immediate neighbors and I'm asking for your consideration this evening to do this.

1100
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Keith.

1101
01:58:24,633 --> 01:58:34,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want us to share any of the content that you sent over so you can give us an overview of the property's current state and what you plan to do with the property?

1102
01:58:43,273 --> 01:58:44,554
[SPEAKER_16]: To start with the plot plan.

1103
01:59:00,744 --> 01:59:01,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we there?

1104
01:59:02,205 --> 01:59:02,325
Yep.

1105
01:59:06,176 --> 01:59:13,701
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I may say a couple of things, I'm not proposing to make any changes to the exterior of the building.

1106
01:59:14,401 --> 01:59:16,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's already an existing non-conforming.

1107
01:59:17,523 --> 01:59:26,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't propose to change the footprint or add any additional square footage to the existing building.

1108
01:59:29,111 --> 01:59:29,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a change of usage.

1109
01:59:31,772 --> 01:59:32,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, perfect.

1110
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:36,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the board have any questions for the applicant?

1111
01:59:40,531 --> 01:59:41,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Andre, go ahead.

1112
01:59:42,092 --> 01:59:42,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Mr. Fallon.

1113
01:59:44,133 --> 01:59:50,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Just looking at the street view of the property, it does look very commercial.

1114
01:59:50,615 --> 01:59:53,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be changing the exterior at all?

1115
01:59:56,097 --> 02:00:03,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little strange to just turn it into a residential unit.

1116
02:00:04,167 --> 02:00:13,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so I'm also a licensed contractor and I bought this building 12 years ago and it was in really bad shape and I renovated it.

1117
02:00:13,357 --> 02:00:20,145
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a pizza parlor there originally and the two residential units were really in dire condition.

1118
02:00:20,225 --> 02:00:25,551
[SPEAKER_13]: So the facade you see, the current facade is something I added to the building when I renovated it.

1119
02:00:26,478 --> 02:00:37,367
[SPEAKER_13]: And assuming I get your permissions to make this change, I will make what the existing commercial unit hopefully becomes residential.

1120
02:00:37,427 --> 02:00:40,430
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make it blend in better with the residential unit.

1121
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:41,571
[SPEAKER_13]: So those windows will go.

1122
02:00:41,671 --> 02:00:43,352
[SPEAKER_13]: They are commercial-grade windows.

1123
02:00:43,432 --> 02:00:46,094
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be residential-looking in appearance, absolutely.

1124
02:00:50,178 --> 02:00:50,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1125
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:53,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike, go ahead.

1126
02:00:55,230 --> 02:01:00,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mr. Fallon, you mentioned letters of support from two of the immediate neighbors.

1127
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:04,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So which neighbors were those?

1128
02:01:05,677 --> 02:01:11,841
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you look at the building, the property to the right, the Oliveras, they've owned that building.

1129
02:01:11,901 --> 02:01:13,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Their building a little bit larger than I've owned mine.

1130
02:01:14,022 --> 02:01:22,327
[SPEAKER_13]: And the people right behind, I think it's Henry Street, 7 Henry Street, and 6, I think it's 616 Main.

1131
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:25,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1132
02:01:25,879 --> 02:01:26,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1133
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:27,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1134
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:35,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got tripped up because the letter from the Oliveiras was, I think, from their alternate address.

1135
02:01:35,242 --> 02:01:36,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

1136
02:01:36,382 --> 02:01:38,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, they live on Governor's Ave.

1137
02:01:38,382 --> 02:01:38,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1138
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:41,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1139
02:01:41,363 --> 02:01:46,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you just have the Governor's Ave one and then you have seven?

1140
02:01:46,784 --> 02:01:47,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, yeah.

1141
02:01:47,585 --> 02:01:47,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1142
02:01:47,685 --> 02:01:48,345
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1143
02:01:48,585 --> 02:01:48,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1144
02:01:54,001 --> 02:01:59,725
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things to point out about this building is with the construction of the two new green line stations.

1145
02:02:01,167 --> 02:02:09,933
[SPEAKER_13]: The one in Lowell Street is less than half a mile walk from this building, and the one in Ball Square is, I think, 0.58 miles walk.

1146
02:02:17,318 --> 02:02:18,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the board?

1147
02:02:22,298 --> 02:02:24,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, just a little follow up on kind of my original question.

1148
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:28,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just so along the driveway, there's just like.

1149
02:02:29,102 --> 02:02:32,124
[SPEAKER_06]: A blank wall all the way to the back facing the butter.

1150
02:02:34,745 --> 02:02:37,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you intending to put windows and.

1151
02:02:37,847 --> 02:02:40,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Along there, yeah, absolutely.

1152
02:02:41,109 --> 02:02:43,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also kind of a, you know, that roof space, right?

1153
02:02:44,051 --> 02:02:45,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, over that.

1154
02:02:46,212 --> 02:02:49,074
[SPEAKER_06]: The commercial space right now, is that going to be used at all?

1155
02:02:50,663 --> 02:02:52,866
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't propose to do anything there.

1156
02:02:53,026 --> 02:02:53,827
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a flat roof.

1157
02:02:55,269 --> 02:03:01,436
[SPEAKER_13]: If I wanted to build up, I would have to go for a variance, I think, because I'd be adding square footage, so I don't propose to do that.

1158
02:03:01,917 --> 02:03:05,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking more like a deck or something like that.

1159
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:09,827
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be nice, but I don't know.

1160
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:12,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Feasible that is within current selling.

1161
02:03:12,911 --> 02:03:13,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.

1162
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:19,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So my understanding just to make sure I understand so that if this were to become a residential unit, this would be the 1st floor.

1163
02:03:20,333 --> 02:03:22,913
[SPEAKER_06]: 2nd floor is a separate unit and 3rd floor is a separate unit.

1164
02:03:23,534 --> 02:03:23,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct?

1165
02:03:23,914 --> 02:03:24,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1166
02:03:24,494 --> 02:03:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1167
02:03:25,014 --> 02:03:25,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1168
02:03:31,716 --> 02:03:32,476
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm sorry.

1169
02:03:36,336 --> 02:03:50,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to say, one of the other things, and I think to the previous conversations you've had is this does add to the housing stock in the city, increases housing supply, which is one of the goals, I think, of the city and generally speaking in the community.

1170
02:03:50,504 --> 02:03:55,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1171
02:03:55,466 --> 02:03:56,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions from the board?

1172
02:03:56,547 --> 02:04:05,792
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we'll bump it to public comment, if anybody from the public would like to ask any questions or comment on this project.

1173
02:04:06,774 --> 02:04:09,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, on this, uh, application.

1174
02:04:11,235 --> 02:04:15,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Please raise your hand on zoom or email Dennis at medford-ma.gov.

1175
02:04:23,879 --> 02:04:25,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see any hands raised on zoom.

1176
02:04:26,420 --> 02:04:28,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Dennis, I know we did receive those 2 letters of support.

1177
02:04:28,701 --> 02:04:32,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have anything additional that's come in since we started or.

1178
02:04:34,242 --> 02:04:35,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing further sunset.

1179
02:04:36,934 --> 02:04:38,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dennis, share away to motion.

1180
02:04:39,096 --> 02:04:42,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1181
02:04:42,939 --> 02:04:43,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mike.

1182
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:44,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

1183
02:04:45,341 --> 02:04:45,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Jim.

1184
02:04:47,303 --> 02:04:47,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee?

1185
02:04:50,045 --> 02:04:50,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1186
02:04:50,265 --> 02:04:50,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Tondra LaRue?

1187
02:04:51,686 --> 02:04:51,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1188
02:04:52,607 --> 02:04:53,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Tarani?

1189
02:04:53,908 --> 02:04:54,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1190
02:04:54,769 --> 02:04:55,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Caldera?

1191
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:56,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1192
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:57,511
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie Thompson?

1193
02:04:57,631 --> 02:04:57,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1194
02:05:01,434 --> 02:05:03,516
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thoughts from the board on this one?

1195
02:05:09,615 --> 02:05:13,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, go ahead.

1196
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:20,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so this is a portion of Main Street that does not have much in the way of commercial.

1197
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:27,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And no substantial detriment standard is

1198
02:05:29,172 --> 02:05:32,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm much easier to meet the variance.

1199
02:05:32,193 --> 02:05:39,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I certainly don't, I think this meets the no substantial detriment standard.

1200
02:05:39,557 --> 02:05:49,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I agree with some of Andre's earlier comments that it is a bit of an odd configuration, but, um, no, it,

1201
02:05:50,764 --> 02:06:00,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that odd configuration by itself, especially with the change in use, suddenly creates a substantial detriment that wasn't there previously.

1202
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:03,611
[SPEAKER_07]: So overall, I support it.

1203
02:06:06,212 --> 02:06:06,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mike.

1204
02:06:07,313 --> 02:06:07,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Andre.

1205
02:06:09,163 --> 02:06:11,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, I agree with what Mike is saying.

1206
02:06:11,425 --> 02:06:19,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll just add, you know, these kinds of first floor commercial spaces are really hard to make work.

1207
02:06:20,232 --> 02:06:29,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, having a vacant commercial space is more detrimental to the neighborhood than having a residential space that's occupied.

1208
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Great point.

1209
02:06:35,604 --> 02:06:36,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other thoughts?

1210
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:43,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, so I absolutely agree.

1211
02:06:43,252 --> 02:06:52,157
[SPEAKER_16]: These single-use commercial units have obviously been, we've seen these in residential buildings being converted pretty regularly.

1212
02:06:52,177 --> 02:07:04,285
[SPEAKER_16]: These neighborhood stores mid-neighborhood have been slowly moving out of the market and bigger chains and business districts have kind of replaced them pretty effectively.

1213
02:07:05,446 --> 02:07:08,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is definitely an improvement for the building and for the neighborhood.

1214
02:07:12,492 --> 02:07:17,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair awaits a motion to approve 6-12 to 6-14 Main Street.

1215
02:07:18,617 --> 02:07:26,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I motion to approve the special permit for the change in use to 6-12 to 6-14 Main Street.

1216
02:07:27,844 --> 02:07:28,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the clarification, Mike.

1217
02:07:30,046 --> 02:07:30,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a second?

1218
02:07:31,447 --> 02:07:31,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

1219
02:07:32,027 --> 02:07:32,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

1220
02:07:32,407 --> 02:07:34,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1221
02:07:34,989 --> 02:07:35,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Mike Caldera?

1222
02:07:36,551 --> 02:07:36,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1223
02:07:37,491 --> 02:07:37,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Andrew LaRue?

1224
02:07:38,772 --> 02:07:38,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1225
02:07:39,673 --> 02:07:40,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim Guarani?

1226
02:07:40,854 --> 02:07:40,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1227
02:07:41,709 --> 02:07:42,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Lee?

1228
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:43,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1229
02:07:44,871 --> 02:07:45,671
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie Thompson?

1230
02:07:45,831 --> 02:07:45,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1231
02:07:47,212 --> 02:07:47,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Keith.

1232
02:07:49,133 --> 02:07:51,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Dennis, if you can go over the next steps for Keith.

1233
02:07:51,555 --> 02:07:51,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1234
02:07:52,695 --> 02:07:54,456
[SPEAKER_14]: So Keith, it's a little different.

1235
02:07:54,476 --> 02:07:55,737
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll be writing the decision.

1236
02:07:56,217 --> 02:07:59,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And then once I finish it, it'll go to our legal counsel for a review.

1237
02:07:59,819 --> 02:08:02,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And then once they're done with that, then I'll send it off to get signed.

1238
02:08:02,641 --> 02:08:05,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Once it's signed, I'll file it in the city clerk's office.

1239
02:08:05,382 --> 02:08:07,604
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, I'll let you know when it's filed.

1240
02:08:07,624 --> 02:08:09,805
[SPEAKER_14]: But then at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period.

1241
02:08:10,842 --> 02:08:15,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Where someone decides to appeal it, so once that appeals period has been finished with no appeals.

1242
02:08:16,805 --> 02:08:19,366
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can get your building apart great.

1243
02:08:19,647 --> 02:08:20,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for your time guys.

1244
02:08:20,647 --> 02:08:21,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Really appreciate it.

1245
02:08:23,609 --> 02:08:25,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dennis.

1246
02:08:25,870 --> 02:08:26,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1247
02:08:27,891 --> 02:08:28,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Um.

1248
02:08:29,552 --> 02:08:31,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on administrative updates.

1249
02:08:35,835 --> 02:08:36,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any minutes?

1250
02:08:36,695 --> 02:08:37,776
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we have any minutes.

1251
02:08:39,569 --> 02:08:40,469
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we have no minutes.

1252
02:08:40,589 --> 02:08:48,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working on them, but I meant to do that while I was here, but I was the only one here for basically, well, I'm not the only one here, but we were pretty short staffed and.

1253
02:08:50,172 --> 02:08:50,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I was on the phone a lot.

1254
02:08:51,573 --> 02:08:52,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm handing the phones.

1255
02:08:52,233 --> 02:08:52,653
[SPEAKER_14]: I should say.

1256
02:08:52,673 --> 02:09:01,036
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'll be giving you some stuff by the end of the next meeting.

1257
02:09:03,096 --> 02:09:06,018
[SPEAKER_14]: No other updates from my end about anything.

1258
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:14,104
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a couple of ones that are in the pipeline there to be approved for next month, so we have already a couple of those.

1259
02:09:14,124 --> 02:09:31,416
[SPEAKER_14]: This came up yesterday, so I'm just letting you all know just in case when it comes up, you'll be like, golly, I didn't know this because I sure didn't, that any structure with water more than 2 feet deep, including a hot tub, is actually considered a pool by the state of Massachusetts.

1260
02:09:32,978 --> 02:09:43,566
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's someone who has a hot tub that is, so it basically, which means they also have to follow the setbacks for pools, which is six feet.

1261
02:09:43,926 --> 02:09:50,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's sort of more just, it sort of came up and I was very surprised by that and talking to the building department and that sort of went over with it.

1262
02:09:50,771 --> 02:09:58,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's more of just, you know, I've been doing this 12 years, 11, 12 years, and I never heard of that before.

1263
02:09:58,897 --> 02:10:01,479
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's more of just the sort of little fact that,

1264
02:10:02,283 --> 02:10:25,860
[SPEAKER_14]: sitting it was this like a we bought one sitting in a backyard or on a deck or did somebody build one i don't want to go into too much details before but basically there's a it's it's it's a hot tub that is in a backyard that is fairly small and so therefore it's within the setback and nobody knew gotcha until much many many years after the fact so

1265
02:10:27,009 --> 02:10:27,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to know.

1266
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:29,431
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just an interesting little thing.

1267
02:10:29,491 --> 02:10:32,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I was sort of going through, because I had to go, at first I went through the city one.

1268
02:10:32,432 --> 02:10:33,073
[SPEAKER_14]: It just lists pools.

1269
02:10:33,093 --> 02:10:33,933
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't list hot tubs.

1270
02:10:33,953 --> 02:10:37,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I went to the state code, and it actually does the thing about the two feet.

1271
02:10:38,096 --> 02:10:41,578
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't, so basically it's anything but a kiddie pool is water safety.

1272
02:10:41,798 --> 02:10:41,958
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1273
02:10:42,618 --> 02:10:46,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Water, yeah.

1274
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:47,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any new business?

1275
02:10:52,164 --> 02:10:53,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Any items for anyone else?

1276
02:10:55,640 --> 02:10:56,661
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you guys.

1277
02:10:56,741 --> 02:11:00,626
[SPEAKER_16]: I know this probably went longer than expected, but thank you for your patience and the time on this 1.

1278
02:11:02,609 --> 02:11:04,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm emotional very much.
