1
00:00:00,588 --> 00:00:01,508
Looks like everybody's good.

2
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:03,689
I just want to welcome everybody.

3
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:04,770
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,131
This is our presentation.

5
00:00:08,631 --> 00:00:11,552
Lorena Escalero is our federal funds manager.

6
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:14,693
She'll be putting on a presentation with a slideshow.

7
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:21,055
So we'll just ask that Lorena put that presentation on first, and then we're going to open it up to question and answer.

8
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:24,697
Everybody's muted right now, but you can use the raise hand feature.

9
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:27,938
And Steve Smearty, who's the communications director,

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,706
Emma Tumbley, who's our communications specialist, and then we have Teresa DuPont from the planning office.

11
00:00:36,147 --> 00:00:40,150
We'll be managing the meeting to answer any questions you may have.

12
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:46,035
We have been working through our ARPA funding for a couple of years now.

13
00:00:46,115 --> 00:01:01,648
We are in a good place to be able to open this funding roundup to any nonprofit that has been doing work that's COVID related to help residents in need, whether that's for housing, food insecurity, social services.

14
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:04,010
and we're happy you're here.

15
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,555
Lorena will run through the timeline and we will be able to, like I said, answer questions at the end.

16
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:15,159
And then we're also all available throughout the process to answer any questions and help however we can.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,582
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Lorena to get started.

18
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:23,807
Thank you, Mayor.

19
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:25,689
Welcome everyone to this

20
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:46,322
ARPA Subrecipient Grant Funding Info Session, where I'll give you a little bit of a timeline, details on the subrecipient process on how to apply, the prerequisites and programmatic requirements, as well as what our needs are, community needs are right now.

21
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:51,424
So you understand how greatly and a great many of

22
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:57,175
nonprofits serving Medford have been impacted due to COVID-19.

23
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:09,458
And so we hope to be able to further support our service providers and nonprofits expand, enhance, and pilot new programs at recovering from COVID-19.

24
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,299
And again, my name is Lorena Escalero.

25
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:17,341
This overview will be succinct, but if you have any questions,

26
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,554
feel free to reach out to me in person.

27
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:24,795
My room is in room 214 at City Hall.

28
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:29,436
My email is lesgalero at medford-ma.gov.

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,737
And my phone number, my direct line is 781-475-5634.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,142
So the timeline of the ARPA grant recipient program will begin with when the application becomes available.

31
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:57,433
It will be available tomorrow, Thursday, March 9, and will go on and will be due on Friday, April 7 2023.

32
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:13,957
At which point the ARPA Nonprofit Subrecipient Committee review members will review applications based on a proposal rubric that we've set up and we'll go over that rubric in the coming slides.

33
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:20,340
And a notice of awards and agreements will be issued around mid to late May.

34
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:28,084
And the project implementation and performance period will span from fiscal year 2024

35
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:42,325
So starting from July 1st, 2023 through June 30th, 2024, to allow time for the project closeout and final reimbursements to be issued.

36
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:50,467
Just as an FYI, all expenditures must be processed by December 31st, 2024 for ARPA funding.

37
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:59,024
So who's eligible to apply?

38
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:07,833
Any nonprofits with a 501c3 classification are eligible to apply for ARPA funding.

39
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:12,818
The Treasury has provided more guidance to allow veteran organizations

40
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,182
that have a 501 C-19 classification.

41
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:37,877
However, for the purposes of Medford Subrecipient Program, we're really looking to focus on the key areas of housing, food assistance programs, and a wide range of social services that were selected from the community outreach sessions and the community survey that was released.

42
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:58,791
And just to note here, you don't have to be a nonprofit that has been negatively impacted by COVID, but as long as the use of your funding, your project proposal is eligible and has a strong tie to COVID-19, you may apply.

43
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:02,735
So just some other

44
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:21,914
application and administrative requirements are, as a nonprofit, you must be registered with the system for award management, known as SAM, and you must provide the unique NVIDIA identification number on the application form.

45
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:41,312
For the programmatic period, ARPA is a lot more stringent than other local and state grant funding, so subrecipients should adhere to quarterly reporting, and this will contain and

46
00:05:42,589 --> 00:06:08,020
kind of will be requesting sub recipients to record keep invoices and any associated receipts, as well as we'll need some data on standard of outcome data, which includes like how many households were served, how many beneficiaries were served in total and other metrics to describe the impact and success of the program.

47
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:26,131
So tomorrow when the application is available, it will be available via the Medford ARPA webpage under the ARPA Subrecipient Program Information Application tab.

48
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:31,214
And I'll just click on it and show you real quick what it'll look like.

49
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:35,357
So if you, I can also send out the link.

50
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,441
to everyone right now.

51
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,782
I'll just post it on the chat.

52
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:43,843
If anyone can post it on the chat, that'd be great.

53
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:57,828
So once you arrive at the Medford ARPA page and you scroll down, it'll be under the ARPA Subrecipient Program Information and Application.

54
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,389
So there'll be a dropdown.

55
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,150
And the first link will

56
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,629
direct you to the ARPA Subrecipient Funding Application.

57
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:19,431
The second link, and this is optional, I just wanted to give folks a chance to publish their questions on a public form.

58
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:32,233
And there'll be a deadline for when questions will be due by and a deadline for when I'll get back to the form with answers to answer people's questions.

59
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:33,893
And if folks

60
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:42,765
Obviously, if they don't want to post their questions publicly, they can always consult me via email or in person.

61
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:50,794
And to help fill out the funding application, you'll need to

62
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:57,283
access the ARPA application package for nonprofits, which is the third link.

63
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,144
And I'll just go to it right now.

64
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:14,148
So as part of the application form that needs to be filled out, there'll be a budget template for subrecipients to complete and submit to me either by email, mail, or in person, whatever works for you.

65
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:17,449
And there's also

66
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:32,102
our Medford community values and statement of needs list here to refer back to while you're sifting out through the questions, the ARPA application questions.

67
00:08:32,982 --> 00:08:39,064
So the ARPA subrecipient funding application will look somewhat like this tomorrow.

68
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:42,545
Lorena, I'm so sorry to interrupt.

69
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:43,785
We're actually not seeing that.

70
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,726
Oh, I'm sorry.

71
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,426
It's all good.

72
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,332
The ARPA funding application?

73
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:52,433
We're seeing your slides right now.

74
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:53,994
Oh, OK.

75
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:06,119
How about now?

76
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,340
Oh.

77
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,262
How about now?

78
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:15,423
Perfect.

79
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:16,882
OK, great.

80
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:17,983
Thank you, Teresa.

81
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:23,386
So the ARPA funding application will look somewhat like this tomorrow.

82
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:27,248
We're still making a few minor alterations to it.

83
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:43,197
So the first part will be subrecipients must fill out general organization information, include the unique entity identification number from the SAM.gov website.

84
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,553
Then for the other portion, it'll be the project description and information.

85
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:59,997
And one thing worth noting is that applicants can apply for more than one project or program.

86
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:11,723
And if you choose to apply to more than one program, I highly suggest you send me an email ranking the programs based on priority and project readiness.

87
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:31,585
So it'll ask you project description, amount being requested, estimated project start date, estimated date of completion, project timeline, major milestones.

88
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:43,310
How do you plan to collect relevant data for measuring project success and meeting ARPA reporting requirements?

89
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:49,685
Description of the general governmental services that will be covered by these bonds.

90
00:10:52,266 --> 00:11:03,693
And this last question, looking back at the statement of community values criteria will help you address this question, which is why is this project needed in Medford for COVID recovery?

91
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:08,316
Please show the clearly identified need for this project.

92
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:28,885
Okay.

93
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:38,396
And so our community values and needs, we really try to hold in on three

94
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:47,507
key areas which are housing, food assistance, and additional social services that were really highlighted by the community survey.

95
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:56,631
So for housing, we're looking for rental assistance and emergency transitional assistance programs, heating and fuel assistance programs,

96
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:09,220
For food assistance, we're looking at projects that address food insecurity, any projects that will help address the gap for the 4800 SNAP Medford recipients on SNAP.

97
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:22,607
There the COVID-19 extra snaps that some of that population was receiving ended last week.

98
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:28,030
So any program that could help with this gap would be highly considered.

99
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:36,035
Other food assistance projects that build a robust, equitable, and resilient local food system in Medford.

100
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,115
And

101
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:50,350
Other broad range of human services needed that were highlighted by the community were in our social worker, Alicia Legambina.

102
00:12:50,370 --> 00:13:00,872
I'm not sure if she's on this call, but they expressed a lot of need for job training, mental behavioral services, positive youth services, homelessness prevention.

103
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:04,753
And these are just a few of the many.

104
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:30,601
So the ARPA Subrecipient Awards will be given on a competitive basis to really help ensure integrity in the application process and reviewing process, and to also help ensure that the funding is reaching the intended beneficiaries that we're trying to, that this program is designed for.

105
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:34,745
And so the ARPA

106
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:51,353
sub-recipient committee review team will score and evaluate application based on some of these factors, which are, is the project proposal related and reasonably proportional to a public health or negative economic impact of COVID-19?

107
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:56,956
Can the organization meet the minimum applicant slash reporting requirements?

108
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:01,378
Does the project align with one or more of the funding

109
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:11,266
uh, priority areas, and what is the applicant's level of risk for non-compliance to ARPA reporting slash monitoring requirements.

110
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:22,650
And for this risk assessment section, I think, like, it'd be helpful to know if the nonprofit... Sorry, I think we're still not seeing the, uh, that slide.

111
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,171
It's still on the, uh, application.

112
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:25,791
Oh, really?

113
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:26,211
Okay.

114
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,212
I'm sorry.

115
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:44,989
Can you see it now?

116
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,232
No, still the application.

117
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:52,175
OK.

118
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,545
It may be best just to stop sharing and then reshare.

119
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,306
OK, thank you.

120
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:28,326
Perfect.

121
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:30,207
Great.

122
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:33,008
Now my screen froze.

123
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,709
OK.

124
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:41,070
Can you see the proposal rubric?

125
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:41,770
Yes.

126
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,872
So this is the rubric that I was just mentioning.

127
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,754
So for, yeah.

128
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:16,047
The last part that I was saying about the non-compliance risk assessment, part of doing the assessment would be looking at if organizations received other types of federal funding, such as home or community development block grant funding.

129
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:28,428
And lastly, before I open it up for questions, I'd just like to point out costs that are not eligible.

130
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:33,129
So these are the following costs that are not eligible for ARPA funding.

131
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,071
Operational costs and indirect admin costs.

132
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:44,994
Admin costs of a proposed program are capped at 15% of the total costs of the proposed project.

133
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:58,350
any capital expenditures above $50,000, depending on the type of request and how reasonable it is.

134
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,011
And employee incentives are not allowed.

135
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,513
However, staff retention stipends are allowed for ARPA funding.

136
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:21,400
And I think I'd like to, before I open it, sorry, before I open up to questions, I'd like to just point out and review together the budget template sheet.

137
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:24,504
So I'm going to share my screen.

138
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,004
Can you all see the budget template?

139
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:47,284
Yes.

140
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:48,325
Thank you.

141
00:17:52,708 --> 00:18:12,441
So for the budget proposal template we have here, you'll fill in the contact information and fill out the project line items based on the program you're running, program staff, direct

142
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:29,833
administrative costs, and benefits for the staff, depending on the hours that are related work towards that program will be covered as well for ARPA and supplies and equipment.

143
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,680
So I think I'm going to stop it there and open it up for questions.

144
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:49,593
Let me know if you'd like me to go back to any of the slides.

145
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:52,174
I think I'll just continue to keep the slides on.

146
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:09,559
It looks like we have a Lindsay from Mystic Valley Elder Services.

147
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,033
Hi, I'm from Mystic Valley YMCA, actually.

148
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,615
Sorry, the first part.

149
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:17,797
My bad, so sorry.

150
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:18,717
No, no worries.

151
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,139
Hi, everybody.

152
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:22,441
Thank you for the presentation.

153
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,683
I have two, I think, fairly simple questions.

154
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,566
Is there a cap on the request amount?

155
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:38,212
No, there's not a grant minimum or a grant maximum since this program is a one-year program.

156
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:42,035
We just want to let the applicant use their best judgment.

157
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:44,957
OK.

158
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:55,506
With the guideline that we can't have operational costs, the sense that I get from that is that

159
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:59,895
No current expenses can be covered by this funding.

160
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:05,680
It has to be a new project or a new program that directly supports Medford residents.

161
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,285
It is not necessarily intended to invest in programs that have been providing COVID relief.

162
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:17,969
It's intended to create new initiatives with this funding.

163
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:19,930
Am I understanding that correctly?

164
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,872
Could you provide some clarification?

165
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:32,642
Yes, so a project could enhance or expand a current project that's aimed at addressing the COVID-19 impact and recovery.

166
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:39,865
So any existing program that has a strong tie to COVID-19 relief is eligible.

167
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:40,806
OK.

168
00:20:41,466 --> 00:20:50,390
It's just that the administrative costs that are indirect costs would be restricted to 15% maximum per project if you were to submit.

169
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:50,710
OK.

170
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,310
Thank you.

171
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:51,911
That's helpful.

172
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:52,691
Thank you.

173
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:53,493
Thank you.

174
00:20:53,513 --> 00:21:02,978
Alan, do you have a question?

175
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,220
Sorry, I'm unmuting you.

176
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,964
Sorry, hold on.

177
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:14,784
What is SAM?

178
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:17,405
I'm a little fuzzy on the SAM registration.

179
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:22,028
So it's the System Management for Awards.

180
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,768
through the SAM.gov website.

181
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:33,935
Okay, so that has to be done first, correct?

182
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:34,756
Yes.

183
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:35,857
Okay.

184
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:48,969
And I think I can get some information on how to get a registration number or the unique entity information, the unique,

185
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:49,845
Yeah.

186
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,187
And the identification number.

187
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:52,747
Sorry.

188
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:53,167
All right.

189
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:53,928
Thank you.

190
00:21:56,989 --> 00:21:58,070
David has his hand up.

191
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:17,062
With regard to rental assistance, can the ARPA funds be used to provide the actual rental assistance itself, or can they only be used to provide the backup services,

192
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:22,677
reviewing applications, all the administration, that sort of thing.

193
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,678
Can they be offered to make the rental payments?

194
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,760
Yep, it can cover rental payments and the entirety of the program.

195
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,341
Great, okay, thank you.

196
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:41,643
Anything John has a question?

197
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:42,884
I think I see him.

198
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:49,639
He's on mute, John.

199
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:57,242
Okay, there we go.

200
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:57,542
Good.

201
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:58,523
Sorry about that.

202
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:09,348
So just back to Alan and Sam for a second, having dealt with the SAM registration things a few times, I would just suggest you might want to look at that stuff tomorrow.

203
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:24,139
And then a second question was, what is the, and I'm sure it's on the website, but what's the total amount available to the city?

204
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,162
Do you mean for, we're dedicated for non-profits?

205
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,444
This project, however you're grouping this.

206
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:35,264
Okay.

207
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:36,304
Yeah.

208
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:39,826
So we don't necessarily have a total in mind.

209
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,887
We're just looking to see how many applications we get.

210
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:45,372
Yeah.

211
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:47,555
Okay, great.

212
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:48,176
Thank you.

213
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:50,719
Thank you.

214
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:51,139
Yeah.

215
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,861
And if I may.

216
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:54,123
Sure, of course.

217
00:23:55,091 --> 00:24:14,542
Lorena gave a presentation to the public and to the city council that we're looking at around two million to cover and maybe upwards of three plus to cover any affordable housing projects and this round to nonprofits that are helping our residents.

218
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:20,806
So it's all dependent on what applications come in and how much that total adds up to.

219
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,001
Any other questions?

220
00:24:35,523 --> 00:24:37,064
Use that help.

221
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,305
Yeah.

222
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,368
OK, great, thank you very much.

223
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:59,017
This presentation I have a questions around the actual implementation of the programs and projects when they would start expect to be started and when they expected and I'm assuming if and what did you be ready to jump right in on July 1st of 2020?

224
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:06,980
three, and then continue, and how long after that would the projects expect to be continuing?

225
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,881
Yes, from July 1st, 2023 through June 30th, 2024.

226
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,341
Okay.

227
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:16,702
All right, great.

228
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:22,283
So then, say there was, as you mentioned, Lorena, maybe several projects might be in place.

229
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:30,785
Would it be an expectation that the projects continue throughout the course of that timeframe, or could it be, have a shorter life?

230
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,503
and then continue as another project kind of thing.

231
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,386
So different projects will occur.

232
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:47,891
So you're asking if you apply for different projects, they'll be happening subsequently throughout that one year span?

233
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,072
Is that what you're saying?

234
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:56,316
Yes, and say one might end after eight months, and one might have done its job after a certain amount of time.

235
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:59,218
Yeah, that's fine, as long as it's not

236
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:04,071
The period of performance.

237
00:26:04,753 --> 00:26:05,033
Great.

238
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:12,566
And then there was a great question earlier about, you know, supporting with rental and transitional housing supports and all that kind of thing.

239
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,322
We're doing that now.

240
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:31,753
So I'm assuming we can support the families that we're currently serving and not necessarily new families or people, but rather a new infusion of support for the families.

241
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:33,615
Yeah, that's correct.

242
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:34,896
Thank you.

243
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:42,835
Thank you, Marie, for your question.

244
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,575
Oh, you're welcome.

245
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,677
I have one more question, actually, I'm sorry, about the data.

246
00:26:48,297 --> 00:27:02,885
Is there a data, are we to create our own data system or database, if you will, or data system of collecting it and how do we, you know, is there a guidance on how to, what to collect and how to report on the data?

247
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:05,586
That's a great question.

248
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:09,388
And that's how you'll,

249
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:19,533
answer the application question, how will you measure the impact or success of the program and be compliant with the reporting requirements?

250
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:28,937
So there's no guideline for us, but kind of like what kind of metrics are reasonable for the type of program that you are proposing to run.

251
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:29,937
Okay.

252
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
Any other questions?

253
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:42,159
I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah tonight.

254
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:54,067
The community values criteria that's gonna be in the package that we're going to read, is that in the, in online somewhere?

255
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:56,508
Yes, it's part of the application.

256
00:27:56,528 --> 00:27:59,830
Okay, great, great, thank you.

257
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:04,493
And Lindsay has a question.

258
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:09,976
Hi, sorry, one more question.

259
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:23,084
I know that you're still working on refining maybe some of the questions and language in the application, but based on what you showed, can you maybe provide just a little bit more explanation around question 12?

260
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:30,309
That one, when we were scrolling through, kind of jumped out at me, the description of governmental services that will be covered by the funds.

261
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:33,431
I just wondered if you could provide a little bit more insight to that.

262
00:28:33,971 --> 00:28:34,792
Sure, I'll pull it.

263
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:35,312
Thank you.

264
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:36,453
I appreciate it.

265
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:49,070
So question 12 is the description of the general government services that will be covered by these funds.

266
00:28:54,777 --> 00:29:01,785
I think this question also mirrors the project description question.

267
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,714
Yeah, it seems to me that it's like repetitive with question.

268
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:34,101
Six, so I will see if we can either consolidate both of those questions or delete question 12.

269
00:29:35,922 --> 00:29:36,323
Thank you.

270
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,646
John, do you have another question?

271
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,067
Yeah, I think John does.

272
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:46,315
I do.

273
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,416
This just is sort of about the writing of the proposal.

274
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,778
Do we write into the form and does it save and you continue to work on it?

275
00:29:57,198 --> 00:30:03,720
Or is it a better idea to do it in Word on the side and get to your final versions and cut them in at the end?

276
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,262
Yeah, I would suggest it's always safe to have a backup Word doc.

277
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,362
And it's a Microsoft form, so I don't think it will save.

278
00:30:16,402 --> 00:30:17,602
You'll have to submit.

279
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:18,142
Oh, wow.

280
00:30:19,303 --> 00:30:19,663
OK.

281
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:20,143
Good.

282
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,544
Wow, good question.

283
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:26,445
But I'm open to receiving the applications in a flexible way.

284
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:35,009
If you'd like to send it to me through Word or whatever form, as long as you're answering all of these questions, I'm open to that.

285
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:36,949
OK.

286
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:38,170
Thank you.

287
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:38,970
Thanks.

288
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,031
Any other questions?

289
00:30:51,854 --> 00:30:52,874
I don't think so.

290
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:58,717
You want to wrap up, Marina?

291
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:01,359
Yeah, I think we're good.

292
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:11,124
I'm not sure if Alicia has anything, any other needs that I might have missed or any

293
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:23,563
uptick in certain calls from you, Alicia, or the Planning, Development, and Sustainability Office, anything that I might be missing?

294
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:26,644
I'll jump in.

295
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:31,326
I don't mean to cut you off, Alicia, but I do feel quite a bit of calls.

296
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:38,409
Obviously, we're in the wintertime, so heating assistance is a huge one, any sort of utility assistance.

297
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:42,211
We've seen a huge uptick in calls through our office about that.

298
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:52,969
And of course, housing, it's always been an issue, a hot topic, just obviously, certainly as of late, there's been a large increase in calls about that as well.

299
00:31:55,552 --> 00:32:07,163
If I could give any guidance to this great group of folks here, those would be like my two, if you are all my fairy godmothers, and I had one wish, it would be if we could provide additional support.

300
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:09,533
in those specifically those two buckets.

301
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:14,627
But Alicia, you field a bevy of different calls more so than I do, so.

302
00:32:23,373 --> 00:32:24,914
Sorry, trouble unmuting.

303
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:27,255
My name is Alicia Lagavina.

304
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:31,718
I am the community social worker with the city of Medford Health Department.

305
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:46,107
And so any of the calls to the multilingual resource line for the city of Medford concerning social services will come to me as well as any requests for services, which is a COVID related form.

306
00:32:47,968 --> 00:33:13,215
on our city website that also comes to me, I would say, and I have been saying that we, you know, here in Medford, what we're seeing is, you know, gaps in the low income threshold for services and the income in which people are requiring services such as rental assistance, such as fuel assistance, the maximum income requirements are pretty low.

307
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:23,918
And so if there were programs designed above those numbers, it would be well suited for the people in need that we've spoken to.

308
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:30,020
And then as well as emergency funding to keep folks in their home.

309
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:41,464
So that could be anywhere from a temporary stay in a hotel to fixing, turning heat back on.

310
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:51,469
costs related that would make the difference in someone being able to live in their home temporarily until other services.

311
00:33:53,129 --> 00:34:08,215
Those are the kind of one-time payments that people are really needing in a crisis time that we've seen through the health department, the building department, and the planning development sustainability.

312
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:13,593
And so if I had a wish, if I had a fear of God mother.

313
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:31,465
I would hope that the agencies that have been assisting us, and I'll speak today, it took us and a resident over two hours and a lot of paperwork to get someone some fuel assistance today.

314
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:40,133
But because we did that in this position, my position, which is ARPA funded, we did get emergency fuel for this person.

315
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:48,419
that will be turned on tomorrow, which is the difference between somebody in Medford who's a homeowner having heat and not having heat.

316
00:34:48,899 --> 00:35:02,108
So just to kind of realistically put a visual to these numbers and the discussion that we're having, like folks are struggling in not meeting the basic need requirement.

317
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:13,197
And so this is really important when we think of these applications and definitely important when being considered by the committee that's overseeing these.

318
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:14,118
Thanks.

319
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:19,302
Thanks, Alicia.

320
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:34,817
So seeing that there are no other questions, thank you all.

321
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:36,517
Oh, one more.

322
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:37,618
Go ahead, Marie.

323
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,079
I think you're on mute, Marie.

324
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:44,479
Thank you very much.

325
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,900
I apologize once more.

326
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:55,742
As if we select to submit, is there a person we can go to to ask some questions as we have more questions as we go through this process?

327
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:59,083
Is there a person we can talk, get some answers from?

328
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,241
clarifications from?

329
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:02,241
Sure.

330
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:06,564
You can always reach out to me for an in-person or remote consultation.

331
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:06,624
OK.

332
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,065
We have your number.

333
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:09,565
Great.

334
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:10,166
Thank you.

335
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:12,247
You're welcome.

336
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,192
OK.

337
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:22,453
I think I'll wrap it up here.

338
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:23,994
Thank you, everyone.

339
00:36:24,394 --> 00:36:27,736
And we look forward to receiving your applications.

340
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:30,833
Thank you very much.

341
00:36:31,114 --> 00:36:31,594
Thank you.

342
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:32,415
Good night.

343
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:33,277
Night all.
