00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:04,444
Welcome back for our next installment of Coffee Chats with the Kingsleys.

2
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:06,645
And I am again joined by Annie.

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,808
So what's the next part of your platform?

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:13,489
Wow.

5
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:14,509
Thank you for asking.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,073
So the next part of my platform is the belief that families and schools need authentic and real engagement.

7
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:21,513
Okay.

8
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:28,637
So what that means is we know that schools have a lot of expertise and we know that families have a lot of expertise.

9
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:30,298
So what are schools experts on?

10
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:33,284
and what our families experts are.

11
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:39,286
So when you put those things together, we are going to be able to better meet the needs of our students.

12
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:52,452
But right now that happens too infrequently, or we rely on just individual teachers that have that belief instead of really investing in a system that supports that at all levels of Medford Public Schools.

13
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,893
What do you mean by the system?

14
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:58,615
Well, so a system might be

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,672
that we say this is like the one type of software we're going to use.

16
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:11,458
The system might be we make it really easy for teachers to reach out to parents because we like set up recommendations of when they do it.

17
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:18,382
A system might be the district creates opportunities to bring families in and talk to them.

18
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:20,924
So it's not always up to one teacher.

19
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:33,573
And right now we have some systems in place that actually make it harder for families and teachers to communicate, like not sharing testing information until, you know, report cards come out.

20
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:39,697
There's ways that we can make it easier for teachers and students, or teachers and families to work together.

21
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:44,961
So that, like, the teachers can, like, do their stuff, their, like, test stuff earlier?

22
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,182
Yeah, so like the math test that you take,

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:47,940
Right?

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:02:00,347
It would be great if once those tests are done, families have access to that information and they're able to help teachers say like, sometimes we know you're really, really good in one area, but you're still struggling with a different area.

25
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:00,608
Right?

26
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:13,375
So if parents know that and teachers know that as it's happening, we can work together to help build those skills as opposed to kind of keeping information and what I would call a silo, like keeping information separate.

27
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,331
So you don't get those authentic partnerships.

28
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:20,472
Cause parents like knowing what their child scores.

29
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:21,552
It's true.

30
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,853
And like what their child is doing great.

31
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:28,774
And when their child isn't doing so great, sometimes they might need to talk to their kid, right?

32
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,995
And then they have to wait until the end of the year.

33
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:32,616
Yeah.

34
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:33,436
And that's no good.

35
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:33,976
Yeah.

36
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:35,616
So what do you think?

37
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:36,557
Would that be a good idea?

38
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:36,897
Okay.
