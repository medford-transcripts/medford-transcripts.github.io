Coach Bates is a MHS Hall of Famer.

53
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:33,824
a four-year starter at Boston University in the hockey program, had a very successful career in the NHL as a member of the Bruins and the Islanders, and most recently was honored by the New York Islanders just a few weeks ago as a member of the Raw Decade team.

00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:40,307
So, Coach, please.

55
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:46,650
On behalf of the team, I want to thank Adam and members of the council for having our team up here.

56
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,991
It was an up and down year for us,

57
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:55,372
We won the GBL and that was our main goal and also to get to the state tournament and they did both.

58
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:58,674
So very proud of these guys and again, thank you for having us.

00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:17,989
Folks, next we have 15-314.

Two Medford athletes were awarded the Boston Bruins Sportsmanship Award, Adrian Perrazzo and Andrew Cronin.

61
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:37,103
So if we could have both of you come on up.

62
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,984
Again, Mr. President, thank you very much.

63
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:41,226
Adrian, congratulations.

64
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:42,427
Andrew, congratulations.

65
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,003
It's my pleasure to present this award to you.

66
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:48,505
First of all, I'd like to thank you both for being such a great representation of the city of Medford.

67
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:55,191
It's quite an honor to have the Boston Bruins recognize you and all the hockey players in the state of Massachusetts to bestow this award upon.

68
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,632
So congratulations.

69
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:11,604
The city council commendation reads that the Medford city council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Andrew Cronin and Adrian Perrazzo in recognition of representing the greater Boston hockey league as the recipient of the 13th annual MIAA Boston Bruins ice hockey sportsmanship award.

70
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:15,947
for best exemplifying the highest standards of fair play and sportsmanship in high school hockey.

71
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:17,307
So congratulations.

72
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:25,510
Is there anything you guys would like to say?

73
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,491
Avery, you've been up here before.

74
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,731
This is all bad for you, Adam.

75
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,032
Come on.

76
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:29,692
Come on.

77
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:35,114
I'd like to say thank you very much to Coach Bates for nominating me and Adrian.

78
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:40,597
And I'd like to say thank you to the community and the boys hockey team.

79
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:46,050
It was a pleasure to receive the award with Adrienne.

80
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,671
She's a class act.

81
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:54,016
And I think everybody in the program represents the city very well.

82
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:54,996
So thank you very much.

83
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:11,287
I'd also like to thank my coaches, who unfortunately aren't here today, Dave McCarthy and Rayann Forbes, because they've been a huge part of my life since I started in this program six years ago.

84
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,088
I'd like to thank them.

85
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,512
They've been supporting me through the whole thing, along with my parents.

86
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:23,161
I was so honored to receive this with Andrew because, like I said, he's a great class act, like he said about me.

87
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,083
And I just feel honored.

88
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,445
And it's a great way to end my high school hockey career.

89
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:27,846
So thank you.

90
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,232
Congratulations to you both.

91
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:43,607
Thanks a lot.

92
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:09,194
I didn't even notice he was absent until so would you like me to do that?

93
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:09,894
Sure.

94
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,595
No, it's not implied.

95
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:25,757
Folks, just for your announcement, Councillor Marks is not with us tonight due to a personal illness.

96
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,058
We're going to continue the meeting with

97
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,752
Public hearing 15-416.

98
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,013
Notice of public hearing.

99
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:50,916
City of Medford five-year consolidated plan, year 41 community development block grant application, July 1st, 2015, June 30th, 2016.

100
00:11:51,616 --> 00:12:02,738
A public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chambers, City Hall, Medford Mass on Tuesday,

101
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,069
April 28th, 2015.

102
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:17,952
The purpose of this public hearing will be to invite the general public and representatives of public service agencies to express comments regarding the city's consolidated action plan for community development and planning.

103
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:27,113
The action plan contains the proposed use of community development block grant funds for year 41, which extends from July 1st, 2015 through June 30th, 2016.

104
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:53,914
The Office of Community Development will be requesting that the Medford City Council authorize Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, official representative of the city of Medford, to submit the five-year consolidated plan, one-year action plan, application for funds, and all other assurances and certifications to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

105
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:56,335
The city is applying for $1 million

106
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,253
$433,774 in block grant funds.

107
00:13:04,053 --> 00:13:20,581
Additional information and review of the draft action plan can be obtained at the Office of Community Development City Hall, room 308, Medford during regular business hours on October 13th, 2015 for public review and comment.

108
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:23,402
Comments may be sent in writing by May 13th, 2015

109
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,438
into this office.

110
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:36,003
The final consolidated plan, action plan, and application will be submitted to HUD on 15 May, 2015.

111
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:42,446
Call 393-2501 for any accommodations, aids, et cetera, et cetera.

112
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:47,549
Edward P. Finn, city clerk, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

113
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,572
So we'll open this portion of the meeting

114
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,673
public hearing for those who are in favour.

115
00:13:56,053 --> 00:14:01,798
And we invite Lauren DiLorenzo, the Director of Community Development, to make her presentation.

116
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:02,799
Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:05,862
Lauren DiLorenzo, the Director of the Office of Community Development here at City Hall.

118
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:11,928
So there's two items really tonight is one is to conduct a public hearing to get any input.

119
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:32,315
If anybody would like to speak on a proposed application of plans and the second is to request the council submit, uh, allow, authorize the mayor to submit the applications, the five year plan, the one year plan, and any of the assurances and certifications that are typically required by HUD in order for us to apply for and receive our annual community development block grant.

120
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,369
Very brief overview for people who aren't familiar with the program.

121
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,691
Community Development Block Grant is distributed through the U.S.

122
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,352
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

123
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:42,954
City of Medford is considered an entitlement community.

124
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:49,337
Basically, that means that we have a population of over 50,000 based on the age of our housing, our citizens, and poverty.

125
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,959
There's a formula application and the city's eligible to apply for that money.

126
00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:02,975
Part of the requirements of submitting and receiving that money is to do an annual action plan, and then every five years to do a five-year plan.

127
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:03,975
So this year we're doing both.

128
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:07,457
We did a five-year plan, and we also are doing the one-year action plan.

129
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:16,622
We've had a process that's been a little bit different this year, and HUD is a little bit slow, but it's moving toward entering the digital era.

130
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:22,613
and has basically required us to use a new, it's called the econ planning suite.

131
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:28,545
So we'll be submitting that in addition to using our normal financial software that we use through HUD.

132
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:34,055
We have done a regional planning process on housing with the North Suburban Consortium.

133
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:35,776
There have been some regional meetings on that.

134
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:42,558
And in addition, we have also done consultations with a number of agencies to identify what their needs are.

135
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,641
A lot of public service agencies that you're familiar with and general information meetings.

136
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:56,044
We also had the council meeting committee of the whole to allow the public service agencies recently to speak about their needs and their requests for applications that they funded.

137
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,921
So I won't take too much of your time, but I will come back and answer any questions that you have.

138
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:05,105
And in general, the city's identifying their housing and community development needs.

139
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:09,148
It is fairly specific because the funding source is specific.

140
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:14,793
So we're really focusing here in HUD on benefits to low and moderate income citizens.

141
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:17,315
And that's the primary purpose of this program.

142
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:21,899
It's not, you know, general use of government funds.

143
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:32,288
It's targeted and to attempt to revitalize neighborhoods that are not deteriorating and to assist low and moderate income people with jobs and social services and housing needs.

144
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:33,690
And that's what we do here in this plan.

145
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,374
And the city council, the past five years, we have worked together to fund

146
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:46,157
and implement over $7 million worth of public projects and facility improvements and public service agencies.

147
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:56,103
So we've had quite an accomplishment with our joint efforts to serve the citizens of the city of Medford who are low and moderate income and we're a working class community.

148
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,644
The funds are very important to us.

149
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,245
They also supplement the general

150
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:02,348
city budget in terms of the delivery of services.

151
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:08,452
So we've been very successful in forging this partnership, and I hope that we can continue to do that.

152
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:12,034
This year, we're applying for $1,433,774.

153
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:17,497
First time we've had really a nominal cut in CDBG funds.

154
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,619
It's approximately $6,000 less than we got last year.

155
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:21,540
So that's good.

156
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,643
We've been having a steady cut in federal funding.

157
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:28,985
So this is a nominal decrease, which has been great.

158
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:34,777
Generally, we've developed some housing goals, and our one and five-year goals are fairly consistent.

159
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,219
We address housing.

160
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:45,103
Now, there's a small amount of money that we're proposing in this budget for housing, but we do have some money for prior years, about $250,000 of prior year money in housing.

161
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:48,745
And we are also eligible to apply through the North Suburban Consortium.

162
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:58,931
And generally, what we do in that case is we use some of the money for administrative costs when we're working with developers who have received, for instance, Medford Community Housing as a local group

163
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:05,771
who has applied for funding through the consortium and we've assisted them with CDBG funds in the past and with getting home funds.

164
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:09,533
So we do regional housing and we also do some local housing efforts.

165
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:15,957
The general goals on housing are to enhance the conditions and quality of life for low income residents.

166
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:25,223
We also work with public housing residents and with the housing authority in order to make sure that there are proper referrals for people so that they find themselves in a situation where they are

167
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:32,487
approaching homelessness or they're on a waiting list, we try to work with them also to coordinate the efforts to make sure that they're properly housed.

168
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:38,229
We assist and potentially fund non-profit housing developers in identifying development sites.

169
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,410
I gave you an example of that with Medford Community Housing.

170
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,930
They have no project this year.

171
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,051
They have one currently with Main Street.

172
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,652
We have no specific project identified for next year.

173
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,085
But if they come forth with a property and we're able to assist them, then we will try to do that.

174
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:54,227
And we administer general housing activities.

175
00:18:54,747 --> 00:19:02,052
We also have, you know, we have the ability to work and coordinate with all of our public sister agencies that are working on housing.

176
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:04,253
We do a lot of referrals to people who have housing needs.

177
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:08,596
We're not experts, but we will find an answer if we can.

178
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:13,239
And we'll work with people who have the resources to address people's problems, housing problems, I should say.

179
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:19,296
The second area that we fund as a goal is physical improvements to city systems and public facilities.

180
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:24,440
And that's a broad area, but generally those are all of the facility improvements that we do.

181
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:32,391
This year, we're proposing $906,953.10 toward public facility improvements.

182
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:40,674
And generally, the activities that we're proposing are, this is general water, sewer, street, and sidewalk, and I'll go through that specific budget item for that.

183
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:47,857
We're also including a removal of architectural barriers, so these are general activities if a project comes up that we can possibly do.

184
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:54,672
We are hoping to implement some improvements at South Street and Winthrop Street.

185
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:56,732
There has been public safety issues.

186
00:19:56,772 --> 00:20:01,453
Public safety is not an eligible HUD activity, but removal of architectural barriers is.

187
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:12,075
So we're trying to work with the Department of Public Works to do a joint combination of Chapter 90 funds and CDBG funds to address access and safety problems over at South Street and Winthrop Street.

188
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:16,396
So we're working cooperatively on that, and hopefully that will be completed this year.

189
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:24,830
The senior center is an activity that I think everybody has seen that it's very well used.

190
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:32,956
It's in a great location to the downtown area and close to two senior elderly developments, but it needs some work.

191
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:33,736
It's getting tired.

192
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:42,082
There's been some leaks in the building, and we've been working with Pam Kelly on actually a very thorough feasibility analysis of the exterior roof.

193
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:46,045
Started with floor replacement, and then it mushroomed into

194
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:52,431
You can't really replace the floor if you haven't replaced the fundamental problems with moisture and water entering the building.

195
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:58,236
So I am proposing that we fund, and this year I was trying to get this budget here.

196
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:58,676
I know it's here.

197
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,198
That we are funding $641,953.10 toward the Medford Senior Center.

198
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:01,659
Now, I have about $500,000 allocated from this year.

199
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,903
Approximately, we have right now a general estimate.

200
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:19,506
The design plans have not been completed, but about $1.1 million.

201
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:23,829
And if we fund this allocation here, what we'll do is two separate projects.

202
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:29,914
One will be the roof replacement, and there's also the, you know, the area that's in the front of the building.

203
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:32,776
that basically has had a rubberized surface that's put on it.

204
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:36,319
There are problems with the exterior masonry.

205
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:41,004
It basically needs to be waterproofed and patched, patched and waterproof, I should say, in that order.

206
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,445
The windows are leaking.

207
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,508
This would include window replacement in the exterior.

208
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,250
Any doors that are leaking would be repaired or replaced.

209
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,591
any handicap accessibility improvements that are required to be done because of the work that we're doing will be done.

210
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:58,775
And then the second part after that is done would be a separate bid specification that would include the interior work.

211
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:06,601
And right now, the scope that we're looking at, once we go further into plan, sometimes, you know, when costs are really identified, we have to trim back some things.

212
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:14,448
But I think we're going to be able to do all this, would be the flooring, making the auditorium stage handicap accessible.

213
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:16,069
It's not currently handicap accessible.

214
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,841
The seniors have, the sound system is very poor there.

215
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,566
When we conduct meetings, the room is so big, it's very difficult for people to hear.

216
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:25,487
That should be corrected.

217
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:28,710
It's just the right thing to do, and that should be taken care of.

218
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,072
It shouldn't be too much money for that.

219
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:32,826
There is some repair to some walls because of leaking.

220
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:35,168
And generally, that's about it.

221
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:36,248
So that's a lot of work.

222
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,929
It's a comprehensive list of work.

223
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:43,633
But I think at the end of it, you'll have a safe and usable building that should last for quite a long time.

224
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,715
So that's really the biggest investment that we have right here.

225
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:50,777
Medford Housing Authority has asked for $15,000.

226
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:55,779
Now, this is the first request they've had for physical improvements in several years.

227
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,946
working toward a new and a better relationship with the housing authority and setting expectations as to how we'll move ahead on any projects.

228
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:13,933
I think this is a good amount of money for us to start with and this is basically to replace a heat pump and air conditioning pump at the community center at Wapping Court.

229
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:19,317
So it does, again, serve seniors and that is in here as a recommendation.

230
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:25,302
$250,000 toward streets and sidewalks, that would include that South Street and any additional

231
00:23:26,164 --> 00:23:30,008
Money that is available would be for identified streets in the new low mod areas.

232
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,013
So they have changed somewhat from the last time with the new census information that's been provided.

233
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:39,939
We're finding generally that some of the areas are getting very poor and other areas are not.

234
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:47,007
And I think that a lot of that has to do with the construction of housing that we've had a lot more high rise.

235
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,568
developments that have predominantly higher income people living in them.

236
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,688
And it's having its impact on the makeup of the neighborhood.

237
00:23:54,708 --> 00:24:02,590
So we're finding more a trend toward more pockets of poverty rather than general neighborhoods that are low or moderate income.

238
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,391
Economic development, we have just generally $20,000 in here.

239
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:13,332
And this is really the HUD limitations on economic development are pretty strict.

240
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,953
In the past, we used to do things like storefront improvements, which is a great program.

241
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,986
And they generally don't allow that anymore unless you can show that you're creating for a five-year period, essentially, a low-moderate income job.

242
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:29,191
Or you're doing slums and blight and only handling the public safety issue, which would be something falling.

243
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,973
So they've really gotten restricted on this.

244
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,096
But this money here, we're going to try to do some activities.

245
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:40,381
I want to find a way to do some increased communication activities and coordination, especially with the Medford Square businesses.

246
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:43,004
We have a lot of projects that are going on in Medford Square.

247
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:47,326
bridge is up and coming, and it's a need in the city.

248
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:55,348
I don't know how else we would pay for this, but we're committed to trying to improve the communication with businesses and retain jobs in Medford Square.

249
00:24:55,848 --> 00:25:00,409
And I think that it's going to be a challenge over the next few years with the bridge being under construction.

250
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:06,030
And I don't have any blanket solution, but it's something that we should keep our eyes on.

251
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,331
We need to work toward job retention, if not job creation.

252
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,583
Public service agencies, I'll briefly go through those, if you don't mind.

253
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:16,904
We had a couple that funded that are not in here.

254
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:20,325
So we had a very small cut from last year.

255
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:21,126
It was about $933.

256
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:23,347
There were a few applications.

257
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:26,388
I'll just run through those agencies, and then they're not being proposed for funding.

258
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,449
One was Medford in the middle, which was an after-school program.

259
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:33,631
They really weren't prepared for the block grant program.

260
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:38,853
I don't think there was quite an understanding about what was required, what the eligibility components were, and what

261
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,509
an agency was required to do for documentation.

262
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:43,070
So they withdrew that application.

263
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,692
They may come forward in the future, I don't really know, but that application was withdrawn.

264
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:49,054
Just to Start applied for some money.

265
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:52,796
It was duplicative to another effort, which was the pro bono legal services.

266
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:55,298
They're not being recommended for any money Just to Start.

267
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,559
And the final was Medford Housing Authority.

268
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:06,125
While they spoke about the great need of providing social work, a social worker over at Walkland Court, quite honestly, we just can't afford it.

269
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,507
And we'd have to cut other agencies they asked for.

270
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:16,504
They ask for $11,648 for a part-time schedule, and we just have to cut that from another agency to give them, so we're not making that recommendation.

271
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:22,849
We think it's a worthwhile service, but I don't see how we fund that without hurting another agency that we've had a longer-term relationship with.

272
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,911
So I'll go through those briefly.

273
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:33,979
A better tomorrow, we are recommending, and these are just nominal cuts from last year, little tiny cuts, less than 0.1%, like half a percent, less than half a percent.

274
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:36,738
$3,778.

275
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:36,738
Boys and Girls Club, $1,937.

276
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:37,139
Bread of Life, $1,048.

277
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:37,899
Community Family, Inc., $1,745.

278
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:39,199
Consumer Advisory Commission, $6,802.

279
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,120
The Council on Aging, $60,028.

280
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,320
EMARC, $4,533.

281
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,760
Heading Home, $3,778.

282
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:05,875
Housing for Families, $5,441.

283
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:20,322
That's a new agency here basically taking over the pro bono legal service project that TRICAP was running.

284
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:23,484
TRICAP dissolved and actually it's the same staff.

285
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:27,386
So they've been hired by Heading Home.

286
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:30,067
So that would be the continuation, excuse me, Housing for Families.

287
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:31,548
That would be continuation of that program.

288
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:33,529
Immigrant Learning Center, $3,778.

289
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:35,571
Medford Public Schools, it's an after school program, $8,505.

290
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:36,992
Mystic Valley Elder Services, $8,161.

291
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:37,912
Salvation Army, $1,162.

292
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,514
SEM Community Transportation, $83,885.

293
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:40,615
And West Medford Community Center, $20,485.

294
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:43,016
Those are the recommendations for public services.

295
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:11,684
I think I will stop there, and maybe there are others who want to speak in favor and opposition, but I will ask, I would ask the council if they would tonight authorize that submission of that application.

296
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:12,524
I would appreciate that.

297
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,244
Very good.

298
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:20,927
So to continue the public hearing, anybody else in favor, please present themselves to the podium.

299
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:22,928
Anyone else in favor?

300
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,389
Hearing and seeing none.

301
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:31,234
We open up this portion of the meeting to those in opposition to the proposal.

302
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:35,395
Anybody in opposition, please present yourself to the podium.

303
00:28:38,396 --> 00:28:40,077
Anyone in opposition to the proposal?

304
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:50,721
Hearing and seeing none, I open up the floor to my esteemed council colleagues and recognize the Right Honorable Paul A. Camuso.

305
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:52,142
Thank you, Mr. President.

306
00:28:52,802 --> 00:28:54,543
And thank you very much for your presentation.

307
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:08,790
Certainly, I think this is a very fair and equitable plan that gives much needed funds to the human service community that directly gives a positive impact on the families that utilize them on a daily basis.

308
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,670
So I am in support of this.

309
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,210
I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

310
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:19,952
And if I could just ask one question, just because there's a little, it's a little bit off topic, but I know Lauren's been handling it and it's not putting you on the spot.

311
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:21,632
The anticipated

312
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,234
completion of the Christopher Campbell Peace Guide.

313
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:26,194
Is it this calendar year or next calendar year?

314
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:27,394
Do you know?

315
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,575
We certainly hope it will be this calendar year.

316
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:36,597
It's a little bit out of our control, and I only say that because the state is actually, MassDOT is the agency that will put the project out to bid.

317
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:37,037
Okay.

318
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:42,639
So the execution of contracts, the actual award of the contract is out of the city's control.

319
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,541
So our schedule has been actually, the city of Medford's schedule would have been that it started already.

320
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:48,061
Okay.

321
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,302
But I hope so, and I can update you once it's out to bid in the

322
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:53,874
the bids are received.

323
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:58,577
And the reason I ask that is because I think it's a very good project.

324
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:02,821
And I was under the impression that it was going to be this year.

325
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,944
But as we approach May, construction-wise, I just wasn't sure that we could get it done.

326
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:07,524
That's right.

327
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:16,331
So I mean, generally, the project is mostly ground improvements, and then some basically landscaping, and there's some furnishings.

328
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,613
So it depends on when it's awarded.

329
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,955
If the worst comes to worst, you know,

330
00:30:21,651 --> 00:30:25,375
The big factor is really when it's awarded, when the contract is awarded, the contractor starts.

331
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:29,899
And the other is whether or not it will be too cold to plant landscaping materials.

332
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:36,465
So the worst case scenario should be that the plants are planted in the spring when it's weather appropriate to do that.

333
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,792
But this should really be, from a construction standpoint, no reason why it can't be completed.

334
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:46,414
It's more dependent on the timing of the state to move this process ahead and get it completed.

335
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:56,457
And I'd like to recognize Council President for giving me the leeway to ask that question, because I know some people were asking, and as we got later in the year, didn't know if it was actually feasible to get it done by the end of the year.

336
00:30:56,477 --> 00:30:57,238
So, yes, thank you.

337
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,098
Thank you very much, Councilor.

338
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,339
Camuso.

339
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:02,780
Vice President Longo-Kern.

340
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,340
Thank you, President De La Russo.

341
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,301
Lauren, can I ask a quick question?

342
00:31:08,005 --> 00:31:11,707
The public service funding, you said the half a percent was cut.

343
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,708
Is that across the board, or were there?

344
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:16,690
I think we generally did it across the board.

345
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,071
I just don't have last year figures.

346
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:23,834
So there's no public agency that got more than half of a percentage cut?

347
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:27,696
Was there anybody that we gave more than half a percent on this one?

348
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:27,756
No.

349
00:31:28,077 --> 00:31:32,239
Last year we had a little cut, and we kept anybody who was under a couple of thousand dollars didn't get cut.

350
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,381
But this year everybody got cut again across the board.

351
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:41,295
It was so nominal it came out to like $30 or $40 for some of these small agencies, so that's what we did.

352
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:50,778
And then with regards to the Mitford Senior Center, do you have a breakdown of, I know you named about five different projects.

353
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:53,159
Do you have a breakdown of what's actually where?

354
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,199
I can give that to you.

355
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,179
I have a preliminary estimate.

356
00:31:55,199 --> 00:32:03,262
When I tell you it's not fully designed, it's a very rough estimate, but within that it shows the components of the work.

357
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:04,642
So all the work is listed.

358
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:05,503
Yes, I can provide that to you.

359
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,342
City Clerk, can we just put that in the record?

360
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:14,264
We're gonna add to the record, Mr. Clerk.

361
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:20,027
Just a breakdown of preliminary estimate with regards to the Medford Senior Center.

362
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:22,149
Of the scope of work.

363
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:27,672
Scope of work, and also with the, obviously, where are we?

364
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:30,433
The Housing Authority.

365
00:32:31,334 --> 00:32:33,235
The Housing Authority, what they proposed to do?

366
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:33,775
Yes.

367
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,721
I'm going to keep good track of what the housing authority is doing.

368
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:40,181
Well, we'll definitely do that.

369
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:43,242
I mean, already, you know, they'll provide a scope of work.

370
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:48,584
We've already talked to them about it being under federal compliant with the federal regulations, not state regulated.

371
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:50,045
Normally they use state funding.

372
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,745
So the real regulation is completely different.

373
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:56,627
We'll make sure that they're using federal wage rates and it's done in accordance with the federal guidelines.

374
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:06,303
And we planned on expending the $500,000 from 2014 and the $641,000 on the senior center this year.

375
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:10,886
It was a big decision whether to bid it all as one or do it as two projects.

376
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:15,229
We made the decision to do it in two separate projects.

377
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,272
The one type of work on the exterior really is independent than the interior.

378
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:23,186
You know, we may get two contractors working there at the same time.

379
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:27,770
Plus, we have to work with the senior center to make sure we're not disrupting programs.

380
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,692
And if we do, that it's done on a limited basis.

381
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:34,775
So the interior work is a little bit harder to coordinate with the operation of their program.

382
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:39,038
And when will be the hope to finish both projects?

383
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,861
I would say by next June 30th.

384
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,942
So in the program, yeah.

385
00:33:44,783 --> 00:33:45,764
June 30th, 2016.

386
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:47,105
The roof should be done.

387
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,967
There's really no reason why the roof wouldn't be done by fall.

388
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:59,199
And then the same thing with the housing programs, you mentioned this 5,000 in this year's budget, and then there's 250,000 left over from last year's.

389
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,380
Yeah, probably from a bunch of years, you know, actually.

390
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,580
So the balance there is $250,000.

391
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,521
So after this year, it'll be $255,000.

392
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,121
Do we plan on expending that?

393
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:09,096
with it?

394
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,717
You know, I don't know if it will all be spent.

395
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:15,498
It really depends on whether or not there's one or more projects that come forward.

396
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:19,779
We generally have been using that for assisting nonprofits to do housing projects.

397
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,540
And normally what will happen is they need money with like a down payment or something like that, you know, where they need.

398
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:32,282
So it depends on what they find for prop properties and how costly it will be to, uh, to move ahead on it.

399
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:35,603
So you can, um, so there may be more than one applications throughout the year.

400
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:36,827
Is that correct?

401
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:37,387
Yes, exactly.

402
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:47,770
And then I think one of my last questions, the South Street in Winthrop, what exactly, I know that was brought up last year, they were going to possibly put a speed bump?

403
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,271
Well, I think what's going to happen, HUD won't pay for anything.

404
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,312
So we have engaged an engineer.

405
00:34:55,612 --> 00:34:57,052
They really haven't started the design yet.

406
00:34:57,112 --> 00:35:01,273
It is going to require some work with Conservation Commission because of its proximity to the river.

407
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,900
Which makes it a little bit of a longer process.

408
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,481
But essentially they came up with two ideas.

409
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,282
One was to put this little island in the center.

410
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:15,808
And the other idea, which I think is probably a better idea, is to bump out the curb on the... Let's see, what side would that be?

411
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:16,488
That would be the south side.

412
00:35:16,528 --> 00:35:17,309
On the side of the river.

413
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,290
On the south side, yeah.

414
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,990
So where the houses are.

415
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:20,811
Bump out the curbing.

416
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:25,334
So across the street from where the bridge is and the grass trim, across the other side where the houses are.

417
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:31,938
On South Street, they would bring that curb out to narrow down the width of the roadway and slow the traffic down.

418
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:37,441
Slow the traffic down so people would have to actually use their blinkers rather than taking the quick turn.

419
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:38,481
Exactly.

420
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:43,984
And that is mainly, I mean, that has to do with people crossing to go to Memorial Park.

421
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:45,845
Well, it's a public safety issue.

422
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,421
fly and take that corner.

423
00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:49,801
They don't slow down at all.

424
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:50,962
It's very wide open.

425
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,363
I think the cars move through it quite well, but the people don't.

426
00:35:54,663 --> 00:36:01,326
So yes, it's to just improve pedestrian safety and allow people to access the park who have disabilities.

427
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:04,107
Right now, there's no curb cuts, so that needs to be done.

428
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:05,807
Curb cuts will be added?

429
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:06,447
Yes.

430
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:08,508
So what's the process?

431
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:13,010
Once you figure out option A or option B, you'll request proposals?

432
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:23,615
What will happen is there's an engineer on board, so now we have to, we really have to decide what alternative is going to go ahead, and I think there needs to be a little input from some residents on that.

433
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:35,259
There'll be a notice of intent that has to be filed with the Conservation Commission, and they'll basically, you know, say whether or not a full environmental review is going to be required for this and have to go through them for that.

434
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:35,859
I hope not.

435
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:37,340
I mean, it's all pavement now.

436
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
It's not like we're taking green space.

437
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,781
We're actually making, you know, we're decreasing the,

438
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:47,419
impervious material, so it should be a benefit from an environmental standpoint, not a detriment.

439
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,641
So we have to do that kind of coordination first.

440
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:55,225
The engineer then will move ahead with whatever the preferred alternative is, do full engineering plans.

441
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,809
We'll submit those to the state if the Chapter 90 ends up being the other funding source.

442
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:05,193
We'll submit the scope of work to the state for its approval and also to HUD to see what items they'll say we can pay for.

443
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,250
And then that will go out to bid.

444
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:13,032
And then once the bid's received, the lowest bidder will be awarded the contract if they are a responsible bidder.

445
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,652
So that's going to, you know, that'll take a little bit of while.

446
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,833
I think that will, you know, be through early fall, I would say.

447
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:20,934
And you will have a public hearing for the neighborhood?

448
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:23,674
You know, an input meeting, you mean?

449
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:23,954
Correct.

450
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:27,675
There'll definitely be a public hearing at Conservation Commission, but yeah, we can, yeah, yeah.

451
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,456
I think there'll be some kind of input meeting so they can see the two alternatives.

452
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:38,893
If we could just put that as part of the record, just the council requesting a public meeting before the work on South Street and Winthrop Street is started.

453
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:48,962
I grew up in South Street, so I know a lot of people on South Street that would be interested in, I think, input from the residents who are traversing the area all the time.

454
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:51,944
It'll definitely be a change from what's going on today.

455
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:55,427
Some may see it as positive and some may see it as negative.

456
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,250
That's all the questions I have for right now.

457
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,551
Thank you.

458
00:38:01,616 --> 00:38:03,237
Madam Vice President, thank you.

459
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:09,601
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, as amended, Councilor Penta.

460
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:31,013
Lauren, you sent us a letter on April 24th, and in that letter on the second paragraph, you state as follows, for communities that are part of a regional housing consortium, the entitlement community must participate in a regional consolidation plan, which must describe and address the community development plans of all community development block grant entitlement communities that are members of the consortium.

461
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:35,711
So my question to you is, are we a member of the consortium, number one?

462
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:42,495
And number two, where are the monies, or are we giving monies to other communities that are in this consortium, unlike projects?

463
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:43,395
OK.

464
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:52,240
So the consortium is a separate application in order to be eligible for housing money through the consortium, home money.

465
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,422
It is individual communities.

466
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:58,943
If you didn't meet a certain threshold, you had to combine with other communities.

467
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:01,425
And so small communities like Bedford, Arlington, Melrose,

468
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,880
meet that threshold, so we have to combine with other communities to apply.

469
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:06,741
So we are part of a READS.

470
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,842
It's a whole separate plan.

471
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:12,106
It's submitted through the lead agency, which is the Malden Redevelopment Authority.

472
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:18,010
They do the administrative responsibilities, so like what I do for the Community Development Block Grant Program, they do for the HOME Program.

473
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:21,007
and they coordinate the activities of eight member communities.

474
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:27,235
And there's a little bit over a million dollars of home money that will be available this year.

475
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:32,603
And the way that goes is basically the communities or any nonprofit can apply for home money.

476
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,877
And also for-profit developers can apply for it.

477
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:44,422
But it's all for the provision and the creation of housing for lower income people that's about 60% median income or less.

478
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:49,665
So yes, the money can't, we don't get our own share, we get a regional share.

479
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,667
And we're eligible to apply for it, and those other communities also can apply for it.

480
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,768
And so can't other developers in those communities.

481
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:57,589
Did I answer your question?

482
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,630
No, not really.

483
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,011
Are you saying that we are or we are not eligible?

484
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:03,072
We are eligible.

485
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:12,102
So since we are eligible, are we going to be taxed at any point in time from another community development plan because you're part of this consortium?

486
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:14,363
Are we going to be taxed, so to speak?

487
00:40:14,403 --> 00:40:18,685
Are we going to have to give up some monies that benefit the plan and another community?

488
00:40:18,705 --> 00:40:18,925
Oh, OK.

489
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:21,446
So sometimes, for instance, I'll give you a for instance.

490
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:24,568
So not for any other community.

491
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,062
But I'll give you, for instance, Medford Community Housing.

492
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,564
They applied for home money, and they applied for block grant funds.

493
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:33,206
But that was a project that was in Medford, so that benefited the city of Medford.

494
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:38,570
But we will not give up any CDBG funds to another community to implement our home project.

495
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,092
Any CDBG funds will be used within the city of Medford.

496
00:40:42,252 --> 00:40:44,334
Now, are they eligible to apply for home funds?

497
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:49,317
Yes, they are, through the regional consortium, if they're a member community.

498
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:51,578
Second question is this.

499
00:40:53,595 --> 00:41:02,523
This idea of giving the housing authority $15,000, of all the people that have applied, they are sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenues.

500
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:03,944
Why would you be doing that?

501
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:07,948
I mean, I'm not worried about trying to develop a relationship with them.

502
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:11,971
They never even got back to us after the feds went in there and did an in-depth investigation.

503
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:21,119
And we were supposed to get a report back as to whether they were or were not adhering to the rules and regulations of not only federal practices, but also accounting practices.

504
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,637
for which, again, we have yet to receive anything back.

505
00:41:24,437 --> 00:41:25,118
That's number one.

506
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:41,970
But why would you give money to someone who sits on hundreds and thousands of dollars of revenue that they receive both from federal and state when you have so many other small little agencies who are trying to work their butts off to offer services in a myriad of ways within this community?

507
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:43,652
I can't buy that.

508
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,532
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,094
Well, they have a long history with us.

510
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,815
I've been here for all of it, and I've suffered through it, too.

511
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,617
And I will say this.

512
00:41:50,957 --> 00:41:53,439
Number one is, this is a state agency.

513
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,520
This is a state-funded development.

514
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,543
It's the only state-funded development left, so they cannot spend any of the federal money.

515
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:04,006
And the federal money is really where the money is in for modernization activities.

516
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,327
State is very limited.

517
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:10,035
They have, I know, I'm sure if you've been down to walking court, they have a lot of needs there.

518
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:14,258
And the reason why it would go, first of all, the public service agencies can't use this money.

519
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:21,562
We can only fund 15% of the total grant for public services and we've maximized that funding in the list that you have here tonight.

520
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:24,259
So this is more like a physical improvement.

521
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:28,041
So it comes out of other money that we could use for physical improvements.

522
00:42:28,601 --> 00:42:31,842
And so the reason is for the elderly people who are living there.

523
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:36,664
That's the number one reason, is because they're the ones who are living in poor housing conditions.

524
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:46,209
Well, maybe they should transfer the monies that they just approved for parks and recreation and for new courts in the same area and use it for the air conditioning and make that the priority.

525
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,951
Well, there are a lot of other sources of funding that the city could suggest through its budget.

526
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:56,915
The primary purpose of the funding here that we have tonight is to benefit low and moderate income people.

527
00:42:57,235 --> 00:43:05,122
I understand your concerns about working with them, but like I said, it's a small amount of money, and it's air conditioning for elderly people who are in a community center.

528
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:10,827
And I assure you that I will be monitoring the use of this money.

529
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,048
Lauren, you may say it's a small amount of money.

530
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:14,269
It's $15,000.

531
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:20,074
That's not a small amount when you're taking less than $1,000 away from other benefactors who are looking for the money.

532
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:20,915
Mr. Clark.

533
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:26,190
I'm going to move to eliminate the $15,000 from the house from this budget for the housing authority.

534
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:49,640
Also, you, you talked about planning and administration for $286,000 in that $286,000 there is a comment that says whenever possible, the city will make every effort to attract discretionary and formula grant funds from federal and state sources to meet community development objectives.

535
00:43:50,388 --> 00:44:04,998
Now, if I understand that correctly, that's telling me that either A, you're going to hire somebody, or B, you're going to hire a consultant who has the ability to go out there and get additional monies, either through a grant or through some type of discretionary fund for me.

536
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:05,218
Okay.

537
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:10,382
Well, first of all, I'd like to believe that we have the ability to do that in-house with our current staff.

538
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:18,968
So why the wording is in there is- Well, maybe the next mayor coming in will take a look at all of this and understand that a two-person office can't do this, and I understand that.

539
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,878
But I'm more concerned over if this is what the objective is to hire someone.

540
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:25,840
No, the statement in there is because we do planning activities.

541
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,941
We pay for planning staff in the office.

542
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:30,843
We pay for Rachel's salary, who's the housing and CDBG administrator.

543
00:44:31,203 --> 00:44:33,944
We pay for a portion of Chloe's salary, who's the economic development planner.

544
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:35,005
And that's what's not in here.

545
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:35,245
No.

546
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,887
That's what's not described here as part of the 286.

547
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:38,087
Right.

548
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:39,047
Well, it is general.

549
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:45,471
But this is basically because what it's saying, you know, HUD wants to be the funder of last resort.

550
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:46,852
They don't want to be the funder of,

551
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:49,865
everything that the city should be doing on its own.

552
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:59,528
So basically that's in there to admit, let them know when we, so for instance, if there's a project that has multiples like the chapter nine in South street, I mean that will be, we'll call that leverage funds.

553
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:05,389
And that's basically says we're using some of our planning efforts to also work with and coordinate with other agencies.

554
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:06,689
So it's a general description.

555
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:10,990
I understand what you're saying, but it's a general description and it's been there every year.

556
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,971
Mr. Clark, you who Mr. Clark,

557
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:18,317
Is he paying attention or not?

558
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:24,882
Mr. Clark, the council has a question, right?

559
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:33,428
If you ran the meeting like you're supposed to, I'd like to put an addendum on there that we get a complete breakdown of the $286,754 for the purposes of any and all salaries.

560
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:39,868
Well, it's more than that.

561
00:45:39,928 --> 00:45:41,288
It's any planning activity.

562
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:44,089
Any consultant that has to- No, I'm talking about employee salaries in this building.

563
00:45:44,189 --> 00:45:44,830
Oh, you'll get that.

564
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:50,132
I can give that to you as part of our regular budget when there's a separate- No, it should have been here for tonight, okay?

565
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:50,812
But that's not 200.

566
00:45:50,972 --> 00:45:52,173
I mean, that's a supportion.

567
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:53,313
I said any part of the $286,000.

568
00:45:53,373 --> 00:45:55,214
That goes towards salaries.

569
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:57,435
That goes towards salaries by name and by title.

570
00:45:57,735 --> 00:45:59,416
Yes, I can provide that.

571
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:01,236
And the office of security development.

572
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:01,657
Do you have that?

573
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:04,858
Who?

574
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:07,339
Yeah.

575
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:08,893
No, I'm talking to him.

576
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:13,114
Mr. Clerk, did you understand that?

577
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:14,635
Did you get it?

578
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:19,276
Thank you.

579
00:46:19,296 --> 00:46:26,377
Is the council through for the time being?

580
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:28,558
Councilor Knight.

581
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:30,738
Mr. President, thank you very much.

582
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:31,038
And Ms.

583
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:33,979
DiLorenzo, I want to thank you for your time and effort and energy, as well as Ms.

584
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,299
Powers for putting this plan together.

585
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:37,060
I think it's rather comprehensive.

586
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:45,910
In looking through the public service agencies, I noticed that there are about eight agencies that will service close to 1,500 families here in Medford.

587
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:51,498
And the other seven agencies of the clientele that they service is 100% Medford residents.

588
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,762
So I really think that the plan was given some

589
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,041
consideration and some concise review.

590
00:46:57,602 --> 00:47:03,525
I think we're going to get a lot of bang for our buck in looking at the proposal and the requests for applications versus what was funded.

591
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:12,589
I see that a number of the agencies that didn't service as many Medford residents have actually been not so lucky this time around to receive funding.

592
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:18,372
However, those agencies that do provide the majority of funding to residents that are from our city is included in here.

593
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:20,293
So, you know, I just want to commend you on your work.

594
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:21,533
I know this isn't an easy job.

595
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,026
you know, we're on year 41 of an action plan.

596
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:30,470
And the big question I have is, you know, are we meeting our goals and objectives that are established from the action plan?

597
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,553
Um, we want to develop strong partnerships to develop, to develop low and moderate income housing.

598
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:39,696
Um, what percentage of our housing stock at this point in time would be low and moderate?

599
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:44,240
So the there's, that's a complex answer, so I'll give it to you.

600
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:49,784
So in the, you know, everybody uses the threshold of 10%, which is a state guideline.

601
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:57,311
And that 10%, how they define affordable housing, are basically projects that are long-term restricted and have some sort of subsidy in them.

602
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:07,119
So they're not, if Mrs. Jones has a tenant downstairs and she gives her a discounted rent to live there, that's not counted.

603
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,103
A group home that was not deed restricted and

604
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:14,674
people who live in there or maybe on a transitional basis, they're not counted.

605
00:48:15,174 --> 00:48:20,678
So, in general, we have, honestly, in real truth, we have a lot more than we're actually counted on the state inventory.

606
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:23,120
But the state inventory is generally about 7.9%.

607
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:28,664
I do think it's going to decrease because we have a number of multiple family housing in there.

608
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:33,591
So but we have been imposing 10%, so that basically means we're keeping status quo on those.

609
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:34,531
So it's going to be difficult.

610
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:43,176
I mean, we'd have to almost produce about 1,000 units of almost all of our housing, and the next couple of years would have to be low and moderate income to make that threshold.

611
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:47,399
But the city has, you know, a good number of units that are available.

612
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:56,124
It's just that we live in a dense city, and the way that the state guidelines go, they look at land areas, say, of your low and moderate projects, what we might have,

613
00:48:56,844 --> 00:49:08,586
You know, 150 units on, you know, 40,000 square feet of land, but you're only getting credit for 40,000 square feet of land or the units that meet the state.

614
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:11,547
So we do have room to improve in that area.

615
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:16,908
There is a housing need, documented housing need, especially with rentals and first time home buyer.

616
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:21,688
It's getting very difficult for people to find housing in this area.

617
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,649
And when they lose their current housing that is affordable,

618
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:28,597
It's very, very difficult for them to find a place in the city.

619
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:31,159
So we are working toward that.

620
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:34,402
And we're really reliant on a lot of nonprofits to develop this.

621
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:38,166
And they're smaller agencies, and they're maybe doing a couple of units a year.

622
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:39,947
So it's very slow moving.

623
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:41,849
OK.

624
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:42,450
Thank you very much.

625
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,950
I appreciate it.

626
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,411
Thanks for your work.

627
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:45,472
All set, Counselor?

628
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:45,913
Yes.

629
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,154
Thank you very much.

630
00:49:47,674 --> 00:49:48,595
Madam Vice President.

631
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:50,417
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

632
00:49:50,968 --> 00:50:03,339
Now that the $15,000 to the Medford Housing Authority is on the table to be eliminated, you mentioned it's the last state, I know we learned this in the meeting as well, the Committee of the Whole meeting, it's the last state housing within Medford.

633
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:09,344
And the federal dollars, obviously, there's more federal dollars.

634
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:14,249
Do you know how much savings the Medford Housing Authority has for state dollars?

635
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,313
No, I don't know how much they have.

636
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:17,714
In reserves, you mean?

637
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:19,775
Basically, how much unexpected money?

638
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:20,376
No.

639
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:21,997
How much?

640
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:25,679
What are they getting for next year, do you know?

641
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,501
They're only getting $50,000?

642
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:33,585
Okay, so Rachel's basically saying the current reserve in state housing is $30,000, and next year they expect $50,000.

643
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:35,346
I mean, it's pitiful.

644
00:50:35,906 --> 00:50:40,589
It really is pitiful, what the state is expecting to be done for housing conditions.

645
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,692
Now, how do you know that?

646
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,841
figures from the state.

647
00:50:45,861 --> 00:51:03,672
Well, we had conversations and meetings with the housing authority in developing that plan, so I just didn't want to cite it unless I just want to confirm that with Rachel, but we can get that in writing from them if you want, ask for it, but I think if we're not giving them the money, then they're, I don't know how they're going to feel about that, but it's public information, we'll request it if you like.

648
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:06,653
But you see $50,000 in all those units is nothing.

649
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:08,575
I know, I agree.

650
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:09,395
It's just not enough money.

651
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,156
I see both sides to it.

652
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:12,117
That was in my...

653
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:19,573
years on the council that was probably the most disturbing set of issues that has come before the council or that we've spoken about.

654
00:51:19,673 --> 00:51:23,656
So, I mean, I probably feel the same way as your office does and the rest of the council.

655
00:51:23,736 --> 00:51:28,540
So I'm apprehensive in voting for it unless obviously you're on top of it, which you will be.

656
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:32,744
depending on the reserves, I guess, is where I'd make my decision.

657
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:37,765
Now, is there any way to hold that portion of it until next week so we can get those figures?

658
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:55,411
If you want to make, if you want to give some guidance that if they have under whatever amount of money, if they don't expect to receive, if they're not going to receive more than, say, $50,000 in state funding next year that you approve that, then I'll just leave it in there and I'll work with them on it.

659
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:59,292
I would feel more comfortable with that than, you know, eliminating it entirely.

660
00:52:00,225 --> 00:52:02,605
maybe put some parameters on it, then you'd have my vote.

661
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:06,346
I just... They've never been refused money by the state, have they?

662
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:06,906
By the state?

663
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:09,267
They've gotten money each and every year for their state projects.

664
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,128
They have, but you're just hearing the magnitude of money that's available, Councillor.

665
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:24,730
And I think if you, you know, I'm not going to say if you go down there, I'm sure you've been down there and you know people living there, that it's a lot more money than $50,000 needs to be done in improvements over there.

666
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:29,491
So maybe they should tackle that rather than other issues that they have over there.

667
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:31,400
They got concerned.

668
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:36,425
Would you be willing to vote on that part separately than the rest of the application?

669
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:39,088
I'd like to just lay that portion on the table for a week until we get an answer.

670
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:40,129
OK.

671
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:43,131
Well, I've got to get this application moved.

672
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:44,553
I mean, I want you to vote on the application.

673
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:48,256
You can amend it at the last minute if you have to.

674
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:51,760
Because you'd be submitting it at the end of the week?

675
00:52:52,922 --> 00:52:55,163
I'll be submitting on the 15th, but I really don't want to come back for it.

676
00:52:55,223 --> 00:52:56,724
I don't want to open the public hearing back up.

677
00:52:56,984 --> 00:53:01,626
I want to get that paperwork in, because we are working with a consultant on this, and we are working with all the other cities.

678
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:06,568
And the electronic submission now, this year, is going to be with all the communities at the same time.

679
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:11,690
So it's just working with HUD and the software programs is not a picnic.

680
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:13,231
What's your actual deadline?

681
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:13,771
The 15th.

682
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,372
It has to be submitted by the 15th.

683
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,453
The 15th of May.

684
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:17,873
Yes.

685
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:19,814
This is only the 27th of April.

686
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:21,295
You can't find out within a week?

687
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:23,870
Well, we just told you what the amounts were.

688
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:47,179
I mean, I just, I think it's... You don't have to fund it, and they can not do another project over there, but I mean, it's up to you if you want to do that or not, but... Medford residents are in those buildings, too, so it's tough, it's tough, yeah.

689
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:51,914
Seeing since it's Councilor Knight.

690
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:54,095
Can you tell me how many residents live down Markland Court?

691
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:56,915
I think it's 144, right?

692
00:53:57,395 --> 00:53:59,176
Is that 144 units?

693
00:53:59,196 --> 00:53:59,636
144 residents.

694
00:54:01,377 --> 00:54:02,977
Yeah, it's 144 units.

695
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:06,498
And none of the units in that facility are air-conditioned, are they?

696
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:07,398
I don't think so.

697
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:12,460
I think that's why their argument at the public service meeting was that this was the centralized place for them to go.

698
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,480
This is the area where they'll congregate.

699
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,941
Yeah, it's not that big either.

700
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,241
But we vote there, I think.

701
00:54:18,115 --> 00:54:26,417
But there's been some improvements there in recent years where they've done some upgrades to make the place a little bit more hospitable and livable for the residents.

702
00:54:26,437 --> 00:54:27,117
Yeah.

703
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:34,478
No, they're not going to the individual units.

704
00:54:34,518 --> 00:54:38,579
Councillor Knight, do you still have a floor?

705
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:39,659
We were told that they do not.

706
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,780
I do, but I'm satisfied with my questions being answered from Mr. Lorenzo.

707
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,601
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

708
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:47,481
Does Councillor Pinto wish to be recognized?

709
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:59,940
Why are we spending money into a center that was already rehabbed before when you're leaving the 124 units still without air conditioning?

710
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,882
I think they need to answer that question.

711
00:55:03,182 --> 00:55:09,847
I think what their argument is, because they said this in the public meeting, was that that's, first of all, it's not a lot of money.

712
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,609
It's a small amount of money.

713
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:15,872
I know $15,000 is a lot of money, but in general, with a project that size, it's not.

714
00:55:16,427 --> 00:55:27,692
that the investment in the community center at least gives them a place to go during the day, a centralized place that is air conditioned, which obviously is a lot less expensive than installing air conditioning into individual units.

715
00:55:28,213 --> 00:55:35,656
So then maybe they are, if you looked at the minutes of their last meeting, you can look at the parks and the developments that they're doing on the outsides of pieces of the property.

716
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:41,339
If I was a senior citizen and I was living there, and I haven't had air conditioning for all these years, and I all of a sudden

717
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:49,686
your air conditioning and community center that I don't sleep in at night time because I'm going to have to go and during the course, I'm not going to spend all day in the community center.

718
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:57,273
Maybe they should be putting a program together to show how they're going to air condition those units that the people live in day in and day out.

719
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:00,356
They give them heat in the winter time, we'll give them air conditioning in the summer.

720
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:04,259
The housing authority is required to do their own planning processes for the public housing division of HUD.

721
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,701
They have a public housing plan.

722
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:10,638
And perhaps that's maybe what you would like to request of them, is a copy of their proposed plan.

723
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,479
Maybe they should come before us, Lauren, before the council.

724
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,521
I'm going to stick to my issue.

725
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:18,963
If you want to lay it on the table for a week, let the council go over it.

726
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:20,223
I really don't want to lay it on the table.

727
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,906
No, I mean, let the council go over it, subject to whether they get the money in on the issue.

728
00:56:23,966 --> 00:56:27,468
If you want to take it out, and then you want them to come back, and you want to find it later on in the year?

729
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:29,588
We'll put it back in later on in the year.

730
00:56:29,608 --> 00:56:29,868
Fair enough.

731
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:39,034
I can, you know, at this stage it's, but I, I believe that you should fund it, but I'm separate that from the main paper.

732
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:40,175
Councilor Camuso.

733
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:46,880
So a request for roll call on the motion for approval and sever the question of the 15 grand.

734
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,501
The sever has to come first.

735
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:50,042
Whatever.

736
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:52,804
I just, I'm for it.

737
00:56:52,924 --> 00:56:54,965
And if I can state, I have the floor, Mr. President.

738
00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:57,947
This is for the Alfonso Caro Center.

739
00:56:58,908 --> 00:57:05,111
It's the common area of that development, and it's where most of the things take place down there.

740
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:07,973
It's where election day is held.

741
00:57:09,314 --> 00:57:19,099
So this is definitely a common area, and this is where you're going to get the best impact for the best dollar, and I support it.

742
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,321
The improvements that were made over the last few years were significant.

743
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:23,382
There were squirrels and raccoons living in the building.

744
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,847
prior to the last improvements.

745
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:32,089
So I certainly do support this as a quality of life issue, and it's coming from the federal government.

746
00:57:32,689 --> 00:57:39,672
So rather than get rid of it, I'd rather see it funded here than in Milwaukee or Nevada or somewhere else that we'll be putting in for funds as well.

747
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:42,173
That's a point of further information, clarification.

748
00:57:42,853 --> 00:57:46,755
When the dedication took place at the Fond du Carreau Center, the place was air conditioned at that time.

749
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:49,016
So what happened to the air condition from then until now?

750
00:57:49,476 --> 00:57:51,837
Yeah, I think the heat pump, is that what they call it, the heat pump?

751
00:57:51,857 --> 00:57:52,357
I have no idea.

752
00:57:53,368 --> 00:57:56,450
But they should have been better prepared when they made their presentation before the city council.

753
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:57,271
Councilor Caviello.

754
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:58,152
Thank you, Mr. President.

755
00:57:58,452 --> 00:58:01,874
I don't know if you know, but at walking court, it's all baseboard heating.

756
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:02,555
There's no vent.

757
00:58:02,775 --> 00:58:03,816
There's no vent system.

758
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:08,539
So even if you wanted to put it in air condition, they'd have to pretty much tear the whole building down to put a vent thing.

759
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,442
It would probably be cheaper for the city to go out and buy an air conditioner for every window.

760
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:14,043
Precisely.

761
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:15,124
And then do that.

762
00:58:15,144 --> 00:58:20,728
But you know, I say, having a relative lived in there, there's just no way of putting air conditioner in there.

763
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:21,449
And I would support.

764
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:26,974
You know, the other said that heat pumps have a lifespan of about 15, 20 years anyway, so they go.

765
00:58:27,614 --> 00:58:28,094
Exactly.

766
00:58:28,695 --> 00:58:41,462
So on the motion to sever the motions, to sever the reduction of the 15,000, all those in favor?

767
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:46,905
Present a question please to the council, and yes, vote is one 15,000 stated or?

768
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:56,545
The question is to sever the two votes so that we sever the question of the 15,000 from the main motion of approval.

769
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:10,314
Well, then it's self contradictory in the, to, to support, to support the paper would be to include the 15,000 in it.

770
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:18,967
Motion to sever.

771
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:19,747
All those in favour?

772
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:23,491
Councillor Camuso.

773
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:30,838
The only other way, I see Councillor Pinter's point, but the only other way would be taking a yay or nay vote on the entire paper as approved.

774
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:40,107
And from listening to the council, I don't think that the votes are there to take the $15,000 away from the Medford Housing Authority.

775
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:42,830
So in essence, if we vote yes,

776
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,230
as it, as it's on our agenda, it's approval for the whole paper.

777
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:53,195
That's so I was doing the sever out of respect for you, counselor, so that we could take a separate vote on that piece.

778
00:59:54,056 --> 00:59:57,038
If you want to, if I may, Mr. President, madam, thank you.

779
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:04,165
I'd ask you to sever it because when we submit the application to HUD, there are a lot of worthwhile agencies and projects in there.

780
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:09,489
And I like to see that you get to have them have an indication that the city council is behind all those other projects.

781
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:10,270
So I would ask you,

782
01:00:10,933 --> 01:00:15,977
to not have any negative votes on the submission of the application if we don't need to, not on something like this.

783
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:16,538
Very good.

784
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:22,222
So on the motion to sever, all those in favor of severing the two, aye.

785
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,124
Roll call on the sever.

786
01:00:24,504 --> 01:00:25,345
On the vote, please.

787
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:32,250
So on whether to remove the $15,000, a yes would be to remove the $15,000.

788
01:00:32,731 --> 01:00:35,013
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

789
01:00:37,074 --> 01:00:37,715
Councilor Penta.

790
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:42,257
Warren, you made the comment that we could vote to take it out and always put it back in.

791
01:00:43,437 --> 01:00:43,797
Correct?

792
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:46,939
Well, I mean, it'll... That's what you said.

793
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:51,801
It can be revised to eliminate that, but I've got to tell you, you know, it's, what month are we in here now?

794
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:52,702
We're at the end of April.

795
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:54,462
We're in May.

796
01:00:54,502 --> 01:00:54,762
May.

797
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:55,823
Effectively.

798
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:58,082
The project should be done and it should be done soon.

799
01:00:58,102 --> 01:01:01,243
The more we wait in time, then that means it doesn't happen for the summer.

800
01:01:01,323 --> 01:01:02,983
And if it's a worthwhile project, it is.

801
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,224
And if it's not, it's not.

802
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:06,085
And I don't think it's a matter of waiting in time.

803
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:11,166
I think your assistant there just got through saying that, you know, you're probably getting $50,000 more from the state this year.

804
01:01:11,587 --> 01:01:15,068
And if you're getting that kind of money, they have other activities that they're going to do with that money.

805
01:01:15,148 --> 01:01:18,309
If we give them this and they can do other projects over there, other improvements.

806
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:20,310
See, that's the whole thing.

807
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:23,851
When they came before us that night at that meeting, they were so ill prepared.

808
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,692
to talk about where they were going with the projects.

809
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:27,673
They just wanted our money.

810
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:29,474
They just wanted the community block grant money.

811
01:01:30,115 --> 01:01:31,796
They're sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars.

812
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:33,538
They have grant writers over there.

813
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:34,999
They have specialists that could do this.

814
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:39,383
And to take the money from other deserving projects here in the city, I think it's wrong.

815
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:40,644
That's my opinion.

816
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:40,964
I hear you.

817
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:44,827
So, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

818
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:50,772
So a yes vote would be to eliminate the $15,000.

819
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:54,497
No.

820
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:54,777
No.

821
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:55,017
No.

822
01:01:55,117 --> 01:01:55,378
No.

823
01:01:56,478 --> 01:02:04,962
The vote of one absent one in favor and five in opposition.

824
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:05,683
The motion fails.

825
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,664
Now, before you call on the main motion,

826
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:24,348
Laura, let's go back and ask the question again.

827
01:02:24,488 --> 01:02:29,810
If in fact we go back to this $50,000 number at that point in time, could you pull this money?

828
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:33,271
I, what I will do is I will find out from them how much money they're going to get.

829
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:36,152
And I will give you a, I will tell you what that is.

830
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:39,413
And I will ask them if they've identified their projects and I will submit that to the council.

831
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:42,594
Point of information Councilor Camuso.

832
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:51,978
Um, in all due respect to Councilor Penta, that may be the druthers of one councilor, but there may be other councilors here that are in, in,

833
01:02:52,715 --> 01:03:04,424
favor of it as presented so that the $50,000 that's non-encumbered right now for a specific purpose can be utilized for the senior citizens within a development and not necessarily that development.

834
01:03:04,984 --> 01:03:09,808
If we fund this money, some of the federal money can be used at other developments in the city.

835
01:03:11,337 --> 01:03:16,418
The federal money that the housing authority gets can only be used on federally funded projects, will not be used on Walkland Court.

836
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:22,160
So I will ask them what their intended use of the funds of their capital improvement money is from the state at Walkland Court.

837
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,900
And I'm sure they will report on what their proposed projects are.

838
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,721
And if they do get money, and it's more than anticipated, they can do an additional project down there.

839
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:37,583
And quite honestly, Walkland Court's a lovely community, but it's probably the building that needs the most upgrades out of them all.

840
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:42,786
And that's from walking and traversing in all of them over quite a few years.

841
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:53,733
So I understand where the council is coming from, but to have the OCD director do that, when it may not be the druthers of the entire council, if he wants to do something like that, then let's take a vote on it.

842
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:55,524
That's basically all I'm saying.

843
01:03:55,584 --> 01:03:57,166
All we're doing is securing information, Paul.

844
01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:58,727
We're not asking you to take the money out.

845
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:04,553
All she's going to do is report back if they're getting the money, and if they are getting the money, whatever the council so chooses.

846
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:08,597
If the members of the council, once again, support asking that question.

847
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:11,059
Why would you not want to get information?

848
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,584
Because I know that over the years, that has been one development that has

849
01:04:16,925 --> 01:04:21,348
for lack of a better word, not receive some of the other upgrades that other developments have.

850
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:29,172
You go down here to 121 Riverside Avenue, they spent a lot of money in the lobby over the years, they spent a lot of money in the grounds.

851
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:38,977
Now I understand some of them are federal and some of them are state buildings, but the one you hear the most complaints about is Walkland Court.

852
01:04:39,077 --> 01:04:40,118
That becomes the whole issue, Paul.

853
01:04:40,598 --> 01:04:42,459
So let's give them as much money as we can.

854
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:46,780
That becomes the whole issue, because all they're going to be doing is keep putting Band-Aids and Band-Aids and Band-Aids.

855
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,621
They need a complete rehabilitation down there.

856
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:56,324
The Walkley Court development was not, all the other projects were federalized, a few of them were federalized, but the Walkley Court project was not federalized because it needed so much work.

857
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:03,955
But there should be a long-term plan for Waukling Court, and it probably includes some type of a new development, you know?

858
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:06,457
That's a long-term plan.

859
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:09,359
And very well possibly in the future, too.

860
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:22,048
It could be something where, with the Green Line coming into that particular area, that there may be other housing options where they can build a new development somewhere else within our community or in a neighboring community that's state-funded.

861
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:26,819
than possibly a whole new development.

862
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:27,519
I mean, we don't know.

863
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:28,659
That's going to be a hot area.

864
01:05:28,919 --> 01:05:32,220
There are solutions with a lot of communities, bosses doing it where they have mixed income.

865
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:32,760
Precisely.

866
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:37,201
If they keep the percent of the low income and they add some market rate units also.

867
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:38,141
Absolutely.

868
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:40,502
And that's what's keeping the units affordable.

869
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:43,823
But I think one of the issues, you're talking about the Green Line.

870
01:05:43,843 --> 01:05:45,363
That's not a definitive thing, number one.

871
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:49,604
Number two, that's not even looked upon by the president administration to spend another $150 million.

872
01:05:49,664 --> 01:05:51,885
The president administration is another six months.

873
01:05:54,407 --> 01:06:01,534
Talking about the State House administration, that's where the money is going to be coming from if the Green Line extension is going to come forward.

874
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:05,678
So you're going from the post office in South Medford all the way to Route 16.

875
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:06,900
That's not a done deal.

876
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,062
Then you have the area metropolitan area planning council.

877
01:06:09,082 --> 01:06:09,682
Point of information.

878
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:11,644
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

879
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:14,307
I'd like to ask the council, where the post office in South Medford is.

880
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:15,028
I'm not familiar.

881
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:17,106
The Tufts University, Tufts University, Tufts University.

882
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:17,346
All right.

883
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:17,786
The hillside.

884
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:18,006
All right.

885
01:06:18,026 --> 01:06:19,367
I was thinking more South Memphis square.

886
01:06:19,447 --> 01:06:20,188
So you take that.

887
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:37,157
I believe there's also a report, Lauren, that came back from the metropolitan area planning council that has itself supposedly at the end of route 16 for 165 units of affordable and low income housing for which the public hearing on that particular night that took place in room 207, there were many, many residents.

888
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:42,791
from the West Method area that were very upset about that because of the traffic, the congestion, the cars that would be parking there.

889
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:47,094
So there's a multitude of issues that are going on with this whole idea of the screen line extension.

890
01:06:47,374 --> 01:06:55,440
I'm more concerned about your housing authority, the housing, not yours, the housing authority that has not come forward with any type of a game plan for that walkway court.

891
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,442
And all I see is patchwork, patchwork.

892
01:06:57,735 --> 01:06:59,376
patchwork and I think it's totally unfair.

893
01:06:59,496 --> 01:07:07,580
I'm sure the council could request the housing authority director to come and give an update to the committee of the whole meeting or at the regular meeting of the housing authority and his plans for improvements.

894
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,621
I, I think that's a fair request.

895
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:10,621
Thank you.

896
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:15,303
So on the question, motion of approval by Councilor Camuso, uh, Mr. Clerk, please.

897
01:07:15,663 --> 01:07:18,445
Motion of approval as presented to the council.

898
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:19,665
Presented to the council.

899
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:20,906
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

900
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,067
Councilor Camuso.

901
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:23,527
Yes.

902
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:25,108
Councilor Calviello.

903
01:07:25,148 --> 01:07:25,208
Yes.

904
01:07:26,122 --> 01:07:26,702
Councilor Knight.

905
01:07:26,962 --> 01:07:27,162
Yes.

906
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:28,502
Vice President Long and Kern.

907
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:28,642
Yes.

908
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:30,123
Councilor Marks.

909
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:30,203
Yes.

910
01:07:31,403 --> 01:07:32,003
Councilor Penta.

911
01:07:32,163 --> 01:07:32,303
Yes.

912
01:07:33,203 --> 01:07:33,983
President De La Rosa.

913
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:34,503
Yes.

914
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:38,984
With the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

915
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:40,024
Thank you very much.

916
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:41,065
Thank you, Madam Director.

917
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:50,606
The motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

918
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:54,167
To hear from a citizen.

919
01:07:54,187 --> 01:07:55,287
To hear from a citizen.

920
01:07:55,307 --> 01:07:55,387
Yes.

921
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:58,404
All those in favor?

922
01:07:59,044 --> 01:07:59,865
All those opposed?

923
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:00,785
Motion passes.

924
01:08:01,765 --> 01:08:02,385
Counselor Knight?

925
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:04,165
Yes, Mr. President.

926
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:12,287
Mr. D'Antonio approached me before the meeting this evening, and he asked if the committee would indulge him so much as to allow him to make a brief informational presentation.

927
01:08:12,847 --> 01:08:18,108
Mr. D'Antonio will present his name and address for the record and make a brief presentation.

928
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:21,849
Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

929
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:26,230
40 years ago today, and tomorrow, and on Thursday,

930
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:37,145
We had a Medford resident, who is now a 30-year member of the Medford Police Department, standing on the rooftop of the embassy in Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City.

931
01:08:37,605 --> 01:08:46,471
This evening at 9 o'clock on the PBS station, public broadcasting, they're going to have a documentary called The Last Days of Vietnam.

932
01:08:47,311 --> 01:08:53,275
We have a hero amidst us again, as we do quite a few times in the city of Medford, and that person is John Galane.

933
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,737
And he's over there in Saigon right now,

934
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,966
commemorating this occasion.

935
01:08:58,527 --> 01:09:02,049
John was one of the last to get on a chopper from the rooftops.

936
01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:05,952
He was getting on a chopper as he saw the tanks coming down the street.

937
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:09,235
The North Vietnamese were coming down there.

938
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:18,682
It's similar to what Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore did in La Trang, Vietnam in 65 in November, when he was the last man off of the first major battle we had.

939
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:24,927
However, the difference was that the 1st Battalion, 7th Calvary had decimated the enemy.

940
01:09:25,783 --> 01:09:30,705
John Ghislaine was facing the enemy coming down the street, and he was one of the last two or three.

941
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:41,229
And I'd also like to say that at that attack and before the attack that we lost two Marines over there, Darwin Judge from Marshalltown, Iowa, and Charles McMahon from Woburn, Massachusetts.

942
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:49,552
I think it's a good piece of living history for the people of Medford to see what this gentleman did, John Ghislaine, as a Marine over there in Vietnam.

943
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,413
It's just something that we cannot forget.

944
01:09:55,433 --> 01:10:02,441
I get so dismayed with seeing things that are being taught to our students today, and it's revisionist history, and nothing is being brought up like this.

945
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:11,090
But I think that John and all the guys, all the Marines that are over there deserve our appreciation for what they did 40 years ago today.

946
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:12,372
And Semper Fi, John.

947
01:10:12,993 --> 01:10:13,193
Thank you.

948
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:22,129
If I may make a motion that the council adjourns this evening in recognition of Attorney Galeen's service.

949
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,230
I mean, I'm Officer Galeen's service, Mr. President.

950
01:10:29,373 --> 01:10:38,018
Thank you, Mr. President.

951
01:10:38,518 --> 01:10:46,983
Mr. D'Antonio, you may not know, but next month in this room, we have a lunch for all the veterans of this community.

952
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:52,756
which Mr. Galan has come here many times, and I'm sure that Mr. Galan will be recognized on that night.

953
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:55,818
I assume he'll be on that afternoon, but I think the date is May 22nd.

954
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,300
And I say it's an afternoon lunch here.

955
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,201
All the veterans in the community are free.

956
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:03,363
We have about 120 veterans that come here every year.

957
01:11:03,383 --> 01:11:07,886
I know you guys do that, but I wanted people to see what actually went on back then.

958
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:10,147
And his story will be told that day.

959
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:14,430
And I say, you're more than welcome to come here that day also.

960
01:11:14,927 --> 01:11:15,227
Thank you.

961
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:17,229
But I say, you know, spread the word to the veterans.

962
01:11:17,549 --> 01:11:23,013
That's a good, that's a, that's a good day in this room where all the veterans get on it and there's pictures on the, uh, on the board.

963
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:25,515
Uh, all the veterans that are here and not here.

964
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:27,916
So again, good.

965
01:11:27,936 --> 01:11:29,998
We don't do enough for other things that happen in this room.

966
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:30,918
Thank you.

967
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:44,168
15 dash four 23 be resolved that the city of Medford examined the potential purchase

968
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:52,525
of a marquee for Chevalier Auditorium in light of the temporary one that was used during the recent filming of a movie at the auditorium.

969
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:53,746
Counselor Carviello.

970
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:54,666
Thank you, Mr. President.

971
01:11:54,846 --> 01:12:02,010
I don't know if any of the council members went by Chevalier Auditorium a couple weeks ago when they were filming the movie there.

972
01:12:03,671 --> 01:12:14,537
The movie company put up a marquee on the face of Chevalier, which lit up Forest Street and did a complete facelift of the building.

973
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:22,087
It made a building that many people don't even know that's there look like a new thing.

974
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:28,810
It was like a whole new business or a whole new entity that had popped up on Forest Street.

975
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:36,792
I asked about maybe keeping that marquee up there, and I was told that it was only a temporary thing.

976
01:12:36,812 --> 01:12:41,774
But from what I was told, the neighbors didn't complain about the lights.

977
01:12:42,254 --> 01:12:44,815
And I think if we were to have something like that,

978
01:12:45,637 --> 01:12:52,101
um, purchased by the city that would give that building a major facelift and recognition that it will be needed.

979
01:12:52,121 --> 01:13:03,349
So, and I know there's some people here from the commission, but I say, I would, I would like to, uh, have the, uh, the mayor or whichever commission, uh, does that seriously look at, look into putting that up there.

980
01:13:08,612 --> 01:13:09,653
Seconded by council.

981
01:13:09,893 --> 01:13:13,135
So sir, you wish to address the council.

982
01:13:13,443 --> 01:13:14,003
Yes, please.

983
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:16,225
John Costas, 25 Salem Street.

984
01:13:17,866 --> 01:13:29,292
I don't know how many people actually got to see the Marquis, but can I just walk you around?

985
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:54,573
And I said, Mr. President, I think that would give that building the facelift that's much needed, and people will know what it is.

986
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:57,175
I mean, you'd be surprised the amount of people who live in this community who don't even know that's there.

987
01:13:59,037 --> 01:14:00,037
Okay, and a couple of things.

988
01:14:00,157 --> 01:14:03,240
There's going to be a great article in the transcript regarding this.

989
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,161
Thank you.

990
01:14:06,623 --> 01:14:11,847
Okay, so what's really unique about this, and I know funding is always the issue.

991
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:20,133
But what you've got to realize is we have a marquee that was designed by the people at 20th Century Fox.

992
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:24,975
Now, how many theaters could claim their marquee as 20th Century Fox?

993
01:14:26,515 --> 01:14:31,417
At the time, they repainted the front doors from the green to this really great maroon color.

994
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:37,819
We left it with that color, because the color that they chose accents the building well.

995
01:14:40,212 --> 01:14:44,195
Their accent lighting they put in, I know it's all make-believe, but it really worked.

996
01:14:44,335 --> 01:15:00,326
So what we've done is we kind of have a design, which is something that we, one of the things that always held the commission up from wanting a marquee is putting something in that neighborhood that the neighborhood's actually going to want, because you don't want something big, bright, and gaudy.

997
01:15:00,726 --> 01:15:04,769
It was impressive because the neighbors across the street thought it was wonderful.

998
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,871
People walking up the street thought it was wonderful.

999
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:14,959
And I'm glad Councilor Cabello is bringing this up because it's something that we've been wanting to do for a very long time.

1000
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,841
We're also on the, we're in the middle of a residential and business district.

1001
01:15:24,501 --> 01:15:29,823
So everything we do in and outside of that, that theater has to fit in with the neighborhood.

1002
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:36,664
And again, this is going to fit in with the neighborhood because we do get residents just on the other side of us, behind us and next to us, not to mention,

1003
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:43,846
We still got the business where you've got to attract attention without being too obvious about it.

1004
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,671
The movie, did anybody know what the movie was about?

1005
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:57,397
It was called Joy, and it's directed by David O. Russell.

1006
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,101
It was about Joy Mangano.

1007
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:06,545
She created some of the Miracle Mop and a few other

1008
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:08,148
items and became famous.

1009
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:10,149
And it's a documentary about her.

1010
01:16:10,389 --> 01:16:13,832
And there's a lot of famous people, but I don't want to go into all the details.

1011
01:16:15,633 --> 01:16:17,454
OK, one final thought, too.

1012
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:25,360
June 6, we have Frank and Ella celebrating 100th anniversary of Frank Sinatra.

1013
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:29,583
We have tickets available if anybody's interested in seeing the show.

1014
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:31,885
It's going to be really, really a great show.

1015
01:16:33,146 --> 01:16:36,368
And something that we also want to do is, and this

1016
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:38,040
This should be in the transcript.

1017
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:45,404
The commission is looking for some input from the community of what we want to see in Chevalier Theatre.

1018
01:16:45,764 --> 01:16:48,146
You know, type of programming, what kind of programming.

1019
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:50,747
And we did this once before.

1020
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:57,731
We didn't get a lot of response with it, but we would like to have some input on what the community would like to see there.

1021
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:03,475
I know since this movie, the interest that's been generated has been, you know,

1022
01:17:04,695 --> 01:17:05,755
very positive for us.

1023
01:17:06,116 --> 01:17:07,116
So thank you.

1024
01:17:07,796 --> 01:17:08,636
Thank you very much.

1025
01:17:09,197 --> 01:17:09,837
Councilor Knight.

1026
01:17:10,477 --> 01:17:11,898
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1027
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:15,259
And thank you, Councilor Caviello, for putting this resolution on the agenda this evening.

1028
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:23,402
I too thought that the facade looked beautiful refurbished, and I also like the color of the door.

1029
01:17:24,282 --> 01:17:28,544
And I think that this, Mr. President, is a perfect example of how the Massachusetts film tax credit's working.

1030
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:32,686
for not only the residents of Medford and its local businesses, but also artisans in the community.

1031
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:35,167
You know, we brought artists to our community.

1032
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:36,628
They put up a new facade.

1033
01:17:36,768 --> 01:17:37,968
They did a little bit of work.

1034
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:40,669
And now we have a proposal on the city council floor.

1035
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:49,472
So, you know, I think this is a very important illustration, Mr. President, that shows how the arts and government can invest together, and good things can happen.

1036
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:58,435
And I really think that this is a great success for Medford, seeing the film tax credit be put to work and actually seeing a movie being filmed here in Medford once again, Mr. President.

1037
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:07,862
With that being said, I wholeheartedly support the resolution, and I would absolutely, positively think that a public hearing would be in order for us to continue to get some feedback from the residents.

1038
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:10,364
Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

1039
01:18:10,944 --> 01:18:12,065
Madam Vice President.

1040
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:13,625
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1041
01:18:15,386 --> 01:18:20,949
I'm just sad, I guess, that I didn't see it live, because that pitch is pretty remarkable.

1042
01:18:21,509 --> 01:18:26,872
It's something that I think would bring so much interest, not only to Chevalier, but the square.

1043
01:18:27,864 --> 01:18:32,626
My only question with that being said is, have you researched pricing and how much that would cost?

1044
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:37,729
Just so we get an idea of what we're voting on.

1045
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:39,790
It's not going to be cheap.

1046
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,851
Part of the expense was the design.

1047
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:47,393
So now that we have a design, we don't need to create a new one.

1048
01:18:48,234 --> 01:18:50,795
So we don't need to hire a architect for a design.

1049
01:18:52,055 --> 01:18:55,637
However, it does require some engineering to have electronic

1050
01:18:56,153 --> 01:19:02,197
Right now they had a backlit fluorescent light, you know, and they hung mechanical letters in the slots.

1051
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:11,023
Our idea would be to update it and it would be electronic wood so that you wouldn't have to add manually add letters up as a marquee.

1052
01:19:11,723 --> 01:19:15,846
So we would need to bring in an engineer, a sign company.

1053
01:19:15,886 --> 01:19:24,412
Now, I think what, if there's some, if we can get the funding for this, that we bring in several different sign companies and do some proposals.

1054
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,621
and have the sign companies design something for us and quote it.

1055
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:32,403
And that would give us the best way of the best price and how to do it.

1056
01:19:34,023 --> 01:19:37,445
So it would be similar to what you showed us on your phone and what we saw?

1057
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:39,265
If we have our way, it will be identical.

1058
01:19:39,505 --> 01:19:39,926
Identical.

1059
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:40,606
To what we have.

1060
01:19:40,646 --> 01:19:44,867
Because that's what everybody seemed to approve and like without any reservation.

1061
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:50,550
So I think when you have something that works that everybody's happy with, I don't think we should change it.

1062
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:51,450
No.

1063
01:19:52,456 --> 01:19:56,477
Are we talking, I mean, so if it's light up signage, it's got to be at least 25,000?

1064
01:19:57,257 --> 01:20:00,578
Oh, I'm going to say we're probably close to 30,000 or 40,000.

1065
01:20:00,618 --> 01:20:00,958
Oh, OK.

1066
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:02,759
But we're in that bar range.

1067
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:05,019
Oh, absolutely.

1068
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,100
So 25,000 to 35,000.

1069
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:11,121
Because it's the, well, I don't want to take up too much time.

1070
01:20:11,201 --> 01:20:16,342
But originally, they were going to drill holes in the cast stone to support that sign.

1071
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:18,423
And that sign weighed over 1,000 pounds.

1072
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:21,704
Well, the building, it's not going to take the weight on holes.

1073
01:20:22,783 --> 01:20:27,287
So they did it a very unique way that only Hollywood can do it, and it worked.

1074
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:36,934
So we'd have to bring in an engineer just to lay out how they can actually attach it to the building, which is part of that $35,000 to do that.

1075
01:20:37,735 --> 01:20:43,459
So the next step here is to talk to some companies that do this for real, put out some proposals.

1076
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,344
And I think what we can do is if we can find an architect in the city that can actually take what we have

1077
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:55,296
And using the pictures I took, I had a lot of pictures, they can scale it down.

1078
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,918
They can scale it to put it on a drawing and actually give us a size of the letters.

1079
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:02,619
Because when the letters were in the lobby, I took pictures of the letters against the wall.

1080
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:08,081
So we can look at the pictures of the letter against the wall and measure the height of the wall, and you get the height of the letter.

1081
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:10,721
So there is work to be done.

1082
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:19,064
I would just add an amendment that there is a neighborhood meeting before any RFPs go out, obviously, just for

1083
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:24,820
I know you said the neighbors were very supportive of it, but we definitely want to get their input.

1084
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:25,941
Oh, absolutely.

1085
01:21:26,321 --> 01:21:27,541
Again, it's a residential neighborhood.

1086
01:21:28,162 --> 01:21:31,242
So we don't want to put anything that anybody's going to have any objections with.

1087
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:34,523
And it's not going to be lit at night all the time.

1088
01:21:35,244 --> 01:21:38,185
I mean, it's going to be lit probably during the day all day.

1089
01:21:39,065 --> 01:21:44,026
But at night, there's no point in really lighting it all night long, unless it's the night of the show.

1090
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,987
And then, of course, it would be lit up.

1091
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:49,548
So it wouldn't be something you'd be stuck blinking like a neon sign.

1092
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,390
all night long in your window.

1093
01:21:52,091 --> 01:22:09,677
And then just another suggestion, when you look for input on, you know, a program that people would like to see, I know the paper is One Avenue and obviously the paper puts it online, but also social media, that can be huge, you know, getting the counselors involved and, you know, everybody's on Facebook nowadays.

1094
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:17,760
I mean, I would really get input from all generations and maybe try to— There's no age limit on the input, you know.

1095
01:22:19,753 --> 01:22:25,895
If there's a, you can email the input to Chevalier Theatre or jcostas at chevaliertheatre.com.

1096
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:29,196
And I think that'll be in the newspaper also.

1097
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:37,659
So it's letter jcostas, C-O-S-T-A-S, at chevaliertheatre.com.

1098
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:38,139
Ari.

1099
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:46,722
I mean, we have such a population of families and just the younger generation too, which would,

1100
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:56,772
I know you've spoken in subcommittee meetings just because people have requested that before, programming for children where families can go on a Saturday afternoon.

1101
01:22:56,832 --> 01:23:01,154
Even as simple as putting up a movie screen and watching a movie with popcorn with your kids.

1102
01:23:01,214 --> 01:23:07,057
I think that a couple bucks a person, there's so many different things you could.

1103
01:23:07,578 --> 01:23:08,739
the community can come up with.

1104
01:23:08,759 --> 01:23:12,961
So I think that getting the input is great and hopefully we can, Council can help in any way we can.

1105
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:18,823
I mean, we requested this before and we got some input, but maybe that was four or five years ago and times have changed.

1106
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:21,405
We've got new people in the city, new families coming in the city.

1107
01:23:21,425 --> 01:23:24,006
So we may get some great ideas that we didn't know about.

1108
01:23:24,026 --> 01:23:32,690
We should take that picture and then start the ad with that because I think that people would be amazed at how that looked and maybe people would spark an interest.

1109
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,931
We can hope.

1110
01:23:33,951 --> 01:23:36,212
Thank you.

1111
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:40,649
A quick question, John.

1112
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:50,977
You had indicated some time back that the City of Lynn, I believe, fronts shows with money and the shows produce the money back.

1113
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:51,777
Yes.

1114
01:23:51,997 --> 01:23:52,638
To the community.

1115
01:23:53,718 --> 01:23:54,299
I did say that.

1116
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,401
Has the City of Medford ever offered that to you folks?

1117
01:23:59,202 --> 01:23:59,403
No.

1118
01:24:00,663 --> 01:24:02,745
Well, the mayor at one time did offer

1119
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:07,535
to help do a revolving fund to fund shows.

1120
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:12,857
But the problem with doing shows is that there is no winner.

1121
01:24:12,997 --> 01:24:14,958
I mean, you never know what the show is going to do.

1122
01:24:14,998 --> 01:24:16,099
You don't know if it's going to make money.

1123
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:16,999
It's going to lose money.

1124
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,001
What Lynn did is they went through a series of shows where they lost money.

1125
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:25,202
But eventually, it turns around.

1126
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:30,864
Because once you get the name out there and the shows are out there, they kind of just snowball.

1127
01:24:31,784 --> 01:24:33,245
And then they start investing some

1128
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,044
more money.

1129
01:24:34,325 --> 01:24:41,390
So for example, our smaller shows, though, like we had John Denver last Friday night, it was a great show.

1130
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:48,156
We had over 300 people in attendance, but it's very tough to make budget when you don't have sponsorships.

1131
01:24:49,056 --> 01:24:50,438
The budget of that show was around $15,000.

1132
01:24:50,558 --> 01:24:57,803
It's not an expensive show to do, but because of the type of show it is, it doesn't attract 1,000 people.

1133
01:24:58,884 --> 01:24:59,785
If we bring in a $100,000 show,

1134
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:06,478
we're more likely to make a budget of $100,000 show if you brought in Natalie Cole.

1135
01:25:07,678 --> 01:25:15,361
So how could you make your argument successful for the city administration to front the money up front to get repaid back?

1136
01:25:15,622 --> 01:25:19,363
And there might be some losses in the beginning, like you said, until it gets to the point that it's repaid.

1137
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:21,404
Well, it's called the investment.

1138
01:25:22,064 --> 01:25:31,548
And at one time at the city council, when we have the live shows, for example, Rick Springfield, financially, I think we lost five grand, but the hotel was packed.

1139
01:25:32,214 --> 01:25:36,476
So the city of Method made thousands of dollars in hotel tax.

1140
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:42,759
Every time we have a show at the theater, Carol's, the Chinese, the Blue Fuji, Salvatore's, they're packed.

1141
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:47,661
So $1,000, you know, more money in taxes, the meal tax.

1142
01:25:48,562 --> 01:25:53,824
And the way Lynn looks at it, and even lower, is that it's not a loss, it's an investment.

1143
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:59,007
Because if you lose a million dollars here, but you gain four or five million dollars in revenue to the city,

1144
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:06,314
The city gains, because obviously if somebody wants to be in business, to have a restaurant, you can increase property tax.

1145
01:26:06,355 --> 01:26:07,735
So everybody is a winner.

1146
01:26:08,035 --> 01:26:10,517
So you can't look at it so much as a loss.

1147
01:26:11,257 --> 01:26:20,342
Because yes, we may take a loss, but if we lose $5,000 and the city makes $10,000 on taxes, on hotel tax, we win.

1148
01:26:21,663 --> 01:26:24,264
If Carroll's and Salvatore's, same thing.

1149
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:28,981
So my argument to you is, yes, we'll lose money, but we win.

1150
01:26:29,461 --> 01:26:31,302
We'll make money.

1151
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:32,143
We're not really losing.

1152
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:33,203
We can win in the long run.

1153
01:26:33,523 --> 01:26:39,668
Well, eventually, if we have enough, well, like, for example, Stoneham Theatre does really well.

1154
01:26:40,348 --> 01:26:43,130
But they have a mailing list of probably 5,000, 10,000.

1155
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,272
We don't have a mailing list that large yet.

1156
01:26:47,172 --> 01:26:50,915
But every time we do shows, we add another 200 or 300 people to our mailing list.

1157
01:26:52,803 --> 01:26:55,544
I think everybody's on the mailing list and you all get the emails.

1158
01:26:56,185 --> 01:27:00,427
I think we have 2,500 emails now and every show we generate more emails.

1159
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:07,490
So the more shows we do, the more interest we can generate, the more people we can have access to because they're on our mailing list.

1160
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:14,153
You know, real quick, you just mentioned the Stoneham theater and you know yourself, they were struggling in the beginning to get themselves going.

1161
01:27:14,553 --> 01:27:18,155
And it was the type of shows that they brought in that's basically saved them.

1162
01:27:18,215 --> 01:27:18,775
And now they're,

1163
01:27:19,258 --> 01:27:20,499
They're for profit.

1164
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:21,260
They're doing well.

1165
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,201
They're doing really well.

1166
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:24,022
And so isn't the region in Arlington.

1167
01:27:24,503 --> 01:27:24,883
Same thing.

1168
01:27:24,903 --> 01:27:27,445
They're a smaller theater, self-promoting theater.

1169
01:27:28,586 --> 01:27:28,906
Thank you.

1170
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:29,667
Thank you.

1171
01:27:34,831 --> 01:27:36,733
Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

1172
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:43,711
My marquee work at 16 Glenwood Ave, Medford, Mass.

1173
01:27:45,372 --> 01:27:53,379
I've been on the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier for 22 years, a little bit longer than my age.

1174
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:01,445
And I've been on the board of the Chevalier Theatre, organ society, since its inception, which I think was about 15 years ago.

1175
01:28:05,429 --> 01:28:09,512
I would like to thank Councilor Carviello for introducing the proposition

1176
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:14,133
to install a marquee at the Chevalier Theatre.

1177
01:28:15,194 --> 01:28:25,863
Because I'm always pleased when this subject is on the council agenda, because it provides an opportunity for public conversation.

1178
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:37,352
And I am definitely in favor of your support and recommendations to enhance the theatre with a marquee.

1179
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,834
that would be an attractive and visible improvement on the building.

1180
01:28:42,835 --> 01:28:54,039
We still have people living in the city, especially new families, for which there are very, very many coming into the community in the last few years, who have no idea what's in that building.

1181
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:05,463
And over the years, I have participated in many discussions about the Chevalier Theatre.

1182
01:29:06,303 --> 01:29:07,644
I've written many stories.

1183
01:29:08,495 --> 01:29:10,936
press releases, newsletters.

1184
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:37,481
My basic concern is that even though the building is owned by the city of Medford and many, many and costly studies have been conducted that have consistently said the Chevalier Theatre has the potential of being a destination in the city and creating a vibrant district

1185
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:44,042
that's pedestrian-friendly and attractive for downtown businesses.

1186
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:55,387
The most recent study was the Sasaki Master Plan, which was issued in December of 2004.

1187
01:29:59,889 --> 01:30:07,612
I guess that's sitting someplace here at City Hall on a shelf, collecting dust, along with the other studies.

1188
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:18,876
Because unfortunately, the recommendations that came out of that study and the previous studies have all fallen on deaf ears.

1189
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:33,627
Why is taxpayer money being spent over and over again for these studies, but the citizens are not seeing any results?

1190
01:30:36,549 --> 01:30:38,410
We're all aware that in this past year,

1191
01:30:39,677 --> 01:30:46,362
Medford has been considered a very hot in the real estate market.

1192
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:51,045
And as a result, it has received a lot of positive publicity.

1193
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:59,810
Many young people, families, small children, professionals are moving into Medford.

1194
01:31:01,932 --> 01:31:08,916
These new residents are looking for a community offering good schools, transportation,

1195
01:31:09,521 --> 01:31:16,505
open space, safe neighborhoods, arts and cultural programs, to mention a few.

1196
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:19,587
In short, a quality of life.

1197
01:31:22,669 --> 01:31:30,054
We have many assets here in Medford that other communities do not have, and the Chevalier Theater is one of them.

1198
01:31:31,215 --> 01:31:37,939
In addition, we have our history, the Mystic River, open space, just to mention a few,

1199
01:31:40,069 --> 01:31:44,271
But I feel that the city needs to do a better job in marketing itself.

1200
01:31:46,532 --> 01:32:08,544
As an advocate of the theater for more than 20 years, it has been obvious to me and many other residents that while the Chevalier has undergone major renovations, at the cost of probably $3.5 to $4 million, which has come from both private and public money,

1201
01:32:10,670 --> 01:32:21,679
And in addition, as well as the money, hundreds of volunteer hours by the Chevalier Auditorium Commission and the Friends of Chevalier.

1202
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,042
It has not had a return on that investment.

1203
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:39,013
There have been people who have been very, very faithful and supportive of the Chevalier Theatre for many, many years, and I would like to

1204
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:50,115
publicly thank John Costas, who has been with this effort since the very beginning, and the late Geraldine Grandy and Dick Oba.

1205
01:32:51,435 --> 01:33:02,320
If it were not for those three people, possibly the Chevalier Theater may have become a parking lot, which would have been disastrous.

1206
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:08,042
I would also like to make a few more observations.

1207
01:33:10,047 --> 01:33:38,840
The commission of five volunteers, in my opinion, should not be expected to manage the theater, oversee major renovations, raise funds for physical improvements to the building, which of course belongs to the city of Medford, and essentially do everything that is needed to make it successful with very, very little support from the city.

1208
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:46,964
The commission has done an extraordinary job in bringing Chevalier to the level of a first class facility.

1209
01:33:49,286 --> 01:33:57,111
Recently, here in March, we observed the 75th anniversary concert.

1210
01:33:57,591 --> 01:34:01,054
We had a concert, which was very successful.

1211
01:34:02,715 --> 01:34:04,876
It came on the heels of 108 inches of snow.

1212
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:12,569
And it was really a wonderful occasion, a great coming together of the community.

1213
01:34:13,449 --> 01:34:31,073
And many people who came there, because it was somewhat of a different show and it drew a different audience, they were amazed to learn of its existence in the first place and how magnificent the theater is, especially the acoustics,

1214
01:34:32,923 --> 01:34:36,885
the elliptical ceiling, and the unobstructed view of the stage.

1215
01:34:39,907 --> 01:35:00,858
Secondly, the commissioners do not receive stipends or other benefits, except for providing annual fuel assistance in the winter, which amounts to about $48,000, and occasional emergency funds when a piece of the building is falling off.

1216
01:35:03,011 --> 01:35:10,535
The city has not demonstrated interest in the potential of the theater as an engine for economic stimulus in Medford Square.

1217
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:14,877
The city budget is about $145 million.

1218
01:35:14,897 --> 01:35:15,238
$145 million.

1219
01:35:15,258 --> 01:35:19,460
Why can't we allocate more than, and this figure is not even

1220
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:43,605
1% or half a percent, it's .0003% of the budget for the theater.

1221
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:51,550
There has to be a few dollars somewhere that can be allocated for Chevalier.

1222
01:35:53,131 --> 01:35:56,774
The demographics and diversity of Medford are changing rapidly.

1223
01:35:57,714 --> 01:35:58,495
We all know that.

1224
01:36:00,457 --> 01:36:05,398
and residents are welcoming a growing arts and cultural movement in the city.

1225
01:36:06,858 --> 01:36:19,921
Today, with the population that we have and the diversity that we have in the community, there is a greater range of artistic talent to share with all our residents in Medford and beyond.

1226
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:28,883
Unfortunately, arts and culture

1227
01:36:29,566 --> 01:36:32,747
are often thought of as frivolous and unessential.

1228
01:36:34,648 --> 01:36:36,228
This is not true.

1229
01:36:37,488 --> 01:36:43,770
Studies are emerging that are quantifying the value of arts and culture to a community.

1230
01:36:45,431 --> 01:36:58,515
In June of 2004, a report titled The Arts Factor concluded that arts and culture are as essential and fundamental to our identity as the American Revolution

1231
01:37:00,829 --> 01:37:13,812
that innovative and inspiring cities place arts and culture among their greatest assets, and that arts and culture is an economic engine for the community.

1232
01:37:16,113 --> 01:37:21,054
I am in favor, and thank you, Councilor Carviello, for your proposal.

1233
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:30,096
However, I would like to say that without the support of the city, and without a vision or a plan,

1234
01:37:31,427 --> 01:37:38,990
for the future of Chevalier, which this council can very, very well initiate and participate in.

1235
01:37:40,651 --> 01:37:42,231
We are in a cycle of going nowhere.

1236
01:37:44,112 --> 01:37:47,173
Change in our community is blowing in the wind.

1237
01:37:49,834 --> 01:37:53,696
And we all need to work together to meet tomorrow's challenges.

1238
01:37:54,376 --> 01:37:54,736
Thank you.

1239
01:38:00,259 --> 01:38:00,959
Thank you, Mr. President.

1240
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:02,422
You know, May, I agree with you 100%.

1241
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:06,263
You know, the people in this community are changing.

1242
01:38:06,283 --> 01:38:08,984
There's more and more younger families that have moved here.

1243
01:38:09,004 --> 01:38:09,644
And you're right.

1244
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:13,345
There's hundreds of many families that have no idea what goes on in that building.

1245
01:38:13,365 --> 01:38:18,606
You know, every morning, if you go down Forest Street, the traffic is backed up to 93.

1246
01:38:18,966 --> 01:38:24,387
That would pay for itself just in advertising alone, that people would get to see that.

1247
01:38:24,447 --> 01:38:29,249
As I say, there's cars that are there that sit at Forest Street for an hour, cutting through to go.

1248
01:38:31,575 --> 01:38:39,540
And I would hope that the new administration coming into this building next year will see the benefit of that building.

1249
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:47,745
And I say, I mean, all one has to do is pick up the newspaper and see the lineup that Lynn puts out every year.

1250
01:38:47,765 --> 01:38:49,346
I mean, every week and every month.

1251
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:53,408
And I talk to people, why can't we have that here?

1252
01:38:53,789 --> 01:38:57,011
There's no reason why we can't get some of the talent that Lynn gets.

1253
01:38:58,351 --> 01:39:00,833
I mean, they had Natalie Cole there not too long ago.

1254
01:39:01,513 --> 01:39:04,534
I mean, there's a woman who has Medford roots.

1255
01:39:05,254 --> 01:39:07,275
No reason why we couldn't have had her.

1256
01:39:07,315 --> 01:39:15,937
I mean, State Representative Donato went and got state funding for all the new seats in that building that don't get the use that they should be.

1257
01:39:16,257 --> 01:39:18,338
Those seats should be worn out from all the people going in there.

1258
01:39:18,998 --> 01:39:23,039
And the other thing that that building lacks, the building should have a concession stand.

1259
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:29,141
That would be a major generator of money for that building if they had a full-time concession stand.

1260
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:30,441
So every time you have an event there,

1261
01:39:31,368 --> 01:39:33,610
You'd make money on your whatever you happen to sell there.

1262
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:35,351
That's all profit.

1263
01:39:36,312 --> 01:39:42,796
So again, I would hope that the new administration takes a different view than the past administration has in that building.

1264
01:39:46,419 --> 01:39:46,819
Thank you.

1265
01:39:46,919 --> 01:39:59,088
And, um, you know, I, I certainly support this this evening, but, um, I think this council has been very supportive of the arts, uh, just within the last few years, the line item that was offered by counselor marks.

1266
01:39:59,683 --> 01:40:01,964
for arts in our community was put into the budget.

1267
01:40:01,984 --> 01:40:04,065
I believe it was $25,000 at the time.

1268
01:40:04,686 --> 01:40:09,388
And it's something that we've made sure that it was put in year after year.

1269
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:11,650
Now, I look back a few years ago.

1270
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:11,650
$15,000?

1271
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:13,571
OK.

1272
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:20,194
I look back a few years ago, and at the time, it was President Stephanie Muccini-Burke who was the chairperson of the council.

1273
01:40:20,614 --> 01:40:23,796
And we did have a proposal for an art center here in our community.

1274
01:40:24,777 --> 01:40:28,859
And the only three councilors at the time that supported it, for whatever reason,

1275
01:40:29,404 --> 01:40:32,567
was Councilor Carr, Councilor Marks, and myself.

1276
01:40:33,067 --> 01:40:38,151
Now, all the councilors have their own reasons why they didn't, and I respectfully understand their reasoning.

1277
01:40:38,652 --> 01:40:43,836
But there's been proposals over the years that have come up, so to say.

1278
01:40:44,537 --> 01:40:54,425
But with that being said, as Councilor Carviello just stated, too, I think, and I brought this up in the past, I think the Chevalier Commission has to look in the direction, too, of allowing

1279
01:40:54,852 --> 01:40:59,596
Counselor Lungo Kern mentioned a few minutes ago about having a nice movie with popcorn and sitting down with the kids.

1280
01:41:00,056 --> 01:41:05,200
But unfortunately, unless you change your rule, popcorn's really not allowed in there during the show.

1281
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:05,800
Is that correct?

1282
01:41:07,121 --> 01:41:07,722
Correct, yes or no?

1283
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:09,438
Yeah, right now.

1284
01:41:10,039 --> 01:41:13,261
So right there is part of the problem.

1285
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:25,969
Concession stands is what's keeping Lowell alive a lot, as well as Lynn, because people are going up to the concession stands, and they're buying a 12-ounce beer for $5, and it's costing the place a nickel.

1286
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:32,434
So the city has been supportive over the years of putting some ideas and stuff out there.

1287
01:41:32,794 --> 01:41:36,796
And the management company, and I understand, you're in a commission role.

1288
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:40,760
And that's certainly different than being an actual manager of a theater.

1289
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:54,793
And the city maybe should have taken a bigger investment on the management side of bringing in somebody that's paying and that's their whole entire job is getting behind the shows to come in and all that.

1290
01:41:55,134 --> 01:41:57,196
But I think we have to change with the times as well.

1291
01:41:58,277 --> 01:41:59,958
I think the marquee is a wonderful idea.

1292
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:24,448
Hesitant to the fact to have some advertising going on it other than the shows that are there Because I think that would essentially be another billboard type thing on Forest Street, and I wouldn't be totally for that to be honest with you But as long as we keep the integrity of the building as long as the Historical Commission signs off on it the Chevalier Commission of course who is in the custody in control of the building and

1293
01:42:24,748 --> 01:42:28,730
as well as I believe it would be the city council for a signed denial permit.

1294
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:33,533
As long as it goes through the proper channels and gets vetted properly, I'm for this 100%.

1295
01:42:34,033 --> 01:42:52,043
But I just think that this council, particularly the council that's here today and not ones of six, seven, eight years ago, have been very supportive of the arts, including the $15,000 that was, I believe, unanimously supported by myself and the other six members of this council.

1296
01:42:52,892 --> 01:42:53,893
over the past few years.

1297
01:42:54,433 --> 01:42:59,876
So, I'd just like to say I support your endeavor and move approval.

1298
01:43:00,477 --> 01:43:02,198
Thank you very much, Councilor Camuso.

1299
01:43:02,878 --> 01:43:04,759
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1300
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,801
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue for Mass.

1301
01:43:08,122 --> 01:43:11,103
Thank you, May Markerbrook, for that excellent input, excellent work.

1302
01:43:12,284 --> 01:43:13,625
I have a question through the Chair.

1303
01:43:14,245 --> 01:43:16,747
Is there air conditioning in the Chevalier for summer shows?

1304
01:43:18,717 --> 01:43:22,659
So there's no air conditioning right now, and I think a marquee is a great idea, Councilor Caraviello.

1305
01:43:22,999 --> 01:43:24,000
I think it's a great idea.

1306
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:32,184
I think the first step is we need the air conditioning, because that means four or five months later, you've got a marquee and nothing happening in there, or very little happening.

1307
01:43:32,284 --> 01:43:36,126
So air conditioner is the first thing we need for the Chevalier Theater.

1308
01:43:37,467 --> 01:43:42,710
Now, I offered a show to the Chevalier for May 23rd, and it would have fit in nicely with the John Denver Tribute.

1309
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:47,352
It's the actual members from Blue Oyster Cult and Alice Cooper's group, Dennis Stunaway,

1310
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:49,171
I've been in touch with Mr. Dunaway today.

1311
01:43:49,231 --> 01:43:52,414
Now, unfortunately, as of today, I've moved the show to the Regent Theatre in Arlington.

1312
01:43:53,175 --> 01:43:58,199
So where the Chevalier is asking for input, I went to the Chevalier first because this is where I live.

1313
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,661
This show would have cost about five grand.

1314
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:03,003
It will do well because I saw it in Shirley.

1315
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:04,845
The room was absolutely packed.

1316
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:12,512
They do all the hits of Alice Cooper, all the hits of Blue Oyster Cult, plus we have a Lou Reed tribute with Nelson Slater, a dear friend of Lou Reed's.

1317
01:44:14,587 --> 01:44:23,375
that this tribute show with these original members for $5,000 is a lot less than $15,000, unless the 15 grand included the police and everything else.

1318
01:44:23,955 --> 01:44:26,537
But still, it's a minimal amount of money for a great show.

1319
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:29,980
And Dennis Dunaway has a book released June 9th on St.

1320
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,742
Martin's Press, which means St.

1321
01:44:31,822 --> 01:44:33,803
Martin's will be promoting the region show.

1322
01:44:34,964 --> 01:44:35,845
Medford lost that.

1323
01:44:35,945 --> 01:44:36,826
Medford loses again.

1324
01:44:36,886 --> 01:44:41,470
I also have other acts that want to come in, a Led Zeppelin tribute from Berkeley.

1325
01:44:41,934 --> 01:44:43,035
These guys are phenomenal.

1326
01:44:43,095 --> 01:44:46,116
So all these acts are coming to me because I am a calendar.

1327
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:47,737
I manage a calendar for a nightclub.

1328
01:44:48,258 --> 01:44:50,619
So all I do is the management of the calendar.

1329
01:44:51,299 --> 01:44:52,980
The booking agent is another guy there.

1330
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:57,062
But I'm in touch with a lot of resources that could benefit the Chevalier.

1331
01:44:57,483 --> 01:44:59,424
Now, this is something we mentioned again.

1332
01:45:00,344 --> 01:45:06,087
And Father Chip Hines and Fred Lasky and Allison Goldsberry went with us to the Chevalier for TV.

1333
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:08,529
The access station should be there.

1334
01:45:08,649 --> 01:45:10,850
And even if it meant putting a van in the parking lot,

1335
01:45:11,803 --> 01:45:20,529
or using the back room, the synergy of the money we have for AXS TV, using a city-owned building, this is just picture perfect.

1336
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:39,622
And I know that the commission has their reasons, but their reasons have resulted, all due respect, because I like the commission of the Chevalier, but all due respect, we have an empty, vacant place, and there are people that want to give input, people with talent, qualified people that have been kind of like, oh, great idea, Joe, but you know, well, you know, we have nothing there.

1337
01:45:41,345 --> 01:45:47,128
I've reviewed concerts at the Stoneham Theatre, at the Lynn Theatre, and they're all flourishing because they put some hard work into it.

1338
01:45:47,729 --> 01:45:52,231
We could have a huge mailing list in a heartbeat, just like we could have a public access station.

1339
01:45:52,572 --> 01:45:53,792
So the three points were that.

1340
01:45:54,573 --> 01:46:03,298
The key thing here is this access station, which we will now have because the issuing authority is moving on to parts unknown, we will now have the stumbling block removed from access.

1341
01:46:03,878 --> 01:46:07,980
And he's probably the same stumbling block that kept shows from the Chevalier.

1342
01:46:08,581 --> 01:46:10,702
Have a good life, Your Honor, Mayor McGlynn.

1343
01:46:11,436 --> 01:46:15,559
It's time for Medford to rise like a phoenix, and the Chevaliers should be part of that rise.

1344
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:17,560
Hey, for the gentleman.

1345
01:46:19,121 --> 01:46:19,682
Thank you.

1346
01:46:20,382 --> 01:46:24,085
Do you say you were going to put your own money and funding behind the show and they turned you down?

1347
01:46:24,765 --> 01:46:25,786
No, that's not what I said, sir.

1348
01:46:25,806 --> 01:46:26,286
I didn't say that.

1349
01:46:26,306 --> 01:46:28,208
Well, no, no, because normally a promoter comes in.

1350
01:46:28,428 --> 01:46:29,128
I'm not a promoter.

1351
01:46:29,469 --> 01:46:30,429
I didn't say I was a promoter.

1352
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:31,270
I offer the show.

1353
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:33,692
All right, well, I'm just a little confused, because if you brought it to them,

1354
01:46:34,507 --> 01:46:36,729
As a conduit, what is your role in it?

1355
01:46:37,249 --> 01:46:42,252
My role in it is I have a rock band, and I want to be the opening act for this event.

1356
01:46:42,993 --> 01:46:46,735
OK, with that being said, you have your own private capital to put on a show.

1357
01:46:46,755 --> 01:46:47,356
No, no.

1358
01:46:47,396 --> 01:46:56,102
I offered to the Chevalier that I know these people because I interviewed the band for my TV show, which is called Visual Radio, which in case you don't know, counselor, I've been doing it for 20 years.

1359
01:46:56,462 --> 01:46:58,523
And I'm in touch with all sorts of people.

1360
01:46:59,184 --> 01:47:04,027
So I have information and contacts that I brought to the Chevalier.

1361
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:13,766
And I talked to the Chevalier about the city funding it, because if the city put up 15 grand for a John Denver tribute, $5,000 is an investment, and all due respect to Mr. Costas.

1362
01:47:14,326 --> 01:47:17,168
But some shows are turkeys and some shows are winners.

1363
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:24,092
And the Chevalier and the city backed some shows of great talent that you knew wasn't going to draw.

1364
01:47:24,733 --> 01:47:33,198
But again, when there's not input from the public and people that are in the trenches that actually know this stuff, that know about Polestar,

1365
01:47:33,818 --> 01:47:41,204
And, you know, as a further thing, since Mr. Camuso brought this up, if we have a management company there, the management company should be required to bring in two shows a month.

1366
01:47:42,225 --> 01:47:44,846
If we have these people on commission, they should be doing two shows a month.

1367
01:47:46,308 --> 01:47:51,091
Just to follow up with the gentleman again, first of all, his facts are wrong, as occasionally they are.

1368
01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:54,594
The city did not put up $15,000 for John Danva.

1369
01:47:54,994 --> 01:47:57,876
That was a private entity that went to the Chevalier, correct?

1370
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:03,970
A promoter?

1371
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:04,991
Well, no.

1372
01:48:05,131 --> 01:48:09,195
On John Denver, like the Alan Frank show, that was commissioned.

1373
01:48:09,735 --> 01:48:10,016
Okay.

1374
01:48:10,256 --> 01:48:13,759
It was the... What happens is... But the city did not put up the money.

1375
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:17,763
The city did not put... Yeah, the taxpayers did not put a penny in that at all.

1376
01:48:17,843 --> 01:48:18,123
Correct.

1377
01:48:18,203 --> 01:48:19,825
And the gentleman said the city put up the money.

1378
01:48:19,865 --> 01:48:23,648
I know that wasn't the case because otherwise you would have to come through here through the general fund and the budget.

1379
01:48:23,949 --> 01:48:24,830
You're correct, yeah.

1380
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:26,411
The taxpayers didn't fund that show.

1381
01:48:26,491 --> 01:48:26,771
Okay.

1382
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,433
They don't fund any of the shows that we do.

1383
01:48:28,927 --> 01:48:38,792
Either the commission funds it out of the revenue we generate from our rentals, or like we have next June 5th, we have Matty B. We had him last year.

1384
01:48:38,832 --> 01:48:40,352
He's a 12-year-old hip hop star.

1385
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:45,895
And without any advertising locally, he sold out 1,300 seats at 12 years old.

1386
01:48:46,715 --> 01:48:50,477
And now he's coming back again this year because he did so well last year at Chevalier Creek.

1387
01:48:50,537 --> 01:48:55,079
And I remember, too, it's very easy to get up here and say, I'll bring this guy in and that guy in.

1388
01:48:55,419 --> 01:48:56,860
But if you don't have the funding to back it up,

1389
01:48:57,207 --> 01:48:58,210
I'll give you a perfect example.

1390
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:05,949
A few years ago, Representative Donato put his own capital behind it, had an outstanding show, Michael Amante, right down here in Medford Square.

1391
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:07,240
The place was packed.

1392
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:11,422
The local limousine companies were busy, the livery services, the restaurants.

1393
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:18,347
But Representative Donato took a leadership role and put up his own private capital in order to do that.

1394
01:49:18,807 --> 01:49:22,090
So Medford Kiwanis did it with Lou Rawls.

1395
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:22,570
Lou Rawls.

1396
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:23,571
Lou Rawls.

1397
01:49:24,171 --> 01:49:29,214
So to say that they're just going to come, I mean, that's a fragment of people's imaginations.

1398
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:39,961
Well, the last Irish show, the Friends of Chevalier, the Friends of the Chevalier Theatre Organ Society, another group that commissioned, they put up all their money to do a show.

1399
01:49:40,641 --> 01:49:42,783
And they had, what, 800 people?

1400
01:49:43,663 --> 01:49:44,764
We had a great turnout.

1401
01:49:44,784 --> 01:49:45,985
It was a fantastic show.

1402
01:49:46,285 --> 01:49:47,045
So yes, you're correct.

1403
01:49:47,086 --> 01:49:47,986
They put up their money.

1404
01:49:48,206 --> 01:49:48,807
All right.

1405
01:49:49,387 --> 01:49:54,790
I think we have to be clear, because it was a statement that was made that the city of Medford put up the money.

1406
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:58,393
And as much as we'd like to, that's not the case at this

1407
01:49:59,518 --> 01:49:59,858
at this point.

1408
01:49:59,878 --> 01:50:12,145
Well, I agree, because I think it's important that taxpayers know that these shows that they see in there, whether they make money or not make money, it is not taxpayers' money that came out of their pocket to fund the show.

1409
01:50:12,325 --> 01:50:24,772
It's a big difference being a groupie with the people that play at nightclubs and tavern-type things, and actually being a promoter that brings in shows, writes a check to the Chevalier Commission for $25,000, $30,000, and then works off commission and other things.

1410
01:50:27,815 --> 01:50:32,758
It's a huge difference, and I've witnessed it firsthand through the likes of the Kiwanis and Representative Donato, so.

1411
01:50:33,238 --> 01:50:33,538
Thank you.

1412
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:35,059
Thank you.

1413
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:35,860
Counselor Camuso?

1414
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:43,004
Yeah, no, I just thought that was important, because I didn't want the taxpayers to think that we were just fronting money for shows at the Chevalier Auditorium.

1415
01:50:43,704 --> 01:50:44,045
Thank you.

1416
01:50:44,425 --> 01:50:45,626
Thank you, Counselor Camuso.

1417
01:50:45,966 --> 01:50:49,348
As a response to Mr. Camuso, Joe Villalon, 59 Garfield Ave.

1418
01:50:49,388 --> 01:50:50,789
Sir, the woman is next.

1419
01:50:51,869 --> 01:50:54,871
I need to respond to this, because he called me a liar.

1420
01:50:55,749 --> 01:50:56,790
I have facts and figures.

1421
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:58,071
I do public records requests.

1422
01:50:58,091 --> 01:50:59,072
I do my due diligence.

1423
01:50:59,393 --> 01:51:00,534
The commission put up the money.

1424
01:51:00,634 --> 01:51:01,315
I made an error.

1425
01:51:01,635 --> 01:51:03,037
Sometimes when we're speaking, we make an error.

1426
01:51:03,057 --> 01:51:10,084
But this individual, this counselor, antagonizes me every week with lies and innuendo when I come up with facts and public records requests.

1427
01:51:10,404 --> 01:51:11,565
And he should be censured for that.

1428
01:51:11,825 --> 01:51:12,546
Thank you very much.

1429
01:51:18,987 --> 01:51:20,507
My apologies.

1430
01:51:20,747 --> 01:51:23,448
Like I said, the gentleman, I deal with facts.

1431
01:51:24,048 --> 01:51:32,310
I'm certainly not going to go low and talk about the judge's order that was written and basically talked about the caliber of the individual that was here.

1432
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,310
That's for another day.

1433
01:51:33,710 --> 01:51:36,751
But facts and figures are important when you're at the people's forum.

1434
01:51:38,011 --> 01:51:38,931
Thank you very much.

1435
01:51:39,511 --> 01:51:41,912
Ma'am, would you wish to speak and address the council?

1436
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:46,633
If you could, please state your name and address for the record.

1437
01:51:47,028 --> 01:51:47,708
I would love to.

1438
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:50,129
I'm Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1439
01:51:50,789 --> 01:51:54,149
And I'd like to thank everybody for giving me this opportunity to speak.

1440
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:58,730
I too have gone to the 75th anniversary of the Chevalier Auditorium.

1441
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:00,471
I too went to the John Denver.

1442
01:52:00,931 --> 01:52:03,451
And this is a wonderful, wonderful asset to the city.

1443
01:52:03,591 --> 01:52:06,172
I know you guys are just like, where did I wake up?

1444
01:52:06,232 --> 01:52:07,832
Because I'm supporting the arts.

1445
01:52:11,053 --> 01:52:12,473
This is fantastic.

1446
01:52:14,114 --> 01:52:16,054
This is a fantastic asset.

1447
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:28,353
If we're going to have a gentleman that walks around here just screaming and yelling, I mean, you may want to do something as the presiding officer, because it's certainly disruptive to the entire group of people that are out here.

1448
01:52:28,713 --> 01:52:31,274
If he has to be escorted off the grounds, then so be it.

1449
01:52:31,574 --> 01:52:38,776
But I'm actually a little bit nervous with the behavior that's being shown by that gentleman right now.

1450
01:52:40,095 --> 01:52:41,736
Thank you, Mr. Councilor Camuso.

1451
01:52:41,936 --> 01:52:43,317
Ma'am, if you would like to continue.

1452
01:52:43,558 --> 01:52:43,978
Absolutely.

1453
01:52:44,478 --> 01:52:51,884
I'm also a proponent of all city buildings having a 5% building line item for maintenance.

1454
01:52:52,524 --> 01:53:02,492
And since this is such a beautiful presentation that we had professionally done by Hollywood, that should be replicated and it should be part of that 5% building

1455
01:53:05,807 --> 01:53:07,528
line item for maintenance for this building.

1456
01:53:07,988 --> 01:53:12,691
It should be awesome, and it would be wonderful because you don't know when you're driving by, and you're absolutely right.

1457
01:53:13,051 --> 01:53:20,215
In the morning, Forest Street is backed up all the way to 93, and they sit there, and you know what that building holds, and it's fantastic.

1458
01:53:20,235 --> 01:53:25,458
And I like your idea with the concession stand, because it is missing, you know, and you go downstairs and you have...

1459
01:53:27,058 --> 01:53:27,878
Yep, it is.

1460
01:53:28,059 --> 01:53:29,319
And so I like that.

1461
01:53:29,619 --> 01:53:34,102
The other thing is about rock concerts, the only thing I have to say is Rick Springfield.

1462
01:53:34,602 --> 01:53:38,044
I heard some stories about stuff that went on in the bathrooms because they rock concerts.

1463
01:53:38,625 --> 01:53:40,126
And I was a kid once too.

1464
01:53:40,186 --> 01:53:41,686
And so you want to be careful.

1465
01:53:42,487 --> 01:53:43,568
And I grew up with Rick Springfield.

1466
01:53:44,008 --> 01:53:47,510
But I mean, things go on in bathrooms, like drug abuse and other things.

1467
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:49,191
And you kind of want to stay away from that.

1468
01:53:49,851 --> 01:53:51,872
But the John Denver thing was awesome.

1469
01:53:52,493 --> 01:53:56,395
And the 75th anniversary, that Irish band that played was fantastic.

1470
01:53:56,875 --> 01:54:13,809
And also, we can have plays, we can have comedians, we can have the diversity of shows, the movie theater, it's fantastic, and it will bring in money to all the restaurants in the area, it'll bring in foot traffic, and our Fridays and Saturday nights should be at least

1471
01:54:14,569 --> 01:54:18,173
lit up until 11 o'clock on a Friday night, okay?

1472
01:54:18,614 --> 01:54:24,220
I mean, why this city on a Friday or Saturday night doesn't have the lights on and people walking around?

1473
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:29,665
I'm not talking about maybe Monday night could be dead, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, but, you know, Thursday should pick up.

1474
01:54:30,126 --> 01:54:30,526
People should

1475
01:54:31,367 --> 01:54:34,149
get off work and go and hang out at Method Square.

1476
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:38,632
And Friday night and Saturday night should be bustling until at least 11 o'clock.

1477
01:54:39,092 --> 01:54:41,894
It wouldn't kill us, and it would bring business and money and tax revenue.

1478
01:54:42,255 --> 01:54:46,497
And that could be the center key, is the theater, because it's just awesome.

1479
01:54:46,517 --> 01:54:49,800
The location, the building structure, it's just beautiful.

1480
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:50,760
And it should be.

1481
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:56,544
And I support this $50,000 or whatever it is, and I'm going to give the guy $20 to make it $20 less tonight.

1482
01:54:56,985 --> 01:54:57,305
Thank you.

1483
01:54:58,886 --> 01:55:00,527
Thank you very much, Jean.

1484
01:55:01,855 --> 01:55:02,195
Good evening.

1485
01:55:02,235 --> 01:55:04,236
Just state your name and address for the record, sir.

1486
01:55:04,736 --> 01:55:06,817
John Veneziano, 65 Crocker Road.

1487
01:55:07,517 --> 01:55:11,218
Thank you very much for your time and patience regarding the Chevalier Theatre.

1488
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,619
A lot of you have heard this before.

1489
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:14,480
I'm on the board of Chevalier.

1490
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:18,201
I joined John Koster about three years ago, appointed by the mayor.

1491
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:21,142
Susan Fairchild just joined the group as well.

1492
01:55:21,702 --> 01:55:24,203
I've worked with the friends of Chevalier and they all do a great job.

1493
01:55:24,683 --> 01:55:29,845
We all know the asset of the theatre, but we don't realize the asset until we actually fund that asset.

1494
01:55:30,431 --> 01:55:32,973
Medford Square is a big part of revitalization going on.

1495
01:55:33,433 --> 01:55:34,854
We have a lot of action going on.

1496
01:55:34,914 --> 01:55:44,861
It's amazing that when we talk about what we want to do, that a lot of us don't have the visual aspects of seeing something first, such as the marquee.

1497
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:53,106
We talked about a marquee at our board meeting about a year ago at Chevalier, and we talked about funding, and like air conditioning, it's very difficult.

1498
01:55:53,507 --> 01:55:56,929
And then someone goes and puts up a fake marquee, and everyone gets excited about it.

1499
01:55:57,549 --> 01:56:03,994
So let's just say that everything that we're trying to do is positive for what we're trying to revitalize.

1500
01:56:04,354 --> 01:56:05,275
The bridge is coming.

1501
01:56:07,496 --> 01:56:09,898
The theater is now becoming a topic.

1502
01:56:10,439 --> 01:56:12,140
And so what do you need to do?

1503
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:17,524
You need to get serious about the aspects in these properties that the city owns.

1504
01:56:18,024 --> 01:56:19,765
This theater is 1,800 seats.

1505
01:56:19,785 --> 01:56:22,427
You put 1,000 people in there, things are going to happen.

1506
01:56:22,868 --> 01:56:23,828
So do me a favor.

1507
01:56:24,469 --> 01:56:25,850
Don't just talk about this tonight.

1508
01:56:26,324 --> 01:56:30,166
Rick, thank you very much for the opportunity of bringing this to the forefront today.

1509
01:56:30,747 --> 01:56:32,628
But think about how we can fund this.

1510
01:56:32,868 --> 01:56:33,969
We have a new mayor coming.

1511
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:40,193
The mayor did a lot of things that he felt was very important for the city to take care of what he needed to do.

1512
01:56:41,193 --> 01:56:45,676
He never dropped the ball on the theater, but I know there are a lot of things that are coming up.

1513
01:56:46,077 --> 01:56:48,858
May made a good point about funding the budget.

1514
01:56:49,179 --> 01:56:52,661
If you can find some money there, we could use a professional group.

1515
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:54,642
I mean, John Costa, myself, and Susan

1516
01:56:55,036 --> 01:56:56,717
We volunteer, we're three people.

1517
01:56:56,757 --> 01:56:58,838
There are actually two seats open for the commission.

1518
01:56:59,739 --> 01:57:08,964
With the Medford Chamber of Commerce, I'm on the, I'm chairing the governor committee, and we have some great ideas that we'd like to do at Chevalier for the election coming up.

1519
01:57:10,144 --> 01:57:16,668
And also with Susan on board, she has some great new ideas for new exciting things that we want to happen.

1520
01:57:16,948 --> 01:57:19,489
Popcorn, we talked about having popcorn.

1521
01:57:19,509 --> 01:57:20,970
We talked about having drinks in theater.

1522
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:22,911
We're figuring out how to make that work.

1523
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,412
And the only reason why we can't do it

1524
01:57:24,787 --> 01:57:27,148
because we have to clean the place, right?

1525
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:33,432
So you have popcorn and you have your drinks and then you leave and then we have to clean it and we don't have the money to do it, it's a shame.

1526
01:57:34,092 --> 01:57:44,198
So again, do me a favor, make this a reality for the city, you bring people to that theater, you fund that theater, and then you'll fund down Meffitt Square and we'll get the square going too, thank you.

1527
01:57:44,879 --> 01:57:46,620
Thank you very much, Mr. Veneziano.

1528
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:52,503
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Caravaglio, seconded by Vice President Lugo-Curran.

1529
01:57:52,843 --> 01:57:53,624
All those in favor?

1530
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:56,451
A roll call has been requested.

1531
01:57:57,391 --> 01:58:01,152
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1532
01:58:05,374 --> 01:58:06,234
Councilor Camuso?

1533
01:58:06,734 --> 01:58:06,995
Yes.

1534
01:58:08,135 --> 01:58:09,055
Councilor Caviello?

1535
01:58:09,115 --> 01:58:09,335
Yes.

1536
01:58:09,996 --> 01:58:10,536
Councilor Night?

1537
01:58:11,016 --> 01:58:11,336
Yes.

1538
01:58:11,976 --> 01:58:12,797
Vice-President Leocur?

1539
01:58:12,817 --> 01:58:12,997
Yes.

1540
01:58:13,597 --> 01:58:14,197
Councilor Miles?

1541
01:58:14,217 --> 01:58:14,317
Yes.

1542
01:58:14,437 --> 01:58:14,897
Councilor Penta?

1543
01:58:14,917 --> 01:58:15,057
Yes.

1544
01:58:16,638 --> 01:58:17,418
President Del Rosso?

1545
01:58:17,959 --> 01:58:18,279
Yes.

1546
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,880
With the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1547
01:58:27,003 --> 01:58:53,398
On the motion of Councilor Cavillo, that while we're under suspension to take 15-422, petition for common Fitchler's license by Jose A. Pazos, 19 Irving Street, number two, Revere Mass, 02151 for Annie's Pizzeria, LLC, 213 Middlesex Avenue, Medford, on file, all the appropriate endorsements from the various departments in City Hall.

1548
01:58:53,758 --> 01:58:55,899
So to take this out of order,

1549
01:58:56,235 --> 01:58:56,935
All those in favor?

1550
01:58:56,955 --> 01:58:57,815
All those opposed?

1551
01:58:58,355 --> 01:58:59,096
Motion carries.

1552
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:01,616
And to the Chairman, Councilor Caviello.

1553
01:59:07,137 --> 01:59:08,237
My apologies, Councilor.

1554
01:59:08,758 --> 01:59:10,778
Mr. President, I have reviewed the gentleman's documents.

1555
01:59:11,098 --> 01:59:12,158
I find them all in order.

1556
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:13,959
And a motion for approval.

1557
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:16,399
A motion of approval by Councilor Caviello.

1558
01:59:16,419 --> 01:59:17,119
All those in favor?

1559
01:59:17,919 --> 01:59:18,560
All those opposed?

1560
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:19,480
Motion carries.

1561
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:20,360
Congratulations.

1562
01:59:20,788 --> 01:59:21,108
Thank you.

1563
01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:22,449
Good luck in your new business.

1564
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:24,809
Mr. President, one more while we're on the suspension.

1565
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:29,811
While we're on the suspension, one more, Councilor Caviello.

1566
01:59:29,871 --> 01:59:34,333
Mr. President, 15-420, if I could recommend tabling that, Mr. President.

1567
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:44,676
On motion 15-420, petition by Asha Patel for Spring Street, Super Red, Medford, for Keno to go, monitor to be installed at 88 Spring Street, Medford, Mass.

1568
01:59:45,076 --> 01:59:48,678
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing Commission, to table.

1569
01:59:48,698 --> 01:59:49,418
All those in favor?

1570
01:59:50,215 --> 01:59:50,875
All those opposed?

1571
01:59:51,236 --> 01:59:52,076
Thank you, Mr. President.

1572
01:59:53,217 --> 01:59:54,998
While we're on to suspension, Councilor Knight.

1573
01:59:55,018 --> 01:59:58,620
Can we take paper 15-337 off the table, please?

1574
01:59:58,780 --> 02:00:01,602
Appointment of Mr. James Tarani, the Board of Trust Fund Commissioners.

1575
02:00:02,282 --> 02:00:02,802
Very good.

1576
02:00:02,822 --> 02:00:05,384
15-1337.

1577
02:00:05,504 --> 02:00:16,350
And we have that as part of the committee of the whole report, reporting it favorably out of the committee.

1578
02:00:16,844 --> 02:00:20,245
Committee of the whole met last Wednesday, April 22nd, 2015, 6, 545.

1579
02:00:22,505 --> 02:00:29,506
Attendees, President DelaRusso, Vice President Longo Kern, Councilors Mox, Knight, and Mr. James Tirrani.

1580
02:00:29,906 --> 02:00:35,567
The purpose of the meeting was to review and discuss the confirmation of James Tirrani for reappointment to the Board of Trustees.

1581
02:00:36,808 --> 02:00:44,169
Recommendations upon motion of Councilor Knight that the meeting be taken out of unfinished and the motion to confirm Mr. Tirrani's appointment passed.

1582
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:47,871
Councilor Knight, motion that the paper report out of the committee is passed.

1583
02:00:47,911 --> 02:00:48,432
Councilor Knight.

1584
02:00:49,792 --> 02:00:50,613
Yes, Mr. President.

1585
02:00:51,193 --> 02:00:52,473
I couldn't have said it better myself.

1586
02:00:53,014 --> 02:01:00,697
The committee was properly, took a look at Mr. Tirani, had an opportunity to sit down and speak with him, ask the questions that they weren't able to ask when he was before the council the previous Tuesday.

1587
02:01:01,397 --> 02:01:05,799
It's my understanding that he works Tuesday nights with clients and was unable to meet with us on a Tuesday.

1588
02:01:05,859 --> 02:01:08,320
So he came the next available day, which was the week after.

1589
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,641
And it looks like everything's in order, Mr. President.

1590
02:01:10,681 --> 02:01:11,841
I was very happy with his appointment.

1591
02:01:11,861 --> 02:01:13,062
I think he's doing an excellent job.

1592
02:01:13,563 --> 02:01:15,203
And with that being said, I move for approval.

1593
02:01:15,764 --> 02:01:17,644
On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1594
02:01:17,664 --> 02:01:17,724
Aye.

1595
02:01:18,184 --> 02:01:19,384
All those opposed?

1596
02:01:19,424 --> 02:01:21,585
Mr. Torani is appointed, reappointed.

1597
02:01:22,965 --> 02:01:27,446
On the motion of Councilor Penta to return to the regular order of business.

1598
02:01:27,586 --> 02:01:28,386
All those in favor?

1599
02:01:28,747 --> 02:01:29,387
All those opposed?

1600
02:01:29,427 --> 02:01:30,447
Motion carries.

1601
02:01:30,467 --> 02:01:33,048
Orders and resolutions.

1602
02:01:33,068 --> 02:01:34,168
15.4.17, offered by Councilor Penta.

1603
02:01:34,548 --> 02:01:38,129
Be it resolved that the position of Mayor of the City of Medford be discussed.

1604
02:01:38,489 --> 02:01:39,209
Councilor Penta.

1605
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,700
Mr. President, this is a very important position.

1606
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:51,226
As we all know, this will be the first time in so many, many years that this office is going to be vacated by the incumbent mayor, Michael McGlynn.

1607
02:01:51,507 --> 02:01:55,449
As I said before, I wish him well for whatever endeavor he so chooses.

1608
02:01:55,509 --> 02:02:00,112
And I would hope that he would be finishing out his term and not leaving ahead of time.

1609
02:02:00,172 --> 02:02:02,594
But be that as it may, that's not the issue.

1610
02:02:03,334 --> 02:02:09,158
Right now, the second highest position in this building, which is the Director of Budget and Personnel, has made an announcement.

1611
02:02:09,895 --> 02:02:12,936
that that individual is going to run and seek the office of mayor.

1612
02:02:13,336 --> 02:02:17,637
I believe that was done some seven days, six days after the mayor made his announcement.

1613
02:02:18,597 --> 02:02:21,038
And I believe that was on April 20th.

1614
02:02:21,658 --> 02:02:34,501
And as a result of that, a further announcement has been forthcoming as it relates to that individual now going to relinquish that position on May 15th.

1615
02:02:34,881 --> 02:02:38,482
And today, I believe we received another press release, which was dated April 21st.

1616
02:02:39,912 --> 02:02:49,937
as it relates to the fact that the Director of Budget and Personnel is going to be leaving effective May 15th, even though the announcement was made on April 20th.

1617
02:02:50,797 --> 02:02:57,861
In the second comment of the letter that states, I would not want the Office of Mayor to encounter any appearance of any conflict of interest.

1618
02:02:57,921 --> 02:02:59,682
And I think there is a, a, a miss there.

1619
02:02:59,722 --> 02:03:00,942
It's not the Office of Mayor.

1620
02:03:00,982 --> 02:03:04,684
I think it would be the Office of the Budget Director because unfortunately,

1621
02:03:05,373 --> 02:03:13,255
This individual is the one that presents the budget to the city council and goes through all the finances to make the city's council's budget come forward.

1622
02:03:13,776 --> 02:03:18,197
At the same time, it's also the person that's in charge of personnel.

1623
02:03:19,097 --> 02:03:25,399
There's only been one person that I've been able to find in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the person comes from the city of Medford.

1624
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:34,222
And when this person, many, many years ago, made his announcement that he was running for attorney general, he resigned his position as vice chairman

1625
02:03:35,098 --> 02:03:40,281
of the Ways and Means Committee of the State House, that was George L. Sacco, former representative George Sacco.

1626
02:03:41,241 --> 02:03:51,906
And that always stuck out in my mind when somebody running for jobs of such high authority, if you're going to be that committed to it, they relinquish their position, at-present position.

1627
02:03:51,946 --> 02:03:55,488
In that time, vice chairman of Ways and Means was a very important position.

1628
02:03:56,269 --> 02:03:59,190
But when he resigned that position, that was the day he made his announcement.

1629
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:03,092
And I would personally believe, and I would think, and I would hope,

1630
02:04:03,782 --> 02:04:08,785
that a budget director would reconsider her position and resign immediately.

1631
02:04:09,446 --> 02:04:29,980
To have the luxury of reviewing a budget right now ahead of time or getting prepared for it, and I believe that the new person taking the budget director's place is now the procurement officer, and she will be assuming the budget director's position effective three days after May 15th, I think the conflict of interest is sort of like outstanding.

1632
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:33,642
That's an undue advantage ahead of time of any other candidate that might be running

1633
02:04:33,938 --> 02:04:39,862
for that position, and in all fairness to all parties concerned, I think May 15th doesn't serve any purpose.

1634
02:04:39,903 --> 02:04:55,454
I think it needs to be done immediately in all fairness, because if in fact, if in fact, that person were to become elected mayor of the community, and that person would be working with a mayor, I would strike that, would be working with a budget in advance that no one else would have had that advantage, advantage point two.

1635
02:04:56,175 --> 02:05:00,298
So with that being said, with all due respect, I understand the position she's in.

1636
02:05:00,806 --> 02:05:04,708
I understand that she's the budget director, and also the budget director in charge of personnel.

1637
02:05:05,348 --> 02:05:15,452
And if I'm looking at the second press release that was offered here today, it says that the procurement officer will only assume the position of a budget director, but not of personnel.

1638
02:05:15,912 --> 02:05:17,693
So I guess there'll be an addendum.

1639
02:05:18,433 --> 02:05:20,654
Someone is going to pick up that position in the future.

1640
02:05:21,274 --> 02:05:28,757
So with that being said, I would like that position to be made loud and clear, and all fairness to all candidates, whoever they may be, he or she,

1641
02:05:29,632 --> 02:05:47,562
that if the second highest position in this city has that authority for which that person has in here, I think in all fairness, they should be resigning immediately, not till May 15th, to get their ducks in order, just in case that person does, in fact, become the mayor of this city.

1642
02:05:48,142 --> 02:05:48,803
And you know something?

1643
02:05:49,043 --> 02:05:54,606
I've spoken to members up in the State House, and they have basically said the same thing.

1644
02:05:55,066 --> 02:05:56,667
Judge Sacco set the precedent.

1645
02:05:57,205 --> 02:06:02,109
of resigning his position when he decided to run for Attorney General, because that's how committed he was.

1646
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:07,514
He was willing to give up that for which he had to go forward and campaign for that position of Attorney General.

1647
02:06:08,115 --> 02:06:10,997
And that's what stuck out in my mind all these years.

1648
02:06:11,057 --> 02:06:19,205
And then when I saw the situation taking place here right now, and reading today's press release, I just thought that that would probably be the fair way to go.

1649
02:06:19,225 --> 02:06:23,869
And fairness to the person herself, to just leave

1650
02:06:24,337 --> 02:06:26,479
and move forward because you've already committed to a date.

1651
02:06:26,539 --> 02:06:27,920
Why did you commit on May 15th?

1652
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,044
I don't know if it's to get the budget in order and hands it down to the next president.

1653
02:06:33,344 --> 02:06:38,608
Again, totally unfair and big advantage and a big conflict as far as I'm concerned.

1654
02:06:39,469 --> 02:06:40,209
Councilor Camuso.

1655
02:06:40,489 --> 02:06:41,830
Thank you, Mr. President.

1656
02:06:42,691 --> 02:06:45,994
I respectfully disagree with Councilor Penta.

1657
02:06:46,234 --> 02:06:53,499
I have had the honor and the distinct pleasure to serve with the lady in question on this city council and have been through several budgets with her.

1658
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:59,304
She has the utmost integrity of high caliber.

1659
02:06:59,904 --> 02:07:04,387
And I am sure that she's doing what is right according to the law.

1660
02:07:04,987 --> 02:07:10,411
And if she feels that resigning on May 15th is the way to go, then I support it wholeheartedly.

1661
02:07:11,652 --> 02:07:16,015
I just, like I said, I just, the utmost integrity this woman has.

1662
02:07:16,115 --> 02:07:20,617
So I just respectfully disagree with my council colleague, and I'll leave it at that.

1663
02:07:21,818 --> 02:07:22,919
Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1664
02:07:23,588 --> 02:07:27,191
So, we have really no motion before us except that there be a discussion.

1665
02:07:27,211 --> 02:07:28,392
Mr. President.

1666
02:07:28,412 --> 02:07:29,273
So, Councilor Penta.

1667
02:07:29,353 --> 02:07:35,197
Yes, in response to Councilor Camuso, I didn't challenge her integrity and I didn't challenge her high caliber.

1668
02:07:35,538 --> 02:07:39,341
What I'm saying is the potentiality of a conflict of interest existing.

1669
02:07:40,381 --> 02:07:44,265
I have, I hear what you're saying and I don't disagree with you.

1670
02:07:44,845 --> 02:07:47,047
But I'm more concerned about the appearance of a conflict.

1671
02:07:48,088 --> 02:07:49,649
Second highest position in this building.

1672
02:07:50,630 --> 02:07:52,251
That's how I'm looking at it right now.

1673
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:56,292
Well, as just a little quick follow-up, and I'm going to let it go, Mr. President.

1674
02:07:57,593 --> 02:08:04,978
I'm sure, and I haven't had any conversations with her since she announced to be a candidate for mayor.

1675
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:15,506
And I am sure, knowing her and the input and just the way she goes about her every day doing her job, she is doing it within the confines of the law.

1676
02:08:16,426 --> 02:08:20,889
And I have no question about anything as it relates to this matter.

1677
02:08:22,114 --> 02:08:28,658
I'm not ready to take any type of vote on this other than to just say, I'm just letting my feelings be known.

1678
02:08:29,799 --> 02:08:30,639
Madam Vice President.

1679
02:08:30,879 --> 02:08:32,740
Thank you, President de la Rousseau.

1680
02:08:33,541 --> 02:08:35,962
I just don't believe this is in our purview either.

1681
02:08:36,022 --> 02:08:41,726
I feel like, I think she did announce that she was going to resign this Thursday.

1682
02:08:42,886 --> 02:08:50,591
We don't know the reasoning for staying on two more weeks, but there has to be some sort of reason, whether it's to train somebody who's going to

1683
02:08:50,927 --> 02:08:54,110
be taking our place or at least taking our place for the June budget.

1684
02:08:54,531 --> 02:08:57,674
There has to be a reasoning that we're not aware of.

1685
02:08:58,314 --> 02:09:05,822
I think it's up to those running for mayor or for elected office or for taking a vote individually to protect their own conflict of interest.

1686
02:09:05,922 --> 02:09:07,584
It's really not in our purview.

1687
02:09:12,406 --> 02:09:13,587
Thank you, Councillor Lungo.

1688
02:09:14,087 --> 02:09:16,368
I too feel as though Ms.

1689
02:09:16,408 --> 02:09:22,951
Burke is taking the steps that are appropriate to ensure that she is not posing a conflict of interest.

1690
02:09:23,011 --> 02:09:27,834
If we take into consideration the election calendar, nomination papers don't even come out until May 28th.

1691
02:09:28,434 --> 02:09:32,756
So until those papers come out, she might have announced for mayor, but until those papers come out, she can't even pull them.

1692
02:09:33,156 --> 02:09:35,978
So I really don't see the big issue here, Mr. President.

1693
02:09:36,038 --> 02:09:38,239
I can certainly understand where Councillor Pente is coming from,

1694
02:09:38,906 --> 02:09:43,629
A lot of times the appearance of impropriety is in fact much worse than actual impropriety.

1695
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:49,812
However, in terms of the situation where the nomination paper's not even out, I have no problem with Ms.

1696
02:09:49,832 --> 02:09:54,115
Muccini-Burke continuing in her position until the date that she decided to withdraw and resign.

1697
02:09:54,915 --> 02:10:00,198
So with that being said, I thank the gentleman for bringing the resolution forward and for bringing the topic to the table.

1698
02:10:00,998 --> 02:10:05,161
However, I too feel as though this is way outside the scope of what this council can do.

1699
02:10:07,526 --> 02:10:08,146
Thank you, Mr. President.

1700
02:10:08,166 --> 02:10:15,147
While I agree with Councilor Penter, I mean, as the parents of conflict, I do agree with Councilor Knight.

1701
02:10:15,607 --> 02:10:21,488
Anybody can announce anything, and until you actually go out and you at least get your papers, you're not a candidate for anything.

1702
02:10:22,309 --> 02:10:26,109
And with any job, it's customary to give a two-week notice.

1703
02:10:26,449 --> 02:10:30,090
You just can't pick up and leave, especially a job of that size.

1704
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:35,191
So just giving a two-week notice, something that you would give with any job that you had.

1705
02:10:36,717 --> 02:10:37,017
Very good.

1706
02:10:37,117 --> 02:10:39,279
On the motion of Council Penta to receive and place on file.

1707
02:10:39,639 --> 02:10:40,280
All those in favor?

1708
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:48,666
Opposed?

1709
02:10:48,686 --> 02:10:49,987
15.418 offered by Councilor Penta.

1710
02:10:50,507 --> 02:10:57,532
Be it resolved that the matter of Snappy Patty Restaurant and its latest activities be discussed.

1711
02:10:58,052 --> 02:10:58,613
Councilor?

1712
02:10:59,994 --> 02:11:04,497
Mr. President and anyone who might be watching, but more importantly, business people in this community.

1713
02:11:04,945 --> 02:11:10,928
that have to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the council, the billing department, and the liquor commission.

1714
02:11:12,148 --> 02:11:19,071
I observed something that's written in the local news food blog issue he made on March 16th, 2015.

1715
02:11:19,291 --> 02:11:25,094
It says snappy patties will get a whole lot bigger with the new patio.

1716
02:11:25,914 --> 02:11:32,457
And then it goes on to say that snappy patties in West Method is going to expand with 50 more seats.

1717
02:11:33,202 --> 02:11:42,785
And they're going to put an outside, upscale, contemporary American food of world influence, which they'll be putting outside for a service.

1718
02:11:43,385 --> 02:11:55,369
And they're going to more than double their capacity with the addition of a 50-plus seat capacity, including an outside bar, according to the job postings for positions on Craigslist.

1719
02:11:56,209 --> 02:12:02,311
Now, the unfortunate part about this, I think both for Councilor Caviello and myself, on two separate occasions,

1720
02:12:02,919 --> 02:12:08,862
weeks apart from each other, were informed that Snappy Patty's was serving alcohol, not beer and wine.

1721
02:12:09,503 --> 02:12:20,929
And such reports were submitted to the Liquor Commission and for which on both times, the Liquor Commission had to tell the Snappy Patty people they couldn't do that because they wouldn't be in jeopardy of their liquor license.

1722
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:26,692
Well, after the first occasion, they should have been fined because they knew that they wouldn't, they shouldn't be doing it.

1723
02:12:26,833 --> 02:12:27,533
That's number one.

1724
02:12:28,145 --> 02:12:35,929
I believe last week at some point in time, they were out there in the backyard with the backhoe or whatever, digging up the backyard.

1725
02:12:36,669 --> 02:12:45,173
That in and of itself prompted the building department to go down there and tell them that they had to stop, whether cease and desist, or they were going to be fined.

1726
02:12:46,094 --> 02:12:52,577
They continuously are just being obstinate to the rules and regulations as to what's going on in this community.

1727
02:12:53,357 --> 02:12:56,539
There are many businesses here in this community

1728
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:58,880
that abide by the liquor license laws.

1729
02:12:59,261 --> 02:13:11,004
As a matter of fact, I think most recently during, I would say early December or thereabouts, there were, I think, eight restaurants in this community that the Liquor Commission went in to make sure that the folks were doing what they were supposed to be doing.

1730
02:13:11,024 --> 02:13:15,905
And I think two of them unfortunately got warnings because of the serving of the alcohol.

1731
02:13:16,105 --> 02:13:18,986
And I believe in those situations, they were to minors.

1732
02:13:19,326 --> 02:13:24,567
But this one here, they brazenly are serving hard alcohol beverage.

1733
02:13:25,034 --> 02:13:30,939
at Snappy Patty's in total violation and total violation of the liquor laws here in the city of Medford.

1734
02:13:31,559 --> 02:13:39,926
Now, if we all remember, we had a discussion most recently regarding Bertucci's wanting to expand and go with an outside dining capacity.

1735
02:13:40,887 --> 02:13:52,957
And by doing that, I believe they gave us a demonstration and they gave us a schematic of the tables that were going to be in the restaurant needing to be at least two to three feet apart to allow a wheelchair to get by and also

1736
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:55,931
to have the accessibility of a handicapped bathroom.

1737
02:13:56,972 --> 02:14:01,234
I strongly suggest that now Snappy Patty's has put themselves into a spotlight.

1738
02:14:01,774 --> 02:14:14,880
I think their present location needs to be looked at as it relates to, is there room wide enough for a wheelchair to make an accessibility way in and out of their floor arrangement to a handicapped bathroom?

1739
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:20,623
And at the same time, this sole proposal for this expansion of 50 plus seats

1740
02:14:21,171 --> 02:14:25,133
which I think takes into question, is it even going to go on city property?

1741
02:14:25,213 --> 02:14:35,359
And if it is going to go on city property, for which we all know we're still waiting for the results, for the report to come back on the contamination of that particular parking lot that's back there.

1742
02:14:36,279 --> 02:14:47,265
So I'm going to ask, Madam President, that the building commissioner report, well, they gave us an initial report here tonight, that they put things down for which Snappy Patty's needs to do.

1743
02:14:47,785 --> 02:14:50,487
I believe what they need to do is first, before they do anything,

1744
02:14:50,888 --> 02:14:55,452
They have to commit construction documents to the building department.

1745
02:14:55,472 --> 02:14:56,252
They haven't done that.

1746
02:14:56,653 --> 02:14:59,275
They have to apply for a building permit, for which they haven't done.

1747
02:14:59,615 --> 02:15:02,598
They have to send in a certified plot plan, for which they haven't done.

1748
02:15:02,938 --> 02:15:08,443
They have to submit a floor plan showing the detailed description of the proposed work area, for which they haven't done.

1749
02:15:08,703 --> 02:15:12,746
And they haven't applied before the council for an outside permit to have their business.

1750
02:15:13,547 --> 02:15:19,732
So how does this business take it upon themselves to go forward, start construction, start digging up,

1751
02:15:20,289 --> 02:15:25,310
advertise what they're going to do in total violation of the rules and regulations of this community.

1752
02:15:25,950 --> 02:15:34,092
If that's the case, Mr. President, and they continue to go forward, and they don't submit the appropriate paperwork and do what they're supposed to do, then I think the council needs to—and if I—Mr.

1753
02:15:34,112 --> 02:15:38,193
Clerk, you can correct me if I'm wrong—do they have a common vigilance license from the council?

1754
02:15:39,653 --> 02:15:39,933
They do.

1755
02:15:40,313 --> 02:15:49,695
I think the council should have a show cause hearing on their common vigilance license for a violation of how they're operating, and at the same time, the request would go to the Liquor Commission

1756
02:15:50,275 --> 02:16:00,798
as it relates to their violation of the liquor laws of the city of Medford, and it's quite obvious now, dated April 28th, that the building department is well aware of what they're doing and what needs to be done.

1757
02:16:01,458 --> 02:16:14,981
You know, this is absolutely unfair to every other single business person that's had to come into this community to go by the rules and regulations as outlined by the building department and by this council, if in fact they have to come before the council.

1758
02:16:15,401 --> 02:16:18,482
But to let this one particular business just do what they want to do

1759
02:16:19,318 --> 02:16:25,383
advertise what they want to do, don't have the right proper documentation, that's wrong.

1760
02:16:26,303 --> 02:16:45,197
So, Madam President, I'm referring this both back to the building department, to our liquor commission, and to our council waiting for a report back as to what they're going to do resulting from the building commission sending them their notices that they're violating without proper authority.

1761
02:16:47,848 --> 02:16:48,208
Thank you.

1762
02:16:48,609 --> 02:16:49,669
Councillor Camuso.

1763
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:54,613
Thank you, and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councillor Penta.

1764
02:16:55,554 --> 02:16:59,117
The gentleman's just going about doing things on his own.

1765
02:16:59,597 --> 02:17:15,969
We have a piece of property that abuts that, directly behind it, that is, we're going to be doing a multi-million dollar clean-up down there at some point, and there's been excavating equipment out there, moving the dirt around, and the dirt is touching buildings

1766
02:17:17,682 --> 02:17:20,823
systems, at least they're monitoring for the chemicals that are out there.

1767
02:17:21,403 --> 02:17:25,083
I mean, this isn't environmentally... If they're taking dirt out, where's the dirt going?

1768
02:17:25,464 --> 02:17:25,984
We don't know.

1769
02:17:28,164 --> 02:17:33,645
So I think we have to send this to the Board of Health as well, Councillor Penta, to find out what's going on with that.

1770
02:17:34,245 --> 02:17:42,467
And the other thing is, too, you know, you have people in this community, city employees, that do their due diligence and take their jobs very serious.

1771
02:17:45,087 --> 02:18:01,624
After city employees have done their jobs and inquire, what's the equipment for, and this and that, and asking where your permits are and all that, one of the gentlemen that's in this particular establishment is going in and basically threatening other businesses, saying they called the city on them.

1772
02:18:02,124 --> 02:18:05,928
I mean, this guy's a vigilante running roughshod down there.

1773
02:18:07,516 --> 02:18:09,017
And it's just totally unacceptable.

1774
02:18:09,378 --> 02:18:13,621
And the business owners are basically looking at him like a deer in the headlights.

1775
02:18:13,641 --> 02:18:14,882
Like, what are you talking about?

1776
02:18:15,362 --> 02:18:17,004
It's in the West Medford Municipal lot.

1777
02:18:18,104 --> 02:18:19,646
It's the West Medford Municipal lot.

1778
02:18:22,888 --> 02:18:31,675
You're underneath the, you have 300, 400 cars pulling in and out of there during the days, I assume, between all the different venues down there.

1779
02:18:32,156 --> 02:18:33,617
So with that being said,

1780
02:18:34,859 --> 02:18:37,401
I think the city has to actually get a handle on what's going on down there.

1781
02:18:38,081 --> 02:18:49,348
Interesting enough, I know the gentleman has the proper seating for the beer and wine license, and I quite honestly don't know what the definition of a cordial is.

1782
02:18:49,788 --> 02:18:56,512
I know bigger restaurants in the community that have gone out and put the proper seating in to have full liquor licenses.

1783
02:18:57,076 --> 02:19:02,284
and made an investment in the pay and higher insurance bills and everything else due to those licenses.

1784
02:19:02,624 --> 02:19:06,970
I mean, are they at a disadvantage if they're serving stuff that doesn't conform with the particular license?

1785
02:19:07,711 --> 02:19:09,234
I really don't know, to tell you the truth.

1786
02:19:09,814 --> 02:19:13,039
So this is all things that our department heads have to get back to us on, I think.

1787
02:19:14,293 --> 02:19:16,135
and then move forward in the appropriate manner.

1788
02:19:16,515 --> 02:19:25,962
Because the biggest thing that disturbed me the most, though, like I said, with everything aside, going in and basically yelling at other business owners when there's a full store full of customers.

1789
02:19:27,524 --> 02:19:28,985
You called the city on me and this and that.

1790
02:19:29,005 --> 02:19:29,485
Well, you know what?

1791
02:19:29,545 --> 02:19:35,750
If you do things right, you don't have to worry about anyone calling the city or a building inspector coming on your property and making sure you're doing things right.

1792
02:19:36,251 --> 02:19:37,172
Just do it the right way.

1793
02:19:37,192 --> 02:19:41,335
I mean, Councilor Penta just read an advertisement talking about the seating and this and that.

1794
02:19:43,223 --> 02:19:44,764
It hasn't even been before this council yet.

1795
02:19:45,065 --> 02:19:48,087
I have a serious public safety issue I'm going to be looking at.

1796
02:19:48,648 --> 02:19:51,010
What if a car pulling out of a parking spot?

1797
02:19:52,562 --> 02:19:56,765
puts the car in drive and goes right through this patio with 30 people eating on it down there.

1798
02:19:57,186 --> 02:19:57,906
I mean, I don't know.

1799
02:19:57,926 --> 02:19:58,707
Is there going to be bollards?

1800
02:19:58,747 --> 02:20:00,248
Is there going to be some barrier in place?

1801
02:20:01,529 --> 02:20:06,073
Is it the border health an issue where the diesel trains are going by and out there eating?

1802
02:20:06,113 --> 02:20:06,553
I don't know.

1803
02:20:06,914 --> 02:20:10,256
But this is where our department heads have to give us the answers.

1804
02:20:10,516 --> 02:20:13,719
And as long as the gentleman's doing everything right, good luck to him.

1805
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:19,844
But as far as I can see right now, from what I hear, and I know early on,

1806
02:20:20,538 --> 02:20:22,860
There was some questions with the way the liquor license was written up.

1807
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:23,400
Is that correct?

1808
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:23,801
Counselor?

1809
02:20:24,681 --> 02:20:33,428
Um, and the way he was approaching his business, but serious, uh, disadvantage to businesses that are conforming to the rules and standards like counsel Penta stated.

1810
02:20:33,929 --> 02:20:37,311
So, uh, I support having this sent to our department heads.

1811
02:20:39,993 --> 02:20:40,934
Point of clarification.

1812
02:20:40,974 --> 02:20:41,595
Counselor Penta.

1813
02:20:41,695 --> 02:20:42,055
I forgot.

1814
02:20:42,075 --> 02:20:45,498
I mean, and the Craig list announced, uh, it basically says,

1815
02:20:46,059 --> 02:20:52,120
They're doubling their capacity with an addition of a 50 foot seating capacity, including an outside bar.

1816
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:54,401
I mean an outside bar.

1817
02:20:55,021 --> 02:20:55,401
Okay.

1818
02:20:55,461 --> 02:20:57,701
So put that all together.

1819
02:20:57,761 --> 02:21:00,782
And how do you advertise like that on, on March?

1820
02:21:01,582 --> 02:21:03,082
If I may, where was the advertisement?

1821
02:21:03,122 --> 02:21:03,483
March 16th.

1822
02:21:03,803 --> 02:21:06,203
It was on Craigslist in the food service blog.

1823
02:21:07,903 --> 02:21:08,644
Councilor Caviello.

1824
02:21:08,864 --> 02:21:09,664
Thank you, Madam President.

1825
02:21:10,064 --> 02:21:15,345
Madam President, you know, um, I, you know, I, I was privy to some of the things councilor Pinto went out with.

1826
02:21:16,292 --> 02:21:21,015
I actually had the opportunity to talk with the gentleman, one of the owners of the place.

1827
02:21:21,055 --> 02:21:29,620
And I nicely tried to explain to him that no one wants to throw out your business or stop your business or we welcome the patio, whatever you want to do.

1828
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:32,761
But I said, you need to understand that we have a process.

1829
02:21:32,821 --> 02:21:37,184
And I said, we approved patios a few weeks ago for some other restaurants.

1830
02:21:37,584 --> 02:21:43,007
I said, they came in here with plans before they started the project.

1831
02:21:43,467 --> 02:21:44,868
I said, please don't come in here.

1832
02:21:45,996 --> 02:21:49,999
thinking you're going to come in here with a fully done patio and we're going to approve it.

1833
02:21:50,399 --> 02:21:51,580
I said, this is not going to happen.

1834
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:55,923
I said, go out, get your proper permits with everybody.

1835
02:21:56,603 --> 02:22:01,587
But I said, before you start, I said, start at square one with your plans.

1836
02:22:01,607 --> 02:22:06,250
And he said, well, I've been to the department heads and I've talked to the commission.

1837
02:22:06,610 --> 02:22:11,414
I said, talking to them and actually getting a permit are two different things.

1838
02:22:12,223 --> 02:22:15,266
I said, so please, I said no one's not in favor of what you want to do.

1839
02:22:15,846 --> 02:22:19,770
Again, just get the proper permits, do the correct thing.

1840
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:28,117
Don't put the cart before the horse here, because again, if he comes here with a completed patio, no one at this council is going to vote for it.

1841
02:22:28,558 --> 02:22:33,062
So I think I tried to make them understand that, and I know the owner of the property.

1842
02:22:34,083 --> 02:22:37,366
I conveyed it to him, and he's tried to make him understand.

1843
02:22:37,859 --> 02:22:39,020
What it is that we're looking for.

1844
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,961
We're not looking for you to do anything different than anyone else has.

1845
02:22:42,022 --> 02:22:48,986
And I don't think people understand, but he doesn't need a permit to put a patio in the back on concrete.

1846
02:22:49,326 --> 02:22:52,067
But he does need a permit if he wants to see people out there.

1847
02:22:52,128 --> 02:23:01,353
I mean, all he's done right now, he's dug up the ground and he's planning on putting either some pavers down there or concrete, which does not require him to have a permit.

1848
02:23:01,778 --> 02:23:11,104
But anything else he does, if he wants to, if he's planning on building a patio, if he goes much further than that without coming before us, I don't know what support he's going to get, Madam President.

1849
02:23:12,025 --> 02:23:12,345
Thank you.

1850
02:23:12,705 --> 02:23:15,688
Point of clarification, Councilor Panto.

1851
02:23:15,888 --> 02:23:19,790
When you say you don't further, we don't know where the city property begins or where the city property ends.

1852
02:23:20,171 --> 02:23:23,413
And I think the city's engineers got to get down there and figure out what belongs to us.

1853
02:23:23,533 --> 02:23:25,674
I don't know if he's on the city property or not.

1854
02:23:26,015 --> 02:23:26,495
None of us know.

1855
02:23:27,270 --> 02:23:39,753
None of us know, but again, I see it's been dug up to the curb, and I'm assuming that the owner of the property owns up at least to the curb, but we haven't even got into the issue of the other businesses you're going to be blocking.

1856
02:23:40,993 --> 02:23:46,635
If I may, from the chair, he does have a... He does have an outdoor dining application in.

1857
02:23:46,955 --> 02:23:47,795
There has been.

1858
02:23:48,055 --> 02:23:49,435
There is an application in.

1859
02:23:49,455 --> 02:23:55,317
The two that haven't signed off yet are obviously building in health, and they are

1860
02:23:56,342 --> 02:24:05,446
looking at the concerns that you have, but the other ones, police, I mean, it's all plans are in sketch, you know, it's before the 88 coordinator.

1861
02:24:05,506 --> 02:24:08,708
And now, uh, for her to look at her and prove it.

1862
02:24:08,728 --> 02:24:10,729
So throughout the steps are still being there.

1863
02:24:10,829 --> 02:24:16,672
Now, whatever permits, that's a different story, but the outdoor dining application is in.

1864
02:24:18,730 --> 02:24:21,512
right now.

1865
02:24:22,412 --> 02:24:34,882
I would hope that his construction doesn't continue until he gets, other than, you know, putting down a concrete slab until he goes further on, until he gets further on the process and he gets to this, gets to this board.

1866
02:24:35,122 --> 02:24:35,422
Thank you.

1867
02:24:35,542 --> 02:24:36,062
Councilor Knight.

1868
02:24:37,003 --> 02:24:38,404
Madam President, thank you very much.

1869
02:24:39,045 --> 02:24:41,647
Um, you know, Snappy Patty's is a new restaurant.

1870
02:24:42,207 --> 02:24:46,270
It's, it's, uh, one of the newer shops down in West Medford square.

1871
02:24:46,753 --> 02:24:52,017
It's gotten some positive reviews and I think it's certainly a nice addition to our downtown and west Memphis square.

1872
02:24:53,038 --> 02:25:04,726
However, not at the expense of, you know, the rules and regulations that are put in place that make sure that this community is kept safe, that health standards are met, that certain engineering standards are met.

1873
02:25:05,487 --> 02:25:12,792
And, you know, there's a process that must be adhered to, Madam President, and ignorance of that process takes no excuse to move forward.

1874
02:25:12,812 --> 02:25:14,794
And Councillor Camuso was absolutely right.

1875
02:25:14,854 --> 02:25:15,875
You know, I had a neighbor that

1876
02:25:16,616 --> 02:25:19,018
wanted to put in one of those wood-burning stoves in their garage.

1877
02:25:19,679 --> 02:25:20,660
And he said, I'm just going to do it.

1878
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,781
And I said, I don't think that's a good idea.

1879
02:25:21,801 --> 02:25:23,222
You might want to talk to the building department.

1880
02:25:23,242 --> 02:25:28,687
And they went to the building department, and they got all the appropriate permitting, and they got the appropriate measurements and the appropriate equipment and put it in.

1881
02:25:29,328 --> 02:25:32,571
Well, it's inside their garage, and it goes out of the roof.

1882
02:25:34,145 --> 02:25:39,070
Sure enough, the first day they turned it on, 7,000 people in the neighborhood thought there was a house on fire, and they called the police.

1883
02:25:39,391 --> 02:25:43,174
And because they permitted it the appropriate way, everyone was aware of what was going on.

1884
02:25:43,194 --> 02:25:48,180
And I think that that's the most important thing here, Madam President, is that there's a process in place.

1885
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:55,147
The process is in place to keep us safe, to keep the community safe, and to protect the quality of life of the residents and the people that want to use those businesses.

1886
02:25:56,047 --> 02:26:09,871
So, you know, I think what we need to do is take a look at Councillor Camuso's resolution that he put forward, which would streamline the permitting process, because I think what this is is really it's just someone, a business owner, who's frustrated and wants the process to move faster than it really is.

1887
02:26:10,171 --> 02:26:14,192
And because the permitting process is taking a bit of time, he's getting himself a little bit ahead of the gun.

1888
02:26:14,933 --> 02:26:23,675
You know, I certainly want to portray a business-friendly attitude when people come before the council for common victuals licenses.

1889
02:26:24,045 --> 02:26:29,429
But not at the expense of public safety and not at the expense of the established rules, regulations, and ordinances that are in place.

1890
02:26:29,469 --> 02:26:29,969
Madam President.

1891
02:26:32,611 --> 02:26:33,591
Name and address for the record.

1892
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:35,052
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1893
02:26:35,112 --> 02:26:36,533
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1894
02:26:37,254 --> 02:26:41,296
The question I have, it seems like this issue might be a little larger than Snappy Patty.

1895
02:26:41,897 --> 02:26:50,342
How can a business be doing work construction without the building inspector posting a work stoppage order on his permit?

1896
02:26:50,442 --> 02:26:51,303
I don't understand.

1897
02:26:51,763 --> 02:26:52,504
Yeah.

1898
02:26:53,575 --> 02:26:55,497
Clarification, Councilor Camuso.

1899
02:26:55,577 --> 02:27:05,585
All he's doing is putting down either blocks or a patio floor, which does not require a building permit at this moment.

1900
02:27:05,885 --> 02:27:08,427
So that's all he's done at the moment.

1901
02:27:09,068 --> 02:27:16,434
He hasn't gone any further than digging it up and planning on pouring a layer of concrete or putting pavers down or whatever he plans to do.

1902
02:27:16,654 --> 02:27:18,856
So that does not require a building permit at the moment.

1903
02:27:19,136 --> 02:27:19,456
Oh, okay.

1904
02:27:19,516 --> 02:27:20,317
Thank you for the clarification.

1905
02:27:21,772 --> 02:27:21,972
Thank you.

1906
02:27:22,032 --> 02:27:25,313
Okay, so on Councilor Penta's motion that the Building Department give a further report, Liquor Commission look into the licensing.

1907
02:27:25,333 --> 02:27:27,014
And amended by Councilor Camuso that the Board of Health look into this.

1908
02:27:27,034 --> 02:27:28,075
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1909
02:27:28,095 --> 02:27:29,035
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1910
02:27:29,055 --> 02:27:30,195
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1911
02:27:30,215 --> 02:27:31,236
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1912
02:27:32,176 --> 02:27:33,197
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1913
02:27:33,217 --> 02:27:35,318
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1914
02:27:35,338 --> 02:27:36,598
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1915
02:27:36,618 --> 02:27:38,599
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1916
02:27:38,619 --> 02:27:39,559
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1917
02:27:39,579 --> 02:27:41,360
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1918
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:42,901
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1919
02:27:42,921 --> 02:27:45,282
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1920
02:27:45,302 --> 02:27:46,362
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1921
02:27:46,382 --> 02:27:47,903
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1922
02:27:47,923 --> 02:27:48,903
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1923
02:27:48,943 --> 02:27:50,364
Building, Liquor Commission, and Board of Health.

1924
02:27:50,384 --> 02:27:50,584
Building,

1925
02:27:55,008 --> 02:27:56,228
Offered by Councillor Penta.

1926
02:27:56,248 --> 02:27:59,129
I'll read it and then we can switch.

1927
02:27:59,529 --> 02:28:06,570
Be it resolved as a matter of this present year's operating budget that includes a $2 million increase in the school department be discussed.

1928
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:08,990
Councillor Penta.

1929
02:28:09,511 --> 02:28:23,133
Madam President, we all know, and I guess at the beginning, I thought it was to the great betterment of the school department that they got a $2 million increase on their side of the ledger.

1930
02:28:23,864 --> 02:28:27,646
for the 2014-2015 budget.

1931
02:28:28,387 --> 02:28:39,874
But after doing some initial investigation, it appears like those monies did not find their way into something that I'm going to revert back to Councilor Caviello.

1932
02:28:40,355 --> 02:28:50,201
When you first came on, I believe it was at the end of your first term, you indicated there was $1.2 million worth of corrections that were needed in the Medford public school system.

1933
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:55,212
And I don't see any report coming back on that, number one.

1934
02:28:55,652 --> 02:29:05,716
Number two, the $1.2 million in corrections, having been talked upon, it's only been talked, if they've done something, it would be nice to get a report.

1935
02:29:06,596 --> 02:29:18,741
But approximately 27 positions have been involved or impacted as a result of this $2 million increase, which I believe, if my numbers are correct, is approximately seven new positions.

1936
02:29:19,785 --> 02:29:24,628
And these seven new positions have jobs that are in the $90,000 range, if not more.

1937
02:29:25,368 --> 02:29:42,877
And I don't think that's what the people of this community are looking for when they see increases in the school department budget, when there is a lacking of teachers in certain specific classes, in the classroom looking for whether it be books or supplies or things of that nature.

1938
02:29:44,118 --> 02:29:48,260
Just because you haven't had an assistant principal in some school for years, now all of a sudden

1939
02:29:48,570 --> 02:29:57,677
because you got the $2 million, you're going to go back and put an assistant principal in, which could be nothing more than maybe a political job, a favor to give to somebody.

1940
02:29:57,817 --> 02:29:58,318
I don't know.

1941
02:29:58,798 --> 02:30:13,850
But I just think it's kind of like wrong that these 27 positions or thereabouts that have been impacted, of seven of which are probably brand new or thereabouts are brand new, with $90,000 salaries, if not more, represents the $2 million increase into the school department budget.

1942
02:30:14,170 --> 02:30:17,272
I don't even know if the city can afford another $2 million this year.

1943
02:30:18,341 --> 02:30:20,563
to sustain the $2 million from last year.

1944
02:30:21,424 --> 02:30:29,931
So, what I'd be asking for, Mr. President, is — Mr. President, I'd be asking that the superintendent of the school department — oh, let me tell you another story.

1945
02:30:29,951 --> 02:30:35,376
I went up to the high school the other day, and I walked into — walking into that high school in the front.

1946
02:30:35,416 --> 02:30:36,376
It's a war zone.

1947
02:30:36,396 --> 02:30:39,219
It looks like that school has gone through a war.

1948
02:30:39,939 --> 02:30:41,541
The cement is all broken.

1949
02:30:41,621 --> 02:30:42,342
The bricks are —

1950
02:30:43,258 --> 02:30:44,499
The bricks are just shuffled.

1951
02:30:44,999 --> 02:30:46,681
There's loose pieces of concrete.

1952
02:30:46,701 --> 02:30:48,602
The door's walking into the front entrance.

1953
02:30:49,483 --> 02:30:58,130
It's an embarrassment, if you were a taxpayer to this community, to walk up to that school and say, this is my high school, and this is the high school where I want to send my children to.

1954
02:30:58,150 --> 02:31:00,131
I don't understand it.

1955
02:31:00,151 --> 02:31:04,275
I just can't understand what they don't understand.

1956
02:31:04,815 --> 02:31:09,699
The young lady who came up here a little while ago, she talked about taking 5% of the budget for each building.

1957
02:31:10,343 --> 02:31:17,706
Well, if we remember correctly, on the new school buildings, there was supposed to have been 5% on an annual basis until those buildings were paid off.

1958
02:31:18,146 --> 02:31:27,090
But of course, the State Department of Education didn't have auditors to come in to check and see if 5% on an annual basis was being reinvested each and every year on those school buildings.

1959
02:31:27,591 --> 02:31:31,452
And now all of a sudden, whether it's a million two, could it be up to a million four?

1960
02:31:31,552 --> 02:31:31,952
I don't know.

1961
02:31:32,513 --> 02:31:35,894
Maybe we should get a review of that also, Councilor Caviello.

1962
02:31:35,934 --> 02:31:39,916
Just what are the damages that need to be corrected in these buildings?

1963
02:31:40,266 --> 02:31:51,055
But it's quite obvious that this $2 million has now become a political football in the school department wherewithal for the purposes of jobs and whatever it might be.

1964
02:31:51,976 --> 02:32:07,008
I thought and I believed that the $2 million was going to be for educational purposes, teachers, books, supplies, things that are desperately needed, and maybe monies to be used to repair some of the buildings

1965
02:32:07,505 --> 02:32:10,907
that have been so delinquent for so long and not getting repairs.

1966
02:32:11,767 --> 02:32:12,727
And that's not happening.

1967
02:32:13,268 --> 02:32:16,929
So I'd like to report back, you know, I don't know where the school committee is on this.

1968
02:32:17,830 --> 02:32:20,091
You know, I think they have an obligation to explain this.

1969
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:36,218
And also, and also, and I don't know where we're going with this, but the scuttlebutt now is, and I'll wait one more week before I put this on the agenda, but the scuttlebutt is now, and it would be nice if we were told about this, that the high school is trying to merge the vocational school

1970
02:32:36,655 --> 02:32:44,317
with the high school and only leave three or four certain classes that are certified and make the other classes nothing more than electives.

1971
02:32:45,077 --> 02:32:54,359
The Medford Vocational School has been a wonderful asset to the community of the city of Medford for students who just are not college bound.

1972
02:32:54,879 --> 02:33:03,841
There are students that want to be plumbers, auto repair person, auto mechanics, workshop folks, whatever.

1973
02:33:04,482 --> 02:33:07,804
whatever the trades people are looking for.

1974
02:33:09,205 --> 02:33:26,716
And now for the school department to be talking and thinking of merging and only leaving three or four certified positions up there as it relates to these type of work entities and have the rest become nothing more than, you know, electives that kids in the high school can go back and forth.

1975
02:33:27,036 --> 02:33:29,918
It defeats the whole purpose of a vocational school education.

1976
02:33:30,858 --> 02:33:33,960
So I'm going to make this in three counts, Mr. President.

1977
02:33:35,177 --> 02:33:37,419
I think maybe we should just meet with the school committee.

1978
02:33:37,859 --> 02:33:54,272
Maybe we should have a joint meeting with the school committee for the purposes of investigating not only the $2 million, but discuss the $2 million, discuss the problems of the city, and discuss the makeup of that, and also to discuss just what are they trying to do with the vocational school.

1979
02:33:55,372 --> 02:33:55,853
Merge it?

1980
02:33:56,473 --> 02:33:56,814
End it?

1981
02:33:58,115 --> 02:33:58,495
I don't know.

1982
02:33:59,144 --> 02:34:00,665
But you have teachers that are very confused.

1983
02:34:00,685 --> 02:34:02,086
You have students that are really upset.

1984
02:34:02,326 --> 02:34:11,332
You have parents that are upset, because when they talk to me, I have no idea what they're talking about, because apparently this has been going on, and it hasn't been advertised, and nothing's been written about it.

1985
02:34:12,112 --> 02:34:21,878
So this is a major change to our public school education, if the vocational school is now going to be transformed into some type of community school within the high school.

1986
02:34:22,118 --> 02:34:24,200
That's not what vocational education is all about.

1987
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:25,961
Absolutely not.

1988
02:34:26,781 --> 02:34:28,062
So I'm going to ask, Mr. President,

1989
02:34:28,459 --> 02:34:42,046
that over and beyond having a joint meeting with the school committee, I'd like to have a report back as to A, number one, the $2 million that have been spent for this year's budget, names of individuals and salaries attached to it.

1990
02:34:43,266 --> 02:34:54,472
Two, the repairs that Councilor Caviello brought to the council, I think it was some three years ago of approximately $1.2 million that we get a list of all the repairs and the projected costs.

1991
02:34:56,353 --> 02:34:56,593
Three,

1992
02:34:58,458 --> 02:35:08,681
What are they doing about this vocational school as it relates to changing the purpose that it presently operates under as to merging it with the high school?

1993
02:35:10,902 --> 02:35:19,104
Fourth, why is the front entrance to Medford High School in such a terrible state of affairs?

1994
02:35:21,385 --> 02:35:21,965
And lastly,

1995
02:35:22,682 --> 02:35:25,463
to have a joint meeting with the school committee on all these matters.

1996
02:35:25,783 --> 02:35:31,385
On the five-fold resolution of Councilor Penta, Councilor, Vice President, I'll go current.

1997
02:35:31,445 --> 02:35:33,286
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1998
02:35:33,406 --> 02:35:35,787
I thank Councilor Penta for putting this on the agenda.

1999
02:35:35,807 --> 02:35:43,349
I think we do need some answers, and I know the school committee has to be involved, but I think we do need some answers before the budget in June.

2000
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:48,371
From what I understand, there have been at least seven new hires at 94,000 to

2001
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:54,971
$15,000 per year in salary.

2002
02:35:55,872 --> 02:36:06,400
So I just, I think that's pertinent information for the June, going over the school department budget in June, because I think we need to look at the big picture here.

2003
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:11,044
I too did not know these new positions were going to be implemented.

2004
02:36:12,205 --> 02:36:19,831
We were told, you know, I think minimal information when we should have been told probably more information of the bigger picture back

2005
02:36:20,124 --> 02:36:22,625
back in last year in June 2014.

2006
02:36:23,665 --> 02:36:25,626
We have people who are being hired, 94,000, 115,000.

2007
02:36:25,686 --> 02:36:27,787
Then we also have people who jumped from 77,000 to 94,000, 82,000 to 94,000.

2008
02:36:27,827 --> 02:36:29,747
We have people that jumped, you know, minimally 8,000, 5,000, 6,000.

2009
02:36:29,907 --> 02:36:35,629
But I think it does a disservice to give an administrator, you know, a $20,000 raise when we're talking about giving our fire and police and teachers

2010
02:36:49,868 --> 02:36:55,871
you know, the one to 2%, you know, an average increase in pay salary based on the cost of living.

2011
02:36:56,471 --> 02:36:58,772
We also have aides in our kindergartens.

2012
02:36:59,672 --> 02:37:03,854
They got a 13 cent per hour raise.

2013
02:37:03,874 --> 02:37:04,234
13 cents.

2014
02:37:05,235 --> 02:37:11,317
That equals, I mean, if you do the average, some aides in the kindergarten classrooms aren't even allowed to work a full day.

2015
02:37:11,357 --> 02:37:13,138
They work about three hours per day.

2016
02:37:14,138 --> 02:37:16,539
That being the case, it's about an $85 raise for the year.

2017
02:37:18,984 --> 02:37:22,786
I think it's something that we need to pay more attention to this at budget time.

2018
02:37:22,826 --> 02:37:26,088
And I know we meet probably six, seven, eight times during the budget.

2019
02:37:26,108 --> 02:37:27,449
We go over the whole city budget.

2020
02:37:27,749 --> 02:37:31,191
But I think we need to dedicate more than an hour, an hour and a half to the school budget.

2021
02:37:31,672 --> 02:37:35,334
And if that's sitting down with the school committee, so be it.

2022
02:37:36,014 --> 02:37:38,996
But the main issue here is that we were given minimal information.

2023
02:37:39,116 --> 02:37:46,761
I mean, we don't have a day-to-day, you know, we don't have day-to-day access of who's hired and who's fired in the school department.

2024
02:37:47,281 --> 02:37:48,262
Well, nobody's fired.

2025
02:37:48,637 --> 02:37:51,738
who's hired and for what salary and who's going to get what raise.

2026
02:37:51,778 --> 02:37:54,359
I mean, we don't have that information on a yearly basis.

2027
02:37:54,759 --> 02:37:59,060
But it's something that we need to definitely dig into a little deeper come June.

2028
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:03,381
Because I think that the city should be consistent throughout the board.

2029
02:38:03,541 --> 02:38:09,243
Like I said a couple minutes ago, fire, police, teachers, aides within our classroom.

2030
02:38:09,283 --> 02:38:10,903
That's disgraceful.

2031
02:38:11,863 --> 02:38:13,104
It's absolutely disgraceful.

2032
02:38:17,885 --> 02:38:18,185
Thank you.

2033
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:20,590
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

2034
02:38:20,750 --> 02:38:21,891
Councilor Caraviello.

2035
02:38:21,971 --> 02:38:22,711
Thank you, Mr. President.

2036
02:38:23,171 --> 02:38:24,491
I agree with Councilor Longo-Kearns.

2037
02:38:26,672 --> 02:38:38,955
We should have some numbers before the budget, and I think this year we need to spend a little bit more time with the school budget, and all the budgets, not just the school, but the budget in general.

2038
02:38:39,755 --> 02:38:46,237
I think we got to sit down and make some hard decisions, and not wait until November to say we need to cut the budget.

2039
02:38:46,797 --> 02:38:48,157
A budget needs to be cut or added to.

2040
02:38:49,059 --> 02:38:55,162
We need to speak up when the time comes now, not wait six months later.

2041
02:38:55,563 --> 02:39:06,329
And also, when Councilor Pentland mentioned the front of the high school, when was the last time you walked into the front of the police station where their stairs are crumbling?

2042
02:39:06,649 --> 02:39:13,833
I went in there the other day, the first stairs almost all gone.

2043
02:39:13,853 --> 02:39:15,053
We're crumbling all around.

2044
02:39:16,854 --> 02:39:18,195
Crumbling out front here too.

2045
02:39:18,675 --> 02:39:20,576
That's right, Counselor Penta.

2046
02:39:21,076 --> 02:39:31,402
Well, all you have to do is look up at the ceiling over there and you wonder what's taken so long to get that fixed, whether it's the stairs in front of the police station, the stairs in front of the high school.

2047
02:39:32,442 --> 02:39:33,343
This is the whole idea.

2048
02:39:33,403 --> 02:39:34,563
How would the priorities are set?

2049
02:39:34,903 --> 02:39:43,988
Just reverting back to Councilor Longo-Curran when she talked about, you know, look at the lunch mothers who haven't received diddly in years for a pay raise.

2050
02:39:45,009 --> 02:39:47,450
And they're there every day taking care of the kids in the school.

2051
02:39:48,443 --> 02:39:58,458
And if I understand some of these bumps that the $2 million afforded, they gave people in management positions pay raises or they escalated their pay.

2052
02:39:59,277 --> 02:40:05,002
But I don't understand how you can do that if you've already had a budget that was voted upon, which your salary is supposed to be.

2053
02:40:05,082 --> 02:40:07,084
And I don't know if you can turn around and do this.

2054
02:40:07,144 --> 02:40:09,026
I mean, that's what needs to be explained to us.

2055
02:40:09,466 --> 02:40:10,587
This is kind of like crazy.

2056
02:40:11,188 --> 02:40:17,974
If you're getting paid $60,000, $70,000 a year, then how can you turn around and get another $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 out of this $2 million?

2057
02:40:18,955 --> 02:40:22,758
Whether you're an administrator or rank and file, it doesn't cut the mustard.

2058
02:40:23,299 --> 02:40:25,721
This $2 million was supposed to be for education.

2059
02:40:26,998 --> 02:40:31,603
not for personal engrangement for certain people that work in that building.

2060
02:40:32,264 --> 02:40:43,395
It should have been for teachers, classrooms, books, supplies, and maybe at the outset it should have been for repairs to the school buildings, because that's what's desperately needed.

2061
02:40:43,615 --> 02:40:45,257
You spent $112 million for new buildings,

2062
02:40:46,783 --> 02:40:50,126
And as of two and a half years ago, there were a million two in need of repairs.

2063
02:40:50,426 --> 02:40:51,948
God knows what the amount is right now.

2064
02:40:52,508 --> 02:40:57,953
But they know how to feather their own nest, their own pocketbook with their own pay raises without acknowledging this.

2065
02:40:58,293 --> 02:40:59,955
I think this is a very crucial matter.

2066
02:41:00,576 --> 02:41:06,281
You have people on the school committee wanting to run for the city council and not acknowledging any of these issues.

2067
02:41:06,961 --> 02:41:12,666
These are the issues that are every day that are confronting the city and the taxpayers and the students that go to that school.

2068
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:23,698
You have whether they're the lunch mothers, who sometimes say they're the lowest ones on the rung because they don't get acknowledged, or you go all the way up to the superintendent, who gets the highest pay of anyone in the entirety.

2069
02:41:24,558 --> 02:41:28,361
Something's got to be understood and explained, and not just at the budget time.

2070
02:41:28,821 --> 02:41:34,526
And we have asked so many times ahead of time to have these joint meetings between the school department and the council and vice versa.

2071
02:41:35,246 --> 02:41:37,608
So you have four separate issues here, Mr. President.

2072
02:41:37,888 --> 02:41:39,930
And then you have a fifth issue to have a joint meeting

2073
02:41:40,189 --> 02:41:52,593
with the school department, so it would be great to get all these answers ahead of time so we could have our joint meeting, so we could have some sense of understanding to know where we're going, rather than walk into a meeting and just look at each other like a bunch of dopes.

2074
02:41:53,534 --> 02:41:54,634
Thank you, Councilor Penta.

2075
02:41:54,674 --> 02:41:55,634
Councilor Langley-Curran?

2076
02:41:55,734 --> 02:41:56,034
Thank you.

2077
02:41:56,054 --> 02:42:06,138
Just to resolve, I know Councilor Penta, we'd like a list before June of all new hires in the last 12 months with salaries and amounts, and then

2078
02:42:07,028 --> 02:42:17,610
Just also a list of all those who received raises over the last two years, over the average of 1 to 2%, which the rest of the city seems to get.

2079
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:22,171
So if we could have that before June, that would help with our budget deliberations.

2080
02:42:23,091 --> 02:42:23,391
Thank you.

2081
02:42:24,011 --> 02:42:24,571
Councilor Knight.

2082
02:42:25,351 --> 02:42:26,731
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2083
02:42:27,012 --> 02:42:29,532
And I can certainly appreciate the concerns.

2084
02:42:29,572 --> 02:42:34,413
However, I believe it's important to point out that our school committee holds their own budget hearings.

2085
02:42:35,973 --> 02:42:37,473
Anybody who wants to go, can.

2086
02:42:37,753 --> 02:42:40,134
They're open to the general public and we can ask those questions there.

2087
02:42:40,734 --> 02:42:42,235
I'd move to sever the questions, Mr. President.

2088
02:42:45,195 --> 02:42:47,396
Motion to sever the questions.

2089
02:42:47,496 --> 02:42:49,476
Councilor Penta, point of information.

2090
02:42:49,516 --> 02:42:54,658
Yeah, on the point of information regarding the motion to sever, and Councilor Knight can do whatever he wants as it relates to that.

2091
02:42:54,978 --> 02:42:59,219
Fact of the matter is this city council makes the final vote on the city and the school department budget.

2092
02:42:59,735 --> 02:43:07,140
And this city council was informed that the school department was given a $2 million increase during our budget with absolutely no explanation as to what and how.

2093
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:23,111
And now that this has now been surfacing and people are asking questions and there are some concerns as it relates to how and why the $2 million was spent and now which precipitates all these other issues, whether it be the vocational school, whether they're merging, they're not merging, whether it's people getting raises, schools are getting raises.

2094
02:43:23,413 --> 02:43:31,976
whether the entrance to the high school is gonna be, it is our bailiwick, it is our responsibility, and it's the school department's responsibility to talk about it and acknowledge it, and they haven't.

2095
02:43:32,936 --> 02:43:34,877
Thank you, Councilor Penta, for that point.

2096
02:43:35,337 --> 02:43:36,498
Councilor Naira, you all through?

2097
02:43:36,778 --> 02:43:38,178
That was interesting, Mr. President.

2098
02:43:38,918 --> 02:43:47,561
However, you know, I think that the council have professed that there were certain members of the school committee that are gonna be running up the city council, and it sounds like it might be certain members of the city council that wanna be on the school committee.

2099
02:43:47,982 --> 02:43:52,243
But ultimately, looking at the issue, you know, we approved a budget,

2100
02:43:53,147 --> 02:43:54,307
We approved a budget, all right?

2101
02:43:54,427 --> 02:43:58,389
And I have no problem asking questions, Mr. President, but I think that we have to ask them in the appropriate form.

2102
02:43:58,949 --> 02:44:02,851
And if we're concerned about what's going on at the school department, then let's go on their turf and let's ask them what's going on over there.

2103
02:44:03,271 --> 02:44:04,431
I don't have a problem with a joint meeting.

2104
02:44:04,451 --> 02:44:05,692
I don't have a problem with that at all.

2105
02:44:06,192 --> 02:44:11,314
But what I have a problem with is us trying to tell the school department what they need to do, us telling the school committee that this is what you need to do.

2106
02:44:11,514 --> 02:44:12,034
They're the committee.

2107
02:44:12,054 --> 02:44:14,255
They're elected to make those policy decisions, Mr. President.

2108
02:44:14,749 --> 02:44:19,452
And I feel as though we're overstepping a little bit when we're starting to demand things from them and tell them what to do.

2109
02:44:19,692 --> 02:44:23,575
They're elected into that office to vet that budget, to put that budget together and to issue that budget.

2110
02:44:23,935 --> 02:44:26,257
They issue that budget to this council and this council looks at it.

2111
02:44:26,757 --> 02:44:27,958
We either accept it or we don't.

2112
02:44:29,479 --> 02:44:30,339
That's the fact of the matter.

2113
02:44:30,680 --> 02:44:38,325
So to talk about the budget and to talk about what the school committee is including in their budget, I think the appropriate time to do that would be when the school committee is putting their budget together during their budget hearings.

2114
02:44:42,003 --> 02:44:49,569
to sever the five-fold motion by Councilor Penta, Councilor Caraviello.

2115
02:44:49,909 --> 02:44:50,670
Thank you, Mr. President.

2116
02:44:51,070 --> 02:44:56,194
You know, Councilor Penta made a comment about the $112 million that was spent on these new schools.

2117
02:44:56,554 --> 02:45:02,879
Well, you know, one of the good things that Mayor McGlynn was able to do was he was able to go out and get federal funding, and we sold the other schools.

2118
02:45:02,939 --> 02:45:09,304
So, geez, you know, just imagine if we were paying the taxes on the $112 million in these schools.

2119
02:45:11,501 --> 02:45:23,849
The least we could have done, seeing that we got the schools for nothing, which is what we did, we could have at least maintained the buildings, seeing that you got your schools for free, which has been a sore point of mine.

2120
02:45:26,151 --> 02:45:26,911
Councillor Pinto.

2121
02:45:27,572 --> 02:45:28,392
Councillor Camuso.

2122
02:45:30,333 --> 02:45:31,294
Thank you, Mr. President.

2123
02:45:31,394 --> 02:45:36,918
And I've been a member of the school committee in the past and a member of this council.

2124
02:45:37,498 --> 02:45:40,380
And I certainly respect the clear delineation

2125
02:45:41,270 --> 02:45:43,691
of the roles of each particular body.

2126
02:45:44,431 --> 02:45:46,091
The school committee puts together a budget.

2127
02:45:46,611 --> 02:45:55,194
They come to the city council with that bottom line number, and we either say yay or nay on the overall funding package.

2128
02:45:55,974 --> 02:46:01,315
A lot of good stuff has been going on in the schools, but there's also some questions, like Councilor Prentice said about the vocational school.

2129
02:46:02,095 --> 02:46:03,236
That's the first I'm hearing of it.

2130
02:46:03,776 --> 02:46:07,737
I know that they're going to be bringing some new programs into the vocational school.

2131
02:46:09,448 --> 02:46:13,330
in the very near future, and I'm not so sure.

2132
02:46:13,350 --> 02:46:18,092
I just haven't heard what you're saying, and I'm sure there is probably some truth to it.

2133
02:46:18,152 --> 02:46:20,093
Somewhere in the middle, there's something going on.

2134
02:46:20,633 --> 02:46:24,335
But I really believe that this is a school committee issue, Mr. President.

2135
02:46:24,855 --> 02:46:33,120
We have school committee members that do a great job getting into that budget during the budget process, so I will not be supporting this.

2136
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:37,882
Just for the mere reason that this is a school committee issue, as far as I'm concerned,

2137
02:46:38,504 --> 02:46:41,345
And I respect the budget that they put together.

2138
02:46:42,385 --> 02:46:49,728
And in most of these positions, too, are subject to some sort of collective bargaining agreement, I would think.

2139
02:46:51,909 --> 02:46:55,410
There's very few employees that are at will employees.

2140
02:46:55,450 --> 02:47:03,153
I know there's some confidential secretaries, but most of the people are in the administrator's union or the teacher's association.

2141
02:47:03,777 --> 02:47:05,698
So that's the majority of the staff.

2142
02:47:05,738 --> 02:47:09,261
And then the rest is the nurses and the paraprofessionals, things like that.

2143
02:47:09,741 --> 02:47:12,903
But most of them are under a collective bargaining agreement.

2144
02:47:12,923 --> 02:47:18,187
So for those reasons, I wish the school committee well as they prepare their next budget.

2145
02:47:28,074 --> 02:47:28,754
Michael Ruggiero.

2146
02:47:28,814 --> 02:47:30,215
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

2147
02:47:31,362 --> 02:47:32,663
I agree with Councilor Penta.

2148
02:47:32,923 --> 02:47:42,326
I think that these issues are better served before an up or down vote that's addressed with all the pressure of having a budget.

2149
02:47:42,626 --> 02:47:45,127
If it doesn't get filled, all of those students are in trouble.

2150
02:47:46,267 --> 02:47:59,132
The sooner we talk about these issues and the sooner we, and the more we participate in the budgeting process, whether it's school committee or also city budgeting, I think the better the program will be when it's finally released.

2151
02:47:59,657 --> 02:48:01,558
and the more transparency that will be in the program.

2152
02:48:02,179 --> 02:48:02,459
Thank you.

2153
02:48:03,220 --> 02:48:03,640
Thank you.

2154
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:12,366
So on the motion to sever by the five-fold resolution of Councilor Penta, offered by Councilor Knight.

2155
02:48:13,968 --> 02:48:14,768
All those in favor?

2156
02:48:14,788 --> 02:48:19,352
Madam Vice President.

2157
02:48:19,372 --> 02:48:20,833
Thank you, President De La Rosa.

2158
02:48:20,873 --> 02:48:27,578
I just want to add that I think very well that the school committee did their due diligence and have probably talked about this

2159
02:48:28,591 --> 02:48:35,857
in their own committee meetings a number of times, I think it's just time for us as a council to get the information before the June budget.

2160
02:48:35,957 --> 02:48:42,061
So I agree with Council Penter in respect that we'd like to see this information and be able to deliberate on it.

2161
02:48:42,421 --> 02:48:48,045
But I obviously disagree with regards to the fact that I think the school committee is doing their job.

2162
02:48:48,105 --> 02:48:51,368
And I just wanted to make that clear.

2163
02:48:53,312 --> 02:48:56,975
And if you could just read the motions before we actually vote on them, that would be fine.

2164
02:48:56,995 --> 02:48:57,295
Thank you.

2165
02:48:57,315 --> 02:49:00,478
First, we're going to take a vote to sever or not sever.

2166
02:49:00,558 --> 02:49:02,139
So all those in favor of severing?

2167
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:03,800
Aye.

2168
02:49:04,661 --> 02:49:05,561
All those opposed?

2169
02:49:05,942 --> 02:49:06,242
Opposed.

2170
02:49:07,623 --> 02:49:09,324
The chair is in doubt.

2171
02:49:10,305 --> 02:49:11,686
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

2172
02:49:11,706 --> 02:49:13,748
This is to sever?

2173
02:49:14,388 --> 02:49:15,189
Motion to sever.

2174
02:49:16,650 --> 02:49:17,170
Councilor Camuso?

2175
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,451
Yes.

2176
02:49:18,812 --> 02:49:19,552
Councilor Caviello?

2177
02:49:19,612 --> 02:49:19,752
Yes.

2178
02:49:20,473 --> 02:49:20,993
Councilor Nye?

2179
02:49:21,214 --> 02:49:21,414
Yes.

2180
02:49:22,014 --> 02:49:22,855
Vice President Long and Kern?

2181
02:49:23,347 --> 02:49:27,491
Yes.

2182
02:49:29,032 --> 02:49:29,332
Yes.

2183
02:49:30,033 --> 02:49:34,417
So six in the affirmative to sever with one absent.

2184
02:49:35,337 --> 02:49:38,180
Uh, the, uh, motions will be seven.

2185
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:44,505
So Mr. Clerk, if you would, from a one to five motions and we'll vote on them singularly.

2186
02:49:44,746 --> 02:49:45,166
Okay.

2187
02:49:45,346 --> 02:49:46,147
Well, the first one.

2188
02:49:50,626 --> 02:49:56,529
increase, uh, the names of the individuals and salaries, uh, the people that were hired.

2189
02:49:57,369 --> 02:50:04,113
So on the motion to, for the school, uh, superintendent's office on that motion, counselor Penta.

2190
02:50:04,353 --> 02:50:05,414
Let's be clear about this.

2191
02:50:05,714 --> 02:50:16,519
When we were presented a budget and we were told that the school department had an increase of $2 million, there was nothing presented in the budget as in the entire other part of the budget of the school department budget.

2192
02:50:16,599 --> 02:50:17,980
Each department was broken down.

2193
02:50:18,403 --> 02:50:20,744
with the names and the salaries of each and every individual.

2194
02:50:21,205 --> 02:50:22,926
So this is on and after the fact.

2195
02:50:23,266 --> 02:50:26,828
So this information that's being requested is nowhere to be found in the budget.

2196
02:50:27,228 --> 02:50:32,812
And I think it's our, I think we're entitled to have it as we were getting everything prior to the budget.

2197
02:50:34,613 --> 02:50:37,015
So on that motion, all those in favor.

2198
02:50:37,675 --> 02:50:41,357
Aye.

2199
02:50:41,778 --> 02:50:46,961
So in opposition of councillors Camuso, Knight,

2200
02:50:49,672 --> 02:50:50,433
That's it.

2201
02:50:50,453 --> 02:50:50,793
Very good.

2202
02:50:50,813 --> 02:50:51,854
So the motion passes.

2203
02:50:56,277 --> 02:50:57,538
Number two.

2204
02:51:02,161 --> 02:51:07,505
Listing of all raises.

2205
02:51:12,508 --> 02:51:13,669
A listing of all the raises.

2206
02:51:14,290 --> 02:51:15,310
All those who received raises over the

2207
02:51:18,038 --> 02:51:20,780
over the average of 1-2% within the last 24 months.

2208
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:26,785
So on that motion, all those in favor?

2209
02:51:26,846 --> 02:51:26,906
Aye.

2210
02:51:41,694 --> 02:51:42,635
All those opposed?

2211
02:51:43,415 --> 02:51:45,396
So the motion passes.

2212
02:51:47,057 --> 02:51:49,319
Opposed?

2213
02:51:49,419 --> 02:51:49,979
Opposition.

2214
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:51,400
Number three.

2215
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:58,785
Number three is the front entrance of Medford High School.

2216
02:52:00,846 --> 02:52:01,906
Walkway, is that it?

2217
02:52:01,946 --> 02:52:07,570
Yeah, the front main entrance, the front entrance, you know, an update on this, an update as to, you know, how they intend to fix it, when.

2218
02:52:09,133 --> 02:52:11,074
and how it's gone into such poor repair.

2219
02:52:11,514 --> 02:52:12,794
So all those in favor?

2220
02:52:13,214 --> 02:52:13,334
Aye.

2221
02:52:13,555 --> 02:52:13,675
Aye.

2222
02:52:14,335 --> 02:52:15,075
Those opposed?

2223
02:52:15,955 --> 02:52:16,856
Motion carries.

2224
02:52:17,376 --> 02:52:18,216
Number of?

2225
02:52:18,496 --> 02:52:24,758
Status of the possible merging of the vocational and high school.

2226
02:52:25,939 --> 02:52:27,639
On that motion, all those in favor?

2227
02:52:27,739 --> 02:52:28,800
Excuse me, can you say that again?

2228
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:35,722
The status of the possibility of merger of the high school and vocational technical school.

2229
02:52:36,462 --> 02:52:37,383
All those in favor?

2230
02:52:37,403 --> 02:52:37,463
Aye.

2231
02:52:38,489 --> 02:52:39,409
Those opposed?

2232
02:52:40,309 --> 02:52:41,250
Motion carries.

2233
02:52:41,970 --> 02:52:49,171
And number five was for a joint meeting of the school committee and Medford City Council.

2234
02:52:50,572 --> 02:52:51,632
All those in favor?

2235
02:52:51,652 --> 02:52:52,332
Aye.

2236
02:52:53,852 --> 02:52:54,752
All those opposed?

2237
02:52:54,873 --> 02:52:57,173
Councilor Camuso is recorded in opposition.

2238
02:52:57,673 --> 02:52:58,553
Motion carries.

2239
02:52:58,993 --> 02:52:59,453
If I may?

2240
02:53:00,934 --> 02:53:01,654
Yes, madam.

2241
02:53:02,114 --> 02:53:06,175
This is not on the agenda, but if I may, I meant to put a

2242
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:15,982
motion under suspension, just to notify the city council that the school committee is having a meeting on Thursday night at the high school.

2243
02:53:16,002 --> 02:53:18,803
I believe I can find out more information at 7 p.m.

2244
02:53:18,863 --> 02:53:22,563
with regards to the drug prevention within our schools.

2245
02:53:22,723 --> 02:53:28,625
That's something that city I brought forward in the city council supported seven to nothing a few weeks ago.

2246
02:53:28,645 --> 02:53:33,646
And I want to thank the school committee for going forward and having that meeting.

2247
02:53:33,746 --> 02:53:34,466
So hopefully,

2248
02:53:35,474 --> 02:53:37,315
Anybody that can attend will be there.

2249
02:53:37,335 --> 02:53:44,617
We're going to get some updates with regards to what is in the schools presently and hopefully round table debate the topic.

2250
02:53:44,697 --> 02:53:46,258
So I want to thank the school committee for that.

2251
02:53:46,778 --> 02:53:50,259
And hopefully we're going to get back some ordinance language soon.

2252
02:53:50,439 --> 02:53:53,260
I think it's still on the desk of the solicitor.

2253
02:53:53,860 --> 02:54:00,082
I'm going to check to get an update on that so we can have a committee of the whole on that discussions.

2254
02:54:00,462 --> 02:54:02,063
And then hopefully move approval on that.

2255
02:54:02,223 --> 02:54:02,424
Great.

2256
02:54:02,504 --> 02:54:02,844
Thank you.

2257
02:54:03,064 --> 02:54:04,685
Very good.

2258
02:54:04,966 --> 02:54:06,267
Councilor Camuso.

2259
02:54:17,496 --> 02:54:18,797
Very good.

2260
02:54:20,418 --> 02:54:28,525
That the superintendent of schools update the city council on a police matter that occurred within the school system.

2261
02:54:29,605 --> 02:54:30,046
Possible.

2262
02:54:31,704 --> 02:54:34,466
On 4-28, that would be today?

2263
02:54:36,687 --> 02:54:38,609
April 28th, today.

2264
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:42,211
We have Councilor Knight wishes to be recognized.

2265
02:54:42,291 --> 02:54:43,252
No, that was on from before.

2266
02:54:43,552 --> 02:54:44,433
Thank you very much.

2267
02:54:44,553 --> 02:54:45,754
Councilor Penta.

2268
02:54:46,575 --> 02:54:53,580
Yeah, just reflecting back on what Councilor Langel-Kern alluded to on this Thursday coming up in the high school on the continuation of the drug issue.

2269
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:58,263
Today there was a forum that was held publicly outside here in front of the city hall.

2270
02:54:58,700 --> 02:55:13,363
at three o'clock with some 50 plus individuals as it related to NACAM and the fact that they're still waiting from the police department and the fire department for coming forward and whether they're going to allow or whether they're going to use NACAM.

2271
02:55:13,924 --> 02:55:17,044
Um, the unfortunate part is there's still no response back.

2272
02:55:18,225 --> 02:55:21,125
Supposedly it's a union issue that they're waiting to negotiate.

2273
02:55:21,685 --> 02:55:28,567
Um, you know, there's nine cities and towns around us that haven't, um, what the negotiation entails or includes, I don't know, but,

2274
02:55:29,008 --> 02:55:38,035
We all know from the vigil that took place about a month and a month and a half ago, um, that we were led to believe that by the end of March, um, and this, uh, it was March or April, excuse me.

2275
02:55:38,556 --> 02:55:40,617
It was going to be, um, set in motion.

2276
02:55:40,637 --> 02:55:41,418
Let's put it this way.

2277
02:55:41,818 --> 02:55:49,464
And the gentleman from Armstrong ambulance, the gentleman from Armstrong ambulance informed us that Armstrong ambulance administers that drug.

2278
02:55:49,704 --> 02:55:50,765
No, you're not.

2279
02:55:50,785 --> 02:55:51,346
Let me finish.

2280
02:55:51,546 --> 02:55:55,509
The gentleman from Armstrong ambulance indicated that they have administered it.

2281
02:55:55,867 --> 02:56:09,277
but the surrounding, the nine surrounding cities and towns who have police and fire that likewise administered, sometimes they are there before the Armstrong ambulance, and sometimes they're in a position that no one else is in where they could possibly save someone's life.

2282
02:56:09,717 --> 02:56:23,968
So what the detail and hanging up is, I don't know, but I think we need to get a report back from both the fire department and the police department on just where are we on allowing them to, or allowing them to have NACOM

2283
02:56:24,732 --> 02:56:31,755
on their persons, so to speak, on their property when they're on duty for the purposes of an overdose.

2284
02:56:31,775 --> 02:56:32,755
I guess you can't use that.

2285
02:56:32,795 --> 02:56:34,676
Part of the clarification.

2286
02:56:34,856 --> 02:56:36,217
Thank you for that.

2287
02:56:36,237 --> 02:56:41,659
I just, I did request an update from the chief of police probably the end of last week.

2288
02:56:41,679 --> 02:56:44,020
So if you don't mind, it's very, you know, it's not too long.

2289
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:45,240
He did write back.

2290
02:56:45,280 --> 02:56:49,562
The patrol officers association is in agreement with carrying and utilizing Narcan.

2291
02:56:50,162 --> 02:56:52,563
At this time, I have the policy almost complete.

2292
02:56:53,082 --> 02:56:58,465
I need to identify a medical control physician to sign off on this and provide training.

2293
02:56:59,045 --> 02:57:04,087
I am working with Penny and Armstrong Ambulance to identify the MCP, which is required.

2294
02:57:04,527 --> 02:57:07,809
I recently received 10 free doses from the Middlesex DA.

2295
02:57:08,129 --> 02:57:10,310
Obviously, we will need more and we will get it.

2296
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:11,571
We are very close.

2297
02:57:11,671 --> 02:57:13,532
The union was very agreeable.

2298
02:57:13,712 --> 02:57:16,433
It is the other red tape that has been problematic.

2299
02:57:16,733 --> 02:57:19,334
So the chief of police is working on it.

2300
02:57:19,414 --> 02:57:22,676
I know the overcoming addiction and the city council and the rest of the city

2301
02:57:23,184 --> 02:57:25,387
is hoping that it comes sooner rather than later.

2302
02:57:26,408 --> 02:57:35,519
But at least the chief is being extremely responsive, and it's good that the Patrolmen and Women's Association is agreeable.

2303
02:57:35,539 --> 02:57:37,621
So I thank the chief for that update.

2304
02:57:37,861 --> 02:57:38,362
Councillor Knight.

2305
02:57:39,475 --> 02:57:40,876
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2306
02:57:41,357 --> 02:57:48,001
First of all, I think that the Police Patrolman's Association needs to be commended for being so receptive and willing to take these steps.

2307
02:57:48,461 --> 02:57:49,962
Now, I've said it before and I'll say it again.

2308
02:57:50,463 --> 02:57:53,165
Narcan is certainly something that's important.

2309
02:57:53,245 --> 02:57:54,726
It's important for our first responders to have.

2310
02:57:54,766 --> 02:57:57,368
It's important to keep people alive who are battling with opiate abuse.

2311
02:57:57,948 --> 02:58:00,670
However, Mr. President, narcan is not going to solve the problem.

2312
02:58:01,330 --> 02:58:06,574
And if people are not provided with better access to care and better treatment options here in the community,

2313
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:11,111
We're going to see the same situation over and over again, where history is just going to continue to repeat itself.

2314
02:58:11,671 --> 02:58:17,212
Someone's going to use, someone's going to overdose, someone's going to be administered Narcan, someone's going to survive that overdose.

2315
02:58:17,672 --> 02:58:18,032
Then what?

2316
02:58:18,452 --> 02:58:19,832
The system just starts all over again.

2317
02:58:19,852 --> 02:58:21,873
The cycle just starts all over again, Mr. President.

2318
02:58:21,893 --> 02:58:33,975
So, while I agree that Narcan is a very important component to an overall and comprehensive plan to battling opiate addiction here in our community, I think that one of the major focuses that we really need to make is on treatment and access to it.

2319
02:58:35,815 --> 02:58:36,155
Thank you.

2320
02:58:40,663 --> 02:58:43,064
Motion to go back to the regular order business.

2321
02:58:43,124 --> 02:58:47,705
Councilor Camuso, did you need to be a regular before we go?

2322
02:58:47,725 --> 02:58:52,767
Yes, just real quick on the Narcan and just want to thank Councilor Lungo and Councilor Penta for bringing this up.

2323
02:58:53,748 --> 02:59:00,110
As well as just send another thank you to Janelle Rocco, who was working hard to put this together.

2324
02:59:00,530 --> 02:59:02,050
And also Councilor Penta.

2325
02:59:02,771 --> 02:59:06,232
Councilor Penta was one of the main speakers today at the event out here.

2326
02:59:07,042 --> 02:59:12,265
Many people didn't know what was going on when they seen Councillor Penta in front of City Hall with a bullhorn today.

2327
02:59:12,786 --> 02:59:16,168
Many people were questioning whether it was your announcement for Mayor or not.

2328
02:59:16,768 --> 02:59:21,651
So, with that being said, I want to congratulate the Councillor for partaking in it today.

2329
02:59:22,331 --> 02:59:23,092
Thank you, Councillor.

2330
02:59:23,992 --> 02:59:24,473
The bullhorn.

2331
02:59:24,813 --> 02:59:25,193
The bulls.

2332
02:59:25,713 --> 02:59:31,877
On the motion of Councillor Night to revert, Councillor, Vice-President Leglecurt to revert back to the regular order of business.

2333
02:59:31,937 --> 02:59:32,678
All those in favour?

2334
02:59:32,718 --> 02:59:33,398
All those opposed?

2335
02:59:33,418 --> 02:59:33,438
15-421.

2336
02:59:37,283 --> 02:59:46,648
petition by Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street, number 15, Medford Mass, to give the City Council an introduction to participatory budgeting.

2337
02:59:47,469 --> 02:59:49,390
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

2338
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:51,151
My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

2339
02:59:51,191 --> 02:59:52,592
I live at 15 Canal Street.

2340
02:59:54,533 --> 02:59:57,615
So quite a few things have happened here the past few months.

2341
02:59:58,394 --> 03:00:01,116
There's been a big outrage about the meters.

2342
03:00:03,177 --> 03:00:05,738
Similarly, there was a vigil here in this room.

2343
03:00:05,778 --> 03:00:09,260
There were apparently hundreds of people just last month about the opiate problem.

2344
03:00:11,802 --> 03:00:23,089
While it's really unfortunate what's been happening, there's also some hope that it gives me because I see so many people here in the city coming together in reaction to things that are horrible that are plaguing the city.

2345
03:00:24,293 --> 03:00:31,460
Something that I wonder a lot about is how do we get people to be involved in civic processes when there's nothing that's really plaguing us?

2346
03:00:32,221 --> 03:00:37,166
Like, sometimes I wonder, like, what is the kind of world I would like to live in?

2347
03:00:37,206 --> 03:00:39,208
What is the kind of world that other people would like to live in?

2348
03:00:39,708 --> 03:00:45,754
And it seems to me that the way that our political process goes today is just, in our city at least, we vote once a year.

2349
03:00:46,962 --> 03:00:51,624
And the options are very, they're very slim about, I mean, what we can vote about.

2350
03:00:52,064 --> 03:00:55,865
So I was really happy to find out last year about something called participatory budgeting.

2351
03:00:55,885 --> 03:00:58,426
It started in Brazil in 1989.

2352
03:00:59,606 --> 03:01:02,347
And it's spread to 1,500 countries around the world.

2353
03:01:02,807 --> 03:01:09,990
What it's really about is people, just citizens or residents, being able to vote on where money will be allocated to.

2354
03:01:10,410 --> 03:01:12,531
Now, it's only really a very small amount.

2355
03:01:14,071 --> 03:01:18,375
It's not for operating expenses, more for capital expenses.

2356
03:01:18,716 --> 03:01:22,279
So these are projects that should be implemented within one year.

2357
03:01:22,299 --> 03:01:30,347
And it's also just not excluded to people who have registered through the traditional process.

2358
03:01:30,407 --> 03:01:31,828
It's open to anybody who's a resident.

2359
03:01:32,189 --> 03:01:36,213
So frequently this includes students as well as schools up to sometimes 12 years old.

2360
03:01:36,946 --> 03:01:43,870
Um, I spoke to Michael Marx last year about this, or actually a few months ago, and I wanted to know how the process would go.

2361
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:45,230
And he said I should speak to the mayor.

2362
03:01:45,851 --> 03:01:49,352
But, um, you know, then the mayor announced that he's resigning.

2363
03:01:49,772 --> 03:01:51,974
So I figured that I should speak to Stephanie Burke.

2364
03:01:54,115 --> 03:01:55,335
He's not running for reelection.

2365
03:01:56,396 --> 03:01:57,096
Yes, I'm sorry.

2366
03:01:58,737 --> 03:01:59,157
Excuse me.

2367
03:01:59,177 --> 03:01:59,517
Thank you.

2368
03:01:59,838 --> 03:02:00,598
Thank you for the correction.

2369
03:02:01,225 --> 03:02:04,290
So I was thinking it would be reasonable to speak to Stephanie Burke.

2370
03:02:04,730 --> 03:02:10,298
So I went to her office last year and I figured because she's the budget director and she may be our next mayor.

2371
03:02:11,179 --> 03:02:17,448
But I was told by one of her assistants that she doesn't really do that when I asked to have an appointment with her.

2372
03:02:18,276 --> 03:02:20,617
Um, which is, is, is really unfortunate.

2373
03:02:20,837 --> 03:02:25,440
Um, but, um, yesterday I did speak to one of the budget analysts from Cambridge.

2374
03:02:26,020 --> 03:02:27,881
And we spoke on the telephone for half an hour.

2375
03:02:28,322 --> 03:02:31,903
And she was part in rolling out participatory budgeting in, in Cambridge.

2376
03:02:32,564 --> 03:02:35,085
And she told me just so much about how the process works.

2377
03:02:35,726 --> 03:02:40,048
Um, what they did is one of the city councilors in November recommended that, um,

2378
03:02:40,505 --> 03:02:42,406
They consider participatory budgeting.

2379
03:02:42,746 --> 03:02:48,990
And they did this very intense process of going to the schools and the community centers and taking so many ideas from people.

2380
03:02:49,190 --> 03:02:54,013
They even put this thing on the website where people can say where they want projects to be done.

2381
03:02:54,814 --> 03:02:57,816
And they took input from a lot of people as well as meetings.

2382
03:02:58,196 --> 03:03:02,378
So they started by asking for volunteers to be part of a steering committee that was 22 people.

2383
03:03:03,739 --> 03:03:09,743
And then the steering committee basically had to make certain determinations about all the logistics, like how much it would cost.

2384
03:03:10,370 --> 03:03:19,157
You know, and after they did some of the big main decisions, then they just made determinations.

2385
03:03:19,197 --> 03:03:23,861
They broke them into four budget delegate committees based on what kind of a project was.

2386
03:03:24,462 --> 03:03:30,086
And what they eventually got were 380 submissions from all the different citizens of Cambridge.

2387
03:03:31,828 --> 03:03:36,571
And over months and months of this process and people voting and a lot of input,

2388
03:03:37,697 --> 03:03:41,500
they brought it down to 30, because each committee can say whether or not it's applicable.

2389
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:47,464
Like there's a Parks and Recreations Committee, and then there's a Streets and Sidewalks Committee.

2390
03:03:48,685 --> 03:03:59,713
And so after they brought it down to 30, 30 options for people to vote on out of 380, then it went to the city manager, and they took a look at how much each one of the things would cost.

2391
03:04:00,798 --> 03:04:02,960
and what could actually be done.

2392
03:04:02,980 --> 03:04:09,247
And they also actually have to look at what was already in the city's budget, you know, so that there's no overlap.

2393
03:04:10,528 --> 03:04:16,714
But one of the things that's really wonderful about processes like this is that they increase citizen engagement.

2394
03:04:17,575 --> 03:04:23,121
And time and time again, more people get involved in this process than actually do in voting.

2395
03:04:23,510 --> 03:04:27,153
Now, a lot of that is because these elections are done online.

2396
03:04:28,154 --> 03:04:35,080
And in a city like ours, I don't have any delusions that we'd be able to roll out an election on our city website.

2397
03:04:35,781 --> 03:04:42,307
However, it does bring a lot of people involved in these meetings who had never really ever considered having input.

2398
03:04:43,654 --> 03:04:46,660
about where money should be spent in the city.

2399
03:04:47,441 --> 03:04:54,775
And there is a lot of discussion about things that aren't working in our city, about things that need to be repaired here and here, but a lot of times it's just a sole voice.

2400
03:04:55,669 --> 03:05:02,453
So what's really great about something like this, and in Cambridge's election, there were 2,727 people who voted.

2401
03:05:03,834 --> 03:05:08,276
What's really nice is it really is, it reflects what the community actually wants.

2402
03:05:08,296 --> 03:05:11,398
So if people want to fix the sidewalk, then, you know, that's really resolved.

2403
03:05:11,778 --> 03:05:16,981
One thing I forgot to explain is that there were 20 options, and people were able to vote on their top five.

2404
03:05:19,127 --> 03:05:23,248
What I really, to me, I don't really understand the budget and everything like this.

2405
03:05:23,928 --> 03:05:28,490
And it's not really clear to me about where these decisions are made.

2406
03:05:28,590 --> 03:05:35,511
So what I'm actually looking at, what I really want, is just some input for the city council about what they feel about these ideas.

2407
03:05:38,152 --> 03:05:38,512
Yeah, sure.

2408
03:05:42,713 --> 03:05:44,374
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

2409
03:05:44,414 --> 03:05:46,154
Did you say Cambridge, there was 2,027 that voted?

2410
03:05:49,621 --> 03:05:56,066
You know, 2,727 people voted on 20 different options, and each one could select up to five.

2411
03:05:57,087 --> 03:05:58,528
So there were six winners.

2412
03:05:58,548 --> 03:05:59,448
Go ahead.

2413
03:05:59,548 --> 03:06:00,729
I mean, I think it's a great idea.

2414
03:06:00,789 --> 03:06:10,336
I always say when I get e-mails with regards to maybe a bond that's coming on the table, and I get e-mails, I always respond, thank you for your input to all our citizens.

2415
03:06:10,356 --> 03:06:11,117
Thank you for your input.

2416
03:06:11,137 --> 03:06:17,161
I like to know what the citizens want to see money spent on, or I like to know if they want me to vote, you know.

2417
03:06:17,571 --> 03:06:18,991
up or down and the reasoning why.

2418
03:06:19,091 --> 03:06:21,892
So, I mean, if we could get it done, I think it's a great idea.

2419
03:06:22,472 --> 03:06:24,273
You do need the administration on board.

2420
03:06:24,333 --> 03:06:29,434
You need to be able to put it on the website, like you said, and have online voting.

2421
03:06:29,474 --> 03:06:30,674
I think that's going to be huge.

2422
03:06:30,734 --> 03:06:32,875
And you need the support behind you.

2423
03:06:33,015 --> 03:06:35,035
But I think it's a great idea.

2424
03:06:35,055 --> 03:06:45,018
I also like when the transcript or the local papers do—they sometimes take tallies on projects that

2425
03:06:45,543 --> 03:06:49,085
you know, are on the forefront and try to get, you know, input.

2426
03:06:49,125 --> 03:06:57,429
I know the last time it was, you know, the police station came in at 20% and so on and so forth with regards to what people think is the top priority.

2427
03:06:57,809 --> 03:07:03,952
So I did read that article and I like to see, you know, what the city of Medford wants, what the citizens want.

2428
03:07:03,972 --> 03:07:04,973
So I think it's a great idea.

2429
03:07:04,993 --> 03:07:11,456
Nope, I'm all set.

2430
03:07:14,839 --> 03:07:16,140
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2431
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:19,321
And Matthew, thank you again for coming up this evening and presenting.

2432
03:07:19,341 --> 03:07:24,403
You and I had a brief discussion on this last week, and I looked into it a little bit myself.

2433
03:07:24,503 --> 03:07:31,905
And the way that I look at it is any time that we can engage a greater base of citizenry in our community to participate in government, we're doing a good thing.

2434
03:07:32,566 --> 03:07:34,566
And I think this is, it makes it easy.

2435
03:07:34,846 --> 03:07:39,288
It makes it easy for our elected officials to determine what projects people want to see happen in their community.

2436
03:07:40,213 --> 03:07:44,235
And it also allows us to get a great cross section of our residents.

2437
03:07:44,315 --> 03:07:46,977
So I certainly appreciate the work that Matthew's done.

2438
03:07:47,237 --> 03:07:51,079
I find it unfortunate that he can't get a meeting with the administration to discuss it.

2439
03:07:51,959 --> 03:07:55,781
However, maybe after May 14th, you can call back again and get a meeting with Louise.

2440
03:07:56,762 --> 03:08:00,964
But I question whether or not the city really has the capacity to do it at this time.

2441
03:08:01,024 --> 03:08:06,227
Like you said, the ability to get the election up on the website is something that might be a struggle in itself.

2442
03:08:07,206 --> 03:08:13,550
However, it's certainly an idea that I think that's a good one, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it further with our budget director.

2443
03:08:13,970 --> 03:08:21,895
Mr. President, maybe we can send this paper to the budget director for her response in terms of what her feelings are on it and where she stands on it.

2444
03:08:22,792 --> 03:08:26,894
So on that motion by Councillor Knight, all those in favour?

2445
03:08:27,014 --> 03:08:27,915
Councillor Camuso?

2446
03:08:28,535 --> 03:08:28,875
Thank you.

2447
03:08:28,995 --> 03:08:50,185
And just to refresh everyone's memory, probably within the last month and a half, I had brought forward a proposal and it was, I believe, unanimously supported by the council, but I'm not 100% sure on that, for the mayor to go out and solicit input by using a poll or something like that for data so that we can make decisions based upon data and statistical

2448
03:08:50,587 --> 03:08:52,188
driven decisions.

2449
03:08:52,888 --> 03:09:04,594
So maybe if we can incorporate that into something like this, maybe, because basically you're reaching out to people in the community, but you want to get a good idea of what's important to them.

2450
03:09:04,614 --> 03:09:06,015
And I believe Cambridge just did this.

2451
03:09:06,575 --> 03:09:11,758
And the biggest thing, like you said, was they let the younger kids participate, whether it was a skate park or this.

2452
03:09:12,558 --> 03:09:14,559
And this was within the last few months.

2453
03:09:14,579 --> 03:09:16,660
I remember reading it in the Globe South, I believe it was.

2454
03:09:17,541 --> 03:09:19,742
So it's a pretty interesting concept.

2455
03:09:21,947 --> 03:09:29,348
I was interested when I met with the mayor last year in this idea of polling citizens, residents, to see what their biggest priorities were.

2456
03:09:30,149 --> 03:09:37,110
But he just, based on some of the answers he had to other questions I asked him, he just really didn't seem interested in that.

2457
03:09:38,670 --> 03:09:47,051
One thing that I wanted to explain about the website is how to administer the election is something that I believe would be determined by the steering committee.

2458
03:09:47,891 --> 03:09:50,752
If Medford felt it was within our interest to actually

2459
03:09:51,273 --> 03:09:54,814
can conduct part of the election on a website or none of it on the website.

2460
03:09:54,854 --> 03:10:02,955
Because, I mean, it's all, it's really up to every city how, and I don't think anything like logistics of how it would be put on a website should keep us from considering this idea.

2461
03:10:04,135 --> 03:10:04,455
Thank you.

2462
03:10:04,475 --> 03:10:08,536
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, amended by Councilor Cuso, all those in favor?

2463
03:10:09,416 --> 03:10:10,497
All those opposed?

2464
03:10:10,517 --> 03:10:11,357
The motion passes.

2465
03:10:11,877 --> 03:10:15,777
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

2466
03:10:15,797 --> 03:10:18,518
15-335, this is a report on the Committee of the Whole meeting

2467
03:10:19,383 --> 03:10:20,244
April 22, 2015.

2468
03:10:21,004 --> 03:10:46,677
In attendance, President De La Ruzo, Vice President Longo Kern, Councilors Marks, Knight, Caraviello, Lauren DiLorenzo, Director of Community Development, Chief Leo Sacco, Police Department, Felix Blackburn, Traffic Commission, Ron Nash, Republic Parking, Mike Ruggiero, Anthony D'Antonio, Mark Rumley, City Solicitor Louise Miller.

2469
03:10:51,621 --> 03:10:57,783
Procurement today, budget tomorrow, Chris Capri, hairdresser, Andrew Castagnetti, citizen, and Ms.

2470
03:10:57,803 --> 03:10:58,844
Jean Martin, citizen.

2471
03:10:59,344 --> 03:11:08,028
The purpose of the meeting was also to amend this record to show the presence of Councilor Penta.

2472
03:11:08,408 --> 03:11:15,411
The purpose of the meeting is for the traffic commission to update the council on the status of the new parking management enforcement program.

2473
03:11:15,912 --> 03:11:16,912
Request from the committee.

2474
03:11:17,427 --> 03:11:20,808
The mayor's office supplied the committee with revenue analysis to date for the meeting.

2475
03:11:21,228 --> 03:11:38,473
Representative for public parking be prepared to present statistical analysis of the program with regards to enforcement that the traffic commission through their secretary forward to the council, all requests and responses from and to the council, as well as updates regarding the program since its implementation.

2476
03:11:38,894 --> 03:11:43,315
The recommendations that were voted out of committee analysis of the city administration,

2477
03:11:44,085 --> 03:11:48,786
from the city administration that will allow for 15 to 30 minute free parking.

2478
03:11:49,267 --> 03:11:54,868
Two, enforcement through existing signage with existing technology.

2479
03:11:55,368 --> 03:12:05,312
Three, Republican Traffic Commission established a survey data collection program that will outline the successes and faults of the parking program.

2480
03:12:05,932 --> 03:12:11,673
Upon motion by Councilor Knight that the paper be reported or the committee passed, the meeting adjourned at 7.45 p.m.

2481
03:12:14,460 --> 03:12:17,081
On the motion of a council night to accept the paper.

2482
03:12:17,481 --> 03:12:20,562
All those in favor on that motion, council Penta.

2483
03:12:20,622 --> 03:12:23,584
We also received a paper that was requested.

2484
03:12:24,384 --> 03:12:35,528
Um, it goes back to, I think council Caviello's original original request to summer 23rd asking for a report regarding the finances as to what they have taken in, um, for the period of time.

2485
03:12:35,648 --> 03:12:38,610
So for the month of January, February, March, they have taken in $223,964.

2486
03:12:42,860 --> 03:12:47,081
Um, citations issued in January were 1,035 and February was 1,834.

2487
03:12:47,721 --> 03:13:03,186
And in March it was 2,396 expired meters were 41% permitted zones was 19% snow bands is 13% and over time on the meters was 4%.

2488
03:13:04,326 --> 03:13:10,828
The one thing that seems to be very telling here in their description notes, it says changes in the meter enforcement hours.

2489
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:12,000
from 7 a.m.

2490
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:12,801
to 7 p.m.

2491
03:13:13,241 --> 03:13:17,983
to 8 to 6, significantly reduced meter and citation revenue potential.

2492
03:13:19,064 --> 03:13:24,827
And unfortunately, that's okay as far as I'm concerned, because these bounty hunters need to leave this town anyway.

2493
03:13:25,227 --> 03:13:25,867
Chris Cappe.

2494
03:13:26,268 --> 03:13:27,969
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

2495
03:13:28,649 --> 03:13:36,373
I believe that the Committee of the Whole that was represented that Republic was actually the body that made that recommendation to reduce the hours as opposed to the Traffic Commission.

2496
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:38,980
Thank you.

2497
03:13:39,260 --> 03:14:06,485
I believe also, Mr. President, I believe also that, um, Chris Capri, um, who was a hairdresser in Medford square also has in her possession in excess of, I believe over 225 signatures, mostly all method people who come to her shop who are not only opposed to this, but it doesn't serve in the best interest because again, the signage is still yet to be posted, um, as it should be.

2498
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:09,361
We also know that the chief was there.

2499
03:14:10,182 --> 03:14:13,043
Unfortunately, the mayor or his representative was not there.

2500
03:14:13,103 --> 03:14:24,569
Our budget director, who was also a part of this, was in her office during this whole meeting and left the building after this meeting took place when, you know, she was one of the people that orchestrated this whole parking program.

2501
03:14:25,390 --> 03:14:27,291
And this is the problem with this administration.

2502
03:14:28,011 --> 03:14:31,713
They don't want to own up to the things that are taking place in this building that they were a part of.

2503
03:14:32,194 --> 03:14:34,115
Defend it if you want, or not defend it.

2504
03:14:34,375 --> 03:14:36,796
But the fact of the matter is, the purpose of this meeting

2505
03:14:37,230 --> 03:14:45,852
was to have an intelligent discussion, hopefully with the people within the administration that could either make the right decision or correct the decisions that need to be corrected.

2506
03:14:46,532 --> 03:14:49,692
The unfortunate part to all of this, Mr. President, I don't know where we're going.

2507
03:14:50,052 --> 03:14:56,973
I think the council has been pretty adamant, and they've acknowledged, you know, where they want to go as it relates to this.

2508
03:14:57,634 --> 03:15:04,935
And the clue that doesn't seem to — they didn't tell you, and I believe it's — they have 600.

2509
03:15:06,524 --> 03:15:11,747
citations that they had to negate because of the wrongness of the citations being issued.

2510
03:15:12,287 --> 03:15:16,309
Over 600 — that's 200 a month, if you average it out.

2511
03:15:16,990 --> 03:15:18,390
That's a phenomenal amount.

2512
03:15:19,071 --> 03:15:25,594
And I believe, also, Mr. Nash acknowledged at the time when I asked him the question, they were supposed to have a job fair, and they didn't have no job fair.

2513
03:15:25,854 --> 03:15:28,876
They were supposed to advertise over the Internet, and they didn't advertise over the Internet.

2514
03:15:29,136 --> 03:15:31,017
They were supposed to publicly advertise, and they did.

2515
03:15:31,037 --> 03:15:32,258
The only thing they did was advertise

2516
03:15:32,708 --> 03:15:33,889
and the local press.

2517
03:15:34,490 --> 03:15:47,140
So that was amongst other major breaches to this contract that relates to Republican, the city of Medford, for which the council voted five to two, two weeks ago to have them time for them to leave the city.

2518
03:15:47,621 --> 03:15:52,105
And I, and I, and I stick by that, Mr. President, it's time for them to leave the city.

2519
03:15:52,545 --> 03:16:00,752
They're serving no purpose, but to cause aggravation and concern here, the bounty hunters coming in here, sucking off the taxpayers of this city,

2520
03:16:01,203 --> 03:16:06,987
to make a 68 to 70% profit on the returns, leaving the city with a diddly amount of money.

2521
03:16:07,447 --> 03:16:09,449
On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

2522
03:16:11,130 --> 03:16:15,954
The committee report as amended to show Councilor Penta's presence.

2523
03:16:16,354 --> 03:16:17,054
All those opposed?

2524
03:16:17,134 --> 03:16:17,835
Motion carries.

2525
03:16:19,796 --> 03:16:21,017
Paper in the hand of the clerk.

2526
03:16:21,137 --> 03:16:30,544
Be it resolved that the Manifest City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Rayanne Conway on a recent passing offered by Councilor Knight

2527
03:16:32,648 --> 03:16:34,029
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2528
03:16:34,650 --> 03:16:39,733
Rayanne Conway Forbes, assistant coach of our girls hockey team, recently lost her mother.

2529
03:16:40,394 --> 03:16:41,734
And Rayanne's a great person.

2530
03:16:42,015 --> 03:16:46,798
She's been certainly traumatized by this loss, and her mother will be sadly missed.

2531
03:16:47,418 --> 03:16:50,821
I offer my condolences to the family, and I ask the council to join me in doing such.

2532
03:16:51,461 --> 03:16:52,022
Great family.

2533
03:16:52,382 --> 03:16:53,683
Please stand for a moment of silence.

2534
03:17:07,495 --> 03:17:12,096
Offered under suspension, 15-424 offered by Councilor Penta.

2535
03:17:12,616 --> 03:17:26,380
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record supporting H2847, a bill sponsored by State Representative Ruth Balzer, entitled An Act to Support Community Access Television.

2536
03:17:26,740 --> 03:17:27,920
Councilor Penta.

2537
03:17:27,960 --> 03:17:31,361
Madam President, Ruth Balzer is a State Representative from Newton.

2538
03:17:32,361 --> 03:17:36,062
And she filed this bill after consulting with other local

2539
03:17:36,944 --> 03:17:39,166
folks and communities as it relates to local access.

2540
03:17:39,506 --> 03:17:46,572
The bill requires that any monies received by municipalities for PEG access cable television be distributed to PEG access cable television.

2541
03:17:47,373 --> 03:17:47,733
That's it.

2542
03:17:48,153 --> 03:17:54,318
If a municipality fails to forward the funds, then it must provide an accounting, and the accounting has to go public.

2543
03:17:54,539 --> 03:18:00,223
The bill requires cable TV providers to locate PEG channels in close proximity to broadcast channels.

2544
03:18:00,724 --> 03:18:04,727
It requires cable TV providers to provide PEG channels with access

2545
03:18:05,278 --> 03:18:06,959
high-definition or other technology.

2546
03:18:07,079 --> 03:18:12,342
It also requires cable TV providers to provide proper mapping of channels.

2547
03:18:12,802 --> 03:18:27,350
Now, this seems to be kind of interesting, because last week, as you know, I introduced some information disclosed by a group of individuals, legally chartered, called Stop the Cap.

2548
03:18:27,970 --> 03:18:30,411
And Stop the Cap is a group of people throughout the country.

2549
03:18:30,931 --> 03:18:31,192
It's a

2550
03:18:32,623 --> 03:18:42,166
Broadband Comcast, it's a broadband watchdog group promoting better broadband, it fights data caps, usage-based billing, and other internet overcharging schemes.

2551
03:18:42,666 --> 03:18:46,407
That for which Comcast is presently doing here in the city of Medford.

2552
03:18:46,427 --> 03:18:57,091
As a matter of fact, Comcast, if you read it now in the Better Business Bureau, is now being regarded as one of the worst corporations in this country for the purposes of public service and for its charges.

2553
03:18:57,851 --> 03:19:00,492
Two weeks ago, I believe, we introduced before the council

2554
03:19:01,094 --> 03:19:10,960
our State's Attorney General going after the community of Lynn for their misappropriation of money, lack of keeping proper records and minutes, and a host of other issues.

2555
03:19:11,620 --> 03:19:27,569
Most recently, as of April 26, the city of Lynn now has asked for a receiver to go in and take over the channel the public access chase in following months of turmoil and alleged financial breaches that have triggered lawsuits and the arrest of the husband on the board

2556
03:19:28,113 --> 03:19:37,637
and a description of the use of the monies that have gone to people working there and the misuse of salaries coming out of the funding from the local access station.

2557
03:19:38,457 --> 03:19:46,160
Similar, quite similar to that for which is taking place here in the city of Medford, for which the mayor has been not only dilatory, but he has failed.

2558
03:19:46,680 --> 03:19:53,243
He has failed in recognizing that the sham of a filing of a dissolution

2559
03:19:53,792 --> 03:20:03,059
by the Channel 3 board back in, I think it was October or September of 2013, has never been completed, has never taken place.

2560
03:20:03,459 --> 03:20:11,285
And as a result of that, what we have here is a combination of now coming up next Thursday, an ascertainment hearing.

2561
03:20:11,766 --> 03:20:21,073
Two weeks ago, last week, this council, I asked this council to vote to change, to make the, change the meeting from 2 in the afternoon to 6, 630 at night, because who the heck can go

2562
03:20:21,585 --> 03:20:22,766
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

2563
03:20:23,246 --> 03:20:27,808
The mayor re-advertises the hearing for next Thursday to be held at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

2564
03:20:28,208 --> 03:20:30,269
So nothing has been accomplished as it comes to that.

2565
03:20:30,850 --> 03:20:47,038
But the fact of the matter is, in Somerset, in another locality, like I said, in Belmont, in Somerset, having these ascertainment hearings, these ascertainment hearings are done in advance, well in advance, before the renewal of a contract takes place with the cable provider.

2566
03:20:47,697 --> 03:20:50,659
We are operating here in the city of Medford with no contract.

2567
03:20:50,699 --> 03:20:55,502
We have no contract right now because the contract time has come and ended as of April 20th.

2568
03:20:55,822 --> 03:20:59,825
And with that being ended yet, we're having an ascertainment hearing well after the fact.

2569
03:20:59,885 --> 03:21:03,047
So Comcast is nothing more than a tenant at will, so to speak.

2570
03:21:03,507 --> 03:21:12,072
The unfortunate part about all of this is when we were led to believe that for whether we agreed or disagreed, public access was going to find its new home up at the high school.

2571
03:21:12,713 --> 03:21:16,095
Come to find out that the new home at the high school, for whatever it might be worth,

2572
03:21:16,553 --> 03:21:18,113
everything has now been put on hold.

2573
03:21:18,653 --> 03:21:30,696
So the monies that allegedly are sitting in the coffers at City Hall in excess of $300,000 that ratepayers have paid to access is now not going to be used for a facility up at the high school, number one.

2574
03:21:31,096 --> 03:21:41,038
Number two, the mayor is now not going forward with the public access station for the purposes of saying, you know, we're going to have public access here in the city.

2575
03:21:41,458 --> 03:21:43,879
This would make two elections in a row that this mayor

2576
03:21:44,218 --> 03:21:54,762
has intentionally denied the taxpayers of this community and people who might be running for office the ability to be on public access and to tell your story for whatever it might be.

2577
03:21:55,022 --> 03:22:03,305
And it's also denying taxpayers and rate payers in this community the use of public access for educational and social purposes, because that's what public access is all about.

2578
03:22:04,126 --> 03:22:12,269
Now, when Comcast went before, and I think it was this past week, Comcast was denied its merger with Time Warner by the Federal Trading Commission.

2579
03:22:12,602 --> 03:22:17,544
because they felt there was too much of a conglomerate, that they would have too much of a control taking place.

2580
03:22:18,164 --> 03:22:24,807
But the mayor was one of 52 mayors in this country that signed the letter supporting Comcast.

2581
03:22:25,387 --> 03:22:37,112
And in the commentary in the Broadband News Journal, the mayor and the 51 other mayors were considered to be shills, shills for Comcast to have this go forward.

2582
03:22:37,432 --> 03:22:41,814
And they have a delineated description of what these mayors got as perks

2583
03:22:42,167 --> 03:22:42,968
particular parks.

2584
03:22:43,348 --> 03:22:54,194
From the best of knowledge that we have right now, the mayor got on an annual basis $2,500 for his golf tournament, and he got an annual $10,000 a year for his lights and whatever he wants to do in the city.

2585
03:22:54,735 --> 03:22:56,476
No other ratepayer gets that privilege.

2586
03:22:56,836 --> 03:23:05,902
They don't get these privileges when they buy their Comcast privilege, or their Comcast, you know, whatever you call it.

2587
03:23:07,013 --> 03:23:09,137
Internet service or whatever it might be.

2588
03:23:10,859 --> 03:23:13,063
Why should the mayor get this personal park for himself?

2589
03:23:13,524 --> 03:23:36,117
for signing a 10-year contract, a 10-year contract, that now, if you go into it and reading about all the advances that are out there and all the technology that's waiting to be served, Apple started with it, Amazon is into it, and there's a whole host of other ones that are telling you, not only through streaming, but through the way that they can bring cable television into the communities.

2590
03:23:36,717 --> 03:23:39,559
We don't need another 10-year contract getting ourselves locked in.

2591
03:23:40,019 --> 03:23:41,160
And the fact of the matter is,

2592
03:23:41,855 --> 03:23:46,760
It's the upstreaming of the rates that we're going to be saddled with for another 10 years.

2593
03:23:47,201 --> 03:23:51,485
It's bad enough you got a 10-year contract that was renegotiated for the waste management.

2594
03:23:51,705 --> 03:23:55,970
You got a 10-year contract that was negotiated for this stupid republic from Tennessee.

2595
03:23:56,288 --> 03:23:58,729
And now we're looking at possibly another 10-year contract.

2596
03:23:59,009 --> 03:24:01,649
And I would hope that this mayor does not sign this contract.

2597
03:24:02,230 --> 03:24:03,990
He is going out of business.

2598
03:24:04,230 --> 03:24:05,270
He is retiring.

2599
03:24:05,330 --> 03:24:06,411
He is no longer the mayor.

2600
03:24:06,791 --> 03:24:15,433
The same way he is holding off hiring a public works director and letting a new person come in, he should likewise do the same thing on this particular issue.

2601
03:24:15,975 --> 03:24:18,877
This ascertainment hearing is nothing more than a dog and pony show.

2602
03:24:19,257 --> 03:24:23,259
It's just a sham because the fact of the matter is there is no public access.

2603
03:24:23,739 --> 03:24:38,307
The public access that was recommended by his three-member committee was to have a local front door place where people could actually see it, not to be putting it up in the wildernesses up at the high school where at nighttime when it's dark, you go into the back of the building.

2604
03:24:38,827 --> 03:24:41,068
And now God knows what's going on up at the high school.

2605
03:24:41,088 --> 03:24:44,250
Like I said, I hope we get this answer back if there is some kind of

2606
03:24:45,483 --> 03:24:52,626
Something going on, that there's some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school, and this isn't even going to be a part of it, I don't know.

2607
03:24:53,066 --> 03:24:56,288
But the fact of the matter is that needs to be discussed, as we know, as a separate issue.

2608
03:24:56,888 --> 03:25:12,494
But Representative Bowser, I would hope that she gets in touch with Representative Gobley, and Donato, and Christine Barber, and also Senator Jalen.

2609
03:25:13,520 --> 03:25:14,821
and seek their support for this.

2610
03:25:15,481 --> 03:25:19,003
Public access is on the throes of being challenged throughout the country.

2611
03:25:19,443 --> 03:25:30,269
There's 1,800 locations throughout the country right now that Comcast and Verizon are challenging whether to accept them or not because they feel it's a cost demand upon them.

2612
03:25:31,410 --> 03:25:34,311
They're not realizing what the value that public access has.

2613
03:25:34,872 --> 03:25:40,595
The unfortunate part that we have a 5% charge here, this city has a 5%

2614
03:25:41,585 --> 03:25:43,625
inclusion in Comcast payments.

2615
03:25:44,366 --> 03:25:58,648
Three percent goes to the city's general funds, one percent goes to public access, and the other one goes to the high school for educational, and the other one goes to the police department, which is the old Channel 16, which is now, I think it's what, Channel 22.

2616
03:25:59,629 --> 03:26:01,129
Maybe the review needs to take place.

2617
03:26:01,549 --> 03:26:02,649
Get rid of the three percent.

2618
03:26:03,009 --> 03:26:04,109
Keep your public access.

2619
03:26:04,530 --> 03:26:06,930
Give a chance to have the rate payers have a reduction.

2620
03:26:07,357 --> 03:26:10,998
and absolutely give no perks to any one individual that signs this contract.

2621
03:26:11,338 --> 03:26:24,102
I don't see any one councilor over here getting a perk, getting a perk as the mayor has for his years of serving with Comcast and the perks that he gets maybe with waste management, I don't know.

2622
03:26:24,542 --> 03:26:34,565
But I know that there is a $5,000 inclusion in the waste management contract that the mayor has to use at his leisure at any part of the city for whatever he wants to do.

2623
03:26:35,068 --> 03:26:43,950
He's only signing that contract because he's supposed to be looking out for the best interest of this community, not for the best interest of him or her or whoever it might be in the future.

2624
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:45,750
That's what these contracts offer.

2625
03:26:46,090 --> 03:26:50,451
These are the inducements that these big guys come in and offer for whatever it might be.

2626
03:26:50,891 --> 03:26:55,551
I would hope next week, when we have the ascertainment hearing, folks do come.

2627
03:26:55,952 --> 03:26:58,732
Unfortunately, it's going to be next Thursday, the 7th.

2628
03:26:58,772 --> 03:27:00,652
I believe it's going to be 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

2629
03:27:01,112 --> 03:27:04,693
And my recommendation is to make the issuing authority the Memphis City Council.

2630
03:27:05,166 --> 03:27:23,737
not the chief executive, because the Memphis City Council hears the pulse of the people, they can understand what's going on, and there is a rationale of reason that can take place without having the singular person, he or she, make that singular decision on behalf of 18,000 ratepayers between Comcast and Verizon.

2631
03:27:26,498 --> 03:27:27,939
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2632
03:27:27,979 --> 03:27:29,420
That was quite a presentation.

2633
03:27:29,640 --> 03:27:34,723
And as I sit back and I look at House Bill 2847, I see that half of that stuff that

2634
03:27:34,999 --> 03:27:37,381
was just discussed will not be addressed by this piece of legislation.

2635
03:27:39,142 --> 03:27:46,708
I'm very cautiously optimistic about moving forward in support of this legislation, Mr. President, reason being that the paper was just assigned to committee recently.

2636
03:27:47,189 --> 03:27:48,250
No committee hearing has been held.

2637
03:27:48,610 --> 03:27:54,455
And if we take a look at the first item on our agenda this evening, we'll see that it came in one way but came out with six different amendments to it.

2638
03:27:54,935 --> 03:27:59,339
So I'd be very cautious in this body's deliberations in moving forward on this.

2639
03:27:59,399 --> 03:28:03,562
I think it may be in the best interest of this body to wait until the committee reports out a paper favorably.

2640
03:28:04,007 --> 03:28:06,169
before we decide to take a position one way or the other on it.

2641
03:28:06,550 --> 03:28:09,193
The reason I say that is because we don't know what it's going to look like when it comes out.

2642
03:28:13,217 --> 03:28:13,958
Thank you.

2643
03:28:14,038 --> 03:28:22,507
We're in receipt of a paper this evening from the city solicitor who basically says that the mayor is the only, it happens to be on the parking question we asked.

2644
03:28:23,022 --> 03:28:40,752
But it basically says that all contracts involved in the amount of $5,000 or more shall be in writing and no such contract shall be deemed to have been made or executed until the approval of the mayor under plan A. So clearly this is a function of the mayor and him being the issuing authority.

2645
03:28:41,252 --> 03:28:47,155
With that being said, I think we have to find out where the city is going as far as the public access component.

2646
03:28:47,632 --> 03:28:54,395
Because if it's going up at the high school, I think people have to, I would be very cognizant of the fact that we have to have people quarry cleared.

2647
03:28:54,956 --> 03:29:02,800
So that to make sure if they're in the same areas and buildings as youngsters in our community, that we want to make sure that the proper

2648
03:29:04,335 --> 03:29:07,657
People are vetted for that, for less of a better word.

2649
03:29:08,538 --> 03:29:10,159
I really don't know much about this bill.

2650
03:29:10,659 --> 03:29:13,541
This is something that was put on under suspension this evening.

2651
03:29:14,322 --> 03:29:17,284
I don't even recognize any of the names of the people that signed on to this.

2652
03:29:18,605 --> 03:29:33,595
If I saw a name like Donato or Garbally or some of the other reps or senators that I'm familiar with and are familiar with some of their policies, I would be a little bit easier to at least support it this evening in its infancy stages.

2653
03:29:34,153 --> 03:29:40,958
But for those reasons, I don't think we should be taking a vote on this at this particular point, not knowing where it's going.

2654
03:29:41,898 --> 03:29:43,099
Councilor Longo-Kern.

2655
03:29:43,620 --> 03:29:43,940
Thank you.

2656
03:29:44,120 --> 03:29:45,961
Briefly, thank you, President De La Rosa.

2657
03:29:46,081 --> 03:29:52,145
I just would like at least a week just to digest it, read the legislation, and get some questions answered.

2658
03:29:52,906 --> 03:29:57,049
It's almost 11 o'clock at night, so I just want to read the language over the week.

2659
03:29:57,889 --> 03:29:58,490
That would just be my request.

2660
03:29:58,510 --> 03:30:01,232
So we have a motion for approval by Councilor Penter on the floor.

2661
03:30:03,165 --> 03:30:04,625
Lay the table, if you want to do it.

2662
03:30:04,685 --> 03:30:07,686
Well, let the citizen speak, and then I'll move to lay it on the table.

2663
03:30:09,527 --> 03:30:11,267
So we have a motion to lay it on the table.

2664
03:30:12,488 --> 03:30:12,668
Sir.

2665
03:30:13,388 --> 03:30:13,788
Good evening.

2666
03:30:13,808 --> 03:30:16,409
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

2667
03:30:17,109 --> 03:30:24,951
Yesterday in Springfield, this document was the first thing that attendees of the Mass Access Conference received.

2668
03:30:24,991 --> 03:30:26,872
160 mile trip from here, round trip.

2669
03:30:27,652 --> 03:30:30,673
And the networking was great yesterday because

2670
03:30:31,103 --> 03:30:36,585
You had access people from all over the Commonwealth converging on the Basketball Hall of Fame out in Springfield.

2671
03:30:37,225 --> 03:30:42,707
Now, consider the bill a guideline that people want public access.

2672
03:30:43,027 --> 03:30:49,369
So, let it go through committee and all that, but right now, take a look at it and see what it says and see how it applies to Medford.

2673
03:30:49,749 --> 03:30:55,231
So, forget that it's a bill going through the Statehouse and look at it as a guideline for Medford, which has no public access.

2674
03:30:56,552 --> 03:31:00,133
At the conference yesterday, I looked at the vendors and I spoke to all of them.

2675
03:31:01,414 --> 03:31:03,035
There is new technology.

2676
03:31:03,115 --> 03:31:08,218
For example, we could put this $11,000 unit, two of them, at each head end.

2677
03:31:09,578 --> 03:31:19,423
And what happens is you can now put the programming over the cellular devices to broadcast or cable cast on Channel 3 and on the Verizon channel.

2678
03:31:19,664 --> 03:31:29,969
So this means that Verizon doesn't have to lay down an expensive material if, in fact, they have to change anything that's up there since the days of TV3 two or three years ago.

2679
03:31:32,647 --> 03:31:34,108
I'm going to give everyone a quick timeline.

2680
03:31:34,128 --> 03:31:40,790
I know it's late and I want everyone to go home, but July 24th, the city solicitor said he would look at TV three, November 20th.

2681
03:31:41,190 --> 03:31:45,071
I put in the public records request for the comp cast December 18th.

2682
03:31:45,872 --> 03:31:52,854
The comp is the resolution that we're looking at, whether or not the council should support house bill 2847 or am I missing something?

2683
03:31:56,215 --> 03:31:57,256
I am staying on topic, sir.

2684
03:31:57,276 --> 03:32:00,397
I'm giving the lead up to this whole bill and how I obtained it.

2685
03:32:01,897 --> 03:32:03,037
And it's very important.

2686
03:32:03,057 --> 03:32:08,259
And if these two councils want to just harangue me every week, it shows why people aren't going to come to the council anymore.

2687
03:32:08,339 --> 03:32:09,219
I was trying to be brief.

2688
03:32:09,700 --> 03:32:10,500
I was concluding.

2689
03:32:11,380 --> 03:32:13,541
And one of these councils, again, harasses me.

2690
03:32:13,581 --> 03:32:14,581
I'm a man over 60.

2691
03:32:15,041 --> 03:32:18,062
Mass General Law says you can't harass a man over 60, but they ignore it.

2692
03:32:18,943 --> 03:32:23,344
Very quickly, December 18th, Comcast media contract arrived at City Hall.

2693
03:32:23,384 --> 03:32:25,405
December 19th, the mayor had his press conference.

2694
03:32:26,365 --> 03:32:31,727
And this week, we find out, through the Office of Procurement, the mayor has now put her on hold.

2695
03:32:33,055 --> 03:32:40,077
Okay, I had a lot more to say, but I want the good people on the city council, the three good people on the city council to get home early.

2696
03:32:40,157 --> 03:32:43,519
Everyone else tearing up the resolution and being obnoxious, go back to.

2697
03:32:55,162 --> 03:32:59,584
That I put forward to find out about where we're going with access and the Corey piece.

2698
03:33:00,944 --> 03:33:02,565
Want to make sure that everyone's Corey clear.

2699
03:33:05,862 --> 03:33:10,545
On the motion, the legislation, I think, is very succinct where it gets to the second page.

2700
03:33:10,565 --> 03:33:30,396
It basically says, whereas residents across the Commonwealth wish to keep in touch with their local government by viewing their city council or selectmen meetings, school committee and other commission meetings, chamber events, high school sports, regional and statewide legislative affairs shows, groundbreaking ceremonies, retirement dinners, dance recitals, school plays, and much more.

2701
03:33:30,556 --> 03:33:33,178
And whereas the culture and definition surrounding

2702
03:33:34,100 --> 03:33:41,746
Cable television is changing rapidly, and community media is only supported through the cable television franchise agreements.

2703
03:33:42,187 --> 03:33:46,350
That's in essence what this is, whether it's amended up or down.

2704
03:33:47,491 --> 03:33:48,913
Wait a minute, can you let me finish?

2705
03:33:49,533 --> 03:33:50,674
What, are you in a rush to go home?

2706
03:33:51,355 --> 03:33:53,157
For God's sakes, just slow down.

2707
03:33:54,437 --> 03:33:57,238
This is part of the thing before we have our motion to table.

2708
03:33:58,159 --> 03:33:59,199
It's a motion.

2709
03:33:59,299 --> 03:34:02,841
You know, you guys are really a class act.

2710
03:34:02,881 --> 03:34:04,362
You know, people want to talk.

2711
03:34:05,022 --> 03:34:06,063
Just let us talk.

2712
03:34:06,103 --> 03:34:08,083
If you don't want to vote, you don't have to vote on it.

2713
03:34:09,124 --> 03:34:10,485
Just cool your jets, will you?

2714
03:34:11,785 --> 03:34:13,546
This is what the legislation is about.

2715
03:34:13,566 --> 03:34:17,948
This is just a scenario.

2716
03:34:18,008 --> 03:34:19,029
This is the gut of it.

2717
03:34:19,369 --> 03:34:23,851
If they want to amend it, if they don't want to amend it, add or subtract or go right ahead.

2718
03:34:24,319 --> 03:34:31,581
There's nine people already on, that's why I said, hopefully our local legislative body and our state senator will jump on board with this.

2719
03:34:32,181 --> 03:34:34,522
They are the ones that have been talking about public access.

2720
03:34:34,862 --> 03:34:41,003
Here's a perfect example for them to be part of it, and I respect Councilor Lengel's concern to lay it on the table.

2721
03:34:41,043 --> 03:34:41,943
I got no problem with that.

2722
03:34:42,423 --> 03:34:45,364
But, you know, just listen it out, that's all.

2723
03:34:45,964 --> 03:34:52,346
Just because it's late, that's what your job, that's what we're getting paid $25,000 a year to meet once a week for, okay?

2724
03:34:54,160 --> 03:34:57,361
Just be a little courteous to your colleagues, all right, Councilor Del Rosso?

2725
03:34:58,981 --> 03:35:00,302
And to you, too, Councilor Knight.

2726
03:35:01,042 --> 03:35:03,523
On the motion to table, all those in favor?

2727
03:35:04,043 --> 03:35:04,683
All those opposed?

2728
03:35:04,703 --> 03:35:05,543
Motion is tabled.

2729
03:35:05,603 --> 03:35:07,584
The records of the last regular meeting.

2730
03:35:07,664 --> 03:35:08,324
Councilor Knight?

2731
03:35:09,904 --> 03:35:19,187
Mr. President, I find it very interesting how a resolution that starts out as talking about a piece of legislation in the House of Representatives that has yet to have been even heard by their committee would turn into this.

2732
03:35:20,096 --> 03:35:22,578
And I really feel as though it's been laid on the table.

2733
03:35:22,618 --> 03:35:23,038
Now, here we go.

2734
03:35:23,059 --> 03:35:26,341
We're going to follow the rules or not, but it's been laid on the table.

2735
03:35:27,162 --> 03:35:27,362
Yes.

2736
03:35:27,422 --> 03:35:28,503
A little bit.

2737
03:35:28,763 --> 03:35:30,064
We don't never get stopped.

2738
03:35:30,104 --> 03:35:32,186
I don't understand this.

2739
03:35:32,246 --> 03:35:33,747
I really don't understand.

2740
03:35:33,767 --> 03:35:36,690
City council will pass to councilor Penta counselor.

2741
03:35:37,110 --> 03:35:38,091
Do you have a motion?

2742
03:35:38,471 --> 03:35:38,871
Yes, I do.

2743
03:35:38,911 --> 03:35:40,893
There's one correction that needs to take place.

2744
03:35:45,276 --> 03:35:47,218
It's on paper 15 three 95.

2745
03:35:47,258 --> 03:35:48,879
The word kiosk should be plural wise.

2746
03:35:48,919 --> 03:35:49,560
It's kiosk.

2747
03:35:50,152 --> 03:35:53,175
Should be an S. You have it as singular.

2748
03:35:53,195 --> 03:35:55,497
Yeah, pluralized.

2749
03:35:55,537 --> 03:35:58,340
Pluralize the word kiosk.

2750
03:35:58,400 --> 03:35:59,461
No, it's plural.

2751
03:36:03,324 --> 03:36:06,207
And now a motion to approve once they're collected, corrected?

2752
03:36:06,707 --> 03:36:06,928
Yes.

2753
03:36:08,029 --> 03:36:10,011
On that motion, all those in favor, all those opposed?

2754
03:36:10,671 --> 03:36:12,273
Motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn.
