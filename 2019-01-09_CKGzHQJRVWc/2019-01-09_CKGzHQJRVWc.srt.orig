[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, OK.

36
00:13:54,672 --> 00:14:00,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to say Happy New Year, and I put a copy of the report in everybody's packets.

37
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:22,391
[SPEAKER_15]: and there was a couple of invoices that I signed for that were related to heating, so I wanted to share that information with you because our last meeting, we had some concerns and we had somebody from community here speaking about the heating, and so I guess there's still some ongoing invoices that haven't been signed for yet that will be coming up over the next several weeks.

38
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:30,334
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them was signed for this particular session was Gone Green Electric, and the work was done at Medford High School,

39
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:35,308
[SPEAKER_15]: There was an issue with the air handling unit in the gym, and it had to be repaired.

40
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:42,856
[SPEAKER_15]: The technician troubleshooted the air handler, rewired the motor, and it confirmed with John McLaughlin that he is now working in the gym.

41
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,939
[SPEAKER_15]: There were two invoices for E&E Systems.

42
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,403
[SPEAKER_15]: The technician found that there was some issues with the hot water coil.

43
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,404
[SPEAKER_15]: It was bypassed.

44
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:57,012
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, it was just interfering with the heating, pretty much, it's really technical.

45
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:18,407
[SPEAKER_15]: So Annie actually did the work and it was, this is going to service the B building, second floor, and the air handler operates along with the pneumonic controller heat exchanger to provide air and airflow to the B building, second floor.

46
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to thank John McLaughlin,

47
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:25,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I reached out to him to ask him some questions about these invoices.

48
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:26,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it.

49
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:28,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

50
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:31,760
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor for approval of the secretary's report.

51
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

52
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:34,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

53
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:35,604
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

54
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:36,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

55
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:37,085
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

57
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:41,950

58
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,812
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could enter him into the records, please.

59
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:45,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Report of committees.

60
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:50,465
[SPEAKER_15]: We just want to take something out of order, Mayor Burke.

61
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the next couple.

62
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:54,468
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be great.

63
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:55,449

00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearing and seeing none.

67
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

68
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz, motion?

69
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

70
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:16,085
[SPEAKER_15]: We would like to move the resolution that's at the very end, and it's the resolution for the MassDOT Safe Routes to School application for the Roberts Elementary School.

71
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,687
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to take the paper out of order.

72
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:21,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second on the floor to take it out of order?

73
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to include all those in favor.

74
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:23,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

75
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,470
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

76
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,990
[SPEAKER_11]: The paper is

77
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Right before us, school committee resolution.

78
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:37,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee hereby approve a letter of support for pedestrian improvements near the Roberts Elementary School, Walk Medford, through the MassDOT Safe Routes to School grant.

79
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:41,644
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor to approve.

80
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,547
[SPEAKER_11]: As we know, parents, I believe, is there a parent?

81
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:45,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Sara is here.

82
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:46,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Sara, come on forward.

83
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:47,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Sara McGiven.

84
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Your name and address for the record, please.

85
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:56,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Sarah McGivern, Madison Motion Coordinator, Board of Health, and 63 Watervale Road.

86
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:07,106
[SPEAKER_18]: So as a lot of you know, the Roberts School is applying for the Safe Roads to School Grant to get up to a million dollars of pedestrian improvements within a two-mile radius around the school.

87
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:14,491
[SPEAKER_18]: There'll be, hopefully, two spots on Fells Way and then one on Salem Street at Hadley Place.

88
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Walk Boston did a safety audit as well just a few weeks ago to look at that area as well.

89
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:26,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's getting intense scrutiny for sure.

90
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've been very successful.

91
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,712
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, the Brooks received this grant.

92
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:31,354
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the planning processes.

93
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:34,116
[SPEAKER_11]: MassDOT pretty much takes over the whole process once it's approved.

94
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:35,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've become the leader of it.

95
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:38,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So they are working towards the Brooks School

96
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,185
[SPEAKER_11]: completion as well.

97
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,826
[SPEAKER_11]: But this would be a wonderful thing if we were able to get this grant.

98
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:46,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So the motion is to go on record officially.

99
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,487
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a paper in your packet that is a copy of the letter.

100
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,828
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to circulate it after we take the vote and get signatures on it.

101
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,709
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

102
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,469
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

103
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

104
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote, please.

105
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,230

106
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,590
Yes.

107
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Kretz, yes.

108
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:02,631

109
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:02,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

110
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:03,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

111
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

112
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

113
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:06,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

114
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:06,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Van de Koop.

115
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:07,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

116
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

117
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes and I will sign and circulate.

118
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:14,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

119
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:14,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

120
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:15,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

121
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:19,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Sarah.

122
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:29,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Is a motion on the floor to refer to the regular order of business by Mr. Russo.

123
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

124
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:30,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

125
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:32,827
[SPEAKER_11]: On the second, all in favor?

126
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:33,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

127
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:34,368
[SPEAKER_11]: All opposed?

128
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:35,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

129
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:41,129
[SPEAKER_11]: We are now back on the agenda, which is the superintendent's update and comments.

130
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:42,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Superintendent.

131
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy New Year.

132
00:18:50,851 --> 00:19:00,813
[SPEAKER_12]: While the majority of the past few weeks in metropolitan schools have been, most of us have been on holiday break, many families were assisted by different students

133
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:03,366
[SPEAKER_12]: and groups from our school community.

134
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:15,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And prior, this was an oversight that I did not have an opportunity to mention a little earlier, but it's a highlight that I think is important and worthy of sharing with the team.

135
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:26,921
[SPEAKER_12]: The Lure Club, Glue Glue, at Medford High School, this club was formed from Miss Nyland's French class students.

136
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,503
[SPEAKER_12]: They were motivated by CCSR,

137
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:37,575
[SPEAKER_12]: our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility program to make a difference in the world.

138
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,897
[SPEAKER_12]: With the support of Ms.

139
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:46,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Nyland, the club created Thanksgiving baskets that went to Medford High School families.

140
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:57,770
[SPEAKER_12]: The students collected the foods and donations from peers, teachers, and many businesses in Medford in order to make baskets for homeless families in our schools.

141
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,912
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were able to provide Thanksgiving dinner

142
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:21,623
[SPEAKER_12]: to over 15 Medford High School families, and so we're very proud of the students' accomplishments, and I wanted to say that it was an oversight that I didn't recognize them last time, but I wanted to extend a special thank you to Club Lurgluglu for their work in Miss Nyland's students.

143
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:25,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanted to recognize Nuha Eliazid.

144
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,845
[SPEAKER_12]: She is a CCSR student as well as a sophomore at Medford High School.

145
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:46,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And as part of her project over the holiday break, she conducted a toy drive at the Franciscan Children's Hospital, where over 50 toys were collected and delivered to the hospital, and the hospital was very grateful.

146
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:54,503
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to recognize her for, again, making a difference in the lives of children that are sick and at the hospital.

147
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:55,823
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for that.

148
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:59,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford High School's transitional program.

149
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,325
[SPEAKER_12]: The students and staff

150
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:09,848
[SPEAKER_12]: at Project Transition at Medford High School, hosted a holiday gathering along with Malden High School's transitional program.

151
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And according to Ms.

152
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:21,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Huther, a teacher in the program, our access program, she explained that getting these groups of students together was one of the best social opportunities the students have ever had.

153
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:27,142
[SPEAKER_12]: It provided the students the ability to network outside of their world.

154
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Truly, this is what our program is all about.

155
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:39,156
[SPEAKER_12]: A special thanks to Headmaster Paul DeLeva for his assistance in helping to make it happen for our students at Medford High School and Malden High School.

156
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,517
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were very happy about that event.

157
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:48,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I'd like to acknowledge our Medford High School's AP in Honors Calculus class.

158
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:50,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Prior to vacation,

159
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Dismissal, students in Ms.

160
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:57,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Chen's class completed projects on related rates of change and optimization.

161
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:05,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Students were asked to choose a real-life application problem and then create a three-dimensional physical model.

162
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:11,878
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one way for students to engage in learning as well as deepen their understanding of mathematics.

163
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:19,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Using appropriate materials, students produced shadow boxes for the purpose of communicating the mathematical problem

164
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,760
[SPEAKER_12]: and its calculus solution to the audience.

165
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:28,282
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition to the shadow box, the students had to submit a typed manuscript that described their work.

166
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:34,623
[SPEAKER_12]: On the project due date, students were given opportunities to engage in an evaluation process.

167
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:44,605
[SPEAKER_12]: They spent time looking at one another's projects and graded them based on creativity, clarity, and explanation, and the overall presentation.

168
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,346
[SPEAKER_12]: These presentations are very informative

169
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,820
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are photos that are posted on the blog.

170
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,501
[SPEAKER_12]: So please, if you have an opportunity, go to the blog to look at that work.

171
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:58,623
[SPEAKER_12]: But just excellent work that's happening with our AP and honors calculus students.

172
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:09,047
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanted to say over the last time that we met, we had a wonderful ceremony here when our new police chief, John Buckley, was sworn in.

173
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,628
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a fabulous ceremony.

174
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:35,407
[SPEAKER_12]: and he was sworn into office on Wednesday, December 19, and I was honored to join him here, be here with him and many other dignitaries, his family, fellow department heads, and our wonderful band, the Medford High School String Ensemble, I should say, under the direction of our finance director, Tony Zigny, provided the musical selections for the ceremony.

175
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:41,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Chief Buckley stated that he plans to continue Medford's community policing initiatives

176
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:48,416
[SPEAKER_12]: that had begun under Chief Sacco, and he also pledged to reach out to Medford's richly diverse community.

177
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:54,219
[SPEAKER_12]: We in the Medford Public Schools welcome him aboard and are eager to collaborate with him.

178
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:06,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Another great partner is Tufts University, and Tufts University will once again be hosting the Tufts Classic at Cousins Gym, Sunday, January 20th.

179
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:15,447
[SPEAKER_12]: both Medford High School boys and girls basketball teams will be playing the Somerville High School boys and girls basketball teams.

180
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Each winner will take home the Tufts Cup.

181
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:25,269
[SPEAKER_12]: The girls games open the tournament at 12.30 and the boys games will follow at 2 o'clock.

182
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,230
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no admission fee.

183
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:32,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead, Tufts University is collecting perishable food items

184
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,299
[SPEAKER_12]: for Medford and Somerville food pantries.

185
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:40,002
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope some of you are able to come out and really support that wonderful event.

186
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,004
[SPEAKER_12]: That date is Sunday, January 20th at 12.30 and 2.

187
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:45,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Cousins Gym.

188
00:24:52,178 --> 00:25:03,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Lesley University, as I continue to work with our partner, Lesley, it's part of the work that I've been doing with my entry plan and also part of the entry plan is looking at our data as a district.

189
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:08,806
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we had talked about earlier, math was an identified area that we wanted to work on.

190
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:17,791
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when you hear me talking about Lesley, the focus really is to address how we performed at the elementary levels.

191
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:20,212
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, we're having a particular

192
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:25,676
[SPEAKER_12]: focus on elementary math, to try to increase outcomes for all students.

193
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:38,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And since we last met, I had the opportunity to go to Lesley University, and I met with Patricia Cren de Galarce, who is our lead partner on the educational side.

194
00:25:38,786 --> 00:25:47,873
[SPEAKER_12]: And in addition to that, I got to meet with the Board of Trustee member, Art Bartich, who is one of the authors of an early childhood math book, a co-author,

195
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,774
[SPEAKER_12]: and supports the what-if math.

196
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:57,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Rohan Kandargi from MIT.

197
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:03,480
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a K-12 administrator who works for the Office of Government and Community Relations.

198
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:09,843
[SPEAKER_12]: He also was very interested in continuing to partner with Medford

199
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:16,840
[SPEAKER_12]: and with Leslie and looking at opportunities to see how we can continue to make meaningful math partnerships.

200
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:36,270
[SPEAKER_12]: The conversations that I had with Art Bardage, we're looking at early childhood mathematics and different ways to make math become alive at the youngest levels so that it carries all the way through to the high school levels and in meeting with

201
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:39,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Patricia, Dr. Galarza, Brenda Galarza.

202
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:51,179
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in the process of scheduling our second math learning rounds, instructional rounds, and we are going to be scheduling those for the end of January.

203
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:57,441
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are intending on going a little deeper this time as we go to each school.

204
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:04,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I had the opportunity to also meet many professors at the university.

205
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:15,805
[SPEAKER_12]: who are interested in continuing to collaborate with us, whether it's conducting learning walks and looking at instruction, or providing support in professional development fashion.

206
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,926
[SPEAKER_12]: So that work is still continuing.

207
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:27,508
[SPEAKER_12]: On our facilities front, the Karen Theater, the heating coil was replaced over a break.

208
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,718
[SPEAKER_12]: so it is now fixed in the Karen Theater.

209
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:40,161
[SPEAKER_12]: And building grounds, we are still working and making progress on the gymnasium, but I just wanted to put that forward as well.

210
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:53,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Lastly, I had the opportunity to look at instruction with Mr. Headmaster Paul DeLeva, and we spent some time, we went to Access Classrooms today, and really got to see wonderful work.

211
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,766
[SPEAKER_12]: The students are so excited to be learning and having us there as guests.

212
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:08,135
[SPEAKER_12]: We also spent some time on the vocational side of the house and went into carpentry, got to see a beautiful table being sanded by a student.

213
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:13,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could have displayed a picture.

214
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:19,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And the students in our carpentry are getting ready to work on a project

215
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:25,588
[SPEAKER_12]: where they're going to be constructing bed frames for refugee children.

216
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:30,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's through the Boston Cares Foundation.

217
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:40,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in Medford, we are doing great things to make a difference in the lives of our own community, but also in the lives of the greater community.

218
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:45,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they have not started that project yet, but the wood has been delivered.

219
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I will definitely keep you posted on the progress that they make there.

220
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to spend time in Meadowfab.

221
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Students shared with me some of their beautiful creations.

222
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:00,836
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw some steel roses that were made by the students.

223
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:01,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful.

224
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're really excited about the work that's happening there.

225
00:29:06,902 --> 00:29:08,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to continue to just

226
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:12,107
[SPEAKER_12]: be in classrooms, look at instruction at all levels.

227
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:17,431
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not always mathematics, but just promoting what's best for the district.

228
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,393
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's my report for today.

229
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:21,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much, Madam Superintendent.

230
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:22,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Benedetto.

231
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:36,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to let the superintendent know, the Carpentries Shop at the Meffitt High School for years has made bed frames for homeless families because when a homeless family gets housing,

232
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:40,334
[SPEAKER_13]: They cannot move in until they have a bed for every child.

233
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:45,017
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you're homeless and you're just starting out, you have nothing to fill that.

234
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:50,480
[SPEAKER_13]: So our students have always built beds for people in our community in need.

235
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,223
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think there was a spotlight on them a few years ago about it.

236
00:29:55,563 --> 00:30:03,027
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a wonderful, one of the wonderful programs that our vocational students reach out to and help people throughout the state of Massachusetts.

237
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:06,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually was telling a group that was looking to donate money

238
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:18,637
[SPEAKER_13]: to reach out to Chad Fallon to talk to them about maybe buying the mattresses if the kids could make the beds and really get people in housing quickly.

239
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm glad to see that they're continuing that.

240
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:22,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

241
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:23,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

242
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:24,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

243
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:26,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

244
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:27,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion on file by Ms.

245
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Van De Kloot, seconded by Ms.

246
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:29,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostone.

247
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:30,536
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

248
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:31,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

249
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:31,856
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

250
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion carries.

251
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:36,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 2, informational report on vaping and cannabis.

252
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:37,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Randy Schuster.

253
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited to have Dr. Randy Schuster come to present to us this evening.

254
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:51,018
[SPEAKER_12]: She did come in December to present to our administrative team.

255
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,879
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were many, many rave reviews.

256
00:30:54,439 --> 00:31:00,502
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I want you to be able to participate in the wealth of knowledge that will be shared by her this evening.

257
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Schuster.

258
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:03,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.

259
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:03,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Doctor.

260
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:05,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

261
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:07,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't set the standards too high.

262
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:32,839
[SPEAKER_11]: While things are being set up, we all know that vaping has become a hidden talent of some youngsters and adults, and it's really important that we catch hold of this and make sure that the students realize that it's not acceptable to be doing this in schools or anywhere else inside our buildings, and similar to smoking.

263
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:34,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to smoking, and it's not

264
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,241
[SPEAKER_11]: acceptable behavior.

265
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:51,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we've been working quite adamantly, along with Dr. Schuster, with our Board of Health, Team Medford, on trying to really educate those about what's in the vaping materials that they're consuming.

266
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:55,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know this will be a very informative presentation.

267
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,924
[SPEAKER_11]: While they're setting up, would someone like to make a motion to take a paper out of order, items five and six?

268
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,546
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion to take papers five and six out of order.

269
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:21,687
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

270
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:21,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

271
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:23,188
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

272
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:23,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

273
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Item five, recommendation to approve leaders environmental donation of $125.

274
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,813
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion for approval of this gift of $125.

275
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking for the paper in my pocket.

276
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

277
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:42,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

278
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:46,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Could we send a letter of thank you?

279
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:46,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

280
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was a wonderful thing.

281
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly in the back of the paper.

282
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:56,595
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion to accept this Leaders Environmental, $125 for education.

283
00:33:56,615 --> 00:34:00,817
[SPEAKER_11]: In appreciation, this is from the president of the company, Luders.

284
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:07,800
[SPEAKER_11]: In appreciation of all the clients we are privileged to service in Medford, we would like to make this donation to the Medford School Department.

285
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:17,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Leaders Environmental is a lawn, tree, and shrub care company specializing in science-based, environmentally sound approaches and attentive customer service.

286
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,545
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a motion on the floor for approval.

287
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:20,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

288
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:23,010
[SPEAKER_11]: seconded by Mr. Giro.

289
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote please.

290
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:35,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

291
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:36,686
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

292
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:37,507
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

293
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:42,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 6, recommendation to approve statute for joint city school director of security position.

294
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:48,769
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could from the chair, as you realize in the budget, we placed a placeholder basically for this position.

295
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's shared jointly between the schools and the city.

296
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And they will oversee security for all of our public buildings.

297
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is a general law, Mr.

298
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:03,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Howard Greenspan brought to our attention that we need to actually adopt this.

299
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:04,574
[SPEAKER_11]: We have posted the job.

300
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:06,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Interviews are scheduled to begin next week.

301
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:14,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're hopeful to get someone on board very quickly so that they can implement a lot of the changes from the Safe Haven report, et cetera.

302
00:35:14,718 --> 00:35:16,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So are there any questions?

303
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:18,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

304
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Vandekloot?

305
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:24,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you let us know what the projected salary range is?

306
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

307
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,690
[SPEAKER_02]: We can send you a copy of the job description.

308
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it in about 90.

309
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:30,131
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

310
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:32,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And where would the person be housed?

311
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:35,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we're anticipating them being at City Hall.

312
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:41,476
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll set them up in an office, and then we will figure out if it's a better location.

313
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:44,097
[SPEAKER_11]: But we want to have them right at City Hall for the time being.

314
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:46,278
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

315
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:46,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

316
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:49,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Mr. Russo had a question.

317
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

318
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:52,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

319
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:56,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm busily eating three-year-old gummies.

320
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:57,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not very good.

321
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Will there be any additional staff for this person?

322
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:02,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the secretary?

323
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:03,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Not right now, no.

324
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:06,916
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be relying on our office, basically, to support them.

325
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:07,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

326
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:16,765
[SPEAKER_11]: And more or less working with the police department, building and grounds, Mr. McLaughlin, and all of our principals, et cetera, to really get the lay of the land.

327
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:38,467
[SPEAKER_11]: look at some of the study the work that's already been done we've received that grant for after shooter grant which the police department is administering and they did an assessment of city hall library as well as the council on aging and we're going to implement some changes based upon what they found and then this person would ultimately be the one that could coordinate all the activities

328
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,605
[SPEAKER_11]: stay on top of cameras and make sure that they're all being checked on a more frequent basis and things of that nature.

329
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:53,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So we anticipate that this person will be on the road quite a bit, and we look forward to having an extra set of hands in this regard.

330
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very important topic.

331
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:56,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

332
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:57,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

333
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:05,420
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to know who will actually hire and oversee this person since they're joint between the school and the city side.

334
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,221
[SPEAKER_11]: It's joint funded.

335
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:08,823
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be an appointment of myself.

336
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:11,905
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have, I think Christine is sitting in.

337
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:14,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Christine Patterson will be sitting in on interviews.

338
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:15,228
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be sitting in on the interviews.

339
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:23,795
[SPEAKER_11]: So the way that I handle most interviews, the team does the interviewing and then they put forth a few recommendations and then determine based on that we do

340
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:26,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, we're going to have to look at the quarries and whatnot, depending upon the job specs.

341
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:33,638
[SPEAKER_13]: And my other question is, will the school security staff then report to this person?

342
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,920
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't worked out that logistic yet.

343
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,580
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

344
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,301
[SPEAKER_11]: But we believe that they will have a dotted line to them right now.

345
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:40,861
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

346
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

347
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:44,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Musto?

348
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I ask, would it have been possible, or is it too late, that could a police officer have been assigned to this,

349
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,059
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more comprehensive than that.

350
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,542
[SPEAKER_11]: And we looked at all different avenues.

351
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:04,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And it made sense to have it a standalone independent of all the other bodies that are working out there.

352
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:05,305
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

353
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can really see things through a fresh set of eyes.

354
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:08,027
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

355
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:08,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

356
00:38:08,868 --> 00:38:09,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

357
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:10,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

358
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:10,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Van de Kloop.

359
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any open interviews that school committee members could attend?

360
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,215
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really administrative.

361
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,455
[SPEAKER_11]: the appointment process.

362
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,956
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a school committee appointment.

363
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:26,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would be closed until we get to the final.

364
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:29,597
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll make recommendations, and then that's usually closed in two weeks.

365
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:31,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's administrative.

366
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:33,918
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a, it's different than appointments.

367
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:39,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo, I should just keep all your mics on.

368
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I was trying to just get things done while we were waiting.

369
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to be sure that, you know, you mentioned the active shooter training that the other

370
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: parts of the city, but we have not approved active shooter Alice training.

371
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,911
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no.

372
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:59,513
[SPEAKER_11]: But you will have a person that will be educated to come in and talk to you about it.

373
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:00,053
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

374
00:39:00,073 --> 00:39:00,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Or other options.

375
00:39:00,894 --> 00:39:01,394
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, good.

376
00:39:01,414 --> 00:39:01,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

377
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't want that to slip under the covers.

378
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,295
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.

379
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:05,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

380
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:09,378
[SPEAKER_11]: And the police department has been a huge support system for us in all security measures.

381
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:11,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So they will continue to be.

382
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

383
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Gero.

384
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a question on the chain of command here.

385
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:24,370
[SPEAKER_08]: this new person will be reporting directly to you and will act independently.

386
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,093
[SPEAKER_08]: So what will the sort of relationship be between this person and the superintendent?

387
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,574
[SPEAKER_11]: They will work very closely.

388
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:36,217
[SPEAKER_11]: So there'd be a dotted line to the superintendent also, because we're basically direct reports, municipal versus school.

389
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:41,881
[SPEAKER_11]: So they would be working just as closely with the school department as the city, probably more so, I would imagine, at the beginning.

390
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:42,921
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thank you.

391
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:44,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey.

392
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I ran out of scripts again.

393
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitty gritty.

394
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:54,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think because I was surprised when I saw it on the agenda, and we haven't really had a conversation about it since maybe May.

395
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:55,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

396
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, May.

397
00:39:57,492 --> 00:39:59,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably just fell off my radar.

398
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be a possible one-year contract?

399
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:13,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just thinking of personnel and how often we talk about the budget and the cost of personnel and the cost of every union, and just to add another person on, whereas

400
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:18,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd rather a position for more math coaches.

401
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:26,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's split between the city and the school, but could it be a one-year job to see if they're just implementing what we get from Safe Havens?

402
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:27,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of...

403
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:30,747
[SPEAKER_11]: But then it's ongoing when you look at our buildings.

404
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:34,828
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot that goes into it that isn't really being looked at right now.

405
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:37,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And I obviously can't get into specific measures here.

406
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,250
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are a lot of things that need to be tightened up.

407
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's ongoing in the maintenance of the equipment that you install and whatnot.

408
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:44,652
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

409
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:46,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

410
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:52,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept statute at Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 37M, which basically is to?

411
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,233
[SPEAKER_11]: provide for joint services for the purpose of shared security direct to position.

412
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:05,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

413
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:07,957
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

414
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz.

415
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:09,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote, please.

416
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:10,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

417
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:10,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

418
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:10,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

419
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:11,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Kretz?

420
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:11,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

421
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:12,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

422
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Estrella?

423
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,661
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

424
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:15,282
Mr. Otero?

425
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:15,522
Yes.

426
00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:18,164
Ms.

427
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:18,704
Trujillo?

428
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:19,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

429
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:20,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Van De Koop?

430
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:21,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

431
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,086
[SPEAKER_11]: May I vote?

432
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:22,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

433
00:41:22,607 --> 00:41:24,588
[SPEAKER_11]: A vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

434
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,468
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion passes.

435
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:26,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

436
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:30,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

437
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandeclude, seconded by Mr. Russo?

438
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,033
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

439
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:34,094
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

440
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:40,435
[SPEAKER_11]: We are now back with item number two, informational report on vaping and cannabis.

441
00:41:40,495 --> 00:41:41,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Randy Schuster.

442
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

443
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:47,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the technological difficulties.

444
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:49,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

445
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:53,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So just by way of introduction, it's OK.

446
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:55,263
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Randy Schuster.

447
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:57,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

448
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a neuropsychologist.

449
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:12,735
[SPEAKER_04]: My area of expertise is in the impact of early drug exposure on the developing brain, particularly as it intersects with academic performance and emotional well-being.

450
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I've been spending the last probably 10 years of my research has been by way of adolescent marijuana use, which is

451
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:26,085
[SPEAKER_04]: about as hot button of an issue as it comes right now.

452
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:45,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I was tasked with is in the next 10 to 15 minutes, giving you guys a broad picture overview of where we stand with the science, and then I will turn it over to the experts behind me in terms of how we're gonna implement this and how we're addressing this at Medford.

453
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I have more slides than we will get through,

454
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:54,706
[SPEAKER_04]: This is audience participation encouraged, so please ask questions.

455
00:42:54,766 --> 00:43:16,902
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these are really more just talking points and ways for us to just kind of start thinking out loud about an area that we really don't, unfortunately, have a lot of research on, but policy is moving very quickly ahead with, and we will see this in full steam in Medford in the next year.

456
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:29,226
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I will touch a little bit on, I'll spend the majority of the time talking about marijuana because that's where I spend most of my academic time.

457
00:43:29,246 --> 00:43:34,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some slides at the end about vaping as well, nicotine vaping as well.

458
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:38,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get us started, let's play a game.

459
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not optional.

460
00:43:41,296 --> 00:43:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone has to participate.

461
00:43:47,638 --> 00:43:55,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Which of these are marijuana?

462
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:13,390
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the above.

463
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,791
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the above.

464
00:44:15,811 --> 00:44:16,692
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys all passed.

465
00:44:17,192 --> 00:44:20,455
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all cannabis products.

466
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I hope this slide really illustrates for you is we are in the Wild West with respect to marijuana research.

467
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:39,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of research that's been published to date on marijuana has come from the 70s, 80s, a little bit in the 90s.

468
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guarantee you.

469
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:46,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of these products were not available then.

470
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So the science that we have is really on, not to be glib, but on yesterday's weed.

471
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:58,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not on what our kids are typically being exposed to right now.

472
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So a few things that also that I think just kind of highlight

473
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:06,200
[SPEAKER_04]: the scope of this issue and really how little we know.

474
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:18,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the most recent reports from the National Institute on Health with respect to current rates of high school marijuana use.

475
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:24,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the past year, over one in three 12th grade students have used marijuana.

476
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Past year, not ever in use.

477
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:39,436
[SPEAKER_04]: What you'll see in this middle figure here, that as tobacco rates are sharply declining, we've done a phenomenal job from a public health standpoint in nearly eradicating cigarette use in youth.

478
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:42,837
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not see a similar trend line with marijuana use.

479
00:45:43,217 --> 00:45:50,240
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in the past month that one in five 12th grade students have used marijuana in the past month.

480
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a public health standpoint, would be considered current marijuana users.

481
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:58,154
[SPEAKER_04]: This is missing its heading here, but this is in daily use.

482
00:45:58,614 --> 00:46:05,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 6% of 12th grade students report using marijuana every single day.

483
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:17,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think these rates of use are all that surprising when we think about the current legal landscape around marijuana use.

484
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:19,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, I'm getting over a cold.

485
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:29,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So as of current, there are 10 states, including the District of Columbia, that allow the most expansive laws around marijuana legalization.

486
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:33,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So they permit not only legal use for medical purposes,

487
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: but also legal use for recreational purposes.

488
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:46,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2016, Massachusetts also adopted, voted in favor of question four, which allows for the legal sales of recreational marijuana use.

489
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:50,160
[SPEAKER_04]: What you'll see in this panel to the right are the 351.

490
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:50,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.

491
00:46:54,762 --> 00:47:22,187
[SPEAKER_04]: municipalities across Massachusetts, and it's separated by those that have implemented a full-on ban of recreational sales in Massachusetts, those that have a moratorium on sales, and those that have no regulations or no stipulations about whether or not that the town can allow for recreational sales.

492
00:47:23,137 --> 00:47:36,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Question four was written fundamentally differently than what was passed in, let's say, Colorado or Washington, which require opt-in for recreational sales of recreational marijuana.

493
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:45,417
[SPEAKER_04]: In Massachusetts, by law, towns have to opt out of having recreational sales.

494
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:49,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So Medford, I think I got this arrow pretty close to right.

495
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: does not have a moratorium or a ban.

496
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,195
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a moratorium.

497
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:55,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Had?

498
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:57,136
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe it expired.

499
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:58,857
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

500
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, and Mary Ann will give a more updated stance on where we are on this, I believe three, four.

501
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:12,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Three.

502
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:21,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimum of three minimum of three shops will be opening in Medford.

503
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:28,530
[SPEAKER_11]: That's by state statute because the city voted in the affirmative for that question.

504
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:37,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford voted, I believe it was 60-some, 62% in favor of allowing for recreational marijuana.

505
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:49,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So by law, in order to move backwards on that, we would have to convene a special election and vote against having recreational sales.

506
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:53,867
[SPEAKER_04]: This will become very much a reality in this town very quickly.

507
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:04,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if there's nothing else to take away from what I will be talking about, it's this slide here.

508
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear from parents all the time, I smoked in the 60s and 70s, and I'm fine.

509
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:14,476
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the big deal?

510
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You really should be talking about alcohol.

511
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is really not that much of a problem.

512
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:25,226
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 60s and 70s, the average THC content of marijuana was about 1% to 2% THC.

513
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:30,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, average THC is anywhere from 6% to 22% THC.

514
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:38,409
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamentally different drug than what was used at Woodstock.

515
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a different product.

516
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:48,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And add in, let's get back to, we now have these products here.

517
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone know what this is?

518
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:52,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a gummy.

519
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:53,734
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you say?

520
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a brownie.

521
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an edible.

522
00:49:59,156 --> 00:50:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a turd.

523
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:01,717
[SPEAKER_11]: It's snakes or worms.

524
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone?

525
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:06,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's wax.

526
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called DABS.

527
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:10,837
[SPEAKER_04]: These are cannabis concentrates.

528
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:15,661
[SPEAKER_04]: They are highly potent concentrated forms of marijuana.

529
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:18,723
[SPEAKER_04]: They're made almost in the same way that meth is made.

530
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You use a solvent like butane to extract THC.

531
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:23,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So THC is the component of marijuana.

532
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,188
[SPEAKER_04]: that will get you high.

533
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:31,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're concentrated down into an oil or a wax that you can vape.

534
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:35,272
[SPEAKER_04]: What is scary about these products, there are a number of things that are scary about it.

535
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:37,093
[SPEAKER_04]: One is they are completely odorless.

536
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:38,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not bloodshot your eyes.

537
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:46,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So kids are reported smoking at school or vaping at school without any sort of those typical telltale signs that somebody's high.

538
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:48,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And these products can be up to 95% THC.

539
00:50:52,643 --> 00:50:58,365
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, we're comparing taking a swig of a light beer to tequila shots.

540
00:50:58,385 --> 00:51:01,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these are just, it's a different drug.

541
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:11,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have the smell that typically comes with burning marijuana.

542
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:12,049
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have this.

543
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,672
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not going to produce a smoke.

544
00:51:21,472 --> 00:51:26,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll produce a light vapor, a water vapor.

545
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first learned about this, I was working at another school.

546
00:51:35,944 --> 00:51:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had to tell this, because I just think this is really telling.

547
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We do urine drug tests.

548
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:46,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And our tests cap at 500 nanograms per milliliter.

549
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:58,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So for just kind of a benchmark, in order for an adult to be hitting 500 nanograms per milliliter at that ceiling, typically they need to be smoking several times a day, every day.

550
00:51:58,201 --> 00:51:59,883
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a heavy, chronic smoker.

551
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kept having this one kid come in at ceiling.

552
00:52:03,442 --> 00:52:07,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And we asked our kids to stop smoking for several days to weeks.

553
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And even after several days of abstinence, he was still at ceiling.

554
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go to our lab, change the assay that we were using, because we weren't able to detect how much THC was in the system.

555
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:21,352
[SPEAKER_04]: He was using these products.

556
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:27,116
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were finally able to get his ceiling, he was at over 4,500 nanograms per milliliter.

557
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:36,878
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know anything about how these products and how this level of THC exposure is impacting the developing brain.

558
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:39,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it impacting academic performance?

559
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it impacting psychiatric well-being?

560
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly don't know how it's impacting driving fitness.

561
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:50,766
[SPEAKER_04]: This really is, like I said, the Wild West.

562
00:52:56,554 --> 00:53:03,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so like I said, this I think really for me is the most concerning trend line for us to watch.

563
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:16,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Also by law, I believe, there's a slight question mark here for me, in Massachusetts we cannot put restrictions on high potency products.

564
00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:18,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So these will become very, these are

565
00:53:19,191 --> 00:53:33,643
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not able to regulate the sale of these types of products.

566
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:35,405
Cannabis is a very complicated plant.

567
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:37,947
It has over 200 different cannabinoids in it.

568
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:46,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, you hear THC and cannabidiol are the two products that are most typically talked about right now in the media.

569
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:52,626
[SPEAKER_04]: THC is really the only constituent that will elicit that high, and these products are just that, oil and milk.

570
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:04,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other thing to think about is this dialogue around cannabis use right now is very complicated.

571
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:08,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not as straightforward as are you pro or against.

572
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to think about the legal landscape in which this is all occurring.

573
00:54:11,754 --> 00:54:14,076
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to think about the products that people are using.

574
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:16,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also need to think about the user.

575
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: One user may not be the same and carry the same vulnerabilities as the next user.

576
00:54:21,365 --> 00:54:26,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So on one hand, we might have adults who are using under the

577
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:33,320
[SPEAKER_04]: a recommendation of their physician and who are using for management of chronic medical conditions.

578
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,601
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not carry the same risk.

579
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:38,743
[SPEAKER_04]: As in the middle, you'll see here, this is Charlotte Figge.

580
00:54:38,803 --> 00:54:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been all over the news really, kind of the face child for medical THC use for intractable epilepsy.

581
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:56,292
[SPEAKER_04]: These two patients might not be the same as who we're talking about on the right.

582
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:07,690
[SPEAKER_04]: kids who are using recreationally and who are using high-potency products who are smoky rather than using oils or low-potency or high-CPT products.

583
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really need to approach this conversation with some level of nuance that I think often gets overlooked when we're talking about pro or con for marijuana.

584
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:20,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really.

585
00:55:20,057 --> 00:55:21,618
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of gray in here.

586
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:36,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to highlight why I believe and why the literature is pretty firm on that this user carries a lot more vulnerabilities than the adult medical user or than the

587
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:55,388
[SPEAKER_04]: the child, the pediatric user who's using very controlled doses of CBD oils are more vulnerable is because of the way that the brain is developing and the period of adolescence which is highly sensitive to the effects of THC.

588
00:55:56,076 --> 00:56:00,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So the brain develops a lot longer than what we previously thought.

589
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:08,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, the current consensus is that the brain develops until about age 25, if not a little bit later.

590
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And the brain develops in a back-to-front direction.

591
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:15,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So the last regions to come on board is your prefrontal cortex.

592
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And that develops well into the third decade of life.

593
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:24,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Your prefrontal cortex is critical for a number of higher order cognitive functions.

594
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:46,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only is it critical for decision making, attention, memory, it's also critical for impulse control and risk taking, which is why we see an increase in those behaviors during adolescence, because that region is least developed, whereas regions of the brain further back are further developed.

595
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:47,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It is also important to know.

596
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:55,695
[SPEAKER_04]: that the regions of the brain that are least developed during adolescence are highly innervated with cannabinoid receptors.

597
00:56:56,716 --> 00:57:03,820
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a rough cartoon schematic of the distribution of cannabinoid receptors throughout the brain.

598
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:06,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're represented by these pink dots here.

599
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:16,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see that the pink dots are highly populated in the prefrontal cortex, as well as in the midbrain, which is critical for emotionality,

600
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:25,095
[SPEAKER_04]: for reward-seeking, sensation-seeking, as well as memory consolidation.

601
00:57:25,136 --> 00:57:44,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a far stretch to think that use of cannabis during this very sensitive period of brain development has the potential to interrupt normal neurodevelopmental processes and have potentially really a negative impact on thinking and emotional functioning.

602
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, please interrupt if you have any questions or thoughts as we're going along.

603
00:57:56,031 --> 00:57:59,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get asked this question a lot, is whether or not marijuana is addictive.

604
00:58:01,116 --> 00:58:06,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is a definitive yes or some.

605
00:58:08,682 --> 00:58:17,050
[SPEAKER_04]: About 9% of ever users, people who ever try the drug at some point in their life will meet criteria for dependence.

606
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:23,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say dependence, I mean they're using despite experiencing some negative consequences in their life.

607
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:28,521
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having problems at school, it's causing problems with their relationship, it's interfering with work.

608
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:31,304
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having legal repercussions, 9%.

609
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:36,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That number doubles when use is initiated in adolescence.

610
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:50,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, highlighting the fact that use might not be a major problem for the majority of the population, but that risk is exacerbated when use is used during this vulnerable period of development.

611
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:59,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know that marijuana use has very strong associations.

612
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:18,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know causality yet for a number of these different diagnoses and disorders, but strong associations with several mental health comorbidities, such that users, especially younger users, are at greater likelihood of experiencing psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder.

613
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,582
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know, and as a neuropsychologist,

614
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:31,746
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I start to geek out in terms of the impacts of marijuana use on cognitive functioning.

615
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:41,271
[SPEAKER_04]: There are robust associations between marijuana use and decrements in attention, memory, executive functioning.

616
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:45,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And those deficits are significantly magnified

617
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: when use is initiated before, the magic number right now is we think around 16 or 17.

618
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:56,697
[SPEAKER_04]: That use before that period really sets kids up of having greater cognitive difficulties.

619
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:06,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We see, and I think this slide here, if you were to just pay attention to this one here, really highlights this notion.

620
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry the,

621
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:10,253
[SPEAKER_04]: he got cut off.

622
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:18,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But what you'll see here, so on this task, this was a task we did in my lab, where we asked kids to learn new words.

623
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:23,983
[SPEAKER_04]: A list of about 16 words, and we present it to them five times over the course of the study.

624
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:27,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And all we do after we present the list of words, we ask them to tell it back to us.

625
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we give them about a 20, 25 minute delay, and we ask them to tell us as many of those words as they can remember again.

626
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:42,322
[SPEAKER_04]: What we see is that this dotted line here are non-users, kids who have never been exposed to marijuana.

627
01:00:43,022 --> 01:00:49,666
[SPEAKER_04]: This solid line here are those who have been exposed, but who started using later in adolescence.

628
01:00:49,826 --> 01:00:50,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Started using around 17 or 18.

629
01:00:53,593 --> 01:00:59,759
[SPEAKER_04]: This line here are those who have been exposed but who started using earlier in adolescence.

630
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:09,268
[SPEAKER_04]: What's important to note here is that our two marijuana-using groups are identical with respect to anything that you can imagine, including cumulative exposure.

631
01:01:09,748 --> 01:01:14,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So those who started using later still use the same amount over the course of their life.

632
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:19,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So this isn't just a dose effect that the earlier users have used more over the course of their life.

633
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:23,377
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that distinguishes these two groups is the age at which they started using.

634
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:35,162
[SPEAKER_04]: that this is a sensitive period where we really should be discouraging use, or at least encouraging kids to delay use for as long as possible.

635
01:01:35,803 --> 01:01:48,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I really try to live in that more harm reduction camp, because it's very hard, especially with legalization, to get buy-in to never use, total abstinence.

636
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:51,716
[SPEAKER_04]: This is dangerous, and this will be dangerous forever.

637
01:01:52,303 --> 01:02:03,287
[SPEAKER_04]: When kids are hearing that their parents are using medically, or they're seeing billboards, or they're trendy advertisements in magazines, it's hard to get buy-in for that.

638
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:11,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is a more palatable message is this might be OK, but not right now.

639
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we can put this off as long as possible, you set yourself up for the best chances.

640
01:02:24,732 --> 01:02:25,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for setting that up.

641
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that.

642
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:28,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did.

643
01:02:29,614 --> 01:02:29,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

644
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:32,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back again.

645
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:34,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

646
01:02:35,115 --> 01:02:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

647
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the study we're working on right now, which is that question is what we're really interested in.

648
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these permanent deficits causing our awareness?

649
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:47,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do kids get better when they stop smoking?

650
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see two pieces of evidence, two things that I think

651
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Lent and self-precaution, but optimism.

652
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:05,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we see here, this was pilot data that we published about two months ago.

653
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:10,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see on the left, this is a measure of memory, a similar task to what I was talking about before.

654
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many words can you remember?

655
01:03:12,892 --> 01:03:19,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially what we did for this study is we're bringing in adolescents who have used smoking water at least once a week or more.

656
01:03:20,016 --> 01:03:24,219
[SPEAKER_04]: So these aren't necessarily very heavy users, those who are using even just on the weekends.

657
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:27,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And we incentivized them to stop smoking for 30 days.

658
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:30,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in a treatment study, kids in high school who are doing just fine.

659
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:34,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Paid them enough money that it was worth their while to stop smoking.

660
01:03:35,025 --> 01:03:38,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And we measured their cognitive abilities every four months.

661
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:44,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had marijuana users who continued doing what they normally do.

662
01:03:44,942 --> 01:03:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't incentivized to sell.

663
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:51,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we do see is that even within one disaster, it's accomplished.

664
01:03:52,512 --> 01:04:02,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So their ability to learn new words improves significantly more than those who continue using, which kind of makes both sides of the aisle happy.

665
01:04:03,178 --> 01:04:11,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So on one hand, we see evidence that at least some of the deficits that we think are caused by marijuana use are not counterfeited.

666
01:04:11,922 --> 01:04:20,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, we see that people are doing better when they're not smoking, which isn't all that surprising.

667
01:04:25,537 --> 01:04:33,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is, I think, a really important message for us to be, even just within a week, they're able to learn better, they're able to think better.

668
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:41,708
[SPEAKER_04]: To think about how this is going to translate to the classroom is really important.

669
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:45,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go back just one slide, and this is another really critical piece.

670
01:04:47,585 --> 01:04:48,725
[SPEAKER_04]: just like with alcohol.

671
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:50,266
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless you.

672
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:58,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people, many kids even, can drink without experiencing significant consequences.

673
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,470
[SPEAKER_04]: They can regulate the when, the where.

674
01:05:01,784 --> 01:05:07,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't encourage it, obviously, but not every kid who experiments, bless you, who drinks has problems.

675
01:05:08,028 --> 01:05:08,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But some do.

676
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to see a very similar pattern with marijuana use, that it's going to be really critical for us to understand who those vulnerable kids are, who are most likely to have problems psychiatrically, emotionally, with long-term social adjustment.

677
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:30,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those risk factors that I think are going to be really critical for us to keep in mind are those with psychiatric comorbidities.

678
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:42,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So kids who use marijuana who are also depressed or who have a history of schizophrenia or who have, the area that I tend to focus on is on ADHD and marijuana use comorbidities.

679
01:05:43,013 --> 01:05:44,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we see here.

680
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:45,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is another cognitive task.

681
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:57,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking at kids without depression and without marijuana use, with marijuana use alone, with depression alone, and those with the co-occurrence of the two.

682
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:12,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see there's a double whammy with depression and marijuana use in terms of they fare worse with respect to their thinking abilities than those with either condition or use alone.

683
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:28,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, really just highlighting that prevention is really going to be the name of the game here, and having really tailored, targeted prevention messages to the kids who we think are going to be most vulnerable to having negative consequences from use.

684
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:36,332
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so just a quick summary, and then I'll spend two minutes on vaping and then open it up.

685
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:38,875
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, cannabis use is common.

686
01:06:39,155 --> 01:06:48,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It is likely that it will become more common in the years to come as the state, and Medford in particular, moves towards the implementation of legalization.

687
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: THC levels that kids are being exposed to are at unprecedented levels, and I'm very, very concerned about that.

688
01:06:59,254 --> 01:07:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also using new products that we just don't have any research on, which poses really important questions about how they're metabolizing the drug, the effects on driving safety.

689
01:07:11,482 --> 01:07:13,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, with edibles,

690
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:17,127
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smoke marijuana, you feel the effects pretty immediately.

691
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It crosses the blood-brain barrier very quickly.

692
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:22,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not the same when you ingest marijuana.

693
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So kids will eat a brownie.

694
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:27,134
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fine.

695
01:07:27,834 --> 01:07:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in the car.

696
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:30,716
[SPEAKER_04]: An hour later, we'll feel the effects.

697
01:07:31,777 --> 01:07:34,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Or have difficulty titrating because they don't feel the effects right away.

698
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So they eat another brownie, or have another soda, or whatever it is, and then overshoot their high.

699
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:48,195
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of really important public health questions for us to think about with these new products that will be on the market.

700
01:07:49,476 --> 01:07:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe adolescents are uniquely vulnerable to the negative effects of marijuana because of ongoing brain development.

701
01:07:57,301 --> 01:08:09,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And that cannabis users, particularly those who start early, tend to be worse, both in terms of their psychiatric profile, as well as cognitive and brain-based abnormalities.

702
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll switch gears very quickly and just talk about electronic cigarette use.

703
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,446
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been just

704
01:08:24,776 --> 01:08:27,838
[SPEAKER_04]: a landslide phenomenon.

705
01:08:28,419 --> 01:08:38,266
[SPEAKER_04]: The FDA recently called this a public health crisis, an epidemic.

706
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a ton of data in terms of the effects of electronic cigarette use on the developing brain.

707
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:47,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We have more data on prevalence.

708
01:08:47,812 --> 01:08:50,453
[SPEAKER_04]: and how these are being marketed towards kids.

709
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:59,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think I need to explain that these images are designed to entice young people.

710
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:07,699
[SPEAKER_04]: These prevalence rates came out about two weeks ago, maybe.

711
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they suggest is that 3.5 million teens use e-cigarettes.

712
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So about one in five high schoolers and one in 20 middle schoolers.

713
01:09:20,275 --> 01:09:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: This represents a two-fold increase in rates of use since last year.

714
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:27,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year.

715
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:28,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible.

716
01:09:30,278 --> 01:09:30,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 37%.

717
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:36,848
[SPEAKER_04]: have used electronic cigarettes in the last year.

718
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're reporting vaping anything from nicotine to marijuana or hash oil or just flavoring.

719
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:57,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Even among those who report vaping just flavoring, there's not a lot of evidence that they're always accurate in their perception of what they're using.

720
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:02,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 60% of kids who believe that they're vaping just

721
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:07,114
[SPEAKER_04]: flavoring or not, or actually are vaping nicotine as well.

722
01:10:08,095 --> 01:10:10,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So why might this be risky?

723
01:10:10,177 --> 01:10:13,660
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of reasons to suggest why this might be risky.

724
01:10:14,521 --> 01:10:26,673
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some evidence that kids who vape nicotine are more likely to progress to combustible tobacco products, so things like cigarettes, and kids who might never have

725
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:40,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say that this is really concerning, especially given what an excellent job we've done in reducing rates of cigarette use.

726
01:10:40,394 --> 01:10:42,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Cigarette use is at an all-time low.

727
01:10:42,942 --> 01:10:48,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have the introduction of these products that I worry might threaten those trend lines.

728
01:10:50,148 --> 01:10:54,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Each cartridge, each jewel cartridge, contains about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.

729
01:10:55,813 --> 01:11:01,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So kids are being exposed to large amounts of nicotine, not tobacco, but nicotine.

730
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:11,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that nicotine, when administered in different ways, so transdermally, like in a patch or through a cigarette,

731
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:15,733
[SPEAKER_04]: increases the addictive liability of other drugs.

732
01:11:16,213 --> 01:11:22,615
[SPEAKER_04]: So when a kid is exposed or an adult is exposed to nicotine, they find other drugs more reinforcing.

733
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:35,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the things that I'm worried about, that if you're vaping and if a kid is vaping and is at a party and drinking, is that alcohol going to become more reinforcing in the context of dual use and nicotine use?

734
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless you.

735
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:36,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

736
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:41,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know that these electronic cigarettes come with a lot of R&D.

737
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:54,546
[SPEAKER_04]: These are smart products and they have sensors that are designed to maximize the buzz and the amount of exposure that kids are getting with each hit.

738
01:11:58,978 --> 01:12:03,180
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a 6.6 billion dollar industry since 2007.

739
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:11,104
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see just dramatic increases in rates of sales in the last decade.

740
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:14,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And the market share is really being driven by jewel use.

741
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:20,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids are talking about these products.

742
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:23,589
[SPEAKER_04]: They are all over Twitter and social media.

743
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:29,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, tons of images that are designed to promote use to youth.

744
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:53,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, so I'll just wrap with what I believe the punchline to all of this to be, that although cannabis may have some medical properties for some users, and e-cigarettes may be a safer alternative than combustible or cigarettes for adults,

745
01:12:55,452 --> 01:13:03,698
[SPEAKER_04]: The adolescent brain is vulnerable, and we know very, very little about the use of these two products in their current form on the developing brain.

746
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:20,891
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we do know is concerning, and calls for very smart, intentional prevention messages, particularly in a time where legalization is rolling forward very, very quickly, and access is going to increase in ways that I hope we're prepared for.

747
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:24,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will wrap with that.

748
01:13:24,329 --> 01:13:30,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I welcome any questions or thoughts now, later.

749
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:32,551
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an area I feel very passionate about.

750
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:36,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a Medford resident, so I'm very committed to doing this right here.

751
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:40,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So please be in touch or feel free to ask any questions online.

752
01:13:40,674 --> 01:13:40,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

753
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:41,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

754
01:13:41,174 --> 01:13:41,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Kritz.

755
01:13:41,514 --> 01:13:44,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a simple question.

756
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Ms.

757
01:13:46,435 --> 01:13:51,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Ray, she shared an article with us over the December break, and Mr. DeLaver did as well.

758
01:13:52,542 --> 01:14:00,026
[SPEAKER_15]: And it does say that the Juul has as much nicotine as 20 cigarettes, like a pack of.

759
01:14:00,226 --> 01:14:19,476
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also, I read that what is in a vape, which is really, really, it sounds horrible, is it exposes your lungs to acriline, which is mostly used in acrylic acid, which is something that is a nail polish remover, that we would take our nail polish off with.

760
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:21,017
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what's in

761
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:25,886
[SPEAKER_15]: the vape, one of the most common ingredients, you know.

762
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:36,495
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just something that is very toxic and irritating, causes upper respiratory tract, and it's just not good, you know.

763
01:14:38,076 --> 01:14:44,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I did read that there are some schools that have, you know, the FDA has posters

764
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:46,750
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're putting them in the bathrooms.

765
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:52,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, I don't know if we have any of these posters in our bathrooms.

766
01:14:53,174 --> 01:15:01,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Or do we have any reports or numbers of what is happening in our school?

767
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:06,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it also has a little bit information about the vaping devices.

768
01:15:06,562 --> 01:15:09,604
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of schools are rolling those out.

769
01:15:09,704 --> 01:15:11,125
[SPEAKER_15]: And do they work?

770
01:15:12,128 --> 01:15:15,289
[SPEAKER_15]: do they really detect if the kids are going into the bathroom?

771
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:21,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Do these vaping devices detect the students using the vapes?

772
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:27,172
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know any of that.

773
01:15:27,432 --> 01:15:27,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

774
01:15:27,552 --> 01:15:28,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Bento?

775
01:15:28,212 --> 01:15:29,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I can speak to that.

776
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:33,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Rachel and I will be talking about some of those to answer those questions.

777
01:15:34,513 --> 01:15:40,835
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think, just quickly to say, I don't think there's enough information about the efficacy of the sensors.

778
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:42,759
[SPEAKER_21]: and how deterrent they are.

779
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,462
[SPEAKER_21]: So kids learn ways around them.

780
01:15:46,602 --> 01:15:46,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

781
01:15:47,182 --> 01:15:49,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

782
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:51,466
[SPEAKER_15]: But we'll talk about things after Dr. Schuster.

783
01:15:51,726 --> 01:16:09,639
[SPEAKER_15]: There was just one other thing I thought was really frightening is that it says that currently right now they are developing hands-free vaping hoodies and backpacks with integrated vaping delivery systems so that they could be vaping in classroom hands-free.

784
01:16:09,759 --> 01:16:10,680
[SPEAKER_15]: And we don't know.

785
01:16:11,565 --> 01:16:14,186
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's all built into their hoodie or their backpack.

786
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:16,827
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're odorless.

787
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:26,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't know how we can tell who's in a classroom who's walking down a hallway here or anywhere.

788
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,151
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just scary.

789
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:35,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say just one thing to reiterate what I said before along these lines.

790
01:16:36,153 --> 01:16:41,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with these two areas, cannabis and all narcocigarettes, are particularly

791
01:16:42,558 --> 01:16:50,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So a difficult conversation to have is because there are real potential public health benefits for some users.

792
01:16:50,966 --> 01:17:02,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So with e-cigarettes, there is promise that this is a much safer alternative for chronic adult cigarette smokers, that this is a harm reduction technique.

793
01:17:02,457 --> 01:17:05,378
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of research on it, but I think that that might be the case.

794
01:17:06,098 --> 01:17:08,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And same with medical cannabis.

795
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:13,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Some formulations of cannabis might have medical properties for some conditions.

796
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a ton of research on it, but there's not a lot of community.

797
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:24,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we talk about, I think it's just, when we're thinking about how we approach this with kids, it's not,

798
01:17:26,248 --> 01:17:34,819
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional data tactics have to be really smart and appreciating the nuance of the current state.

799
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:39,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids are being exposed to both sides of these messages.

800
01:17:44,909 --> 01:17:50,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Schuster, I just wanted to thank you for coming forward and sharing your knowledge with us.

801
01:17:50,192 --> 01:17:56,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that for me what really touched home was the increase in the potency in THC.

802
01:17:57,316 --> 01:17:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for being here tonight.

803
01:18:01,898 --> 01:18:02,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

804
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:12,284
[SPEAKER_13]: I too wanted to thank the doctor for bringing this information forward to make sure that this paperwork is on our blogs and may be sent to our PTOs.

805
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:19,964
[SPEAKER_13]: So when they have parent meetings that the education is there for them to access.

806
01:18:21,065 --> 01:18:31,488
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as our students, I think especially at our high school level, maybe during health class or whatever classes, I'm not sure exactly how this is being presented.

807
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:38,830
[SPEAKER_13]: But since it is a crisis that we need to stop now, we have to have strict policy in place

808
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:43,795
[SPEAKER_13]: and be ready to help our children make better choices.

809
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:55,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Very strict, like we do for any other toxin ingested during the school day, social probation, and help.

810
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:05,403
[SPEAKER_13]: We recently received an email as a committee by a family in the district whose child was vaping and asked for our help.

811
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And our administration reached out to that person

812
01:19:09,739 --> 01:19:11,500
[SPEAKER_13]: But if there's one, there's many.

813
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:17,782
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're getting one email, there's 100 children or families experiencing the same things.

814
01:19:18,862 --> 01:19:22,424
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother was an addict in high school and now is no longer living.

815
01:19:23,664 --> 01:19:26,185
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a different drug, and it took his life.

816
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:39,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that this is just as dangerous as what he did, because I think the effects of inhaling chemicals that we don't even know are in those vapes into your lungs and into your body

817
01:19:40,538 --> 01:19:45,120
[SPEAKER_13]: that could have the potential to be lethal for some of our children.

818
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would hate to see a family go through what my family did because of this.

819
01:19:50,922 --> 01:19:56,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm committed to working on this as a committee member and as a community member.

820
01:19:56,664 --> 01:20:02,906
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad that you live in Method, because not that you wouldn't be invested, but that pulls you in even a little tighter.

821
01:20:03,246 --> 01:20:08,648
[SPEAKER_13]: So through the next year, I'd like to have a committee, the health committee or a subcommittee,

822
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:28,112
[SPEAKER_13]: to really focus on our role as leaders in the community, not only in our schools, but in our community in general, and working with the city council and the mayor's office to make sure that our community is safe for our developing children.

823
01:20:30,612 --> 01:20:31,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Oshiro.

824
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:38,946
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the interesting factors I would like to discuss more about is vaping of cannabis oils.

825
01:20:39,346 --> 01:20:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So do we have a sense of that increase?

826
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:45,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it seems to me that's even a bigger problem.

827
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:47,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you think it's of the same magnitude?

828
01:20:47,688 --> 01:20:51,229
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not as common.

829
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So vaping is far more common.

830
01:20:58,904 --> 01:21:01,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry, I move a lot.

831
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:03,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not used to standing still.

832
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:07,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was I?

833
01:21:07,928 --> 01:21:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaping nicotine is far more common, far more ubiquitous.

834
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I think vaping marijuana is, in the use of the dabs, is more stigmatized, not as common as use of marijuana in other forms or use of nicotine.

835
01:21:26,402 --> 01:21:36,668
[SPEAKER_04]: With that said, among those who do use it, I'm very concerned about that level of THC exposure because we have no data on that.

836
01:21:37,569 --> 01:21:44,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rates that I'm seeing in the kids that I'm working with are who are not kids in treatment centers.

837
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:47,094
[SPEAKER_04]: These are high school kids in the Boston area.

838
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:53,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, the levels of exposure are unlike anything that's published right now.

839
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:59,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a sense of how the rate has been increasing?

840
01:21:59,862 --> 01:22:06,469
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't, because it is a new phenomenon that we are really just starting to ask about.

841
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:13,517
[SPEAKER_04]: So the large scale studies that we have, that we get a lot of these nationwide estimates

842
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:17,898
[SPEAKER_04]: are just starting to ask about it.

843
01:22:18,118 --> 01:22:20,978
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only the second year where we've asked about making it continue.

844
01:22:21,078 --> 01:22:23,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think in the next year we'll have that information.

845
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:24,819
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no sense?

846
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:25,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Not good information.

847
01:22:25,819 --> 01:22:30,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Not nationwide, I think, representative information about increases.

848
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

849
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Jasper, do you want to step forward to one of the microphones?

850
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:38,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Just off of my high school insight.

851
01:22:43,052 --> 01:22:45,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I've been in school since freshman year, of course.

852
01:22:48,054 --> 01:22:51,456
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been a major increase in nicotine products.

853
01:22:52,896 --> 01:22:53,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.

854
01:22:54,017 --> 01:23:00,920
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a major increase in nicotine products and weed products that I've seen, especially in this past year.

855
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest proponents of that is the

856
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:08,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Influence of media, of course, social media.

857
01:23:08,299 --> 01:23:09,400
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really hard to combat.

858
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:13,743
[SPEAKER_00]: But also just the stigma of being the cool kids, you know.

859
01:23:15,004 --> 01:23:22,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there is a lot of negativity on those who don't drool or don't use dab pens or anything.

860
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:32,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's gotten to the point where I don't use the bathrooms anymore because, I mean, like, you just walk into a cloud of smoke every time you go into the bathroom.

861
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:35,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

862
01:23:36,108 --> 01:23:40,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it definitely wasn't like this when I started my freshman year.

863
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:42,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's definitely a big problem.

864
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:45,112
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting into younger generations.

865
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:51,414
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, even my brother has seen people in fifth grade.

866
01:23:51,474 --> 01:23:52,394
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's crazy.

867
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:55,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's definitely a big problem.

868
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:58,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a single solution to it.

869
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:00,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just going to be

870
01:24:02,777 --> 01:24:03,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually don't know.

871
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:05,959
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my input on it.

872
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,363
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a lot bigger of a problem than we thought before.

873
01:24:11,003 --> 01:24:19,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, I'm not going to give specific names or anything, but I can tell you that there's definitely a major increase in this past year alone that I've seen.

874
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So just my insight.

875
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:22,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for that input, Jasper.

876
01:24:22,712 --> 01:24:23,193
[SPEAKER_11]: That's scary.

877
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:28,517
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

878
01:24:28,537 --> 01:24:28,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

879
01:24:28,717 --> 01:24:28,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone.

880
01:24:30,118 --> 01:24:31,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

881
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had mentioned deer.

882
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:50,756
[SPEAKER_03]: program and when Jasper just mentioned his brother in fifth grade which that's when we have it do you know is there a new curriculum that is being worked on that's updated with these new concerns for dear you don't know I didn't know in your work if you've come across any discussion about it

883
01:24:52,761 --> 01:25:15,498
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing I would, and I know this will come as I relinquish the microphone, what I've seen to work really well, just in my clinical experience, is having students like Jasper and having a lot of these messages

884
01:25:16,304 --> 01:25:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: come from the kids.

885
01:25:18,225 --> 01:25:32,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Having dialogue and having kids think through these problems, talk out loud, problem solve, weigh out the pros and cons, because there are pros and there are cons, and I think we owe it to them to kind of work through those together.

886
01:25:33,155 --> 01:25:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think a lot of these messages are more salient.

887
01:25:37,624 --> 01:25:50,378
[SPEAKER_04]: more powerful when they don't come from me, but maybe facilitated by me, but come from kids who are really experiencing the phenomenon.

888
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:56,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would highly encourage student participation.

889
01:25:57,065 --> 01:25:57,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

890
01:25:57,546 --> 01:26:00,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so very much for presenting to us this evening.

891
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:04,073
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we're going to have some follow-up from members.

892
01:26:04,233 --> 01:26:09,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming up next is the Medford Board of Health report on vaping response in Medford.

893
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:12,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Ann O'Connor, our Director of Public Health, will be leading the discussion.

894
01:26:13,303 --> 01:26:17,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And with her is Penny Funioli from our Board of Health, as well as Lisa Van Doyen.

895
01:26:27,484 --> 01:26:29,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Michael, did you turn off the projector?

896
01:26:29,165 --> 01:26:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, do they want it on?

897
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you putting a projector?

898
01:26:33,369 --> 01:26:34,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they are too, okay.

899
01:26:35,892 --> 01:26:36,973
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to turn it on again.

900
01:26:37,013 --> 01:26:39,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they want the projector on, sorry.

901
01:27:27,063 --> 01:27:27,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

902
01:29:48,012 --> 01:29:50,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there anything to add, Liv, before the presentation or no?

903
01:29:52,335 --> 01:29:52,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

904
01:29:53,796 --> 01:29:55,037
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all in the presentation.

905
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:55,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

906
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:00,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I can tell you about the resources that you have here, actually.

907
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:02,463
[SPEAKER_19]: So the Orange Resources, as Kate and Ms.

908
01:30:02,483 --> 01:30:09,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Barrett described, that was put together by one of our TESS students that was working with us last year.

909
01:30:09,728 --> 01:30:15,792
[SPEAKER_19]: She did a phenomenal job, terrifically, of pulling research together, looking at data,

910
01:30:16,432 --> 01:30:19,914
[SPEAKER_19]: and figuring out how best to display that.

911
01:30:20,494 --> 01:30:24,175
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have had some parents take a look at it and they had some feedback.

912
01:30:24,195 --> 01:30:25,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Some feedback was it's way too long.

913
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:34,019
[SPEAKER_19]: So we wanted to be thinking about maybe this is our grand guide, but maybe we take pieces and chunks of it and we separate them.

914
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:36,761
[SPEAKER_19]: We will be looking at that in February.

915
01:30:36,801 --> 01:30:44,844
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna be inviting folks in to talk about a campaign around prevention of marijuana, understanding marijuana,

916
01:30:45,244 --> 01:30:48,005
[SPEAKER_19]: and how it affects the whole nine.

917
01:30:48,366 --> 01:30:49,366
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll be working on that.

918
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:50,687
[SPEAKER_19]: It's starting in February.

919
01:30:50,787 --> 01:30:52,788
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna put a committee together.

920
01:30:52,868 --> 01:30:56,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Obviously anyone here who'd like to be a part of that committee, please come.

921
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,870
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll send out that message to you.

922
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:00,132
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's what you're looking at now.

923
01:31:00,152 --> 01:31:12,458
[SPEAKER_19]: The state has those nicotine addiction pamphlets, and I think it's important to really start talking about nicotine addiction, because vaping is the device and the mechanism, the actual substance

924
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:15,496
[SPEAKER_19]: is one nicotine and the other is cannabis, right?

925
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:19,779
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want to be really talking about the fact that nicotine is extremely addicting.

926
01:31:19,799 --> 01:31:27,244
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just that the tobacco... I'm taking my presentation, sorry.

927
01:31:27,324 --> 01:31:31,187
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we have other prayer bullets here that have gone out over the years that we want you to see.

928
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:38,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we can pass this around while we're waiting, too.

929
01:31:38,763 --> 01:31:44,025
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually the JUUL device, and this is a package of pods, the JUUL pods.

930
01:31:44,245 --> 01:31:54,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And Maureen, who has made us here, who has the control of Maureen, does inspections of the stores to make sure they're not selling to buy us.

931
01:31:54,528 --> 01:32:00,750
And this is actually something she, one of the stores, committed themselves to do one of the inspections.

932
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:04,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then we have a little,

933
01:32:05,415 --> 01:32:07,776
Board and I don't know what it's about.

934
01:32:07,816 --> 01:32:08,517
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't mention that.

935
01:32:08,537 --> 01:32:09,477
She showed us what we do.

936
01:32:09,497 --> 01:32:17,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year, this year's graduation, this year's graduation, next year's graduation, next year's graduation.

937
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:21,204
And some of the things we found out in the last

938
01:32:28,613 --> 01:32:37,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a great way for them to buy these things online, especially those nice gift cards.

939
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:53,018
[SPEAKER_11]: So a year or so ago, we did in plain sight in the room right next door to here, and it was eye-opening to me to see where some of these little gadgets can be hidden in an ordinary bedroom.

940
01:32:53,579 --> 01:33:01,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I was curious, I know we spoke about it about a month or so ago, is it possible to bring it back to Medford, maybe possibly in two locations even?

941
01:33:02,106 --> 01:33:06,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we are planning that with Tony and Nick Tucci as well.

942
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:08,411
[SPEAKER_20]: We have it scheduled for February 8th.

943
01:33:08,491 --> 01:33:10,153
[SPEAKER_20]: There'll be a vaping presentation

944
01:33:11,605 --> 01:33:19,652
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, 7th, February 7th, there'll be a vaping presentation with Maureen Busby and the Hidden Plains site exhibit as well.

945
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:27,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're trying out this idea of doing it during the school dance so parents can drop their kids off at the dance and then come to this presentation.

946
01:33:27,799 --> 01:33:29,561
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're trying that out as well.

947
01:33:29,621 --> 01:33:32,103
[SPEAKER_20]: And they'll be working on the flyer for that event right now.

948
01:33:32,183 --> 01:33:36,507
[SPEAKER_20]: So it should be going out and being promoted next week.

949
01:33:36,707 --> 01:33:37,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Will it just be at that one?

950
01:33:38,262 --> 01:33:42,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm hoping that this office becomes the elevator you're going to have right there.

951
01:33:43,026 --> 01:33:49,171
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would be the hope, is a place to have it, you know, the easiest to view city hall.

952
01:33:49,431 --> 01:33:53,074
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's say coming soon in the spring.

953
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:53,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

954
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I guess we're good to go, right?

955
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,660
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so thank you.

956
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:04,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm with the Medford Board of Health, Mirian O'Connor.

957
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:10,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And with me is Penny Funioli and Lisa Bandrian from our Office of Prevention and Outreach.

958
01:34:10,865 --> 01:34:25,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm going to talk to you a little bit about is just vaping overall, what's going on with that, and then what we as the Board of Health are doing through regulatory processes, as well as the state laws and other policy changes that we're trying to implement.

959
01:34:37,626 --> 01:34:50,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've heard a little bit of talk about folks thinking vaping is a safer alternative to typical traditional tobacco smoking.

960
01:34:50,332 --> 01:34:52,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is really up for debate.

961
01:34:53,074 --> 01:34:57,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really don't want people to walk away with that kind of idea.

962
01:34:57,136 --> 01:34:59,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The FDA does not approve these.

963
01:34:59,993 --> 01:35:06,058
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanisms as a deterrent to cigarette smoking, like they would the patch or other items.

964
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:10,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a message that's important to get out to the kids, because that's the first thing they'll say.

965
01:35:10,402 --> 01:35:11,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's safer than smoking cigarettes.

966
01:35:12,223 --> 01:35:14,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's safer, but not safe.

967
01:35:15,226 --> 01:35:25,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know what the chemicals are in the vapes that you're inhaling, as well as that nicotine, that level of nicotine addiction, which is really what's so scary.

968
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:36,899
[SPEAKER_05]: They are toxic and trigger inflammation linked to asthma, strokes, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.

969
01:35:37,459 --> 01:35:39,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And nicotine in and of itself is dangerous.

970
01:35:40,302 --> 01:35:44,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Inhaled nicotine increases heart rate and blood pressure, is highly addictive,

971
01:35:45,174 --> 01:35:50,255
[SPEAKER_05]: and may lead to changes in the developing adolescent brain like we just heard from Dr. Schuster.

972
01:35:50,835 --> 01:35:53,476
[SPEAKER_05]: And it may increase the risk of addiction to other drugs.

973
01:35:54,376 --> 01:36:04,859
[SPEAKER_05]: So we as parents and city officials and school administrators really need to be aware of this new and dangerous trend, but really we need to open up conversations at home and in the classroom

974
01:36:05,249 --> 01:36:06,910
[SPEAKER_05]: and keep the conversations going.

975
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Regarding the health risks of vaping, many, many students don't realize that there are chemicals like formaldehyde and other things in these vapes.

976
01:36:16,172 --> 01:36:17,793
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't realize there's nicotine.

977
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:20,513
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know about the addictive behaviors of nicotine.

978
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:25,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the discussions we need to start having and keep having with our youth.

979
01:36:27,579 --> 01:36:36,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And in addition to being an obvious violation of school policy, these discussions are vital to our young people's safety and well-being.

980
01:36:37,607 --> 01:36:39,588
[SPEAKER_05]: There are common side effects to vaping.

981
01:36:41,247 --> 01:36:45,329
[SPEAKER_05]: most commonly associated with the dehydration that the vapor causes.

982
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:58,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's dryness, dryness of mouth, of eyes, skin, lips, sensitive or bleeding gums, a cough or general throat irritations, headaches, nosebleed, and dulled ability to taste food.

983
01:36:59,858 --> 01:37:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then most commonly, side effects associated with nicotine consumption would include inability to sleep,

984
01:37:08,492 --> 01:37:16,617
[SPEAKER_05]: or unusual tiredness, ringing in the ears, constipation, racing or abnormal heart patterns, and nausea.

985
01:37:18,138 --> 01:37:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are some of the things to be aware of and like if you are noticing in a child's behaviors as well.

986
01:37:26,677 --> 01:37:39,146
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we can do on a regulatory end, well, as most of you may or may not know, the state's new tobacco 21 law just went into effect New Year's Eve.

987
01:37:39,746 --> 01:37:46,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So Medfit had already gone 21 plus back in 2016, but the state has now also caught up.

988
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And that does include the purchase of e-cigarettes as well.

989
01:37:51,194 --> 01:37:51,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's now 21.

990
01:37:54,950 --> 01:38:00,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford's tobacco laws, like I said, in September 2016, we went 21 plus.

991
01:38:01,972 --> 01:38:11,374
[SPEAKER_05]: In July of 2017, we restricted the sale of flavored tobacco products, including the electronic cigarettes, to adult stores only.

992
01:38:12,235 --> 01:38:16,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are tobacconists, which we really don't have any, but mostly what you see at the vape shops.

993
01:38:17,096 --> 01:38:21,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyone entering those stores must be 21 years of age or older.

994
01:38:21,517 --> 01:38:24,358
[SPEAKER_05]: They're supposed to show identification to enter the store itself.

995
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:38,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, in that same regulation update, we updated the minimum cigar prices for $2.50 for a single cigar and a minimum of $5 for two or more.

996
01:38:38,893 --> 01:38:44,976
[SPEAKER_05]: That was to eliminate those $0.99 cigars packaging that you saw in those stores.

997
01:38:46,076 --> 01:38:49,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We added no new stores with tobacco sales within 500 feet of a school.

998
01:38:50,638 --> 01:38:55,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We permit capped, limiting the number of the vape shops to five in Medford.

999
01:38:56,483 --> 01:39:01,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And as of today, we are at five, five permits for 21 plus stores.

1000
01:39:01,767 --> 01:39:04,329
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be no additional 21 plus stores in Medford.

1001
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:10,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And we updated the public places and smoking prohibition to also include e-cigarettes.

1002
01:39:10,915 --> 01:39:16,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So anywhere cigarettes can't be smoked, neither can vapes be done.

1003
01:39:21,344 --> 01:39:26,825
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit of a graph to show you where things are, where you can purchase them, and who can purchase.

1004
01:39:27,626 --> 01:39:37,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, the cigars and e-cigarette devices you can purchase in any convenience store, but you must be 21 years of age in Medford.

1005
01:39:38,749 --> 01:39:44,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have drug paraphernalia regulation in place as well.

1006
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:52,100
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavored products, which include the e-cigarettes, cigars, mods, and e-liquids, those are limited to the vape shops.

1007
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,403
[SPEAKER_05]: 21 years or older, that's a Board of Health reg.

1008
01:39:55,624 --> 01:39:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: The drug paraphernalia.

1009
01:39:58,678 --> 01:40:03,202
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit tricky now with the legalization of marijuana.

1010
01:40:03,702 --> 01:40:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: We may be challenged on whether or not we can actually restrict the drug paraphernalia sales, but right now they are limited to the vapes and smoke shops out of 21.

1011
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBD is something new.

1012
01:40:16,832 --> 01:40:23,957
[SPEAKER_05]: CBC does not supposed to have THC or high levels of THC in it, but they're not regulated right now.

1013
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:24,858
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

1014
01:40:25,098 --> 01:40:26,119
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what's in them.

1015
01:40:26,179 --> 01:40:30,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, it's kind of like vapes were before the FDA finally stepped in.

1016
01:40:31,983 --> 01:40:42,129
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Board of Health has restricted the sale of CBDs because I think if you've noticed recently, if you go to any convenience store, they're right there on the counter, CBD products that look like gummy beers.

1017
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:52,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, they're definitely marketing to kids just like these vape products are with their fruity flavoring and gummy beer style.

1018
01:40:52,516 --> 01:41:00,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Board of Health has put a restriction on all CBD products to 21 plus stores as well.

1019
01:41:01,102 --> 01:41:04,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will be coming off the shelves of convenience stores within the next month.

1020
01:41:12,932 --> 01:41:15,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the Medford smoking enforcement.

1021
01:41:16,114 --> 01:41:18,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So this we brought up because one of the ideas we were talking about is

1022
01:41:20,589 --> 01:41:29,451
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, smoking in schools and municipal buildings, you can, and I think at one point they might have done it for the alcohol problem back then, but you can ticket.

1023
01:41:30,471 --> 01:41:31,052
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a fine.

1024
01:41:31,112 --> 01:41:34,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, these fines are less than the Board of Health Regulation fines.

1025
01:41:34,953 --> 01:41:38,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The first violation here is $100, and the second is $150, and the third is $200.

1026
01:41:38,914 --> 01:41:45,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Board of Health Regulation smoking where prohibited is actually a $100, a $200, and a $300 fine for first, second, and third offense.

1027
01:41:53,415 --> 01:41:53,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, everyone.

1028
01:41:55,016 --> 01:41:55,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Penny Funnily.

1029
01:41:55,696 --> 01:41:59,798
[SPEAKER_19]: So every two years, we do our community care survey.

1030
01:42:00,518 --> 01:42:07,302
[SPEAKER_19]: In 2017, we added the question, have you ever used an electronic vaporizer such as an e-cigarette?

1031
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:09,983
[SPEAKER_19]: These were the results that came back.

1032
01:42:10,043 --> 01:42:20,148
[SPEAKER_19]: The high school looking at 20% of students basically said that they had tried it in their lifetime, and only 7.3% said that they were using on a regular basis.

1033
01:42:22,431 --> 01:42:22,771
[SPEAKER_19]: measure.

1034
01:42:23,611 --> 01:42:28,575
[SPEAKER_19]: But we know that this has exploded, and we're not sure what's going to come of next year.

1035
01:42:28,595 --> 01:42:31,156
[SPEAKER_19]: This year is the year that we will be doing it again, 2019.

1036
01:42:31,857 --> 01:42:37,941
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking to do that sometime in the early, late winter, early spring.

1037
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:46,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we've done is we've worked with our evaluator to update questions, and Lisa's really done a phenomenal job working with them on this.

1038
01:42:46,366 --> 01:42:47,947
[SPEAKER_19]: So she's going to talk about the questions that we added.

1039
01:42:49,672 --> 01:42:50,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, everyone.

1040
01:42:50,132 --> 01:42:51,153
[SPEAKER_20]: My name's Lisa Van Doyen.

1041
01:42:51,193 --> 01:42:58,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm the partnership for success coordinator for the City of Medford, which is a grant that we have for prescription drug prevention among high school aged youth.

1042
01:42:59,717 --> 01:43:05,520
[SPEAKER_20]: So like Penny said, I worked a lot to update our CTC server that we do every two years.

1043
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:11,082
[SPEAKER_20]: When I was updating these questions, I really was focusing a lot on vaping and marijuana questions.

1044
01:43:12,483 --> 01:43:15,746
[SPEAKER_20]: We're looking at the vaping questions that we added.

1045
01:43:16,667 --> 01:43:32,760
[SPEAKER_20]: So basically, the first two questions that we added was whether or not the youth vaped nicotine, and we were very specific to say nicotine, and then describe that as e-cigarettes, vape pens, and jewels, and how many occasions did you use that.

1046
01:43:33,601 --> 01:43:38,525
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's how many occasions did you use that in your lifetime and in the past 30 days.

1047
01:43:40,078 --> 01:43:46,422
[SPEAKER_20]: We also added a question to get to whether or not they're using flavors.

1048
01:43:46,862 --> 01:43:52,726
[SPEAKER_20]: So we wanted to know whether or not if youth are using, are smoking, what flavors are they into?

1049
01:43:52,746 --> 01:43:56,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Are they into these cherries, these creme brulee, or what have you?

1050
01:43:57,148 --> 01:44:00,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are they just, we all know that they're doing flavors, but anyway.

1051
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:09,416
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we also were interested on if they were, if they are smoking, would they still smoke if flavors were not available?

1052
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:16,740
[SPEAKER_20]: And then lastly, we asked, how harmful do they think that vaping is to their health?

1053
01:44:17,281 --> 01:44:19,161
[SPEAKER_20]: And what level of risk is that?

1054
01:44:20,422 --> 01:44:22,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you go back to the prior slide for me for just one second?

1055
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:23,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1056
01:44:24,103 --> 01:44:26,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have the breakdown 9th to 12th grade?

1057
01:44:27,084 --> 01:44:27,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do.

1058
01:44:27,624 --> 01:44:28,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it go up by 12?

1059
01:44:29,925 --> 01:44:30,486
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe so.

1060
01:44:30,586 --> 01:44:32,346
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have to look at that again to confirm.

1061
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:33,287
[SPEAKER_19]: But yes, I think it could be.

1062
01:44:33,307 --> 01:44:33,887
[SPEAKER_19]: It's higher than the 7.2.

1063
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:37,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Most data shows that it gets higher.

1064
01:44:38,262 --> 01:44:44,049
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's interesting, sometimes you'll have an 11th grade that has lower numbers than the 9th grade.

1065
01:44:44,389 --> 01:44:47,012
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's maybe that cohort, something going on.

1066
01:44:47,352 --> 01:44:49,735
[SPEAKER_19]: So usually though, it does go up as a trend.

1067
01:44:49,755 --> 01:44:49,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes?

1068
01:44:50,015 --> 01:44:57,003
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm about to talk about that.

1069
01:45:01,597 --> 01:45:05,803
[SPEAKER_19]: So marijuana, for years we've been tracking it.

1070
01:45:06,163 --> 01:45:07,465
[SPEAKER_19]: 2005 is when we started the survey.

1071
01:45:07,505 --> 01:45:11,931
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a long history of looking at this data and being able to compare apples to apples.

1072
01:45:12,311 --> 01:45:14,134
[SPEAKER_19]: But as you know, the landscape has really changed.

1073
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,971
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we had to update these questions.

1074
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:19,393
[SPEAKER_19]: So what you see here is lifetime use, 6th grade to 8th grade.

1075
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:21,175
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 3.4%.

1076
01:45:21,215 --> 01:45:22,155
[SPEAKER_19]: 30-day use, 1.2%.

1077
01:45:22,436 --> 01:45:23,636
[SPEAKER_19]: That's very low.

1078
01:45:23,857 --> 01:45:26,338
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's actually very low compared to where we started in 2005.

1079
01:45:26,759 --> 01:45:29,000
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something to be very proud of.

1080
01:45:30,341 --> 01:45:33,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Great risk of harm is another measure that we look at.

1081
01:45:33,604 --> 01:45:34,784
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's sort of like...

1082
01:45:35,965 --> 01:45:38,886
[SPEAKER_19]: shows this longer-term sense of use.

1083
01:45:39,246 --> 01:45:47,388
[SPEAKER_19]: So yes, we want to delay use, but sometimes when they have low risk of harm, they actually start using later in life, and that's something we want to keep track of as well.

1084
01:45:47,788 --> 01:45:49,448
[SPEAKER_19]: What is their sense that this is harmful?

1085
01:45:50,169 --> 01:45:59,491
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, marijuana is coming out as seemingly unharmful to these young people, and that's a concern for us, and especially where you look at

1086
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:01,558
[SPEAKER_19]: It's compared to the U.S.

1087
01:46:01,638 --> 01:46:02,018
[SPEAKER_19]: norm.

1088
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:03,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the kinds of conversations.

1089
01:46:04,021 --> 01:46:14,858
[SPEAKER_19]: How do we explain in a thoughtful way how this is going to affect them in their future if, in fact, we aren't having good conversations that are really rooted in science?

1090
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,240
[SPEAKER_19]: The science isn't there as heartedly as we want it to be.

1091
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,220
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kind of difficult.

1092
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:28,006
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the high school, you see 32% of students saying that they tried it in their lifetime, and 20% overall saying that they had tried it in the last 30 days.

1093
01:46:29,547 --> 01:46:32,648
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a steady trend across all those years.

1094
01:46:33,089 --> 01:46:37,091
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's just something to note, too, is that it really has stayed steady.

1095
01:46:37,111 --> 01:46:43,415
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a bit of a tick up and has stayed at that level since 2009 when the decriminalization law passed.

1096
01:46:45,296 --> 01:46:54,181
[SPEAKER_19]: So all in all, those numbers are actually comparatively better than other communities, but it's still something that we want to pay attention to, of course.

1097
01:46:54,602 --> 01:47:04,367
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the one survey question that we've been analyzing in the last year that we're really... For some reason, it's not showing the actual... It's kind of over it.

1098
01:47:05,948 --> 01:47:08,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you ridden with someone who's a marijuana user?

1099
01:47:10,836 --> 01:47:15,423
[SPEAKER_19]: And clearly, 30% of seniors, these seniors are no longer seniors here, right?

1100
01:47:15,663 --> 01:47:16,605
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to keep that in mind.

1101
01:47:16,645 --> 01:47:19,249
[SPEAKER_19]: These people are now in college, I think in their sophomore year.

1102
01:47:19,529 --> 01:47:25,819
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're saying, though, that they are in a car with someone actively and know that they're driving under the influence of marijuana.

1103
01:47:26,112 --> 01:47:30,494
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's going to continue to be something we should be looking at and monitoring and thinking about with our messaging.

1104
01:47:31,074 --> 01:47:38,777
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of this here kind of goes into that thing I was saying before, where we sit down and we talk about, how are we going to talk about marijuana to our community?

1105
01:47:38,997 --> 01:47:41,858
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to use these stats to really think about a baseline.

1106
01:47:42,098 --> 01:47:44,199
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we'll be looking for our new stats.

1107
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:47,160
[SPEAKER_19]: So we added a question because of this landscape.

1108
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Lisa's going to hold that.

1109
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:55,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, basically, we already have the questions about whether or not they are using marijuana in the past 30 days or in their lifetime.

1110
01:47:55,262 --> 01:48:00,343
[SPEAKER_20]: But basically, now we want to ask, how are you using marijuana if you are using marijuana?

1111
01:48:00,563 --> 01:48:11,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Either you have not used it, you smoked it in a joint, pipe, or bong, or hookah, you vaped it, vape pen, dab pen, vape mods, or you ate it in a brownie, gummy, or other cannabis edible.

1112
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:18,107
[SPEAKER_20]: So we basically just want to get a little deeper and find out how it's being used among youth.

1113
01:48:18,748 --> 01:48:21,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there like an all of the above if they did it multiple ways?

1114
01:48:21,311 --> 01:48:22,192
[SPEAKER_19]: This is check all.

1115
01:48:22,492 --> 01:48:23,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, it's check all that applies.

1116
01:48:26,895 --> 01:48:33,598
[SPEAKER_19]: So just going back, Marianne referenced the tickets that have been used for alcohol.

1117
01:48:33,878 --> 01:48:36,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, Medford has a nuisance order.

1118
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:39,541
[SPEAKER_19]: And in that nuisance order, it's a fine for underage drinking.

1119
01:48:39,941 --> 01:48:52,626
[SPEAKER_19]: With that, Detective Lakowicz and myself and Brooke Quate, we worked on this program years back with the help of the mayor to think about how can we do diversion as opposed to doing nothing.

1120
01:48:54,507 --> 01:49:01,733
[SPEAKER_19]: or going to court with a young person who's being found smoking, drinking in the woods or out in the public.

1121
01:49:02,254 --> 01:49:05,717
[SPEAKER_19]: So what they would do is they get a fine from the officer.

1122
01:49:05,797 --> 01:49:09,140
[SPEAKER_19]: The officer then offers this program to them.

1123
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:13,604
[SPEAKER_19]: They can have that fine waived if they attend our program.

1124
01:49:13,984 --> 01:49:15,005
[SPEAKER_19]: A three-hour course.

1125
01:49:15,448 --> 01:49:20,771
[SPEAKER_19]: coupled with a brief screening, which is the SBIRT screening that is being done by the schools.

1126
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,132
[SPEAKER_19]: This is 2012.

1127
01:49:23,172 --> 01:49:26,433
[SPEAKER_19]: We started this method of looking at how can we get kids help.

1128
01:49:26,473 --> 01:49:32,636
[SPEAKER_19]: So then we also were partnering with the Safe Project, which is also what the school is partnering with around substance use.

1129
01:49:32,896 --> 01:49:38,019
[SPEAKER_19]: So it kind of really matched up and mirrored what's going on at the school with what the police department do.

1130
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:41,620
[SPEAKER_19]: This program is really well organized and ready to roll.

1131
01:49:42,341 --> 01:49:44,482
[SPEAKER_19]: The issue is that the officers

1132
01:49:45,142 --> 01:49:49,625
[SPEAKER_19]: aren't really actually finding young people as readily as we think they would.

1133
01:49:50,045 --> 01:49:54,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So this program is sort of sitting there, waiting.

1134
01:49:54,668 --> 01:49:55,769
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an opportunity here.

1135
01:49:55,929 --> 01:50:01,973
[SPEAKER_19]: We could be utilizing this along with vaping, thinking about how to put some of that education.

1136
01:50:01,993 --> 01:50:12,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, first of all, adding vaping education into the curriculum, as well as really expanding it and thinking about how do you deal with smoking cessation or nicotine cessation.

1137
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:13,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it that they go to

1138
01:50:14,126 --> 01:50:17,328
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, the kind of treatment programs to someone who might be having alcohol.

1139
01:50:17,568 --> 01:50:18,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe it is.

1140
01:50:18,129 --> 01:50:19,389
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to talk to that facility.

1141
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:22,071
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's something that we could have an opportunity for.

1142
01:50:22,251 --> 01:50:22,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1143
01:50:23,812 --> 01:50:24,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1144
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:37,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't believe that's true.

1145
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:40,523
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the issue for the police department in the past

1146
01:50:43,162 --> 01:50:43,482
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in homes.

1147
01:50:43,742 --> 01:50:44,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're in homes.

1148
01:50:44,422 --> 01:50:44,843
[SPEAKER_19]: They're in homes.

1149
01:50:45,143 --> 01:50:46,803
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they're in places.

1150
01:50:46,843 --> 01:50:48,204
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not out in the exhibit.

1151
01:50:48,584 --> 01:50:55,847
[SPEAKER_19]: But the officers have, since 2009, they have been hands tied to the, they can't do much about marijuana.

1152
01:50:56,347 --> 01:51:04,430
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're like now almost, we're 10 years later, officers have not been enforcing marijuana laws at that level.

1153
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,851
[SPEAKER_19]: So since it's been decriminalized, that hasn't been happening.

1154
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:10,852
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just thinking if the plan involves

1155
01:51:13,021 --> 01:51:19,443
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is actually, that's a very good point.

1156
01:51:19,463 --> 01:51:24,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the point of this program, that this is a civic-based

1157
01:51:42,365 --> 01:51:47,487
[SPEAKER_19]: diversion program as opposed to a connected to a court diversion program, right?

1158
01:51:47,747 --> 01:51:52,790
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't go to the court unless they choose to pay a fine from a city ordinance ticket.

1159
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:56,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so it's a civic, totally different track.

1160
01:51:56,691 --> 01:51:59,193
[SPEAKER_11]: It keeps them off of the court.

1161
01:51:59,573 --> 01:51:59,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1162
01:52:00,033 --> 01:52:04,955
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's kind of like beneficial in multiple ways in that it's not a punishment.

1163
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:06,536
[SPEAKER_19]: It's about adding help.

1164
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,452
[SPEAKER_19]: as opposed to getting them in trouble.

1165
01:52:09,872 --> 01:52:15,977
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on top of that, it's civic-based, and it does not include the courts unless that individual chooses not to pay that fine.

1166
01:52:16,317 --> 01:52:21,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the school resource officer up to date on everything that Officer Lockowitz is doing with diversion?

1167
01:52:23,755 --> 01:52:25,657
[SPEAKER_19]: We are working closely with the SRO.

1168
01:52:25,677 --> 01:52:29,319
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be the answer to the bathroom issue that Jasper mentioned and other.

1169
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:32,762
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we need to meet and figure out how we can connect the two.

1170
01:52:33,082 --> 01:52:40,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's some other options that are out there about vaping diversion, both in Belmont and Georgetown.

1171
01:52:40,408 --> 01:52:49,135
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing something a little bit different where they're having young people meet with different people within the school system and engage with them.

1172
01:52:49,235 --> 01:52:53,278
[SPEAKER_19]: So in Georgetown, they're meeting with different staff members to kind of have

1173
01:52:53,598 --> 01:53:01,207
[SPEAKER_19]: more of a relationship building and get them to understand what's going on and maybe get to meet with other people that they're not usually exposed to.

1174
01:53:01,527 --> 01:53:12,740
[SPEAKER_19]: And then in Belmont, they're having you call the quit line, and they're getting you to go through a process of stages of change, which is highly recommended, of course, with anything related to treatment.

1175
01:53:14,522 --> 01:53:14,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1176
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:45,182
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was asking if the school resource officer knew about the program and how to implement it so that it could happen there.

1177
01:53:45,855 --> 01:53:48,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and do we need to set a policy?

1178
01:53:48,296 --> 01:53:49,196
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a, please.

1179
01:53:49,236 --> 01:54:13,522
[SPEAKER_13]: A policy for the superintendent, and I'll get this submitted to two, three to seven folks, so that, you know, when I'm, when a book comes out, for every parent, who's just dying next year, this is the policy, if your child's mom will be taking a class, right, and you're handling similar to a five or five series movie, then they are required to go through this program.

1180
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:22,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the program all set up and ready to run?

1181
01:54:22,051 --> 01:54:25,311
[SPEAKER_11]: It's public building based, the ticket program.

1182
01:54:26,352 --> 01:54:29,612
[SPEAKER_11]: So an officer could give a ticket in any public building.

1183
01:54:29,632 --> 01:54:38,594
[SPEAKER_11]: This would almost be outside of the normal school catching, like a principal catching someone and sending them to after school.

1184
01:54:38,614 --> 01:54:39,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Or worse.

1185
01:54:49,488 --> 01:54:57,367
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're getting a school ticket and you've been logged in and you have three tickets, you're required on a Saturday.

1186
01:55:00,982 --> 01:55:05,065
[SPEAKER_13]: do you want to speak?

1187
01:55:05,085 --> 01:55:11,069
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on.

1188
01:55:11,609 --> 01:55:18,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I don't get to speak.

1189
01:55:28,203 --> 01:55:32,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Video culture will go off whenever other toxins are going in.

1190
01:55:32,706 --> 01:55:38,471
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't want to show people's lives later on because we don't know now.

1191
01:55:38,551 --> 01:55:40,833
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a program set up in the community.

1192
01:55:40,853 --> 01:55:42,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to those community meetings.

1193
01:55:42,674 --> 01:55:44,716
I know that it is great to go.

1194
01:55:44,736 --> 01:55:53,943
And it actually runs those programs for people that have community that have received those funds.

1195
01:56:01,394 --> 01:56:07,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to comment and say that there are definitely some strict procedures that are in place.

1196
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,481
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have Saturday detention.

1197
01:56:09,941 --> 01:56:17,928
[SPEAKER_12]: There still is the social probation, which usually, if it results in a suspension or something along those lines, it's a 30-day

1198
01:56:20,593 --> 01:56:30,483
[SPEAKER_12]: social probation, the administrator, the parents come, they meet with the school administrators, whether it's the headmaster or the assistant submasters.

1199
01:56:31,163 --> 01:56:36,949
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are structures that are in place to deal with discipline.

1200
01:56:39,111 --> 01:56:43,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, with the bathroom situation, I have been speaking with

1201
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:45,861
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the assistant submasters.

1202
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:55,203
[SPEAKER_12]: And students can sometimes be very savvy in terms of where they conceal the jewels.

1203
01:56:55,763 --> 01:56:58,564
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to actually catch them in the act.

1204
01:56:59,284 --> 01:57:02,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And so sometimes it's very difficult to catch them in the act.

1205
01:57:05,606 --> 01:57:08,187
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is something that is on everyone's radar.

1206
01:57:08,247 --> 01:57:09,867
[SPEAKER_12]: They are working collaboratively.

1207
01:57:12,993 --> 01:57:19,755
[SPEAKER_12]: When they do catch it, they confiscate it immediately and they follow the disciplinary procedures that are in place.

1208
01:57:23,356 --> 01:57:23,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1209
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:42,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what

1210
01:58:00,503 --> 01:58:04,825
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe Team Medford could look into it in greater detail with Ms.

1211
01:58:04,865 --> 01:58:06,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Vento and who else?

1212
01:58:06,946 --> 01:58:07,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't see who else.

1213
01:58:08,066 --> 01:58:11,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a second on the move up.

1214
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:27,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a question on this?

1215
01:58:28,182 --> 01:58:28,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

1216
01:58:29,363 --> 01:58:30,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1217
01:58:30,704 --> 01:58:31,324
[SPEAKER_11]: No question on that.

1218
01:58:31,965 --> 01:58:34,806
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion that this be investigated further.

1219
01:58:35,146 --> 01:58:35,907
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1220
01:58:37,007 --> 01:58:37,728
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1221
01:58:38,648 --> 01:58:39,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1222
01:58:40,029 --> 01:58:40,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Russo.

1223
01:58:40,889 --> 01:58:43,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1224
01:58:43,251 --> 01:58:48,794
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is actually around, is there any evidence that punishment actually has any effect on use?

1225
01:58:50,763 --> 01:58:50,943
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1226
01:58:50,963 --> 01:58:52,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I can't.

1227
01:58:52,504 --> 01:58:53,985
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the research in front of me.

1228
01:58:54,005 --> 01:58:54,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1229
01:58:54,365 --> 01:58:55,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

1230
01:58:55,846 --> 01:58:57,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I sort of asked the question.

1231
01:58:57,467 --> 01:58:59,888
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of shaking heads out there.

1232
01:58:59,928 --> 01:59:00,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1233
01:59:00,108 --> 01:59:12,315
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, I asked the question earlier around kids who don't get to go to college because they got arrested for something that shouldn't prevent you from getting an education.

1234
01:59:12,835 --> 01:59:17,898
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just worry about a focus on detention or punishment

1235
01:59:18,716 --> 01:59:30,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if the goal is to have any impact on this, and that doesn't have an impact on it, then it's a heck of a lot of feeling good like we did something and we didn't do anything.

1236
01:59:32,321 --> 01:59:38,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's two groups of kids to worry about, the ones that are already using and the ones that aren't.

1237
01:59:39,903 --> 01:59:44,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And everything we've heard tonight from Dr. Schuster is also that,

1238
01:59:47,153 --> 02:00:04,261
[SPEAKER_09]: If we educate both groups of kids on the effects, that seems like an effective approach without detentions and getting things on your record so that you have trouble when you apply for college or getting into school brains.

1239
02:00:04,281 --> 02:00:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the state changes their minds on what they're going to do with the data.

1240
02:00:07,003 --> 02:00:11,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the feds are deciding they want the data, because we know that happens.

1241
02:00:12,405 --> 02:00:12,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just

1242
02:00:16,313 --> 02:00:22,157
[SPEAKER_09]: have a strong dislike for the disciplinary approach to things.

1243
02:00:22,737 --> 02:00:26,220
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think the most important thing is that we're looking at this on multiple levels, right?

1244
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:27,401
[SPEAKER_19]: There's universal prevention.

1245
02:00:27,741 --> 02:00:30,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody gets the same information, right?

1246
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:34,946
[SPEAKER_19]: And then folks who have already started, there needs to be some sort of tactical intervention that we're working on.

1247
02:00:35,342 --> 02:00:40,985
[SPEAKER_19]: And then folks that are using, we need to have some good, solid treatment options to get them moved towards a recovery.

1248
02:00:41,306 --> 02:00:45,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you really do have to be in recovery from nicotine.

1249
02:00:45,428 --> 02:00:47,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Nicotine is physically addicting.

1250
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:52,192
[SPEAKER_19]: And it causes a lot of harm when you just suddenly go cold turkey.

1251
02:00:52,272 --> 02:00:53,493
[SPEAKER_19]: You can get really sick and stuff.

1252
02:00:53,513 --> 02:00:56,995
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know that young people know that at this level.

1253
02:00:58,076 --> 02:00:59,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's part of what this program would have to do.

1254
02:01:00,157 --> 02:01:04,480
[SPEAKER_05]: But we really need to look at this program and tweak it, because we don't have that education component right now.

1255
02:01:05,518 --> 02:01:07,839
[SPEAKER_05]: the tactical intervention ready.

1256
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:10,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have even treatment options.

1257
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know how hard it is for folks to try to quit smoking.

1258
02:01:12,821 --> 02:01:18,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we don't know for youth, you know, the patch, the physician involvement.

1259
02:01:18,483 --> 02:01:23,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would have to be really, really thought out well, this diversion program.

1260
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:23,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

1261
02:01:24,066 --> 02:01:24,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1262
02:01:24,566 --> 02:01:25,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1263
02:01:25,686 --> 02:01:26,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1264
02:01:26,647 --> 02:01:33,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing that these products are all illegal, do we have any sense of where kids are getting them from or how the distribution networks are happening in the high schools?

1265
02:01:35,937 --> 02:01:40,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Online, the assumption is that older kids may be buying them for the younger kids.

1266
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:43,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like alcohol, same thing, right?

1267
02:01:43,442 --> 02:01:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: The kids get their hands on alcohol and it's 21 plus for alcohol.

1268
02:01:46,744 --> 02:01:47,965
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the case that Ms.

1269
02:01:48,025 --> 02:01:53,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Busby just cracked, was it just selling to a minor or was it selling to someone and then giving it to a minor?

1270
02:01:58,171 --> 02:01:58,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

1271
02:01:58,992 --> 02:01:59,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1272
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:03,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Maureen Busby, Regional Tobacco Prevention Program Coordinator.

1273
02:02:04,832 --> 02:02:14,675
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had asked me this question six months ago, I would have said the same answer, that kids are getting them from older kids, older siblings, or a kid who's already 18.

1274
02:02:14,955 --> 02:02:21,097
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the reasons we wanted to change the age here in Medford to 21, because 18-year-olds are still in high school.

1275
02:02:21,557 --> 02:02:24,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So one high school kid can get a whole bunch of them, sell them to his friends in school.

1276
02:02:24,718 --> 02:02:25,499
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens all the time.

1277
02:02:26,219 --> 02:02:30,040
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last couple of weeks, I've received countless complaints

1278
02:02:30,568 --> 02:02:41,113
[SPEAKER_01]: from parents, members of the community, members of substance abuse prevention coalitions who are telling me that this store, that store, this other store is selling to minors.

1279
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:48,577
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not just an epidemic that we were talking about in terms of addiction and all of that.

1280
02:02:48,938 --> 02:02:51,699
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an epidemic in our retail environment.

1281
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,220
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very popular products.

1282
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,541
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fairly expensive.

1283
02:02:55,945 --> 02:03:00,390
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, $15 for a pack of pods, $30 for a device everybody wants in on.

1284
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:05,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that stores that I never had a problem with are now selling to our youth.

1285
02:03:05,516 --> 02:03:12,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm now planning – I did a stakeout in Malden the other day because I got a tip that kids were going there after school, and so I'm

1286
02:03:12,728 --> 02:03:16,972
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there in my car watching the store until a fire truck pulled up and blocked my view.

1287
02:03:16,992 --> 02:03:18,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very good at it.

1288
02:03:18,913 --> 02:03:23,858
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I'm also lining up extra trained youth to do compliance checks with me.

1289
02:03:23,978 --> 02:03:29,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a list, unfortunately, of problem stores where I hear that kids are going in.

1290
02:03:30,043 --> 02:03:34,367
[SPEAKER_01]: In one store, I heard that all a kid has to do is say, you sold to my friend.

1291
02:03:34,747 --> 02:03:35,788
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the magic word.

1292
02:03:36,313 --> 02:03:38,455
[SPEAKER_01]: These are complaints I never heard before.

1293
02:03:38,695 --> 02:03:48,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And following this explosion of use, I'm now finding that I have to do something different in terms of enforcement than I was doing six months ago.

1294
02:03:48,682 --> 02:03:52,145
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is fast evolving, and it's kind of whack-a-mole.

1295
02:03:52,505 --> 02:03:53,566
[SPEAKER_01]: We figure one thing out.

1296
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:55,127
[SPEAKER_01]: We figured out flavor restriction.

1297
02:03:55,447 --> 02:03:56,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a flavor restriction here.

1298
02:03:56,888 --> 02:04:04,914
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't buy mango or creme brulee or whatever in a local convenience store, but you can still buy menthol.

1299
02:04:05,338 --> 02:04:10,482
[SPEAKER_01]: and the kids very quickly switched from the mango fruit flavored whatever to menthol.

1300
02:04:10,522 --> 02:04:15,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I see confiscated products in a local school, they're all green and blue.

1301
02:04:15,445 --> 02:04:16,726
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all mint and menthol.

1302
02:04:16,746 --> 02:04:22,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing the flavored products anymore because they're not being sold by our local convenience store.

1303
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:29,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's anecdotal, but I'm believing right now that more kids are getting them in our retail environment than I had thought.

1304
02:04:29,555 --> 02:04:31,737
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought a lot of them were getting them on the internet.

1305
02:04:31,757 --> 02:04:33,198
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't seem to be as much

1306
02:04:33,745 --> 02:04:50,237
[SPEAKER_01]: of an issue, again, I don't have data on this, this is anecdotal, received a call from a parent who said she found out her son was buying at a local vape shop, doesn't happen to be Medford, but in one of the communities that I work in, because she checked his debit card, his debit account.

1307
02:04:50,677 --> 02:04:57,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another call to a local community because this parent spotted some Uber charges on her account.

1308
02:04:58,379 --> 02:05:00,700
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Uber address was a vape shop.

1309
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:05,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So her son was taking an Uber to the vape shop to get his product.

1310
02:05:05,462 --> 02:05:06,683
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all underage kids.

1311
02:05:06,743 --> 02:05:10,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is just like in the last few weeks, it changed dramatically.

1312
02:05:10,625 --> 02:05:12,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to be giving tips.

1313
02:05:12,305 --> 02:05:22,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of saying to parents, which I was saying three months ago, watch those Amazon gift cards, now I'm going to be saying, check your son's debit account.

1314
02:05:23,184 --> 02:05:24,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Check your Uber account.

1315
02:05:24,545 --> 02:05:31,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're doing what we can, but it's fast evolving, and there's one of me in these communities.

1316
02:05:31,512 --> 02:05:40,760
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be looking for support as we go forward with boards of health to try to introduce other regulations that we're going to have to figure out as we go along.

1317
02:05:41,921 --> 02:05:48,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, as I said, you know, tackling the menthol issue, because right now you can buy menthol in a convenience store.

1318
02:05:48,027 --> 02:05:48,888
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy fruit.

1319
02:05:49,753 --> 02:05:57,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you think that it's simply the case where kids are just going into community stores, or is it just some kids have access and they're buying a bunch of it and then distributing it?

1320
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:59,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mostly the latter, I think.

1321
02:06:00,121 --> 02:06:05,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And stores, when I send a compliance check in, in fact, a kid in, I did this the other day.

1322
02:06:06,086 --> 02:06:11,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a special check on a store I get a complaint about, sent my kid in, the kid comes out, no purchase.

1323
02:06:12,231 --> 02:06:18,196
[SPEAKER_01]: As she's walking to my car, the owner comes out of the store and looks up the street and down the street.

1324
02:06:18,637 --> 02:06:19,977
[SPEAKER_01]: he busted us.

1325
02:06:20,037 --> 02:06:22,318
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew that wasn't a regular kid in that store.

1326
02:06:22,818 --> 02:06:23,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tricky.

1327
02:06:23,818 --> 02:06:27,299
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was doing a stakeout at that store to see if I could see young people going in there.

1328
02:06:27,799 --> 02:06:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm hearing is those stores that are selling, and it's not all stores, but those stores that are trying to make a buck and they're selling, they know who the safe kids are.

1329
02:06:37,841 --> 02:06:40,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the trick in trying to enforce.

1330
02:06:40,742 --> 02:06:42,662
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's the penalty for selling to a minor?

1331
02:06:42,842 --> 02:06:45,723
[SPEAKER_01]: So in all of the communities they work in, in Medford also,

1332
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:52,003
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time that a store sells to a minor, it's a $100 fine, which is basically a slap on the wrist.

1333
02:06:52,524 --> 02:07:02,069
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second time they sell in a three-year period, it's a $200 fine and a seven-day suspension of their tobacco permit, meaning they can't sell any tobacco or nicotine products.

1334
02:07:02,089 --> 02:07:04,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So that hurts a little more.

1335
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:09,032
[SPEAKER_01]: The third time they sell in a three-year period, it's a $300 fine and a 30-day suspension.

1336
02:07:09,452 --> 02:07:10,413
[SPEAKER_01]: That would hurt a lot.

1337
02:07:10,853 --> 02:07:17,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was at a meeting with Senator Lewis up at the statehouse because we were talking about what the state did a lot this year.

1338
02:07:18,136 --> 02:07:19,277
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a pharmacy ban.

1339
02:07:19,297 --> 02:07:19,877
[SPEAKER_01]: They did T21.

1340
02:07:19,917 --> 02:07:26,420
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed that vaping will now be treated like smoking because you can't vape anywhere you can't smoke.

1341
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:27,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did a lot of good things.

1342
02:07:27,941 --> 02:07:29,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Lewis said, what's next?

1343
02:07:29,642 --> 02:07:31,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about a menthol ban.

1344
02:07:31,182 --> 02:07:32,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about a whole bunch of things.

1345
02:07:33,184 --> 02:07:40,146
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that he wanted to see us all consider was higher penalties for people who sell to youth.

1346
02:07:41,067 --> 02:07:42,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our youth are getting addicted.

1347
02:07:42,947 --> 02:07:44,288
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting this product somewhere.

1348
02:07:44,668 --> 02:07:47,709
[SPEAKER_01]: The AG is investigating the internet sales.

1349
02:07:48,069 --> 02:07:51,330
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA has come, finally, last year they said this isn't a problem.

1350
02:07:51,651 --> 02:07:53,371
[SPEAKER_01]: This year they said it's a big problem.

1351
02:07:53,751 --> 02:07:58,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're coming out with, you know, they raided the Juul Lab headquarters in San Francisco.

1352
02:07:58,817 --> 02:08:00,258
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to do a lot.

1353
02:08:00,278 --> 02:08:02,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're thinking about banning flavors at the FDA level.

1354
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:03,679
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.

1355
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:05,620
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll take time.

1356
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, we need to take care of our kids right now and do what we can do.

1357
02:08:11,318 --> 02:08:13,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Which leads into our next slide.

1358
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo has a question.

1359
02:08:16,141 --> 02:08:16,462
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good?

1360
02:08:17,162 --> 02:08:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we've been talking about is what else can we do.

1361
02:08:20,284 --> 02:08:25,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the regulatory side of life, so right now all the flavored products and such are restricted to the 21 plus.

1362
02:08:26,508 --> 02:08:34,133
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to restrict the actual apparatus for the E6 to be in the 21 plus stores as well.

1363
02:08:34,882 --> 02:08:39,504
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also considering looking at a flavor restriction on menthol and mint as well.

1364
02:08:39,524 --> 02:08:42,425
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are things that are going to be on the Board of Health agenda for Tuesday.

1365
02:08:43,246 --> 02:08:45,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Updating the penalties for vendor violations.

1366
02:08:46,007 --> 02:08:46,907
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to go the 1, 2, 300.

1367
02:08:48,048 --> 02:08:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go right to the 330-day suspension.

1368
02:08:50,829 --> 02:08:55,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are things, again, we'll be talking with the Board of Health on Tuesday.

1369
02:08:55,651 --> 02:09:02,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone threw out, I think it was Bonnie when we were talking, we could impose a local sales tax on these products.

1370
02:09:03,904 --> 02:09:06,246
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're not taxed the way cigarettes are.

1371
02:09:06,366 --> 02:09:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no huge excise tax on these products.

1372
02:09:09,589 --> 02:09:12,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could impose a local sales tax.

1373
02:09:14,854 --> 02:09:15,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Russo.

1374
02:09:16,796 --> 02:09:20,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Enforcement again, we're talking about... Oh, I'm sorry.

1375
02:09:22,496 --> 02:09:30,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that you were working with the Board of Health and the communities all around us so that we're not just doing something and you just walk two minutes away to Somerville and it's totally different.

1376
02:09:30,807 --> 02:09:38,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So Somerville actually, Somerville just passed the menthol and mint restriction, the ban.

1377
02:09:39,135 --> 02:09:40,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to effect April 1st.

1378
02:09:41,156 --> 02:09:42,936
[SPEAKER_05]: The thought is there's got to be litigation.

1379
02:09:42,976 --> 02:09:46,078
[SPEAKER_05]: That big tobacco's going to come after them and take them to court on this.

1380
02:09:46,138 --> 02:09:53,820
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're kind of at a wait and see, like do we move forward or wait and see how it actually pans out in Somerville and then move forward.

1381
02:09:54,721 --> 02:09:56,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So Somerville's already moved forward.

1382
02:09:56,181 --> 02:09:58,342
[SPEAKER_05]: They've moved forward with the restriction as well.

1383
02:10:00,283 --> 02:10:03,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Malden, Melrose, the rest of us, I didn't speak.

1384
02:10:03,664 --> 02:10:05,744
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all kind of looking at the Somerville thing.

1385
02:10:05,805 --> 02:10:06,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to try to.

1386
02:10:08,519 --> 02:10:15,121
[SPEAKER_19]: To be clear though, restricting it is not really an issue because it's not saying you can't ever sell it.

1387
02:10:15,721 --> 02:10:17,621
[SPEAKER_19]: The banning is what Somerville did.

1388
02:10:17,681 --> 02:10:20,262
[SPEAKER_19]: They could not sell it at all, and that's the legal.

1389
02:10:20,282 --> 02:10:22,102
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they restricted it to 21 plus.

1390
02:10:23,042 --> 02:10:23,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Adult only plus.

1391
02:10:23,863 --> 02:10:24,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they didn't ban.

1392
02:10:24,883 --> 02:10:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's restricted to 21 plus.

1393
02:10:27,684 --> 02:10:29,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first ones to ever do that.

1394
02:10:29,244 --> 02:10:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1395
02:10:35,712 --> 02:10:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like, you wouldn't be able to buy a pack of Newports in a convenience store anymore.

1396
02:10:40,013 --> 02:10:41,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's convenience store.

1397
02:10:41,994 --> 02:10:45,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, store owners are up and off sabbaticals.

1398
02:10:49,616 --> 02:10:56,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the rest of the ideas that we're looking at is, again, maybe embedding the vaping-specific education into our diversion.

1399
02:10:58,266 --> 02:11:09,215
[SPEAKER_05]: program, and really looking at parent education as well and expanding that, explaining to parents what vaping is and how to get help, and then school policies as well.

1400
02:11:11,237 --> 02:11:11,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1401
02:11:12,738 --> 02:11:13,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1402
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:14,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Very informative.

1403
02:11:17,042 --> 02:11:17,962
Thank you.

1404
02:11:18,463 --> 02:11:24,308
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to ask Tony Ray and Rachel Perry to come forward.

1405
02:11:25,763 --> 02:11:26,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1406
02:11:26,303 --> 02:11:26,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1407
02:11:27,323 --> 02:11:27,703
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

1408
02:11:27,743 --> 02:11:27,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

1409
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:29,024
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we doing?

1410
02:11:29,044 --> 02:11:30,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy New Year.

1411
02:11:31,064 --> 02:11:32,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy New Year.

1412
02:11:32,104 --> 02:11:32,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1413
02:11:32,544 --> 02:11:35,865
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just wanted to talk a little bit about student education.

1414
02:11:35,945 --> 02:11:38,905
[SPEAKER_11]: It was probably about four or five years ago we met.

1415
02:11:55,123 --> 02:11:57,384
[SPEAKER_17]: about the opioid issues that were going on.

1416
02:11:57,744 --> 02:11:59,885
[SPEAKER_17]: We saw the vaping stuff coming down the pike.

1417
02:12:01,046 --> 02:12:05,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Really didn't see it in Medford at Medford High School until last year is when it really exploded.

1418
02:12:06,888 --> 02:12:09,970
[SPEAKER_17]: We had sat in a CBJ meeting, noticed these things were happening.

1419
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:14,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Perla asked me to come up with some lessons for 9th through 12th graders.

1420
02:12:15,212 --> 02:12:16,032
[SPEAKER_17]: We did that last year.

1421
02:12:16,052 --> 02:12:17,453
[SPEAKER_17]: There was about four lessons.

1422
02:12:17,993 --> 02:12:24,156
[SPEAKER_17]: And each grade also were involved in a contest where they came up with posters, videos,

1423
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:25,630
[SPEAKER_17]: on vaping.

1424
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:35,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we did is there was one student that won the poster contest, and we had copies of those posters made, and they were put up around high school, and then the videos were posted as well.

1425
02:12:37,456 --> 02:12:45,940
[SPEAKER_17]: Since then, as you know, we use the Michigan model, and vaping is included in those units in 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th grade.

1426
02:12:46,361 --> 02:12:50,062
[SPEAKER_17]: So those units were updated this year to include vaping as well.

1427
02:12:51,703 --> 02:12:57,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And we've also this year incorporated the CATCH curriculum, which is specifically a vaping curriculum.

1428
02:12:57,707 --> 02:13:01,269
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've been really working hard to kind of keep up with what's been going on.

1429
02:13:03,070 --> 02:13:05,392
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, that's in those four grades.

1430
02:13:05,992 --> 02:13:09,895
[SPEAKER_17]: And as information is coming out, I'm passing that information out to teachers.

1431
02:13:09,915 --> 02:13:13,297
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're really trying to keep up with the things that are going on.

1432
02:13:13,517 --> 02:13:18,320
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, one of the things that have come up is vaporware.

1433
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:21,022
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Kathy had talked a little bit

1434
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:21,953
[SPEAKER_17]: about that.

1435
02:13:21,993 --> 02:13:28,154
[SPEAKER_17]: So we basically talked about that in our CBJ meeting, handed it out to teachers so they're aware of what's coming up with PIKE.

1436
02:13:29,134 --> 02:13:32,155
[SPEAKER_17]: And as things are coming up, we're updating and updating.

1437
02:13:35,795 --> 02:13:39,496
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll just talk a little bit about some of the student supports that we have.

1438
02:13:39,536 --> 02:13:44,097
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we have universal screening through the SBIRT screening program.

1439
02:13:45,617 --> 02:13:50,358
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also, so that would be our universal lowest level of support.

1440
02:13:51,267 --> 02:13:59,454
[SPEAKER_21]: And then depending on how involved students are in this activity, we up the support.

1441
02:13:59,534 --> 02:14:10,083
[SPEAKER_21]: So from there it might go to a behavioral support plan that's developed by the school adjustment counselors, students who have been referred to them.

1442
02:14:10,343 --> 02:14:15,587
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll work with the nurses and the administration and teachers to make sure we have a support plan.

1443
02:14:15,957 --> 02:14:20,899
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the next level starts going to referrals for outside counseling.

1444
02:14:21,239 --> 02:14:26,100
[SPEAKER_21]: We're fortunate that we have a community partnership with the SAFE project.

1445
02:14:26,721 --> 02:14:41,566
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have a variable number of students each year that we refer to the SAFE project and that agree to participate and take advantage of on-site counseling for their substance abuse issues.

1446
02:14:43,606 --> 02:14:45,027
[SPEAKER_21]: We've also done a lot of

1447
02:14:46,313 --> 02:15:05,526
[SPEAKER_21]: work with professional development around social-emotional learning, and starting at young levels with healthy decision-making, learning about taking care of yourself, peer relationships, and laying the groundwork for being able to deal with peer pressure at an older age.

1448
02:15:07,928 --> 02:15:10,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Another place that we reached out to was within the community.

1449
02:15:12,858 --> 02:15:23,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Lisa Bandoyan and Penny and I, and Stacy Shulman, we put together a little brochure that was about community partnerships.

1450
02:15:23,587 --> 02:15:38,160
[SPEAKER_21]: We attended a Grand Rounds presentation at Winchester Hospital, and then we were also asked back to one of the local pediatric offices to talk about partnerships and how we can collaborate with pediatric offices

1451
02:15:38,938 --> 02:15:42,740
[SPEAKER_21]: for the better health of our students and their patients.

1452
02:15:44,541 --> 02:15:46,842
[SPEAKER_21]: We really go from a harm reduction model.

1453
02:15:47,683 --> 02:15:49,443
[SPEAKER_21]: We use motivational interviewing.

1454
02:15:49,984 --> 02:15:51,284
[SPEAKER_21]: We make these referrals.

1455
02:15:51,505 --> 02:16:01,310
[SPEAKER_21]: We're always looking at providing support and helping students owning the responsibility for changing their behavior.

1456
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:04,971
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see from the report we've done a number of

1457
02:16:06,649 --> 02:16:11,191
[SPEAKER_21]: programs in the community for staff and for parents.

1458
02:16:12,272 --> 02:16:13,993
[SPEAKER_21]: I've had a number of them listed out.

1459
02:16:14,053 --> 02:16:25,598
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one coming up in February at the McGlynn Middle School, where Nick Tucci had a very wise idea to pair it with on the night of a student dance.

1460
02:16:25,938 --> 02:16:34,323
[SPEAKER_21]: So parents can drop off their students at the dance, and they can stay and listen to a speaker inform them about vaping.

1461
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:37,861
[SPEAKER_21]: So that will be coming up in February.

1462
02:16:40,002 --> 02:16:41,803
[SPEAKER_21]: We've put website postings out.

1463
02:16:41,843 --> 02:16:45,785
[SPEAKER_21]: We get out and update the information on the web as often as we can.

1464
02:16:45,805 --> 02:16:49,788
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we have a couple grants that we've received some money for.

1465
02:16:51,749 --> 02:16:52,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1466
02:16:52,729 --> 02:16:53,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo?

1467
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:55,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1468
02:16:57,072 --> 02:17:04,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you had any conversations around going down to fifth grade, since it sounds like it's unfortunately not something

1469
02:17:05,334 --> 02:17:06,955
[SPEAKER_09]: necessarily starts in sixth grade?

1470
02:17:11,537 --> 02:17:11,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1471
02:17:12,538 --> 02:17:18,161
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the elementary schools for health education, we cover the social emotional learning unit.

1472
02:17:18,421 --> 02:17:23,344
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't covered anything else other than the Medford Police Department does go in and do the DARE unit.

1473
02:17:24,144 --> 02:17:29,687
[SPEAKER_09]: But does the Michigan model that we've purchased include anything for fifth grade on vaping that we just aren't using yet?

1474
02:17:30,067 --> 02:17:31,128
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't purchased that part.

1475
02:17:31,148 --> 02:17:32,929
[SPEAKER_17]: We only purchased the social emotional learning part.

1476
02:17:33,225 --> 02:17:34,006
[SPEAKER_17]: for elementary.

1477
02:17:34,226 --> 02:17:35,127
[SPEAKER_17]: They do have one.

1478
02:17:35,147 --> 02:17:35,968
[SPEAKER_17]: They do have one.

1479
02:17:36,128 --> 02:17:36,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1480
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1481
02:17:38,130 --> 02:17:38,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kloot.

1482
02:17:39,211 --> 02:17:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Two things.

1483
02:17:39,771 --> 02:17:45,717
[SPEAKER_02]: First, whenever I hear that there's a program at the McGlynn, which of course sounds like a great idea, being partnered,

1484
02:17:46,073 --> 02:17:49,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to ask whether it's going to be similarly at the Andrews.

1485
02:17:49,936 --> 02:17:50,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1486
02:17:50,456 --> 02:17:51,778
[SPEAKER_21]: We're working on the flyers now.

1487
02:17:51,838 --> 02:17:55,360
[SPEAKER_21]: So once those are developed, we will distribute them to both schools.

1488
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:55,560
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1489
02:17:56,061 --> 02:17:59,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second part, though, is if it's a McGlynn dance only?

1490
02:17:59,544 --> 02:18:00,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1491
02:18:01,505 --> 02:18:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on how that goes, if we're not getting Andrews parents, we should see if we could do it.

1492
02:18:08,951 --> 02:18:13,975
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is just thinking back, and I believe it was at one of the April 2017 programs,

1493
02:18:15,666 --> 02:18:18,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That incredibly great movie that was shown.

1494
02:18:20,409 --> 02:18:21,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that the screenagers?

1495
02:18:22,570 --> 02:18:23,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was the screenagers.

1496
02:18:23,791 --> 02:18:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1497
02:18:24,291 --> 02:18:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1498
02:18:25,532 --> 02:18:25,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Different.

1499
02:18:26,412 --> 02:18:27,173
[SPEAKER_02]: A little different.

1500
02:18:27,233 --> 02:18:27,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1501
02:18:29,734 --> 02:18:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1502
02:18:30,134 --> 02:18:30,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1503
02:18:30,634 --> 02:18:33,516
[SPEAKER_21]: But still, all concerns about adolescent behaviors.

1504
02:18:34,637 --> 02:18:35,497
[SPEAKER_21]: That should be shown again.

1505
02:18:36,618 --> 02:18:36,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1506
02:18:37,298 --> 02:18:38,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there any other questions?

1507
02:18:39,763 --> 02:18:40,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you both so much.

1508
02:18:40,744 --> 02:18:43,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank all of you for what an informative evening.

1509
02:18:43,546 --> 02:18:46,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope parents at home are watching or will re-watch.

1510
02:18:46,828 --> 02:18:51,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe get the buzz out that it'll be replayed a couple times because it was very informational.

1511
02:18:51,511 --> 02:18:51,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1512
02:18:52,751 --> 02:18:53,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1513
02:18:55,321 --> 02:18:56,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, is there a motion?

1514
02:18:56,422 --> 02:18:58,243
[SPEAKER_11]: We have three items, three reports.

1515
02:18:58,263 --> 02:19:02,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion to take all three and receive and place them on file?

1516
02:19:03,106 --> 02:19:03,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved by Ms.

1517
02:19:03,906 --> 02:19:05,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1518
02:19:05,787 --> 02:19:06,528
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1519
02:19:06,548 --> 02:19:06,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1520
02:19:07,328 --> 02:19:08,048
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1521
02:19:08,489 --> 02:19:09,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes, thank you very much.

1522
02:19:12,071 --> 02:19:16,033
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our item seven, fiscal year 2019 budget update.

1523
02:19:17,394 --> 02:19:17,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1524
02:19:17,894 --> 02:19:18,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Patterson.

1525
02:19:18,394 --> 02:19:18,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

1526
02:19:21,492 --> 02:19:22,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1527
02:19:22,793 --> 02:19:40,140
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a summary of the current activity for fiscal year 19, of which I've done a slightly different presentation for ease of reading the information and knowing which pieces are pertinent for our review.

1528
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:47,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Just as a summary for the wording on the original document,

1529
02:19:48,077 --> 02:19:55,782
[SPEAKER_16]: The FY19 appropriation allocation for the general fund budget was $58,608,630, of which current year-to-date expenditures and encumbrances are $30,602,875, which is 52.22%.

1530
02:19:55,902 --> 02:19:58,064
[SPEAKER_16]: So roughly half of the year has gone by.

1531
02:19:58,164 --> 02:19:59,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Half of the year has been expended.

1532
02:19:59,965 --> 02:20:00,946
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is in line with

1533
02:20:17,425 --> 02:20:19,025
[SPEAKER_16]: current historical activity.

1534
02:20:19,946 --> 02:20:25,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, encumbrances are the reserve for what we anticipate expenditures to be.

1535
02:20:26,208 --> 02:20:32,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of those may not materialize, so we do monitor those as we go throughout the rest of the fiscal year.

1536
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:39,231
[SPEAKER_16]: We try to true them up based on actual invoices and then liquidate any amounts available.

1537
02:20:39,611 --> 02:20:41,172
[SPEAKER_16]: So the encumbrance amount does

1538
02:20:43,507 --> 02:20:48,236
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes a little bit higher and lower at different points in time during the fiscal year.

1539
02:20:48,636 --> 02:20:52,243
[SPEAKER_16]: The expenditures have actually materialized, so that's a true figure.

1540
02:20:54,927 --> 02:20:56,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Significant areas for noting.

1541
02:20:57,287 --> 02:21:10,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, the fiscal year 19 has settled with negotiations on contracts for the teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrative unions, of which all have a 2% cost of living allowance for this fiscal year.

1542
02:21:11,392 --> 02:21:19,876
[SPEAKER_16]: For those units, the adjustments have already taken place with the retros provided for the start of the fiscal year.

1543
02:21:20,556 --> 02:21:24,577
[SPEAKER_16]: All of the unit steps have been applied and settled.

1544
02:21:24,597 --> 02:21:26,158
[SPEAKER_16]: The non-bargaining staff,

1545
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:31,961
[SPEAKER_16]: did also receive a 2% COLA, which was approved, and the retro payments have been issued for those.

1546
02:21:33,761 --> 02:21:47,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Within the budget itself, we did have the undistributed amount that will be adjusted and reallocated according to the deficits throughout as we left that as a placeholder for the negotiation purpose.

1547
02:21:49,186 --> 02:21:50,206
[SPEAKER_16]: For the security

1548
02:21:50,928 --> 02:22:04,717
[SPEAKER_16]: item, the FY19 budget did include additional funding for general maintenance and upkeep of security cameras, so that line item does reflect a $46,500 deficit currently.

1549
02:22:04,838 --> 02:22:09,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this is an area that I will be doing a budget adjustment to reflect chewed-up expenditures.

1550
02:22:10,702 --> 02:22:18,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Additionally, we have significant overtime expenses for additional security coverage, and that will be

1551
02:22:19,097 --> 02:22:25,682
[SPEAKER_16]: reallocated through a budget adjustment for identifying those areas that have been paid out year to date.

1552
02:22:26,503 --> 02:22:32,948
[SPEAKER_16]: So our technology areas, we did have the E-rate wiring and infrastructure project that was completed over the summer.

1553
02:22:33,609 --> 02:22:38,612
[SPEAKER_16]: And each building received additional wireless network spots.

1554
02:22:39,293 --> 02:22:47,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And significant funding was maintained for needed laptop increases and or the portable work cart

1555
02:22:49,394 --> 02:22:57,396
[SPEAKER_16]: items within each building, and that included the $15,000 for the high school, middle schools, and $10,000 for each of the elementary schools.

1556
02:22:58,996 --> 02:23:06,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And the library did have an additional $65,000 earmarked for district-wide technology as priorities come up throughout the year.

1557
02:23:06,918 --> 02:23:12,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So they are validating what the different needs are within each building as they come up.

1558
02:23:12,839 --> 02:23:18,760
[SPEAKER_16]: The transportation costs, again, we are in year one of the two-year extended contract with Eastern Bus.

1559
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:27,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Next fiscal year will be the last contract year we'll need to go out to bid for this current yellow bus transportation.

1560
02:23:28,558 --> 02:23:35,804
[SPEAKER_16]: We do provide after-school buses to the middle schools, and that is three buses per day for 70 days throughout the school year.

1561
02:23:36,445 --> 02:23:45,693
[SPEAKER_16]: We have just reduced the bus route number 18 that was for our newcomers program at the Brooks, and we have split that route between two

1562
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:56,071
[SPEAKER_16]: manageable vans to accommodate and shorten up time for those students that are transported for the newcomers program.

1563
02:23:57,373 --> 02:24:04,802
[SPEAKER_16]: The utilities we encumber based on historical years and we budget conservatively for unexpected occurrences.

1564
02:24:05,548 --> 02:24:07,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Natural gas has been favorable.

1565
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:12,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Utilization has been a little bit lower right now.

1566
02:24:12,391 --> 02:24:20,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, we haven't experienced the cold winter months yet, so we still haven't received those amounts.

1567
02:24:20,193 --> 02:24:23,955
[SPEAKER_16]: And our current year-to-date expenditures only reflect through November.

1568
02:24:24,135 --> 02:24:29,497
[SPEAKER_16]: We are a month or so in arrears for their invoices that come in through the utility companies.

1569
02:24:30,257 --> 02:24:31,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Our electricity.

1570
02:24:32,861 --> 02:24:43,269
[SPEAKER_16]: rates are significantly a little bit higher because of the marketplace, and that was, we're running about 32,000 higher than we were last year.

1571
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:56,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, we had current rates that were locked in beginning November 2018, so we will see an increase accordingly based on that rate that will go through 2021 for the supply cost.

1572
02:24:56,359 --> 02:24:56,639
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we

1573
02:25:00,301 --> 02:25:12,211
[SPEAKER_16]: continue to monitor these items within the next few months, we will be able to liquidate and or update, increase those POs as needed based on the actual utilization.

1574
02:25:12,872 --> 02:25:23,240
[SPEAKER_16]: So in summary, we are in line with all the budget projections and we will be making adjustments to cover areas that we know are going to be in a deficit.

1575
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:28,725
[SPEAKER_16]: But as you look at the detailed information provided, the summary page that

1576
02:25:29,696 --> 02:25:32,358
[SPEAKER_16]: was run, and that is based on program.

1577
02:25:32,758 --> 02:25:44,826
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is a simplified snapshot for everyone to see where we are in each program area, so meaning what departments are we spending, what are our trends in that area.

1578
02:25:45,726 --> 02:25:51,950
[SPEAKER_16]: And as a reminder, the budget itself is the total line item appropriation of the $58,608,000.

1579
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:59,912
[SPEAKER_16]: So as long as we are within those amounts, we are fine.

1580
02:26:00,012 --> 02:26:09,134
[SPEAKER_16]: The other areas are meant for the Department of Ed reporting, for our programmatic reporting, so that we know which areas are going to be significant.

1581
02:26:09,634 --> 02:26:14,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this helps us plan and project for upcoming fiscal year budgeting purposes.

1582
02:26:15,316 --> 02:26:23,518
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know that there's going to be some shifts in the upcoming year, as we've just approved major

1583
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:28,413
[SPEAKER_16]: increase in our sciences next fiscal year, we're going to see a big bubble there.

1584
02:26:28,733 --> 02:26:39,499
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is just a snapshot to make it easier to really see where we're at in the program areas versus getting in the minutia of each line item.

1585
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:45,023
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have categorically.

1586
02:26:46,244 --> 02:26:47,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1587
02:26:47,064 --> 02:26:47,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1588
02:26:48,285 --> 02:26:49,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for this report.

1589
02:26:50,588 --> 02:26:54,911
[SPEAKER_13]: So on page 3 of 10, and you might not have this answer.

1590
02:26:56,112 --> 02:26:57,233
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent might help.

1591
02:26:58,614 --> 02:27:04,278
[SPEAKER_13]: It says halfway down the page for the amount of $14,500 and the line below it $14,982.

1592
02:27:08,517 --> 02:27:12,159
[SPEAKER_13]: instructional support staff for the Brooks and for the Columbus.

1593
02:27:12,519 --> 02:27:17,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we not hire that staff or has that position been left open for any reason?

1594
02:27:17,782 --> 02:27:18,002
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1595
02:27:18,183 --> 02:27:25,587
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, there are some areas where a payroll code may not necessarily match our general ledger code.

1596
02:27:26,187 --> 02:27:27,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So in terms of

1597
02:27:28,244 --> 02:27:40,275
[SPEAKER_16]: The staffing component, they are staffed and they are... We do have one instructional support staff that's open at the Columbus right now just because we've had a recent resignation.

1598
02:27:40,896 --> 02:27:47,582
[SPEAKER_16]: But the expenditures may not necessarily line up with the actual staffing assignment.

1599
02:27:49,904 --> 02:27:52,386
[SPEAKER_13]: In the future, will those line up more?

1600
02:27:53,695 --> 02:27:56,938
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an ongoing effort to try to clean these up.

1601
02:27:57,278 --> 02:28:01,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, again, that's... I know you've been making an effort for that to happen.

1602
02:28:01,201 --> 02:28:01,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1603
02:28:01,401 --> 02:28:02,462
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, that's the goal.

1604
02:28:02,963 --> 02:28:03,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1605
02:28:03,603 --> 02:28:11,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, for the Brooks School Elementary textbooks, they still have a balance of $4,000, and the Roberts does as well.

1606
02:28:12,570 --> 02:28:20,757
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I say this is because last year at end of budget, some of the principals came forward and didn't realize there was a cutoff or didn't

1607
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:30,908
[SPEAKER_13]: didn't know enough about their budget, maybe on their part or our part for not educating them, of where they have funds to spend.

1608
02:28:31,349 --> 02:28:48,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make sure that every principal has gone over their budget, knows that they have these funds to utilize for the year, make sure that they have what they need and are not holding back from providing supplies like textbooks or staff.

1609
02:28:49,078 --> 02:28:56,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And at our monthly admin meetings as well, there is an update, and so they're being told on a monthly basis as well.

1610
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:04,901
[SPEAKER_13]: So the Roberts and the Brooks realizes they still have 4,000 each in books available for them to order for the school year?

1611
02:29:04,921 --> 02:29:05,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they are aware.

1612
02:29:06,222 --> 02:29:07,202
[SPEAKER_12]: They are definitely aware.

1613
02:29:07,222 --> 02:29:09,202
[SPEAKER_12]: No one would be surprised to see that.

1614
02:29:09,402 --> 02:29:17,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And last year we talked about sending a reminder email to all principals and department heads,

1615
02:29:17,668 --> 02:29:25,756
[SPEAKER_13]: around this time of year, so when you do your early cutoff so you can reconcile your books, that they have sufficient time to get their POs in.

1616
02:29:26,076 --> 02:29:29,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that they weren't... She said not when they're gone.

1617
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:29,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1618
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:30,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1619
02:29:30,541 --> 02:29:32,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1620
02:29:32,663 --> 02:29:33,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1621
02:29:33,484 --> 02:29:35,906
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my other questions were...

1622
02:29:36,387 --> 02:29:40,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Vocational pupil transportation, $15,000.

1623
02:29:40,728 --> 02:29:41,828
[SPEAKER_13]: We hadn't utilized that.

1624
02:29:41,888 --> 02:29:45,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that additional savings for students no longer going to college?

1625
02:29:45,729 --> 02:29:45,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1626
02:29:45,949 --> 02:29:51,830
[SPEAKER_16]: So that cost is actually incorporated within our out-of-district tuition payments.

1627
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:56,370
[SPEAKER_16]: So they invoice us for both their transportation and tuition.

1628
02:29:56,750 --> 02:29:59,951
[SPEAKER_16]: So it just hasn't been delineated separately for that cost.

1629
02:30:01,871 --> 02:30:04,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Further down that page, again, was textbooks.

1630
02:30:06,758 --> 02:30:07,778
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to move on from that.

1631
02:30:09,379 --> 02:30:18,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Math department office supplies haven't used their $500 allocation on page 7 of 10.

1632
02:30:20,741 --> 02:30:25,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I noticed, like, computer teacher at the Roberts.

1633
02:30:26,603 --> 02:30:35,445
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that was... So, again, this may be a payroll code issue that the actual

1634
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:40,212
[SPEAKER_16]: person assigned to that is being coded to another line item.

1635
02:30:40,573 --> 02:30:44,195
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not necessarily that that position is empty.

1636
02:30:45,496 --> 02:30:50,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes it's a payroll code issue that we are continuously going through the payroll codes.

1637
02:30:51,159 --> 02:30:56,943
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't necessarily tie back to one another because our payroll system is not part of our financial system.

1638
02:30:57,003 --> 02:30:58,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to crosswalk that.

1639
02:30:59,384 --> 02:31:04,267
[SPEAKER_13]: So that explains a lot of it, excluding the library, aid, and Medford High School.

1640
02:31:04,881 --> 02:31:07,502
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's probably a similar situation then?

1641
02:31:07,622 --> 02:31:08,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1642
02:31:08,202 --> 02:31:17,945
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the operation and maintenance secretary salary is also in that situation.

1643
02:31:17,985 --> 02:31:19,746
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know if it's allocated differently.

1644
02:31:19,806 --> 02:31:21,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a person in that position?

1645
02:31:22,227 --> 02:31:22,547
[SPEAKER_16]: It is.

1646
02:31:22,687 --> 02:31:26,648
[SPEAKER_16]: So hers is actually the line beneath it.

1647
02:31:26,668 --> 02:31:28,929
[SPEAKER_16]: So the $20,594 is applicable to the budget for the line above.

1648
02:31:33,380 --> 02:31:42,084
[SPEAKER_16]: And sometimes it's a matter of the function code and where the correct placement is versus where they might have been charged or budgeted previously.

1649
02:31:42,444 --> 02:31:49,227
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is an exercise that I'm going through and trying to clean up and working with City Hall.

1650
02:31:49,367 --> 02:31:50,428
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gotten much better.

1651
02:31:50,548 --> 02:31:55,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it used to be very hard to see a lot more of these.

1652
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:58,912
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of the ones I had today, again, with salary, and we don't have that program.

1653
02:31:59,855 --> 02:32:01,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the information.

1654
02:32:01,256 --> 02:32:03,138
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good to see that we're on track.

1655
02:32:03,198 --> 02:32:08,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And my only concern was making sure all department heads' needs were met for this year.

1656
02:32:08,243 --> 02:32:08,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1657
02:32:09,144 --> 02:32:09,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1658
02:32:09,304 --> 02:32:09,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandeclote.

1659
02:32:10,345 --> 02:32:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of questions.

1660
02:32:11,225 --> 02:32:11,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1661
02:32:11,686 --> 02:32:14,388
[SPEAKER_02]: First, or comments on the transportation.

1662
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that this move to two smaller vans is good for the students as well.

1663
02:32:21,723 --> 02:32:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just appreciated that we were taking that step to provide transportation for the newcomers in this new way.

1664
02:32:30,069 --> 02:32:31,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was great.

1665
02:32:32,091 --> 02:32:40,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondarily, sort of to my concern also was, as my colleague, at this time then, there is no limitation on expenditures.

1666
02:32:42,439 --> 02:32:43,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

1667
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:43,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1668
02:32:44,181 --> 02:32:44,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

1669
02:32:45,882 --> 02:32:48,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we, again, we had the same issue when we heard

1670
02:32:48,782 --> 02:32:52,904
[SPEAKER_02]: that certain people were told they couldn't spend it because they hadn't done it soon enough.

1671
02:32:53,824 --> 02:33:02,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of surprising in some ways that people are a little, especially since that's happened in the past, that they're not a little more proactive.

1672
02:33:02,188 --> 02:33:05,230
[SPEAKER_16]: And the notification was given in April and May.

1673
02:33:05,830 --> 02:33:10,572
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, if certain categories aren't spent at that time.

1674
02:33:11,733 --> 02:33:14,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to go help them spend it.

1675
02:33:15,014 --> 02:33:16,415
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not intended to just

1676
02:33:17,266 --> 02:33:18,747
[SPEAKER_16]: be wasteful in that regard.

1677
02:33:18,907 --> 02:33:26,150
[SPEAKER_16]: It's where, you know, if there's a true need or maybe they were able to combine resources with another classroom.

1678
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because we always know that there's other things that pop up throughout the school year.

1679
02:33:30,912 --> 02:33:36,574
[SPEAKER_02]: The last thing I just want to ask is you said that the business office team has been in transition and key roles.

1680
02:33:36,654 --> 02:33:45,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could provide for the school committee a list of the names of all the business office personnel and their job titles or responsibilities.

1681
02:33:46,008 --> 02:33:46,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1682
02:33:46,388 --> 02:33:47,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Christine.

1683
02:33:48,190 --> 02:33:48,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1684
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:50,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo.

1685
02:33:50,211 --> 02:33:51,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1686
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:55,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really happy to see the technology money for the equipment.

1687
02:33:56,415 --> 02:34:00,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that that's equipment that's there, but you actually can't use it.

1688
02:34:00,518 --> 02:34:02,799
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more frustrating than no equipment at all.

1689
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:09,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had one other comment of which my own.

1690
02:34:10,004 --> 02:34:15,568
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you told us this already in the transportation and the summary.

1691
02:34:16,683 --> 02:34:22,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the encumbrances are known already is why it's already at 95%, right?

1692
02:34:22,687 --> 02:34:23,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1693
02:34:23,087 --> 02:34:26,490
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other things we don't really necessarily know, so we don't have them written in.

1694
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:27,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1695
02:34:27,591 --> 02:34:28,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1696
02:34:28,511 --> 02:34:45,483
[SPEAKER_16]: And even within that line item, we will have a slight reduction because we encumbered for the entire year's worth of the yellow bus route 18, which we've now consolidated to the two smaller van vehicles that will be less.

1697
02:34:48,646 --> 02:34:49,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1698
02:34:49,327 --> 02:34:49,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1699
02:34:50,969 --> 02:34:54,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file?

1700
02:34:54,152 --> 02:34:54,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Ms.

1701
02:34:54,873 --> 02:34:55,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloop.

1702
02:34:55,894 --> 02:34:56,615
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

1703
02:34:56,635 --> 02:34:57,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1704
02:34:57,576 --> 02:34:58,297
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

1705
02:34:58,837 --> 02:34:59,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1706
02:34:59,758 --> 02:35:00,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1707
02:35:00,439 --> 02:35:01,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

1708
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:01,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1709
02:35:01,460 --> 02:35:07,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, under new business, school committee resolution.

1710
02:35:08,824 --> 02:35:13,389
[SPEAKER_11]: We at Resolve at the Medford School Committee express our sincere condolences to the family of John Welch.

1711
02:35:13,589 --> 02:35:19,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Welch helped manage facilities at the La Conte Brink and was a teacher for 37 years in Somerville.

1712
02:35:19,935 --> 02:35:20,736
[SPEAKER_11]: He will be missed.

1713
02:35:20,996 --> 02:35:32,148
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could tell you the amount of people that attended his wake was amazing and the hockey players, the hockey team showed up and they all in their jerseys and

1714
02:35:32,550 --> 02:35:33,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It was quite a tribute to him.

1715
02:35:33,971 --> 02:35:36,952
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a wonderful man, and he had an impact on so many.

1716
02:35:37,932 --> 02:35:39,913
[SPEAKER_11]: And he worked at Fenway for many, many years.

1717
02:35:39,993 --> 02:35:43,574
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could all rise and have a moment of silence on his passing.

1718
02:35:43,594 --> 02:35:53,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1719
02:35:55,979 --> 02:35:57,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And motion to adjourn.
