1
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:09,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Test one, two.

2
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:54,152
[SPEAKER_00]: started.

3
00:06:54,172 --> 00:07:02,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.

4
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:11,091
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three items on the agenda tonight, and we're going to take them a little bit out of order and

5
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:22,466
[SPEAKER_00]: start by looking at the resolution to allow the director of veteran services to offer housing incentives to veteran renters.

6
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:34,776
[SPEAKER_00]: We're joined here today by Teresa DuPont and Veronica Shaw to offer a bit of a recap of where this was at.

7
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:40,201
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an idea that veteran services director Shaw had in which

8
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:57,893
[SPEAKER_00]: she would have the ability to use extra funds that were allocated to the veteran's office to essentially have a voucher program for veteran renters so that landlords could get an extra bonus if they choose to rent out to veterans.

9
00:07:58,093 --> 00:07:59,294
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed this by legal.

10
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,815
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found that it would have complications.

11
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,756
[SPEAKER_00]: There are complications in

12
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:10,797
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the city distribute money directly to people to interested parties.

13
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:25,866
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to and Council told us that we would have to first go to a nonprofit and that led to a partnership that was largely initiated by the city staff with housing families.

14
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,628
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a memo here

15
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:36,400
[SPEAKER_00]: that housing families pass to us, which describes the outline of this program.

16
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:45,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it was not, I don't believe we only got this memo yesterday, so it wasn't distributed in the official agenda packet.

17
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:58,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fairly, so I'm just going to read it into the public record real quick, and then I'll let Teresa and Veronica speak about it and answer any questions that we might have.

18
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,540
[SPEAKER_00]: The memo from housing families as follows.

19
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:11,947
[SPEAKER_00]: As a longtime community resource partner of the city of Medford, housing families help support the Medford community by providing homelessness prevention and housing services to income eligible residents.

20
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:22,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, housing families was approached by the city of Medford's veteran service director, Veronica Shaw, city councilor and city councilor Matt Leming to propose a new partnership and a pilot veterans housing assistance program.

21
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:26,297
[SPEAKER_00]: The program would provide a rebate incentive to property owners in Medford.

22
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:30,280
[SPEAKER_00]: who lease their units to residents identifying themselves as active or retired service people.

23
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,984
[SPEAKER_00]: This program aligns with both the City of Medford and Housing Families' missions of providing housing assistance to residents.

24
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:41,108
[SPEAKER_00]: The City of Medford has already identified a funding source through the Veterans Services Office's general operating budget.

25
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:44,370
[SPEAKER_00]: This funding is required to be dispersed through an intermediary organization.

26
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Housing Families is uniquely qualified to

27
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:57,582
[SPEAKER_00]: support this program as our organization currently supports several assistance programs for Medford in the greater Boston area and are located locally in Malden.

28
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,923
[SPEAKER_00]: The intended program eligibility guidelines will be as follows.

29
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:07,406
[SPEAKER_00]: One head of household must be an active or retired service member as defined by Mass General Law Chapter 115.

30
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Property must be owner occupied by resident of Medford.

31
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:29,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, proper documentation must be submitted to verify eligibility, including but not limited to an executed lease agreement, verification of address, copy of active service documentation, or certificate of discharge as allowable by Mass General Law, Chapter 115, Section 3A, and the completed W-9 from the recipient or property owner.

32
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:34,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, program payments will be distributed in the form of a paper check.

33
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Five,

34
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:41,337
[SPEAKER_00]: property owners must apply for annual recertification to qualify for subsequent payments.

35
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:47,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Six applications will be received on a first come, first served and rolling basis until program funds are extinguished.

36
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:55,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, any remaining funds after the annual cycles will be rolled forward to provide funding for future applicants of this program.

37
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh we ask that the city council offer their support of this program.

38
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:02,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Best regards, Chief Executive Officer, Housing Families

39
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:18,772
[SPEAKER_00]: further questions from my colleagues, I'll go ahead and hand it over to Teresa Dupont and Veronica Shaw so that they can speak about this and answer any questions that we might have about it.

40
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:25,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I see, Councilor, hold on, I still need to get used to leave you.

41
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't think it's on the weird.

42
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually can't see your light.

43
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:30,200
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of blocked by the other light.

44
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,703
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, literally, the lamp is blocking the red thing.

45
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:34,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't

46
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:35,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

47
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,118
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, go ahead and press it.

48
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you press it again?

49
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:41,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

50
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:43,482
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

51
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,083
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weird.

52
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:46,363
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I'm seeing.

53
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:47,044
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

54
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:48,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

55
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:52,527
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

56
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:53,907
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

57
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Aha.

58
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

59
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:58,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knew?

60
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

61
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechanical failure.

62
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:04,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you send this out?

63
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:05,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a copy?

64
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we see copies?

65
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was distributed by the clerk.

66
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:09,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

67
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the name of the, I just don't see the, I'm looking at all of the clerk's emails right now.

68
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:17,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it under the newsletter draft or?

69
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,944
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be, I distributed it.

70
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:20,964
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the title?

71
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:22,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I sent you yesterday or today.

72
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:23,866
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the title of the email?

73
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,090
[SPEAKER_00]: News, hold on.

74
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:39,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I can get it later, but I would like a copy.

75
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should have been.

76
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I am searching through my email.

77
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:46,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the clerk can find out the subject and let me know.

78
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Documents for Community.

79
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:51,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see, did I get it?

80
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Documents for committee meeting.

81
00:12:56,074 --> 00:13:00,636
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sent to your Gmail.

82
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:02,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, to my Gmail.

83
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:03,737
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

84
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:04,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

85
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:05,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now.

86
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:13,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it only went to my Gmail.

87
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:13,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

88
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:15,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

89
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:21,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the documents for committee meeting, it should have both a copy of the Google

90
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:23,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

91
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Pending any further questions, go ahead and press the button on that.

92
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:31,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

93
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:32,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Try speaking.

94
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:33,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

95
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having us.

96
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:43,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a whole lot more to add, other than I'm very grateful that we have gotten this far with this initiative.

97
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to helping as many veteran families as we can.

98
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,054
[SPEAKER_06]: hoping that this grows.

99
00:13:51,194 --> 00:14:00,024
[SPEAKER_06]: We have other cities that are looking at this, other veterans offices that are looking to see how we do this in hopes that they can expand to their communities as well.

100
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:08,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let Teresa talk about the organization that we're working with and how that all is going to happen.

101
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:11,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Councilors.

102
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for having us.

103
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Teresa DuPont, CPA and Grant Manager here for the City.

104
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:27,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been assisting with this one as the intermediary organization who will be helping to implement the program is Housing Families, an organization that I in my CPA role

105
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:38,528
[SPEAKER_03]: work with very well and often, so we're excited that they agreed to help partner with us to implement this program, just because we already have such a great relationship with them.

106
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:47,357
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tried and true with their vetting and their eligibility intake on applications for all of their various programs.

107
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very diligent.

108
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: They're lawyers, so they're very diligent about ensuring eligibility is accurate.

109
00:14:54,604 --> 00:15:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to answer any logistical questions about how the experience would be for the landlords on the back end for applying for this.

110
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,342
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing the next on button.

111
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're can you hear me?

112
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:15,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

113
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just had a question about capacity in your office.

114
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there is it?

115
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, new.

116
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:25,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it require you to take on more?

117
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:25,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Um

118
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:34,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Since it's contracting out with housing families, which I've worked with them before too, they're really wonderful, Laura's great.

119
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:45,156
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're handling this and it's their space in your budget for them to do the work, then maybe this is a moot point, but is there anything that you're going to have to be taking on that's going to be more

120
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,603
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated or difficult or is it good totally well within your capacity?

121
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:57,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's within our capacity and largely it will be fielding people probably calling our mutual offices saying, hey, I heard about this program.

122
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:06,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would at that point, just like we do right now with, I need rental arrears assistance, I'm moving into Medford, can you help me find those costs?

123
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We explain the program to them and then point them in the direction of our partners.

124
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So our capacity at our level is minimal.

125
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:22,258
[SPEAKER_03]: To your point about their capacity on their end, they have graciously offered to execute this as a pilot program.

126
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Should, and we hope to, grow this program, find that there's a lot of need in the community and being able to, like I said, just expand the program.

127
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:45,448
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, we would probably have a conversation with them about can we supplement them with a little bit of administrative funds to help support the program on their end, like we do right now, again, with our homelessness prevention programs or legal services.

128
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:51,551
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a small portion of those grant awards that do go towards the actual administration of the program.

129
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:59,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this year, this pilot program, they're absorbing those costs because it will be pretty minimal on their end.

130
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:08,484
[SPEAKER_03]: But if all goes well, we'll give them more work to do, and then that will be something we can address with the grant award or what have you.

131
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:09,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I answer that?

132
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:10,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

133
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:21,833
[SPEAKER_06]: From my end, the biggest portion will be vetting the veterans, because I have access to be able to look at their DD214s and make sure that they are classified as veterans.

134
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:26,619
[SPEAKER_06]: that way the organization will not have to do that.

135
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,221
[SPEAKER_06]: The veterans can come through me for that portion, for vetting.

136
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

137
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:37,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair, if I may, just two thoughts I have.

138
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:48,171
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that I just know that capacity can be limited in our city hall offices in Medford, so just something I'd love to

139
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: keep in mind for for us going forward.

140
00:17:52,670 --> 00:18:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really important that we take advantage of programs like this they're really wonderful and it's a great way for us to reach out to folks who can benefit from our from

141
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,381
[SPEAKER_04]: programs that are available like this, but we should not be stretching our steps so thin that, you know, they can't operate.

142
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And that just means hiring and building our capacity.

143
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:19,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing is, is there something built in for outreach?

144
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:22,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible that I've missed it, but just letting people know about the program.

145
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:27,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a plan for letting qualified folks know about it?

146
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:40,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We hadn't really kind of planned past that, but our office is, I work in the planning department and we're the kings and queens of outreach up there.

147
00:18:40,826 --> 00:18:45,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure that we can put something together to push this out on social medias.

148
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously you can have literature in the veteran's office.

149
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:52,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you have any other thoughts about that, but we can put something robust together to push this out.

150
00:18:52,967 --> 00:19:06,556
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, I do work with a couple of real estate agents when I have veterans that are in need of VASH housing who are, one of them works, lives here in Medford and works almost exclusively with veterans.

151
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would use that person to

152
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Spread the word right now we're starting out small just to make sure that this is something that is needed.

153
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:22,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's definitely needed housing for veterans is needed, but it makes sure this is the program.

154
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:28,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start small and probably just go to those few sources and then expand.

155
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:35,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

156
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I thank you for presenting today and for coming to our meeting.

157
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:45,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I apologize, I was stuck on the bus, and the bus was a few minutes late.

158
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:51,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I ask anything that is repetitive, feel free to let me know.

159
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to say first that I'm very excited about this.

160
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:01,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is what people are asking of government.

161
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:08,173
[SPEAKER_05]: They're asking for government to be more active in helping out, in making things more accessible.

162
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:13,376
[SPEAKER_05]: People face so many difficulties with being able to rent and to afford.

163
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,318
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, live in the city.

164
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is this is a very healthy step forward.

165
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really want to thank how proactive you all have been on putting this together.

166
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess some some quick questions.

167
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:32,652
[SPEAKER_05]: The $750 annually, you might have already spoken to this.

168
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,374
[SPEAKER_05]: How did we get to that number?

169
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:40,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that's like, a maximum by law or

170
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:50,128
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a program that, as far as I could tell, all the research I did, it's never been done here in Massachusetts.

171
00:20:50,908 --> 00:21:00,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So the number, honestly, was just, if I was renting to somebody, what would make me be interested enough to rent to somebody?

172
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:12,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could give you a more scientific explanation, but that was just it, is that I wanted to come up with a number that would make it worthwhile for somebody to take a chance on a veteran.

173
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:13,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

174
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:20,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think my, I only asked that because it seems like there's going to be an ordinance change in that.

175
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:29,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was, I guess, in my approach to things, it would be better if we set a higher upper bound just to give you more flexibility you need.

176
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, does this number give you the flexibility you think you need?

177
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, so I could, I could talk about that a little bit.

178
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regards to the

179
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:44,552
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance change, the paper in front of you is the proposed language that originally was referred to this committee.

180
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:50,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was planning on talking about that a little bit after the presentation.

181
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:58,140
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have to refer that to legal so that council can say what is the best way to frame this.

182
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some proposed language and if they

183
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,964
[SPEAKER_00]: folks have any more input on sort of the maximum amount.

184
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:10,507
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also very, you know, we can be amenable to that at this stage as well.

185
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:18,032
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you have in front of you is just the previous paper version of this paper that was referred to committee that most definitely will have to be changed.

186
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:26,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also add that that the number that I came up with was based off of

187
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:35,325
[SPEAKER_06]: this budget, the money I have right now, and also based off of a small amount of landlord veteran pairings.

188
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:48,448
[SPEAKER_06]: If this program expands the way I am hoping, I definitely need to look at my budget going forward before I would even consider increasing that amount.

189
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:55,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to give more, but I definitely have to look at my budget and make sure that if I have emergencies with veterans, that can be met.

190
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,980
[SPEAKER_06]: before I talk about.

191
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my perspective on it is just that I think it should be up to you to look at your budget and determine what's the appropriate amount.

192
00:23:09,403 --> 00:23:17,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just want to avoid a situation where we're constantly coming back to the city council and asking for language changes.

193
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:24,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that we have as much flexibility built into the legal language that we pass eventually as possible.

194
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:32,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my next question is, I'm reading over the housing families doc, which again very exciting.

195
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:39,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering the eligibility guidelines is that something we wrote up or is that something that housing families has provided to us.

196
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:55,163
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that we wrote up kind of based off of other eligibility guidelines and other programs, as this is an incentive that's going to the property owner, not necessarily the tenant.

197
00:23:55,663 --> 00:24:01,986
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit more fun things in there, like the executed lease agreement, we want that on hand.

198
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:11,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's malleable, if you would like to see other criteria in there, that's certainly something we can look at, but it did come from us and blessed by housing families.

199
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:12,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

200
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:21,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think the only only one I mean I haven't thought of things to add, and generally I would love, I like guidelines to be a little bit more flexible.

201
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:31,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the only question is the owner occupancy requirement is, is, was there a reason behind it seems like there was there, there definitely was is that.

202
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:40,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want this money going to a corporation that didn't need it.

203
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:42,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it to go to Medford residents.

204
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:49,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this money to stay in Medford for Medford so that they can rent to Medford veterans.

205
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:56,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't want it to go to a corporation that didn't need it and was gonna probably turn around and kick the veteran out.

206
00:24:56,448 --> 00:25:02,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted it to make sure that residents of Medford were benefiting from this.

207
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,276
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super helpful.

208
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And I only ask that because I think sometimes people might look at a doc like this, and these are the types of emails I get.

209
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:18,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we all know the reasoning behind it, we can better explain it to our constituents.

210
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:28,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last question I had, you had mentioned us asking maybe just what the back end would look like, us working with the landlords.

211
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:32,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that'd be very helpful for us to hear as Councilors so we can explain it to people who are interested.

212
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:44,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so again, it will be if somebody calls Veronica or myself and says, hey, I want to get in on this, we would point them towards housing families for their intake of the application.

213
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:51,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm a landlord, and Veronica just told me to give a call to my friends at housing families, what I should expect.

214
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:54,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty painless intake.

215
00:25:56,748 --> 00:26:03,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Rental arrears and homelessness prevention those tend to be a little bit more invasive, they want your tax returns, they want your bank statements they want.

216
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:11,279
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, blood type of your firstborn, you know, it's a bit more invasive because there is such a financial element to this.

217
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it is an incentive, but it's ultimately, the goal isn't to give somebody money, it's to house veterans.

218
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:23,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So the intake portion of it will be relatively painless as compared to other intakes.

219
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We should just expect, again, those criteria there, the lease agreement, we will,

220
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:50,879
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm a landlord, I think the one small hurdle I might run into would just be asking my tenant, who is the military service person, would you be able to provide to me your discharge paperwork, a copy of your... I foresee that being the biggest challenge there because sometimes people just... Ship's passing in the middle.

221
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:57,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, it's pretty basic information that's being provided to housing families.

222
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Their turnaround time is usually within

223
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on the severity of the situation.

224
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:11,832
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't an emergency, I would consider it, but they typically like to turn around payments to people within a week so It's not going to get stuck up in a queue for months and months and months on end.

225
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:12,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So there.

226
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:14,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we chose housing families.

227
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:20,762
[SPEAKER_03]: They are such a great expeditious partner with lots of Expertise on their team.

228
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And one, just one quick question.

229
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:25,139
[SPEAKER_05]: That's super helpful.

230
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:26,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that explanation.

231
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:32,945
[SPEAKER_05]: My last question, I swear.

232
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:36,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any ways to measure success of the program going forward?

233
00:27:36,808 --> 00:27:38,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we tracking anything?

234
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:45,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the biggest measure of success is how many veterans and landlords were able to pair.

235
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,089
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be the truest form.

236
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:57,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't have any landlords and we don't have any veterans that are willing to work together, then it would not be a success.

237
00:27:57,454 --> 00:28:03,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't have to give us a number, but are there numbers that you have in mind of like goals?

238
00:28:04,246 --> 00:28:05,927
[SPEAKER_05]: for the upcoming years?

239
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:09,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to, again, you don't have to like, we don't want to bind ourselves to any numbers, but.

240
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

241
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have thought about it.

242
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to necessarily share them right now.

243
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:21,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see how we do because I can, I would like to be able to adjust if necessary.

244
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:22,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to lock myself into something.

245
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:35,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, that's just super helpful because I think it's something to keep in mind as we move forward in budgeting for us to help advocate for your department come budget season, you know, to make sure you have the funds you need.

246
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:36,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.

247
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and I would like this to be able to be a program that as we go, if we see issues, we can change them.

248
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:50,937
[SPEAKER_06]: If we see that we need to just tweak little things, we can do that.

249
00:28:51,098 --> 00:29:00,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And to speak to Teresa's point about DD214s is that yes, veterans don't generally like to share our documents with complete strangers.

250
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:02,585
[SPEAKER_06]: because there's a lot of personal information.

251
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,366
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that can be funneled through my office.

252
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:15,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problems being a liaison between the veteran and a landlord or the organization that's going to help us, because that is kind of a personal document and not everybody needs to see it.

253
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:17,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

254
00:29:17,176 --> 00:29:17,676
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

255
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:19,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other comments?

256
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:21,860
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can add just one more thing on that, so sorry.

257
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:29,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of our relationship with housing families as a granting agency is they do provide quarterly reporting to us.

258
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:41,026
[SPEAKER_03]: in the interim before the end of the program wraps up with the boat, we will be getting status reports, whether that's how many applications received as well as how many incentives handed out.

259
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have some hard data that we can share.

260
00:29:45,748 --> 00:29:47,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan, wait.

261
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:53,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on, I keep pressing the next on, I'm not sure what, okay.

262
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:55,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Mic on.

263
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:01,372
[SPEAKER_02]: second.

264
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:02,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's on.

265
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your work.

266
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:12,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really impressed with, you know, initiating the program, having the ideas, then finding out it's not gonna work the way you think, and then finding a way to make it work.

267
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's excellent.

268
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I am very excited about the owner occupied.

269
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:20,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's exactly the way that we want to do it.

270
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:24,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, it seems like we're all on the same page.

271
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:29,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to informally ask that you might come back to this committee in a year and just give us an update.

272
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:30,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

273
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

274
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:33,894
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

275
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:42,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So with just a couple of logistical things related to this, I'm going to share my screen really quick here.

276
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:57,988
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so in order to do this, what you have in front of you is an additional authority added under the Director of Veterans Services.

277
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:10,824
[SPEAKER_00]: The draft language was what I originally penned under the assumption that the veteran service director could do this independently.

278
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they cannot.

279
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:23,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I would propose is to replace that language with the following, which says the director of veteran services shall at their discretion and his funds are available.

280
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:31,535
[SPEAKER_00]: have the authority to partner with a nonprofit organization which may offer cash incentives of up to $750 annually to landlords who offer rental housing to veterans.

281
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:46,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the best way forward is to first discuss this language, pass it to legal counsel, and then simultaneously pass this package to the regular meeting.

282
00:31:48,390 --> 00:32:02,797
[SPEAKER_00]: to a regular council meeting, and then once we have feedback from legal, revise the language there in accordance with whatever the recommendations might be, if they have any better way to phrase this than what I came up with.

283
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:08,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Councilor Callahan.

284
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still on, how nice, how convenient.

285
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Given Councilor Tseng's suggestion, I wonder if there is a way to not tie it to $750.

286
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:30,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how we can, if there's a way to sort of craft some language that isn't gonna require us every couple of years to be like, well, that's not 750.

287
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:32,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We could potentially move it to the fee schedule.

288
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:39,213
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a solution to it so that it is,

289
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:48,452
[SPEAKER_00]: updated automatically, that could be one solution.

290
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:55,958
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that either way, this language is going to have to go by council.

291
00:32:56,379 --> 00:33:03,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am comfortable referring this to a regular council meeting and then doing

292
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:12,708
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more research and potentially revising this to go into the fee schedule, for instance, and then voting on it there.

293
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

294
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:22,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the idea of tying it to the fee schedule, personally.

295
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:35,480
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, do we have a motion on the floor to refer this to regular council and legal?

296
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

297
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,361
[SPEAKER_00]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

298
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:43,701
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

299
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:43,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

300
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:45,422
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

301
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:46,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion passes.

302
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:52,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you both very much for your work on this.

303
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:00,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will likely be looking at it at the next regular meeting.

304
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:04,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, the city council newsletter.

305
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:13,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the last minute nature that we've been sending these things out at.

306
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:18,446
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sort of doing a rotating schedule whereby different councillors

307
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:21,238
[SPEAKER_00]: draft different portions of the newsletter.

308
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:44,263
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that latest email, you should have a link to this Google Doc here, which contains the draft of Councilor Collins, as well as a couple of points that I added from late October, which events that occurred after our last meeting.

309
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:44,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,

310
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:53,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Collins version of the newsletter actually does contain a couple of

311
00:34:54,761 --> 00:35:05,328
[SPEAKER_00]: points that we are going to discuss in the meeting literally right after this, which I don't think has been done in a newsletter previously.

312
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:17,896
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that news, personally, that newsletters should report things that have already happened.

313
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:22,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But one way to get around this is to

314
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:30,702
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially approve this language contingent on what happens in the next meeting.

315
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:39,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we do, in fact, pass those, I could, with the permission of this committee, while formatting the newsletter, just change everything to the past tense.

316
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:53,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we're reporting things out, I think I would rather have more current events happen instead of waiting a month before we tell people what happened in a committee meeting that's happening today.

317
00:35:54,508 --> 00:36:05,458
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be one way to write this, even though, technically, we're, as of this moment, the things discussed in this newsletter haven't happened yet.

318
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:14,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, Councilor Callahan, I can see that your mic is still on, so I'm not.

319
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:16,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Charlie, that's what I was going to say.

320
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:18,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.

321
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:28,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we have any other specific suggestions to the content of the newsletter as it stands in this this Google document?

322
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:30,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Tseng?

323
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:38,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm not really, um, I think most of it looks good as is, if anything, it might be a little too long.

324
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:39,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but

325
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:49,374
[SPEAKER_05]: the only real content change suggestion that I had was to write out Medford Public Schools in the first paragraph.

326
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because some folks might not know what MTS is.

327
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:05,067
OK.

328
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,109
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very reasonable.

329
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

330
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: There are just a couple of, this may just be a holdover, but the Administration Finance Committee, Governance Committee just have like blank, a couple of them.

331
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:23,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's from my draft.

332
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:28,660
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just keep those there for consistency's sake, but those wouldn't be in the formatted version.

333
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I could even just delete those now for clarity.

334
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:38,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

335
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:41,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any other comments?

336
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:49,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Give folks a moment to go through it before we take any motions on this.

337
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

338
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:06,684
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're ready, I'm happy to motion to move this to the regular committee or no, we don't do that.

339
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,584
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.

340
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:20,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I think in this case, the motion would be specifically to approve it contingent upon the what is voted on in the next meeting.

341
00:38:22,296 --> 00:38:24,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Approve a contingent upon what is voted on in the next meeting.

342
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,122
[SPEAKER_00]: On the motion by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by

343
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan.

344
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:34,241
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

345
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:35,782
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

346
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:37,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion passes.

347
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:49,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very last item on the agenda is just a brief update on what's going on with the City Council listening sessions.

348
00:38:51,366 --> 00:39:03,551
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that there has been a little bit of behind the scenes activity, mainly because these listening sessions just require Councilors kind of running around and trying to coordinate with different groups, get something on the calendar.

349
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:12,675
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to go ahead and give the opportunity to Councilors Lazzaro and Callahan, who I know have been working on some of these initiatives as well.

350
00:39:13,236 --> 00:39:16,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever would like to go first, Councilor Lazzaro.

351
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:17,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

352
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:24,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We I've been communicating with Pamela Kelly of the

353
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:26,826
[SPEAKER_04]: senior center.

354
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:33,608
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a title, elder services, director of elder services.

355
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:41,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And we set up a time, consistent time to hold a listening session at the senior center in Medford.

356
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to host that the first time, but we'll have a rotating, hopefully other Councilors can rotate in.

357
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:53,136
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll have it be a consistent, ongoing session.

358
00:39:53,616 --> 00:39:59,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's gonna be Thursdays at noon once a month, starting in January at the end of January, January 30th.

359
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:17,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be a great opportunity to hear from our local seniors and make sure that folks are used to seeing city council members there at the senior center available to hear concerns and, you know,

360
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:20,768
[SPEAKER_04]: bring those concerns back to our committee.

361
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:31,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, as as we're able and looking forward to getting started with that, and we're gonna be able to put it in the senior center newsletter, so people will be aware of it leading up.

362
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:33,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

363
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:33,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.

364
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Council call him.

365
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is a little bit of an update.

366
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:53,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when we first drafted the, I think we came up with nine different ones we were hoping to do, you know, this year or so, we wanted to take advantage of our community liaisons.

367
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:54,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So we split those up.

368
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of reports back from those that will be upcoming.

369
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we also can move.

370
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:03,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the senior center is fantastic.

371
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:07,689
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had, I think, tough students in the high school.

372
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:17,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love for us to, at some point in the new year, to start doing things at each of the schools for parents of the schools.

373
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:18,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great way.

374
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:22,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's other ways for us to really get into the community.

375
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:28,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think getting out of this chamber and getting into places where folks who maybe don't come to this

376
00:41:29,073 --> 00:41:32,479
[SPEAKER_02]: room able to hear from more folks.

377
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:38,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So my two updates are that this Saturday through the

378
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:44,045
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Arab speaking, uh, liaison.

379
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're gonna do one at the library.

380
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:49,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming up Saturday at noon.

381
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:58,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, we have two potential dates for doing one through, uh, Stacey Moore, and we decided to do it at the West Medford Community Center.

382
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:07,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the two potential dates for that are, um, Saturday, December 7th at 10 or 10.30 a.m., and Saturday, January 4th at 10 or 10.30 a.m.

383
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can pick either one of those, and then I can get back to her.

384
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:12,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

385
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:23,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am very, very glad to hear that these, these issues are happening and we are

386
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,325
[SPEAKER_00]: actively reaching out to members of the community that, again, like you're saying, normally do not come into these chambers.

387
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:44,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to the reports of the listening sessions that have happened and just a brief outline of some of the feedback that we've gotten there.

388
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:47,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, yeah.

389
00:42:48,156 --> 00:42:52,579
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all very much for your wonderful work on this.

390
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:53,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan.

391
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:56,989
[SPEAKER_00]: it.

392
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

393
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

394
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would like us to choose now, like sure.

395
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:17,474
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the one for the Arab.

396
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:22,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was just gonna give my preference.

397
00:43:22,335 --> 00:43:23,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Councilor Tseng.

398
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I would prefer the 7th of December, just because I know I'll be here, and I think I might have some family obligations around the New Year's.

399
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:37,497
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know there are more councilors who might be able to attend, so.

400
00:43:38,538 --> 00:43:38,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

401
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:40,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

402
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:59,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be with Councilor Callahan at the library on Saturday for the Arab American liaison listening session, but I can't be there on the 7th of December so I but I would also be fine with like seating that to another Councilor if

403
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do the 4th, January 4th.

404
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's kind of like these sessions aren't meant to be too many.

405
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, if there were three of us, there would be a quorum of this committee and we wouldn't be able to do it.

406
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's sort of the conundrum, right?

407
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:19,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say probably December 7th would work for the West Medford Community Center if you wanted to do that one.

408
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:22,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

409
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:23,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense to me.

410
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, I don't think we, do we necessarily have to take a vote on that one?

411
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:34,192
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, okay, cool.

412
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,533
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great, sounds good.

413
00:44:47,055 --> 00:44:51,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful, all right, is there, all right, is there any public participation?

414
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing.

415
00:44:55,629 --> 00:45:02,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody bite on zoom or in the chambers, see that Teresa's knitting over there.

416
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, Councilor Callahan.

417
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:07,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

418
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:10,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few minutes.

419
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:14,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I mentioned, you know, maybe doing some at the schools.

420
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:22,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I also thought just thought we could have like a couple minutes of brainstorm since we're nearing the end of the

421
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:24,493
[SPEAKER_02]: year.

422
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:32,335
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think for parents at the schools, you know, one each at each school might be nice.

423
00:45:34,055 --> 00:45:43,938
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of maybe looking at where the lower income Medford residents are and trying to do like neighborhood ones where we flyer?

424
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:52,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Just trying to think of like, how can we reach the folks who are like, likely to come here that we don't often hear from and that we would really like to make sure that they're doing okay.

425
00:45:55,778 --> 00:46:07,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like accessing these groups is sometimes it's a matter of personal connections and trying to communicate with folks who you know might have those connections.

426
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:19,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of parents who might be able to tap into their parental networks to figure that particular one out.

427
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be one.

428
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:29,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could be something to pursue in January.

429
00:46:29,451 --> 00:46:41,677
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of students, because that was another one on our list, my thoughts on that would be you'd really have to get more formal, sort of a more formal,

430
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:53,884
[SPEAKER_00]: lines for that, like probably reaching out to the principal of Medford High to see if they're okay with it, or reaching out to student government.

431
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:56,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, I would imagine that

432
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:05,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in that case, you definitely need to have a slightly more formal.

433
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:15,870
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also just different community centers and social centers around the city, which is where the senior center idea comes from.

434
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:26,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was thinking through reaching out to groups of veterans, in which case the VFW would be a good solution for that, a good way to address that.

435
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:40,399
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I also think that we did kind of have a bit of a lull in scheduling these listening sessions over the summer because when we were scheduling our ambitious schedule, we didn't understand that it was the summer.

436
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,762
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody was really around.

437
00:47:43,102 --> 00:47:45,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something that happens.

438
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:48,087
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad to see that they're picking up now.

439
00:47:49,148 --> 00:47:56,295
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, when Councilor Lazzaro and I were brainstorming, we're like thinking of the regular sessions at the senior center.

440
00:47:56,335 --> 00:48:06,504
[SPEAKER_00]: The logic behind that was that it is an easy kind of like it is an easy month by month thing where we can put as little brain power as possible into reaching out and scheduling to a new group.

441
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a way to sort of keep it going.

442
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:10,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro.

443
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:26,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that the library, though I mean we're already doing some targeted sessions at the library but it being a space that people with young kids before they go to school, meet frequently.

444
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:35,034
[SPEAKER_04]: people, low income folks who don't have somewhere to hang out during the day will frequently go, especially when it's cold out.

445
00:48:36,516 --> 00:48:39,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to be a gathering space for the community.

446
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:54,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of different groups in the community can be, if we had capacity similar to what we're doing at the senior center, to go consistently to the library in one of the rooms and we could advertise on a regular basis, that might be something that we could do similar to what we're doing at the senior center.

447
00:48:59,680 --> 00:48:59,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

448
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,300
Cool.

449
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:00,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

450
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:05,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any motions on the floor?

451
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:07,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a second?

452
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:07,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

453
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:11,304
[SPEAKER_00]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng.

454
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:12,885
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Councilor Tseng, right?

455
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

456
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:16,126
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

457
00:49:16,146 --> 00:49:16,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

458
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:17,466
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

459
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:18,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion passes.

460
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:19,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting is adjourned.

461
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:19,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
