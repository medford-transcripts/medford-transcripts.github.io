1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,952
welcome to this special meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,453
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,633
Jamie Thompson.

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:09,814
Present.

5
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:11,494
Jim Tirani.

6
00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:12,414
Present.

7
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,235
Andre LaRue.

8
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:15,095
Present.

9
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:16,756
Yvette Velez.

10
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:19,856
Present.

11
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:20,777
Chris D'Avetta.

12
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:22,537
Present.

13
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:25,078
Mary Lee.

14
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:31,008
I think he's planning on joining, but may not be here yet.

15
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:34,689
Mike Caldera present to the quorum.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,030
Dennis, can you please kick us off?

17
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:48,854
On March 29th, 2023, Governor Haley signed into law a supplemental budget bill, which, among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the opening of the meeting on March 31st, 2025.

18
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:55,916
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at the meeting location.

19
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,796
and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

20
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:05,437
The language is documenting substantive changes to the open meeting law and extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

21
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:06,097
Thank you, Dennis.

22
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,697
Can you read the first matter, please?

23
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:10,738
970 Felsway, case 40U-2023-01,

24
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,093
continue from a night.

25
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:32,263
The resumption of consideration of the petition of the idea fells we'll see the Davis companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to that just generalize chapter 40 B for multifamily 6 story apartment development.

26
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:36,827
Look at an approximately 3.4 acres when it meant to be felt like property ID 7 dash 2 dash 10.

27
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:49,809
This proposal will be developed as approximately 289 units, consisting of 278 units of multifamily housing and 11 townhomes with 73, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

28
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,291
This hearing will discuss the draft decision and conditions.

29
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:54,035
Great.

30
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,296
Thank you, Dennis.

31
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,137
All right, folks, this is a long-running hearing.

32
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:01,659
It's been ongoing since November of last year.

33
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:12,485
The board, over the course of multiple sessions, has heard about the architecture, the civil engineering, the traffic for this project, and it's been multiple iterations.

34
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:16,627
As Dennis mentioned, the intention for today's meeting

35
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:34,682
is we're going to be focused on reviewing a draft decision, especially the proposed conditions, as well as reviewing the updated waiver list from the proponent of this project.

36
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:42,947
So this is the second to last of the scheduled hearings on this matter, or sessions of the hearing on this matter.

37
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,088
And so that will be the focus.

38
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:55,134
We will take public comment on the proposed conditions and the waivers.

39
00:02:56,835 --> 00:03:00,058
And yes, we do not intend to vote today.

40
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:08,526
So the proponent did, I believe, receive a draft of the decision recently, but hasn't had time to fully review it.

41
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:11,810
And so one of the things we'll cover in the next hearing is any

42
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,492
additional responses or feedback before the board intends to vote.

43
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,974
So that's the plan for today.

44
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:34,167
I'm planning to kick it off with the draft decision, but before I do that, I just want to check in with Pat Noon for the proponent to see if there's any other requests or suggestions before we get started.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,483
I'm Mr. Chair, members of the board.

46
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,449
Thank you again for having us this evening.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,241
I don't have anything specific to address prior to getting into what you discussed.

48
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,338
Wonderful.

49
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,618
All right, great.

50
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:57,260
So we have Attorney Haverty here who will be walking us through the proposed conditions in the decision.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,741
Dennis intends to screen share that document.

52
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:08,563
There are aspects of the decision that go beyond the conditions, but the conditions are a salient part of the decision.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,444
So that's where we're going to be focusing our time today.

54
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:15,985
The board does get a chance to review the other aspects before we make it official.

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:29,692
Yeah, with that being said, Dennis, if you could get the version that Cliff updated up in screen sharing, then we can go through the conditions section by section.

56
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,613
We'll start at the section level.

57
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:39,657
Attorney Haverty will provide some details to the board, and then we'll zoom in on particular conditions as needed.

58
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:45,580
It's a long document, so we won't be reading through it line by line verbatim in today's hearing.

59
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:55,745
Great.

60
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:58,548
You can see that.

61
00:04:58,728 --> 00:04:59,109
Thank you.

62
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:08,378
So conditions start a few pages down.

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,087
So Mr. Chair, did you want me to just run through sort of the earlier sections and just give a quick description?

64
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:20,570
Sure, yeah, actually, I think that's a good idea.

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,853
So yeah, if you could just kind of talk section by section what these are each about, that would be helpful.

66
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:36,460
Right, so the first section just lays out the procedural history, when the application was filed, the safe harbor process that

67
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:44,855
The board went through with the applicant and the housing appeals committee when the matter was remanded back to the board.

68
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:49,984
There are some blanks in here where I was looking for some information from the staff.

69
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:59,246
I did get an email just before the hearing started, but I hadn't had the opportunity to review that and fill in these blanks, but those will be filled in.

70
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:13,252
It lays out who the applicant's team was, who the board used for peer review, and just sort of gives a sense as to what exactly happened during the course of the public hearing.

71
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,994
One thing I want the board to take a look at is the

72
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:26,762
Paragraph number 14, which lists the board members and notes that all of them were attended all of the meetings during the public hearing process.

73
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:31,406
If that is not correct, just let me know so that I can make note.

74
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:38,032
If anybody availed themselves of the Mullen rule exemption, we would want to note that as well.

75
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,846
So then the second section is the jurisdictional findings.

76
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:53,354
So the way Chapter 40B works, you have to meet specific jurisdictional requirements in order to be eligible to move forward on a comprehensive permit application.

77
00:06:54,574 --> 00:07:06,363
So the first one is that the, finds that the applicant is a limited liability company, which really is a pretty simple process in which it just agrees to limit its return on profit.

78
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:15,743
The 2nd, 1 is the determination that the applicant submitted a copy of a project eligibility letter from a qualifying subsidizing agency.

79
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:25,088
The 3rd is that the applicant has the requisite site control by virtue of the quick claim deed that it submitted with its application.

80
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:31,292
And then finally, that the applicant has agreed to execute a regulatory agreement limiting its annual distributions.

81
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:41,955
The next section goes into the statutory minima set forth in the statute, and the safe harbor process.

82
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,140
It notes the fact that the

83
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:56,187
The city engaged in that safe harbor process and that it reserves its rights regarding any appeals of the committee's interlocutory determination.

84
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:04,477
So, the purpose of that is the safe harbor process that the board undertook regarding its safe harbor claim.

85
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:17,432
ended at the Housing Appeals Committee level with their interlocutory decision, the board didn't have any right to take an appeal of that determination at that time.

86
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:27,897
It requires the matter to go back to the board, complete its hearing process, and then the board needs to reiterate its claim if and when an appeal is filed with the Housing Appeals Committee.

87
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:32,959
So I just wanted to make sure I noted that in the decision and reserved the board's rights.

88
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:41,068
I did go through the other safe harbors, noting that the town does not qualify for any of them and did not assert any claims under them.

89
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,532
So then the next section is factual findings.

90
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:52,337
So this is just findings specific to the application submitted by the developer.

91
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,481
And then the next section is the conditions.

92
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,745
So starting on page...

93
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:31,380
six is the conditions subsection a general conditions so these are a list of conditions that are typical standard conditions on any chapter 40b development they list out the plans that will ultimately be the approved plans presuming that the board just decides to grant an approval of this development and i think it would be helpful for me to note that i have drafted this decision

94
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:40,920
With the presumption that the board is going to approve the project with the conditions, you know, as set forth, but of course, the board is.

95
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,902
Has the right to make whatever determination it makes.

96
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,143
These are only suggestions.

97
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,464
It's not binding you in any way, shape or form.

98
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,987
So, I've got a list of the, the.

99
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,834
Plans that were included with the original application.

100
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:07,659
There have been revisions throughout this process, and I will be looking for the applicants to provide details with regards to what the actual approved plans will be.

101
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,805
So, going just through these, you know, it's sort of setting forth the.

102
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:28,334
number of stories, the maximum heights, all of which is information I'm looking to get either from the applicant or from staff.

103
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:49,478
Then there are some conditions in here that discuss submittal of final plans, transfer of the comprehensive permit, provisions of the comprehensive permit decision binding upon successes and assigns,

104
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:55,241
All sidewalks, driveways, roads, and utilities to remain private.

105
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:05,087
I did have a question in the end of paragraph A11 with regards to the public sidewalks.

106
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,808
I'm looking for a response on that.

107
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,390
Section B is affordability.

108
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:19,108
section A, I think it would probably logically live in 11.

109
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:40,626
So there was this question raised at a prior hearing about the status of easements for the shared driveway, I guess you'd call it, on the east side of the building between the building and the

110
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:49,531
the storage facility, so is that something that would need to be added here?

111
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:56,195
Like a requirement over an easement for access?

112
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm pretty sure in the transportation conditions that we got from your peer review consultant that that's addressed there.

113
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,061
Okay, great.

114
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,283
I see Director Hunt has her hand raised as well.

115
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:29,742
Thank you, I was actually just looking at that item 11 as well and its weight worded very strongly about that the city should so I understand that the city does not want responsibility for these sidewalks, but the way it's worded seems to take that off the table.

116
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:39,317
Like if in the future the city actually wanted to take control of the sidewalks, it seems to be worded in such a way that would actually prohibit that.

117
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,559
Is that in fact true?

118
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,564
And why is it worded so strongly?

119
00:12:45,264 --> 00:13:01,592
Well, it's worded strongly to prevent an applicant from coming back to the city and trying to request that the city take ownership of sidewalks and interior roadways and things of that nature.

120
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,874
It's designed to discourage that.

121
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:10,799
It would not prohibit the town of its own volition from taking that.

122
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:13,901
That's not something that a comprehensive permit decision can do.

123
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:15,162
It wouldn't have that authority.

124
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:20,106
That being said, we can soften this language if you think that that makes sense.

125
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,886
Okay, I just, I sort of wanted to protect the city's future rights.

126
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:26,306
Sure.

127
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:40,869
And I will just, since I'm speaking in this moment on this item, the question about the public sidewalks along Myrtle, or the sidewalks along Myrtle Street is one that we should run by the DPW commissioner.

128
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:47,991
I suspect that actually the city would prefer to have those, but I would not presume to speak for him.

129
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,271
I'd like to actually ask him.

130
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:53,379
Okay.

131
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,623
And so Dennis, you'll make sure we have an answer to that by Tuesday.

132
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:02,847
Okay, great.

133
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:03,968
Got a thumbs up.

134
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,752
So section B is affordability.

135
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:10,654
These are all very standard conditions.

136
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,638
Requires 25% of the units to be affordable.

137
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:26,522
Requires units to be restricted for rent to households earning no more than the maximum income as determined by EOHLC or any substitute subsidizing agency.

138
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:42,328
Addresses certification reports from affordability monitoring agents, the execution of the regulatory agreement, the submittal of the affirmative fair housing marketing plan.

139
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:47,975
There is language in here addressing local preference.

140
00:14:49,028 --> 00:15:01,211
And I guess I did want to get the board sense as to whether or not it wanted to include this condition that would allow up to 70% of the units to be reserved for a local preference category.

141
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:09,694
I've had some boards that have represented in the past be less enthusiastic about such a provision.

142
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,454
And I've had some, you know, that are very strongly insisted on it.

143
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:14,115
It's really up to you.

144
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:16,055
Yeah.

145
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,056
So for that one, um,

146
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:36,748
Director Hunt, I know in a prior hearing, I forget if it was you or a member of your staff mentioned that the city does typically seek local preference where appropriate for projects like this.

147
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,669
And that I know that the actual

148
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:47,116
kind of evidentiary basis for justifying local preference is more of a subsidizing agency thing.

149
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:53,867
But could you just maybe speak to the city's position on whether there should be a local preference condition here?

150
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:04,493
Yes, we prefer local preference and we have standard language that we send to the state every time about the need for that.

151
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:10,975
And we have always had it approved since we've been sending it for the past four years without any issues.

152
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,697
So we're happy to provide that, but yes, it is absolutely our preference to have local preference.

153
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:28,239
It's going to be the city's responsibility to submit that language to the subsidizing agency during the final approval process so that you get to assert it.

154
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:36,925
Ultimately, it's the subsidizing agency that gets to determine if and what percentage of local preference will be applicable.

155
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:42,499
Yes, and our housing planner and our office is familiar with that process.

156
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:51,002
Dennis have just make a note that she's aware that that's necessary with this, even though it's a 40 day that it's still on her.

157
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:53,323
Great, thank you.

158
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,264
So then on this one, what I'm going to suggest to the board is.

159
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:19,457
I intend for us to go through all these conditions will hear public comment and then the board can discuss any, you know, conditions that were sort of this like more of a board choice versus a standard thing if they're leaning a certain direction or

160
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:23,961
missing conditions, so we'll do that all after we've gone through them all.

161
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:37,933
So just if you have a strong preference one way or the other on this one, especially if you would prefer not to have this condition, we can discuss that at the end.

162
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:49,259
All right, so the next section is section C, submission requirements.

163
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,063
So these are all of the materials that the applicant is going to have to submit to the board prior to commencement of construction.

164
00:17:56,683 --> 00:18:02,007
So, as the board is aware, under chapter 40B, an applicant is only required to submit preliminary plans.

165
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:09,751
when they seek a comprehensive permit and the board only gets those preliminary plans prior to issuing a comprehensive permit.

166
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:15,453
So, you need to cover yourself and make sure that you're addressing the submittals after the permit has been issued.

167
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:27,720
So, C1 talks about submittals prior to any construction or site development activities, which includes if the

168
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:36,146
City would generally require it that the applicant fund a peer review consultant to review final plans.

169
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:41,733
Requires submittal of a NIPIDES permit if applicable.

170
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:49,531
And then in subsection C, it talks about the review and administrative approval of final engineering drawings and plans.

171
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:53,333
So those are the final plans that the applicant has to submit.

172
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,474
That's the actual detailed construction plans.

173
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:01,557
It's also the final plans that are going to serve

174
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:13,012
for review by any local board or staff that would generally review for other permits and approvals.

175
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:23,782
So for instance, and we had a discussion earlier this afternoon where we were talking about DPW review and approval of sidewalk construction standards.

176
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,869
The applicant is going to have to submit final plans.

177
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:38,637
Those final plans are going to have to be reviewed by the DPW, by, you know, the Board of Health, Conservation Commission, whatever the local board

178
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:49,690
would generally review those sort of plans and implement their permitting requirements to the extent that they're not waived under this comprehensive permit.

179
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,292
And any waivers, you know, are going to be very specific.

180
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,753
They're not going to be blanket waivers.

181
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:58,856
So that's what the final plan review purpose is.

182
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:10,016
Subsection D talks about the middle of a landscaping plan, and the board and the city staff can review this.

183
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:18,841
This is sort of a standard landscaping plan review that I've included in dozens of comprehensive permit decisions.

184
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:25,565
But if you've got different language that you want to include, then that's certainly your purview.

185
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:36,873
includes the requirement for a submittal of a construction mitigation plan, addressing dust control, fill delivery schedules, stockpiling areas, and things of that nature.

186
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:45,500
Final plans in subsection F shall include all the various changes that have occurred during the hearing process.

187
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:55,748
Subsection G final plan shall show designated snow storage areas, and that's going to come up multiple actual different spots in this decision.

188
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:03,590
Provide notification to the Medford assessor's office for address and unit numbering.

189
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:23,685
And then section C2 is submittals that are required before the issuance of building permits, which includes evidence of recording of the comprehensive permit decision with a registry of deeds, evidence of final approval from the subsidizing agency, and that's something I should probably get into a little more detail.

190
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:32,823
As you're aware, at the beginning of the process, the applicant is required to get a project eligibility letter from a qualifying subsidizing agency.

191
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:42,465
In order to move forward and actually commence construction, they've got to get final approval from that subsidizing agency.

192
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:55,228
And that final approval includes all of the programmatic materials that the subsidizing agency has jurisdiction over, such as the execution of the regulatory agreement, the monitoring services agreement,

193
00:21:55,868 --> 00:22:12,177
review and approval of the affirmative fair housing marketing plan, and a number of other similar matters, all of which have to be completed before the town is actually eligible to count these units on their subsidized housing inventory.

194
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:20,322
So you want to make sure that you've got evidence that the final approval has been issued prior to the issuance of building permits.

195
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:31,623
There's some language in here about automatic sprinkler systems and showing plans confirming that that's complied with.

196
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:37,466
Obtain and file with the building commissioner a copy of all required federal, state, and other local permits.

197
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:46,630
Obtain all other necessary building, electrical, plumbing, and associated permits required to begin construction of the project as required by state law.

198
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,593
And then in parentheses, it's understood compliance with this requirement as part of the building permit process.

199
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,940
rather than required prior to the issuance of building permits.

200
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:08,930
I've actually had an applicant complain about this particular decision because they said, how can we get necessary electrical plumbing and associated permits before we get building permits when it's part of the building permit process?

201
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:20,900
So there are a number of other specific requirements of things that have to be done prior to the issuance of building permits, all of which are pretty standard.

202
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:32,870
Subsection D, construction completion, certificate of occupancy, so this details submittals that are required before a certificate of occupancy can issue.

203
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,690
I don't think we need to cover them in too much detail.

204
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:45,093
And then Section E, project design and construction.

205
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:54,337
So this gets into more of the specific details of how the project's going to be addressed.

206
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:59,281
E2 requires a construction management plan be submitted.

207
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:13,432
And E1 requires a pre-construction conference with representatives of the Medford fire department, department of public works, building commissioner, and other city staff and consultants as may be determined.

208
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:17,655
And it also requires a meeting open to all members of the public.

209
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:24,001
to review the construction schedule, hours, policies, procedures, and other neighborhood impacts.

210
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,703
And that has to be done at least 14 days prior to the start of construction.

211
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:50,568
All right, so I see an E9 that, I think this is Cliff, that has made these suggested changes.

212
00:24:50,608 --> 00:25:04,859
The applicant shall incorporate equipment for electric heating, cooling, and domestic hot water generation for the project and all electric building, as well as rooftop solar array designed to generate electricity or supplement domestic hot water generation.

213
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,141
So that was a helpful change.

214
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:20,821
E14, there's some blanks in there, and I think that getting some feedback, and I may already have received it from staff, but I haven't had the opportunity to review it yet, but this addresses the hours of construction.

215
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,464
And, I'm sorry, go ahead.

216
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:37,413
Yeah, Attorney Haverty, so the former building commissioner in the last 40B hearing we did, I vaguely recall he had some strong opinions about

217
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:58,002
language on hours of operation if i'm remembering correctly the it has to do with who's going to enforce violations whether it be building department or police so is that something you could speak to so i see you're recommending that the hours be consistent with

218
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:23,733
the hours applicable to non-40B developments in the city, but just for the board's understanding, and this is something we can check with the current building commissioner, in the event that there were some report of violations of the permitted hours and days, that enforcement action would go through the building commissioner, is that correct?

219
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,151
That is correct.

220
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:29,052
So this is ultimately a zoning permit.

221
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:38,355
Any violation of this permit goes through the standard zoning enforcement process, which begins with enforcement by the zoning enforcement officer.

222
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:53,159
If the applicant disagrees with the zoning enforcement officer, or if there is an abutter seeking zoning enforcement that the zoning enforcement officer chooses not to enforce, appeals of those decisions come to the Board of Appeals in the standard form.

223
00:26:54,437 --> 00:27:11,371
And so in the absence of such a condition that expressly stated that ours would, and if there weren't a waiver to the contrary, then it would just be governed by the city ordinance on this.

224
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:11,932
Is that right?

225
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:12,953
Correct.

226
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,555
And this condition should be consistent.

227
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:17,416
with the city ordinance.

228
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:23,963
The board is not allowed to treat a subsidized housing project differently than an unsubsidized housing project.

229
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:31,852
So the hours of operation should be exactly the same for this as any other construction project in town, in city, sorry.

230
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:45,531
Okay, but so the advantage of codifying this in a condition rather than falling back to the ordinance would be that in the event that there was a violation and a disagreement, it would ultimately come back to the board.

231
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:52,796
So it's sort of reserving board discretion to arbitrate any disagreement on this matter?

232
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:58,340
Is that- Well, one way or the other, an appeal would come to the board.

233
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:06,681
The advantage of actually setting forth the hours of operation in your decision is that it's there.

234
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:13,125
You don't have to look in multiple different sources to try to figure out what can and cannot be done with this.

235
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:19,308
It's all in one decision, which is why it's as comprehensive as it is.

236
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,109
We haven't even gotten to the waivers and we're already at 31 pages.

237
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:34,794
There's a lot of information in here, but it helps to have it all in one document rather than having to search through and try to figure out what exactly is the applicable rule.

238
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,302
Great, thank you.

239
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:40,743
Mr. Haverty, just a question or a minor comment.

240
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,223
Sure.

241
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:49,065
Sorry if it's already in there and I didn't notice it, but could you explicitly reference the Medford Health Department as well?

242
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:59,167
Because I think they're responsible for noise, air quality, and things like that.

243
00:28:59,247 --> 00:29:02,807
So I think like rodent control and et cetera.

244
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,528
Yeah, I can absolutely add that.

245
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:06,383
Thank you.

246
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:07,604
Welcome.

247
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:21,857
Okay.

248
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:31,898
So, actually, there's, you know, there's a condition E17 that talks about dumpsters serving the project.

249
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:36,621
I could probably get something in there about the health department in that condition.

250
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:46,927
There's also a condition addressing noise and requirements to comply with the DEP noise policy.

251
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,909
Yeah, and I think there was a, in the, you mentioned the pre-construction meeting.

252
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:54,791
I just think that, like, the health department should be part of that.

253
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,172
That was, I think, further up.

254
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:57,085
Yep.

255
00:29:57,125 --> 00:30:03,950
All right.

256
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,552
I had made a note and I will add that.

257
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:06,973
Thank you.

258
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:14,799
All right.

259
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:20,403
So I'm seeing at the end of section E that there are a number of suggested conditions that Cliff has added.

260
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:25,287
All rooftop equipment shall be screened so as to not be visible from any public way.

261
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,405
Open spaces along Myrtle Street and Amaranth Avenue shall be available for use by the public.

262
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:38,072
The applicant shall explore opportunities for incorporating public art into the development, e.g.

263
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,894
murals, outdoor sculptures.

264
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:47,383
Proposals shall be reviewed by, that should be the board or town staff, really depending on

265
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,289
what the board wants to do there.

266
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:55,790
And documentation for approved proposal shall be included in the documents submitted for permitting.

267
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,331
So that should be in the final plans.

268
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:03,492
Project plans shall include appropriate accommodations for future connections to the potential rail trail.

269
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:12,655
I think that's also in the conditions under the transportation system that were provided by your traffic peer review consultant.

270
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,093
So so on the 30.

271
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:20,298
I would love to check in with city staff if they have a recommendation on.

272
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,661
Which department would be the logical.

273
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,644
Reviewer of those opportunities.

274
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,207
Maybe that's something you could speak to director on.

275
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:41,155
Sorry, similar condition and.

276
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:46,315
previous 40 B. So with the language that we used in that, so I think there was something fairly similar.

277
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:48,536
I just don't want to look at it now while I'm doing a screen share.

278
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:53,378
But I can look that up in a minute and see what language we used in that and let you know.

279
00:31:54,099 --> 00:32:04,264
My recollection is that one was a little bit more specific in part because of some of the additional discussions about the type of public art.

280
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:10,687
So I think it referenced some local, like a local nonprofit or something of that nature.

281
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:25,796
So yeah, I mean, I'm happy to discuss anything the board would like in that area, but I would like to know if it were the city reviewing rather than the board, like who would be logical to review that.

282
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:31,037
So the Medford Arts Council is an appointed body of the city of Medford.

283
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:37,583
So that could be, they don't really have regulatory authority over anything.

284
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:41,607
They are more of a granting body, but they are artists appointed by the mayor.

285
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:44,830
So it's appropriate to me.

286
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:46,432
Okay, Medford.

287
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:47,392
What is that name again?

288
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,715
Medford Arts Council.

289
00:32:59,004 --> 00:32:59,344
Okay.

290
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:14,576
All right, the next section is traffic, traffic safety conditions, sidewalks.

291
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:20,200
There was a significant amount of feedback from your peer review consultants.

292
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:30,358
The majority of these conditions came from your peer review consultant addressing issues that were raised during the public hearing.

293
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:36,602
I don't know if there's anything specific that you wanted to cover here.

294
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:49,651
I do note in F9, the condition suggested was accommodations shall be provided to support telecommuting by residents of the project.

295
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,453
And that just seemed very vague.

296
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:56,256
So I didn't know if we wanted to be more specific with that.

297
00:33:57,657 --> 00:34:18,852
So I saw in something, I don't remember if it was the final peer review letter or if it was the conditions they sent, a suggestion of a condition surrounding subsidies for

298
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:26,108
commuters, but I guess telecommuting accommodations, yeah.

299
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:33,214
Do we have someone from beta on who could speak to that, what the intent was there?

300
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:45,105
That is in condition F10, I'm sorry, F9I addresses that request.

301
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:51,707
I do see we have Bill McGrath from data, but I also see Director Hunt has her hand raised.

302
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,168
Director Hunt, would you like to add something?

303
00:34:55,788 --> 00:35:07,072
So I do want to offer to the board that we are actively talking to the Lower Mystic TMA, which is an organization that does transportation management for multifamily buildings.

304
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:10,774
We are not yet at the point of saying

305
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:31,626
that we there we're under discussion of should there be something that says new multifamilies should actively participate i would absolutely offer it as a resource to help with some of the tdm requirements um if there was a way to say that if the city uh

306
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:45,437
participates with the lower mystic TMA that the applicant would pursue membership in that organization.

307
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:55,005
I can elaborate if that's helpful, but I don't know if the board is familiar with those.

308
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:59,228
I'm not super familiar with it.

309
00:35:59,248 --> 00:35:59,749
So maybe

310
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,073
I guess maybe first we can check in with Beta.

311
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:08,694
I'd just like to get to an understanding of the current proposed condition.

312
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:13,296
But yeah, we could certainly talk about that further.

313
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,617
Bill, is that something you want to speak to?

314
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:22,018
Yeah, Mr. Chairman.

315
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:24,539
Again, Bill McGrath with Beta Group.

316
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:29,501
Unfortunately, Jeff McStudis was not able to attend tonight.

317
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:55,480
So I think the condition regarding supporting telecommuting speaks to the building being equipped in public areas for the residents, having Wi-Fi, internet connections, those types of things that would support remote work.

318
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:09,875
and not speaking so much to having specific designated areas for remote work or telecommuting.

319
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:13,437
OK, got it.

320
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:24,084
So the spirit of the proposed condition is that there should be some infrastructure or

321
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:33,518
shared spaces to support that in the building, and then the specific language is something we could discuss as a board.

322
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,580
Is that fair?

323
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,063
Yeah, I think that's correct.

324
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:40,904
Okay, thank you.

325
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:49,812
I was just going to check back in with Director Hunt.

326
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,460
I, I'm not entirely sure I followed the proposal.

327
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:16,535
Was this just a thought as a, like an incentive or, or sort of like a suggestion, Hey, it'd be nice if you participated in this, or, or do you think that bringing in the expertise of that organization would be important in the development of the TDM or something else?

328
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,038
So, so organ, so there,

329
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:37,517
transportation management authorities that work in regions to help organize transportation for multifamily and other buildings and stuff.

330
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:45,623
In some areas, they actually run shuttles that the multifamilies kind of buy into to help rather than each building running its own.

331
00:38:46,203 --> 00:39:05,428
They have a level that's called associate membership that's for buildings under development and that level they help the buildings prepare packages of information for their tenants about transportation options other than owning single vehicle occupancy cars.

332
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:24,235
They also then have a further level where a building would buy into it that would help with some of these options around getting their residents onto the buses and on the T and organizing things like that, and if necessary, running area shuttles.

333
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:30,277
Our vision is that there might in the future be shuttles in this area for multifamily buildings.

334
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:37,299
And so it would be nice to hear that the developer would be willing to participate in something like that.

335
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:54,805
But I think that at the low level of a project under development, to suggest that they could work with the lower Mystic TMA to help provide an appropriate welcome packet for this area, I think would be reasonable.

336
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:56,306
I see.

337
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,887
And that's something that any project under development

338
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:00,462
could do today.

339
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:15,046
Would a project work in consultation with them on the TDM itself?

340
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:21,047
They can help develop a TDM for a building.

341
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,308
So that is one way of doing it.

342
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:28,389
They do work with buildings on TDM planning.

343
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:31,822
Okay, got it.

344
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,283
Other questions from the board on this topic?

345
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:44,206
Okay, back to that.

346
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:55,209
So the rest of the traffic conditions really detail

347
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:05,536
improvements that have been, I think, discussed throughout the process and being recommended by your peer review consultants.

348
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:14,924
I don't know if there's any specific one that you want to delve into here, but they're all laid out through F-16.

349
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:18,026
I did have a question about F-15.

350
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:28,965
which states the applicant shall provide the city of Medford with a way finding signage plan, which shall be implemented by the applicant upon approval by the city of Medford.

351
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:40,578
And I just think we need to identify which board or staff is going to be reviewing and providing administrative approval of that.

352
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,456
I guess it's me again.

353
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:51,057
I'm sorry for just jumping in.

354
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:56,580
So chair, the planning office would be appropriate.

355
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:05,324
And in fact, the planning office is reviewing and approving all signs under our zoning ordinance at this time.

356
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:12,587
So it would make sense for the same staff in the planning office to review the wayfinding signage plan.

357
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:20,391
For my understanding, more of a technical question.

358
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:22,633
So this is a comprehensive permit.

359
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:37,082
If we're not granting a waiver to the sign ordinance, that's still okay that there would be a condition in here that would essentially require an approval by a different, in this case, department?

360
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,767
So it's an administrative approval.

361
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:55,117
And essentially what that means is that they're reviewing and approving the final plans for consistency with the board's decision and for consistency with any local requirements that have not been waived as part of this decision.

362
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:55,977
I see.

363
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:56,397
OK.

364
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:03,582
I had a question about, I think it was F9I, so up a little bit.

365
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:15,472
Yeah, so it's not just about this sub bullet, because I think similar language is used in other proposed conditions.

366
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:21,635
So coordinate with the city and assess feasibility.

367
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:26,237
Functionally, what does that mean?

368
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,701
Who determines whether it's feasible and whether it happens?

369
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:38,448
I think that's a good question.

370
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:41,830
I would defer to Beta who proposed this condition.

371
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:47,054
Bill, is that something you could speak to?

372
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:49,896
I think so.

373
00:43:51,337 --> 00:44:05,908
So I think this is, again, as are some of the other conditions, sort of a encouragement on the part of the applicant as part of the transportation demand management plan.

374
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:16,462
to promote public access to subways, public transportation, things like that.

375
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:34,957
Again, I would imagine that it would probably be coordinated between the applicant and the planning office, where the applicant would look to provide some of these passes, subsidies, things like that, UBIKE memberships,

376
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:48,674
in coordination with the planning office in the city, that insofar as whatever the city may be doing now would wanna be coordinated.

377
00:44:48,694 --> 00:44:57,518
And so the applicant isn't acting on their own necessarily, but coordinating through whatever programs the city has now.

378
00:44:58,907 --> 00:44:59,167
got it.

379
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:25,787
Okay, so it's essentially explicitly codifying a an intention or an encouragement for conditions that for whatever reason, maybe are not entirely within the board's purview or where the board doesn't really and even the proponent doesn't really have full information as to whether

380
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:30,219
it would be financially feasible to do the thing.

381
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,361
Is that right?

382
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:34,662
Yeah.

383
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:45,130
I don't think the project is at a point where that firm commitment could be made, certainly from a financial standpoint for the applicant.

384
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:46,751
Got it.

385
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:47,411
OK, thank you.

386
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,292
And this is for Attorney Aberdee.

387
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:55,217
So just from a board purview standpoint, it is within the board's discretion

388
00:45:56,541 --> 00:46:08,532
to, if we wanted to use stronger language for a condition like this to do so, it would run the risk of a feasibility issue down the road that could then be disputed.

389
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:14,817
But then with some of the other similar language conditions pertaining to

390
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:25,214
the transportation improvements off the site, that would be outside of the board's discretion to outright require those.

391
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:27,656
So we would need to use software language for those, is that right?

392
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:29,398
Yeah, I think that's correct.

393
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:36,505
I mean, ultimately, a copy of this draft decision has been provided to the applicant.

394
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:41,550
We're going to get feedback from them at some point prior to closing the public hearing, and we'll

395
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:51,011
get an idea as to whether or not they object to any of these conditions and whether they think that impacts the economic viability of the project.

396
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:56,613
To the extent they don't object to them, then the conditions are good.

397
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:03,816
If there is an objection, then the board has to make a determination as to whether the language is too strong or whether it needs to be softened up.

398
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:05,117
Okay.

399
00:47:05,437 --> 00:47:05,697
Thank you.

400
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:20,297
All right, so the next section, unless there's any other questions about the rest of the traffic conditions.

401
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:25,540
Next section addresses police fire and emergency medical.

402
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:33,285
Requires professional property management and maintenance personnel on the premises.

403
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:42,051
Addresses a lot of fire concerns requiring it to be sprinkled to NFPA requirements.

404
00:47:44,128 --> 00:48:06,745
requiring all state building code and NFPA requirements relating to fire access and safety to be met, requires emergency backup for elevators, fire access road compliant with the fire safety code, and just a number of other specific fire safety provisions.

405
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,670
Section H, water, sewer, and utilities,

406
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:33,218
addresses installation of utility services for the project, requires submittal to the DPW with calculations to ensure that the water system has sufficient capacity to meet system demand.

407
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:40,362
There's requirements regarding fire hydrant placement and the fire department review of that placement.

408
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:47,989
Service size for the domestic water to be verified by the water superintendent.

409
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:55,955
Water utility servicing the buildings shall be installed and tested in accordance with applicable city requirements and protocols.

410
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:10,348
Fire demand shall be split into the flow needed to operate the building's fire suppression system and any additional flows required by the fire department for external firefighting and or augmenting the internal sprinkler system.

411
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:18,832
Is a condition H7 had a question on with regards to the minimum diameter water main?

412
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:25,454
I've got it as an 8 inch and that came from a project with buildings of similar size.

413
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:31,118
But obviously, we're going to want to refer that to the water department and get their input on that.

414
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:35,961
Standard condition regarding underground utilities.

415
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,763
Applicants responsible for all trash and recycling.

416
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:44,579
And fire hydrants shall remain private and maintained by the applicant.

417
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:53,723
Again, that's, I'm presuming that that's what the board and the city wants, but if they want something different than that condition can be modified.

418
00:49:56,524 --> 00:50:09,689
Subsection I, wetlands, floodplain, environmental, civil conditions, really not as big of an issue on this project, but I've got a number of conditions to address potential concerns regarding these issues.

419
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:29,241
And then there's a number of other general conditions having to do with finality of the comprehensive permit, lapse of the comprehensive permit modifications, and just standard issues and concerns.

420
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:38,746
There's also conditions in here that address if the applicant does not maintain the stormwater management system and sets forth

421
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:46,683
the rights of the city to go in and ensure that it is properly maintained.

422
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:54,169
And ultimately it allows it to conduct emergency maintenance or repair if necessary and charge the applicant for that.

423
00:50:54,189 --> 00:51:08,881
And then at the end, the decision reiterates what exactly the permit is granting for the construction of 289 rental units and for the development as described above.

424
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:10,725
and then record of vote.

425
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:19,551
At the end of this, there will be an additional section that is going to be tracking all of the waivers.

426
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:24,855
I'm still waiting for the final updated waiver list from the applicant.

427
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:30,660
And once I get that, I will go through it and provide all of my suggested waiver decisions.

428
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:36,224
When it comes to the waivers, I will say, similar to what I said at the beginning here,

429
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:51,618
I'm going to provide suggested actions by the board as it relates to the waivers, and those actions are going to be based upon a presumption that the board intends to approve the project.

430
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,361
Again, it does not place any obligations on the board.

431
00:51:55,421 --> 00:52:00,125
The board is going to make whatever determinations it believes to be appropriate.

432
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:11,158
So I just want you to understand that when you see these draft waivers, that it's not telling you that you have to approve or not approve specific waivers.

433
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,303
Those are just recommendations consistent with the feedback that I've received to date.

434
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:18,326
Great.

435
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,447
Thank you, Attorney Aberdeen.

436
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:20,528
My pleasure.

437
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:39,600
I'll reiterate what I said earlier that I fully intend and expect for the proponent to take a look at this in greater detail and have an opportunity to provide feedback at our next session of the hearing on Tuesday.

438
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,082
But I do want to check in with them briefly in case there's anything

439
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:55,701
We heard tonight that you'd like to speak to now, especially if it's something like, you know, now requires additional discussion.

440
00:52:56,161 --> 00:53:04,025
It might make sense to do that today rather than Tuesday, but no expectation on my part that we do that.

441
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:05,586
I'm just offering the opportunity.

442
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,245
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

443
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:14,147
On behalf of the Davis companies, Peter Tam from Wilson and stores.

444
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:18,508
Um, and thank you for the opportunity to respond.

445
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:30,652
We just recently received the draft, and I think is, as Mr Havity and you have suggested, will will provide a careful, thorough review both for project consistency and to ensure

446
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:39,171
that the owner operator and any investors and the contractor can comply with these conditions.

447
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:51,133
There are, you know, we can identify a number of issues that I think we will be fully prepared to discuss on next Tuesday.

448
00:53:53,093 --> 00:54:00,595
And we can commit to sharing our comments with the board by Monday.

449
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:02,958
Okay, thank you.

450
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:03,859
Sounds like a plan.

451
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:13,706
All right, so next I want to check in with the board in terms of questions or comments on what we heard.

452
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:18,249
This is a great opportunity if there's conditions

453
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,312
that you didn't see in there that you'd like to see to talk about those.

454
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:39,284
There's conditions that are in there that you would like to remove, and especially if there's something that came up over the course of the hearing that's not in the proposed conditions that the board should make a determination on, I think we should be discussing it now.

455
00:54:39,384 --> 00:54:43,948
So I just want to check in with members of the board on those topics.

456
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,132
Jamie, please go ahead.

457
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:53,083
So I just, two items.

458
00:54:54,003 --> 00:55:00,345
The subsidized traffic, I was looking at the site that Director Hunt posted.

459
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:05,866
I think that's an interesting option to ask them to be partners with that program.

460
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:11,748
I think that covers some of the demand, although it doesn't look like it ties into the MBTA at all.

461
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:19,330
So I think we want to group those together and we might be able to be more, a little bit more flexible

462
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:25,350
subsidy aspect if they do join membership with the Lowell Mystic program.

463
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:48,505
The other question I had with regards to the fire, you know in previous construction scenarios we've had conversations about the safety with the pre-sprinkling the building while it's being constructed to prevent potential fire hazards during the build.

464
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:49,506
I just wanted to

465
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:55,120
I know that was typically covered by the building commissioner.

466
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,342
Just want to make sure we have that conversation.

467
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:00,083
Yeah, that's right.

468
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:09,548
So on that second point, I believe we mentioned it in passing in an earlier hearing, but I just want to share my recollection.

469
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:17,112
So the former building commissioner shared a lot of useful details.

470
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:44,669
in a prior comprehensive permit hearing, which was also the wood frame construct, wood frame high rise was the term he had used, about the fire risk posed by these buildings and some historical examples of construction, a construction fire in the city of Waltham, I believe, for a similar design.

471
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:45,210
And so,

472
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:55,699
For that project, he had proposed, so there were two separate buildings.

473
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:03,626
And he had proposed essentially sprinklering, I think, every floor as it was being built or something of the sort.

474
00:57:04,627 --> 00:57:08,951
And so we didn't spend a lot of time on it in this hearing.

475
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,452
And now we have a new building commissioner.

476
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:13,815
But broadly speaking, you want to discuss

477
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:20,521
the safety and whether there's a need to do something similar here.

478
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:21,682
Is that right?

479
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:35,074
I think in the previous case it would be it ended up being in a meeting outside of the board meeting where the building commissioner met with the applicant, reviewed the plan as they were looking at their design and what the

480
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:47,735
you know, obviously the cost, the questions of what that would look like, and I just would like to ask that that conversation happen between the building commissioner and the applicant, just based on the current building commissioner's perspective.

481
00:57:48,835 --> 00:58:02,744
Okay, so the request is for the applicant to talk with the current building commissioner and ask whether the current building commissioner has any

482
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:13,126
recommendations pertaining to fire safety conditions during construction for this building?

483
00:58:14,026 --> 00:58:14,467
Exactly.

484
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:18,688
Is that something we can do?

485
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:26,971
I know it's a short turnaround, but maybe it would be nice if we could have that discussion just so that the board has that info by Tuesday.

486
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:32,193
Mr. Chairman, may I make a suggestion?

487
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:32,973
Please.

488
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:56,852
we'd be completely comfortable with a condition to that effect, that prior to the finalization of final plans, that we coordinate and incorporate into the construction plans any requirements established by the fire department in the course of construction.

489
00:58:59,213 --> 00:58:59,293
OK.

490
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,286
address your concern, Jamie.

491
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:03,686
Okay.

492
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:09,748
And then the other one, so on the, I just want to make sure I was understanding the first point.

493
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:30,554
So you're, you mentioned that you would like the proponent or the applicant to explore participation in this lower mystic TMA and that if they do, that it might impact your thoughts on the amount of subsidy

494
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:33,231
required?

495
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:34,152
Did I get that right?

496
00:59:34,192 --> 00:59:34,472
Correct.

497
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:43,477
That program provides subsidy programs for blue bikes and travel recommendations and opportunities for rideshare and things like that.

498
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:53,463
It does not cover MBTA, but I think that that's an excellent program that's in place today that could be leveraged by the applicant as part of that program.

499
00:59:53,483 --> 01:00:02,188
And then from a subsidies perspective, or if that subsidies item may be able to be restricted just to a conversation about what opportunities there would be,

500
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:03,987
for MBTA years.

501
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:05,788
Okay.

502
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:06,268
Okay.

503
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:06,608
Got it.

504
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:13,689
So to that end, and I'm going to mention a related topic with this.

505
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:23,672
So as a member of the board, I'm contemplating conditions

506
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:41,106
on that topic, participation in the lower Mystic TMA, as well as conditions pertaining some of the traffic improvements off-site that do not require coordination with DCR.

507
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:45,567
So I think the DCR one, we already know that can't be a strongly worded condition.

508
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,928
But because I'm contemplating

509
01:00:50,184 --> 01:01:08,770
stronger wording on each of these things, it would be great if the proponent could come to the next meeting with a position on whether they would be on board with or not conditions essentially requiring

510
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:18,692
participation in the lower Mystic TMA and any of the proposed traffic improvements.

511
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:29,917
I would like the board to have clarity on the applicant's position on each of these conditions, just so we know we're not spending a lot of time going back and forth on something we all agree on.

512
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:34,319
But at the same time, I don't want to just assume at the outset that

513
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:39,730
None of these are a possibility and just use the weak language for all of them.

514
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:48,413
I'd like the board to know, you know, as of information we have today, what the applicant is and isn't willing to do in those areas.

515
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:54,215
So is that something we could review on Tuesday, just so the board has clarity?

516
01:01:56,667 --> 01:02:04,954
Yes, Mr. Chairman, I won't speak for Mike Cantalupa or Pat Noon of the Davis Companies, but I think what you suggest is reasonable.

517
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:19,446
What we've done in the past with respect to those items that are within state control, in this case, DCR, is that we would expect, and I think Van Ness has indicated that

518
01:02:20,356 --> 01:02:27,720
we will advance those items within DCR to the extent they're approved by DCR.

519
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:33,423
So that language can be further strengthened to that effect.

520
01:02:34,104 --> 01:02:37,746
What we can't do is commit that DCR will approve them, right?

521
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,727
But if they do, we will advance them and build them.

522
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:45,050
And that should give the board some comfort there.

523
01:02:46,057 --> 01:03:06,865
With respect to subsidies, I mean, I think we all recognize the variety of different improvements with respect to transit that are being made, including our indication that with the bus stop right there, we want to improve that to the extent we can.

524
01:03:08,065 --> 01:03:08,786
And I think that

525
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,303
The idea about TMA makes sense.

526
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:20,465
We'll investigate it with Van Ness and be able to indicate what level of commitment we can make.

527
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:40,472
All of that said, the applicant has to sort of reserve their right to assess the totality of mitigation and the costs associated with that before making an absolute commitment here that we can advance the project

528
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:42,984
in an economic way.

529
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:54,670
And so I guess that point is, as we all advance together, we're working in good faith with you to get to a project that can be constructed and can be successful.

530
01:03:56,391 --> 01:04:08,398
But we will need, and this goes to Mike and Pat, we'll need to assess sort of comprehensively at the very end of this discussion,

531
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,802
whether or not all of this mitigation in totality is feasible.

532
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,044
Understood, thank you.

533
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:28,332
Yeah, even getting to a point by the next meeting where you could indicate, you know, these are the mitigations we're most concerned about from a feasibility standpoint, I think would be helpful for the board.

534
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:29,733
Will do.

535
01:04:31,074 --> 01:04:31,774
Okay, great.

536
01:04:32,355 --> 01:04:36,057
Other comments or questions from the board?

537
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:55,285
All right, seeing none, chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the proposed conditions.

538
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:56,726
So moved.

539
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:58,487
Do we have a second?

540
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:00,569
Second.

541
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,191
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

542
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:04,112
Jamie?

543
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:05,293
Aye.

544
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:06,514
Jim?

545
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:07,475
Aye.

546
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,116
Andre?

547
01:05:09,136 --> 01:05:10,217
Aye.

548
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:11,458
Beth?

549
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:12,699
Aye.

550
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:14,604
Mike, aye.

551
01:05:16,326 --> 01:05:18,508
All right, public comment is now open.

552
01:05:18,568 --> 01:05:25,856
If you are a member of the public and you'd like to speak on the proposed conditions, you may do so now.

553
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:35,646
Please raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, and type in chat, or you can email DennisDMcDougall at Medford-MA.gov.

554
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,143
I see a Richmond Chow.

555
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,245
Please state your name and address for the record.

556
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:50,668
Hi, this is Richmond Chow.

557
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:55,012
I live at 128 Myrtle Street, so direct to Butter.

558
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:08,280
I guess in terms of the conditions, my comment is kind of related to, I guess, the section for parking and the parking plan and whatnot.

559
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:14,022
And I would just, you know, I know you've heard comments from multiple people input.

560
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:17,143
So I would like to, you know, if you guys have

561
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:26,803
specific conditions that I would like to see put in there, more specificity versus a plan would be submitted.

562
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:32,108
Because I think there've been comments previously like, what is the cost of on-site parking?

563
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:40,957
There's a concern if the parking is too high, would people just park on the neighboring streets and resident streets in a wood neighborhood?

564
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:52,621
Be allowed to park on on site during certain times, you know, if there's certain conditions that I think the board might feel like is beneficial to the neighboring community.

565
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:59,583
I would like to kind of put that in place upfront versus leaving it up to a general plan that might be.

566
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:05,371
I don't know, undiscussed or discuss for the down the road or something like that.

567
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:18,058
If there's things like that, I would like to kind of have the board put that conditions in from a traffic and parking and and, you know, if it also, if you had more concerns about telecommuting or having a shuttle.

568
01:07:18,078 --> 01:07:25,061
44, you know, that that brings people from the resident to to to T stations versus, you know, having them.

569
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,563
Wait, or, you know, things like that, so.

570
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:29,917
from a condition standpoint.

571
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:33,979
I have more concerns about the overall project, but I guess that's neither here.

572
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:35,639
Yeah, not at this time, but.

573
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,521
Okay, thank you.

574
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:57,190
To that point, Attorney Haverty, could you maybe speak broadly about what is and isn't within the board's discretion in terms of conditions as it pertains to parking and trying to mitigate impact to the neighborhood?

575
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:16,856
I think the board's purview relating to parking is a little bit broader than you might otherwise think, given the fact that they are requesting waivers of parking requirements.

576
01:08:18,497 --> 01:08:25,181
So in granting those waivers, it's appropriate for the board to be taking into account

577
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:31,533
Ways in which you can ensure that you are not going to be having a negative impact on abutting properties.

578
01:08:33,314 --> 01:08:38,979
So, it's it's very fact, you know, specific in terms of what the proposed conditions would be.

579
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:43,042
Any at the end of the day.

580
01:08:43,062 --> 01:08:49,708
You know, the board's decision, if it if all of the conditions and waiver decisions in the aggregate.

581
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:56,033
render the project on economic, you leave yourself vulnerable to having that decision overturned on appeal.

582
01:08:56,793 --> 01:09:06,516
So you want to make sure that, you know, you're not imposing conditions that are going to have a significant detrimental economic impact on the project.

583
01:09:06,896 --> 01:09:14,898
But if there are conditions, you know, that you believe are necessary and appropriate, I think that's within your purview to implement them.

584
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,353
Okay, thank you.

585
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:35,424
And then just since it was given as a specific example, and I understand this is on the stronger end of the spectrum for conditions, but what about a condition surrounding the actual pricing of parking on the premise?

586
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,065
Is that within the board's purview?

587
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,447
In terms of your

588
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:48,408
You want to set what the applicant should charge for parking as part of the approval?

589
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:51,910
That was my understanding of the public comment.

590
01:09:51,990 --> 01:10:06,197
It was a question about whether the board could, as a condition, impose some restriction on the pricing of the on-premise parking.

591
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,891
I think that's going a little bit far afield.

592
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:20,293
I think that you can require the applicants to submit to the board the information regarding what they plan to charge for parking.

593
01:10:21,514 --> 01:10:30,877
But I think that trying to actually dictate what is charged probably wouldn't be upheld if it was challenged.

594
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:32,737
Okay, thank you.

595
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:35,739
And then I'd like to, yeah, so I was gonna check in with the proponent.

596
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,082
As I understand it, there will be a different company managing the property.

597
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:45,544
So I would like to know if that's information you even have available right now.

598
01:10:48,085 --> 01:11:01,612
Well, Mr. Chairman, as we've stated and coordinated with Director Hunt and other staff throughout this hearing, the project has been designed to accommodate

599
01:11:02,412 --> 01:11:06,354
tenants and guests on site and not to have an adverse impact on the neighborhood.

600
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:22,621
So I think rather than, and there's a balance between you charge for parking separately, we've seen that as a way to sort of disincentivize folks with cars, but that might drive them into the neighborhood.

601
01:11:22,941 --> 01:11:31,625
So what I think we would be prepared to consider and we can work on in our draft is an additional condition that

602
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:55,141
the board and Mr. Haverty can review, that would essentially require that we, in the tenants leases, that they not be eligible for any parking specific sticker or regulation that would be implemented in the future by the city.

603
01:11:57,082 --> 01:12:00,584
As a way to ensure that

604
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:04,710
there isn't any spillover overnight parking in the neighborhoods.

605
01:12:07,052 --> 01:12:08,253
And that's one idea.

606
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:12,416
But we would work with Mr. Hafferty and Director Hunt on the specific language.

607
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:17,099
I don't think we need to get into, are you charging, are you not?

608
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:18,340
There's adequate parking.

609
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:24,764
We've right-sized it on the site to accommodate both the project needs and the self-storage needs.

610
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:29,508
Director Hunt, is there something you wanted to add on this topic?

611
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,070
I was just checking if it was needed.

612
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:46,613
We'll come up with language that we've been incorporating into some other decisions through the planning board lately of residents are not eligible for Medford resident permit parking stickers.

613
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,454
If that is one of the conditions that the board recommends.

614
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:57,455
From a planning perspective, is that advisable?

615
01:12:58,451 --> 01:13:04,677
So the intention there is to basically say to the developer, put your money where your mouth is.

616
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:09,381
Your tenants will be mad if you didn't put enough parking into this.

617
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:16,607
And if you don't lean into getting people onto the T and the blue bikes, et cetera, and you'll need some visitor parking too.

618
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:21,632
And it gives some teeth behind the idea.

619
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,774
So for example, if residents of this building

620
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:41,931
were to say it was built and they went tomorrow to the parking office and started asking for resident permit parking or guest permits, the parking director would be very upset and she would come to me and say, I don't have space for 800 more cars on the Medford street.

621
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:45,775
How come we're letting these guys have parking permits on our streets?

622
01:13:46,992 --> 01:13:53,633
So this sort of gets that out in advance before the building is ever built that we all know there.

623
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:58,755
So if the resident said, we're entitled to park in the street, I don't like parking in a garage.

624
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,115
The streets couldn't handle it.

625
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:02,635
There is not that space.

626
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:06,776
So this is just a way of sort of codifying that and putting that up front.

627
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:08,777
Okay, thank you.

628
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:09,837
Andre, please go ahead.

629
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:30,180
Yeah, I, you know, I think this is an area where I actually wanted to commend the applicant, because I do think it's good practice to kind of charge separately for parking as a way of reducing the overall number of cars that a project uses.

630
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,060
I'm grateful that they're doing that.

631
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,541
I don't know if many other projects in Medford actually have done that before.

632
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:54,164
I'm also very appreciative of what Attorney Tam just said about being willing to consider a condition around limiting public parking permits in the future.

633
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:57,305
I think that would be a good condition to include.

634
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:09,149
One question I do have, because now I don't remember talking about it, is whether there is a number of visitor parking spots planned on site.

635
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:13,952
So I'd be interested to hear about that if possible.

636
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:25,259
Yeah, my recollection is that there were some short-term parking spots designated at the front of the building, but I don't recall if we talked about longer-term visitor parking.

637
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:28,021
Is that something someone can speak to?

638
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:34,018
Yeah, I can jump in on that.

639
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:49,872
We in previous sessions have reviewed the site plan and parking plan, which reflected visitor parking on the site outside of the covered garage as a part of the peer review process with the beta team.

640
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:55,716
I believe, I don't know if it's specifically in these conditions.

641
01:15:55,776 --> 01:16:12,730
I know as a comment that has come back from them and something that has been discussed as becoming one of the conditions is that a part of our final plans would include the identification of long-term and short-term visitor parking to a greater extent in our plan set.

642
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:15,853
Yeah, I would endorse that.

643
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:16,693
Thank you.

644
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:18,715
Okay, thank you.

645
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:25,544
All right, looks like we have another member of the public that would like to speak on this matter.

646
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:29,046
Christina Katch, please state your name and address for the record.

647
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,388
Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street.

648
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:37,050
I had to step away briefly at the beginning of this.

649
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:44,835
So before I ask my question about parking, I want to ask a question that may have already been covered, but I missed it because I had to step away.

650
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:49,217
With all of these, excuse me,

651
01:16:50,134 --> 01:17:02,525
proposed conditions that are listed, who is it that's in charge of monitoring all those line items to make sure that they are happening as stated?

652
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:09,671
It's the building department is in charge of enforcing all things zoning.

653
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:16,637
So you could file a complaint with the building department in the event that any of the proposed conditions are violated.

654
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:20,183
Thank you.

655
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:29,689
All right, so my question, it's changed a little bit since the discussion that we just had about parking.

656
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:38,954
So if my thought doesn't ring with any sense, just let me know and I'll try to rephrase it.

657
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:51,651
The document E-29, it says that spaces on Myrtle and Amaranth are going to be available for use by the public.

658
01:17:53,172 --> 01:18:07,675
And now with the conversation we just had, I'm feeling a little turned around because as Director Hunt just said, the streets aren't going to be able to handle all those cars coming in.

659
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:22,418
So now we have it as a condition that they can park on, that the public can park on Myrtle Street, even though we can't handle it.

660
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:29,600
And I don't know if you already knew, but Myrtle Street is not a resident permit parking street because it's a thruway.

661
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:37,122
So there's nothing stopping the residents of the housing complex from parking on Myrtle Street.

662
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:42,265
They don't need to go to the town hall and get a parking permit.

663
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:52,413
So if they decide that they don't want to park in the garage, and it's easier to park on Myrtle Street to get where they're going in the morning, there's nothing preventing them from doing that.

664
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:55,195
So I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

665
01:18:56,136 --> 01:19:05,924
And I personally would like to see, I think, Richmond, you also were maybe hinting at this a little bit, that I'd like to see a little bit more specificity in the language about public.

666
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:13,202
public yes is us the residents and them and visitors.

667
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:27,167
It just seemed a little vague and we've been bringing up the parking concern for the residents of Myrtle Street and Amaranth for a while now.

668
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,832
So again, let me just recap because that was a lot.

669
01:19:33,493 --> 01:19:37,857
Myrtle Street does not have a requirement to have a resident parking sticker.

670
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:55,390
So what is going to prevent your residents from figuring that out and not paying for parking and not going to the town hall to get a parking sticker because they don't need it and taking our spots on Myrtle Street for those of us who live here.

671
01:19:58,609 --> 01:19:58,969
Thank you.

672
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:04,632
So there's a few things to unpack there, so I'll just try to go through them.

673
01:20:04,752 --> 01:20:12,436
I think some I have the details for, some I might need to check in with Director Hunt or others.

674
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:25,642
So the document we reviewed, so before this discussion, it didn't have any language in there proposing to prevent

675
01:20:27,329 --> 01:20:39,815
Now and in the future, the residents of this development from seeking out parking permits, which I'll come back to that because I understand you're saying that that's not presently required.

676
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:44,237
But so what we reviewed didn't have any language surrounding that.

677
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:54,082
One proposal is that the board could add a condition and the applicant would be amenable to that.

678
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:55,163
It says,

679
01:20:57,703 --> 01:20:59,203
essentially now and into the future.

680
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:19,209
So if there's ever permit parking for this street, that the residents of the development would be ineligible for that, which I think was proposed as a condition intended to preserve that parking for others on the street.

681
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,590
Now, the

682
01:21:23,024 --> 01:21:50,763
My understanding, which we can check with Attorney Aberdee, is that if there weren't language stating that the spaces on Myrtle and Amaranth that are partially on private property, if there wasn't any wording clarifying that they're available to non-residents of this development, which current language says the public, then technically,

683
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:59,821
that would be inaccessible that the owner or maybe even property manager at any time could take those out of the supply.

684
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:07,726
So I think the intention was to clarify that the area residents could use those spaces.

685
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:19,494
But I take your point that currently it sounds like the street is maybe a private way, which is the case I'm familiar with where

686
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:23,712
the city of Medford doesn't require permit parking.

687
01:22:24,092 --> 01:22:28,213
And so I want to check in with Director Hunt on that.

688
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:37,276
Like, how would a street that doesn't currently have permit parking even start to have permit parking if they chose?

689
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:41,977
And what role do the different residents have in getting to that point?

690
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:53,672
So there's the sorry, Mister chairman, there's the current policy that has been under effect and where the traffic commission is moving.

691
01:22:53,812 --> 01:23:07,584
So permit parking is regulated by the traffic commission in the city of Medford, which by law is consists of the police chief, the DPW commissioner, the planning director and two residents.

692
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:11,567
Um, so as such, I'm on the traffic commission.

693
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:12,628
Um,

694
01:23:14,408 --> 01:23:31,392
If a, the way the policy has been is that if a street in Medford wanted permit parking, they would need to go to the residents of that street and collect at least 50% of the signatures and present the petition to the traffic commission saying we want permit parking on our street.

695
01:23:31,992 --> 01:23:34,392
Currently Medford has street by street permit parking.

696
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:40,074
If you get a permit, if you live on the street, you can only park on that street and your visitors can only park on that street.

697
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:47,678
This system is incredibly unwieldy and it is very dated.

698
01:23:47,998 --> 01:23:59,325
And so the city has been working on moving away from this policy to a zoned parking program as was recommended in the parking study that was done.

699
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:04,808
There was a parking committee that looked at this citywide and made recommendations.

700
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:28,540
Right now the city has just voted the commission to implement its first zone of parking zone, so that anyone in the new what's called the green line extension zone can get a permit for that they live in the zone, you get a permit to park inside the zone, you can park anywhere in the zone on any street, your visitors are still expected to park.

701
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:34,923
on your street or within a block or so of the house that your visitor's permit is for.

702
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:39,825
It's actually very similar to how Somerville's is handled that way, if anybody's familiar with it.

703
01:24:40,995 --> 01:25:04,080
We're piloting this new zone, and it is our hope that if and when more permit parking is needed in the city, in other parts of the city, that we would implement zones so that people who live around, you could park around the corner from your house, you wouldn't have to go three blocks up the same street to find parking, for example.

704
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,201
So it is our hope.

705
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:18,829
So the best of my knowledge, and I will tell you, I do not have my parking maps in front of me here, is I don't think Myrtle Street is a private way, but I could check.

706
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:21,451
I actually do have to remember where to find that online.

707
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:25,614
So it's really a matter of the residents asking.

708
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:37,577
If a street is a private way, then the residents of that street can post no parking and arrange for towing and stuff on their street.

709
01:25:37,938 --> 01:25:47,728
The city has a web page on that, and I will go after I mute myself and find the link for private ways and just drop it in the chat for reference.

710
01:25:49,190 --> 01:26:09,003
I think that's enough information as a planning director is to put a condition in that residents of this building would not be eligible for resident permit parking and just leave it blanketly like that because there may not be permit parking on the street, but there may be in the future and that would just sort of cover it in the future.

711
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:10,321
Okay, got it.

712
01:26:10,361 --> 01:26:23,368
So what I'm hearing is that, you know, presuming both roads are public ways, then it's really up to the residents to come before the commission today if they'd like to institute it now.

713
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:31,037
on a public way, having language stating that it's open to the public isn't granting an extra permission.

714
01:26:31,217 --> 01:26:38,721
It's just sort of reinforcing that since these spots are on private property, that they remain open to the public.

715
01:26:39,182 --> 01:26:44,625
And so then having language stating such and

716
01:26:46,068 --> 01:27:04,391
a condition restricting residents from gaining permit parking in the future would protect the street, whatever and if ever that is enacted such that those spaces would be reserved for other residents.

717
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:05,471
Is that right?

718
01:27:07,552 --> 01:27:07,772
Okay.

719
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:13,853
And I actually was able to very quickly find our list and Myrtle Street is a public way in the city of Medford.

720
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:15,053
What about Amarant?

721
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:23,216
Let me just... Amaranth Ave is a public way.

722
01:27:23,797 --> 01:27:24,437
Okay, great.

723
01:27:24,637 --> 01:27:29,719
I can actually drop the list as well in the chat just in case anybody wants to check.

724
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:31,780
Okay, great.

725
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,462
Well, so I know it's outside the board's purview to

726
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:42,592
impose any restrictions on the residents or on the commission in terms of whether or not to request permit parking.

727
01:27:42,652 --> 01:27:57,759
So I think it sounds like the language clarifying that those spaces are open to the public, plus the restriction for residents of the development is about as strong as the board can get there.

728
01:27:59,360 --> 01:27:59,540
Cool.

729
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,180
Thank you.

730
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:05,863
Other comments from members of the public?

731
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:29,151
Seeing, okay, in general, I'm hoping we'll do one comment per member, but since we don't have a lot, and I didn't say that up front, Richmond Chow, please state your name and address again for the record.

732
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:32,834
Hi, this is Richmond Chow, 126 Myrtle Street.

733
01:28:33,035 --> 01:28:34,036
Yeah, I just wanted to

734
01:28:35,945 --> 01:28:48,719
FYI, there is no residential or parking in any of the neighborhoods surrounding this entire area, just because there's no development this size and there hasn't been any need.

735
01:28:51,481 --> 01:28:52,603
Thank you for clarifying that.

736
01:28:52,863 --> 01:28:56,947
Like I was saying, the board can't really force the neighborhood

737
01:28:57,893 --> 01:29:01,756
to implement that within its purview.

738
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:16,366
So I think if the neighborhood had a grassroots campaign to organize and make that, 50% of the residents would be sufficient pre-construction to put that in place.

739
01:29:16,566 --> 01:29:23,751
And then otherwise, I think the residents of the new development would also be counted in the 50%.

740
01:29:23,811 --> 01:29:25,612
So those seem to be the options.

741
01:29:27,202 --> 01:29:27,442
Got it.

742
01:29:27,923 --> 01:29:40,893
I also had another comment on, is there any area of possibility of adding conditions for like exterior lighting or things like that, you know, from a building standpoint that might, because it's so large.

743
01:29:41,374 --> 01:29:52,283
Yeah, so we glossed over it in the summary, but there is a condition on exterior lighting and the shielding and the type of lighting in there.

744
01:29:52,403 --> 01:29:55,105
So it's consistent with the,

745
01:29:56,086 --> 01:30:08,877
uh, type of lighting that was previously presented that's going to ensure, um, there isn't, um, forget the technical term, but essentially light pollution that spills onto the neighboring properties.

746
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:09,697
Okay.

747
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:10,418
Thank you very much.

748
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,422
Uh, Jamie, do you want to add something?

749
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:17,964
It's dark sky certified.

750
01:30:18,685 --> 01:30:19,005
Thank you.

751
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:19,385
Yep.

752
01:30:21,928 --> 01:30:22,248
All right.

753
01:30:23,354 --> 01:30:25,715
Other comments from members of the public?

754
01:30:30,396 --> 01:30:37,979
Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to close public comment on the proposed conditions.

755
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:40,339
Do I have a second?

756
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:42,980
Second.

757
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,781
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

758
01:30:45,861 --> 01:30:46,381
Jamie?

759
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:47,602
Aye.

760
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:48,522
Jim?

761
01:30:49,342 --> 01:30:49,462
Aye.

762
01:30:50,142 --> 01:30:50,622
Andre?

763
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:51,223
Aye.

764
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:53,555
Aye.

765
01:30:54,316 --> 01:30:55,096
Mike, aye.

766
01:30:56,057 --> 01:30:59,439
Public comment is now closed on the proposed conditions.

767
01:30:59,539 --> 01:30:59,840
All right.

768
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:14,690
So now the other item on the agenda, I believe, I don't know whether it's Attorney Tam or Attorney Gallagher, but I believe someone for the proponent intends to walk us through the updated waiver list.

769
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,470
Is that right?

770
01:31:17,052 --> 01:31:17,952
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

771
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:18,873
I think

772
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:41,521
both Pat Gallagher and I will do this sort of in tandem and we'll be brief because as Paul Haverty mentioned he hasn't had an opportunity to review the updated waiver list yet so we'd expect to give him the opportunity to help refine the list and provide any clarifications to the board on Tuesday.

773
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:41,581
So

774
01:31:44,177 --> 01:31:47,518
We can show you and kind of scroll through.

775
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:53,500
We just circulated this to Attorney Haverty and to Director Hunt within the last hour.

776
01:31:54,501 --> 01:32:03,664
We've updated the waiver list that was requested as part of the revised submission to reflect the updated building program.

777
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:20,413
And topically, I think it might make sense in five minutes or less, because you have not had the opportunity to review this, to just show you the types of waivers that we have sought and the reasons why.

778
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:30,603
And then we would expect that we'll be refining this list with Attorney Haverty in the context of the overall decision for next week.

779
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:41,018
I think it's important to keep in mind that these are waivers being sought from local regulation in order to construct the project.

780
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:53,370
And the project, as we've reviewed with you, has been revised and refined so that it's our understanding, based on the prior discussions with the board,

781
01:32:54,297 --> 01:33:02,523
that the scale, location, these issues, you're really focused on the project plans.

782
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:09,128
And that is what the board is reviewing and ultimately approving by granting these waivers.

783
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:17,135
So I'll kind of run through them, and a couple of them go to the decision themselves.

784
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:22,679
The first waiver we're seeking is from the Solar Energy System Ordinance.

785
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:32,219
As we've discussed with the board, the project does not at this time involve rooftop solar.

786
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:39,302
The multifamily structure is capable of accommodating rooftop solar.

787
01:33:39,362 --> 01:33:40,462
It's an all electric building.

788
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:48,085
And that is the level of the commitment that has been made at this stage.

789
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:52,227
So a waiver has been sought from the application of that provision.

790
01:33:53,836 --> 01:34:07,187
There is a historical preservation ordinance with a demo delay provision to the extent this old industrial building, this would apply to the removal of that building.

791
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:11,891
We're seeking a waiver as well from that section of the ordinance.

792
01:34:13,572 --> 01:34:22,280
There is a number of technical waivers that we're seeking relating to sidewalk dimensions, street trees,

793
01:34:23,609 --> 01:34:28,041
And there's discretion granted in the city council with respect to.

794
01:34:30,863 --> 01:34:31,963
underground utilities.

795
01:34:32,463 --> 01:34:36,764
And so for these, we're seeking waivers to build in accordance with the plan.

796
01:34:37,264 --> 01:34:47,106
Obviously, on the street trees, we're dealing with in the context of a site that's fully private, that's entirely paved or impervious.

797
01:34:47,686 --> 01:34:54,807
And there's going to be considerably a lot new landscape and buffer relative to what's out there today.

798
01:34:55,508 --> 01:34:57,348
So again, this is one where

799
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,901
quite literally, you don't want to lose the forest from the trees.

800
01:35:00,941 --> 01:35:03,363
We're seeking the waivers to the extent they apply.

801
01:35:05,584 --> 01:35:12,908
The additional provisions here are technical zoning provisions.

802
01:35:12,989 --> 01:35:17,791
So there is a restriction on two principal structures on the same lot.

803
01:35:18,032 --> 01:35:25,636
Obviously, there'll be more than one principal structure here between the townhomes and the principal multifamily building.

804
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:27,017
So a waiver is being sought.

805
01:35:28,492 --> 01:35:41,423
Similarly, there are use requirements associated with accessory uses for which we're out of an abundance of caution seeking waivers as well.

806
01:35:42,564 --> 01:35:46,748
And then the bulk and dimensional requirements we've identified here.

807
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:54,494
Things like yards are driven by, in many cases, by building height.

808
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,036
And that's why you see these

809
01:35:57,068 --> 01:36:02,396
Um, these numbers, um, and and those, those changed as the building changed.

810
01:36:02,777 --> 01:36:03,017
Right?

811
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:12,371
So, um, you can understand this and we can review it in the context of the site plan to the extent the board or any members of the public have questions.

812
01:36:18,128 --> 01:36:22,110
There are a number of other technical requirements about inner courts.

813
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:27,713
In this case, the building has courtyards, and it goes to the dimensions of those.

814
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:36,137
I think the courtyards that have been designed and revised in accordance with your peer review are appropriately scaled.

815
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:40,599
So we're seeking waivers from the technical requirements here.

816
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,242
There are additional yard requirements that

817
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:53,493
At this late hour, I don't think we need to get into unless you'd like us to.

818
01:36:53,733 --> 01:37:09,219
But both side yard requirements and other dimensional requirements for accessory structures here, that it's detailed and noted as to why and how we're seeking these waivers.

819
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:11,720
On parking,

820
01:37:12,998 --> 01:37:22,490
I think it's important to note, and this was a question that was raised both in connection with peer review by the board by members of the public and has even come up tonight.

821
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:27,617
We've detailed and Vanessa has prepared.

822
01:37:29,073 --> 01:37:33,474
And Beda has reviewed our parking plans, including the parking demand analysis.

823
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:51,018
We are seeking waiver from the technical requirements that would be required for both multifamily as well as the self-storage in the context of your ability to grant a, quote, shared parking special permit.

824
01:37:53,013 --> 01:37:58,978
And so that is subsumed within the comp permit and the appropriate waivers are set out here.

825
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:09,066
There's also additional technical parking design requirements that are noted here, and we've noted where we need relief.

826
01:38:11,548 --> 01:38:18,113
Again, all of these items have been peer reviewed in terms of the adequacy, the size, the dimension, et cetera.

827
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:21,961
Um, there was questions about signage.

828
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:30,468
Um, there is a waiver side here, uh, with respect to the process by which, um, to, uh, obtain signage.

829
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:38,275
And we can review this in detail with Mr. Havardy and ultimately with the board, you know, in connection with the plants.

830
01:38:43,185 --> 01:38:46,366
So a number of other waivers here.

831
01:38:46,446 --> 01:38:51,146
Some of these appear somewhat redundant because they come up in different sections of the ordinance.

832
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:59,408
But I don't want to be, I don't want to blow through these, but if you have any questions, we can get into the details.

833
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,788
Certainly, if not tonight, then on Tuesday.

834
01:39:08,849 --> 01:39:12,410
There is, we're seeking,

835
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:37,901
both waivers from the application of these special residential regulations and also from the provision for development linkage fees.

836
01:39:44,296 --> 01:39:55,961
And then we also talked about... Attorney Tam, just double checking, because I received this too, but it was recently, and this may not even be a change from the prior version.

837
01:39:56,021 --> 01:40:04,565
So on the linkage one, it's a waiver is requested from the process or from the fees?

838
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:11,948
This was in our original application, I believe, as well.

839
01:40:13,946 --> 01:40:23,271
that if you read the ordinance, we believe we're exempt from the linkage fee.

840
01:40:24,932 --> 01:40:29,014
And we confirm this, and we can review it with Attorney Haverty.

841
01:40:30,175 --> 01:40:36,258
But on a number of these, we've included them out of sort of an abundance of caution, because we don't want any ambiguity.

842
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:47,565
Okay, that's something I'd like to come back to later tonight, because this was something we discussed at length in the prior comprehensive permit, but thank you for clarifying.

843
01:40:47,866 --> 01:40:49,086
We can come back to that at the end.

844
01:40:57,312 --> 01:41:07,318
There are a number of processes that are subsumed by this comp permit, including site plan review to the extent it would apply, so we've noted those here.

845
01:41:13,018 --> 01:41:15,600
There is some other technical submittal requirements.

846
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:29,772
I think we've provided a number of renderings and elevations over the course of this hearing, but we've retained this to the extent it would apply, and we haven't otherwise fulfilled it.

847
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:41,322
And then I know the team from Bowler is still on, but to the extent there are questions, we've identified and sought

848
01:41:42,132 --> 01:42:07,782
relief from the stormwater management rules and regs as well, specifically for this particular requirement in terms of rate of runoff and how it would apply to this development and how the stormwater management system and the stormwater plan has been analyzed and submitted.

849
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:24,388
So I think it's fair to say this isn't, you know, I think Attorney Haverty will have an opportunity to review this.

850
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:36,759
Your peer review consultants who have had the original waiver list, this is largely consistent with the original waiver list, but it's been updated to reflect a new project plans.

851
01:42:37,888 --> 01:42:49,413
They'll have an opportunity to review this and we can respond to any questions that board members or members of staff or your consultants have on Tuesday evening.

852
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:51,934
Thank you.

853
01:42:52,874 --> 01:42:57,516
So I do want to check in with the board for questions.

854
01:42:58,297 --> 01:42:59,017
I am just going to

855
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:17,424
preempt the linkage topic in particular just by restating, or by not restating, by stating some of the details of what was discussed in the prior comprehensive permit as it may apply here.

856
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:25,911
So in the prior comprehensive permit hearing, there was a request also from that applicant

857
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:31,861
to waive the linkage requirements under the ordinance.

858
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:35,202
Their position was that the building was exempt.

859
01:43:36,222 --> 01:43:49,105
The city weighed in and had a different position that only the subsidized units were exempt under Medford's development linkage fee.

860
01:43:49,185 --> 01:43:55,387
So the remaining 75% units were in fact subject to the linkage fee.

861
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:01,932
There was quite a bit of back and forth in that hearing.

862
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:13,402
The board issued a finding asserting that, in fact, only 25% of the units were exempt from the linkage.

863
01:44:14,943 --> 01:44:20,828
This board is not precedent setting, so if things go that direction, we might have to have a similar consideration here.

864
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:46,181
the basically where we landed just I'm sharing this in the in an effort to potentially speed up some some of the discussions is that under Medford's ordinance the just the subsidized units would be exempt unless there's something special beyond that about this project that would qualify

865
01:44:47,351 --> 01:45:00,728
all of the units or a greater portion of the units as exempt from the linkage, which then meant that requesting this waiver required the board, you know, to consider that

866
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:07,582
So what about the project needed that waiver?

867
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:24,536
And so there was some back and forth about how in that other project, there were some offsite improvements that had been agreed to, which the city treated as, I'm forgetting the technical term, but basically credits against linkage.

868
01:45:25,356 --> 01:45:29,740
And the board ultimately issued a condition

869
01:45:31,102 --> 01:45:39,466
to assert how much linkage was required for that project in light of the different improvements.

870
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:49,670
So this is another project where you've been working with us as a board and adjusting the design, and there's discussion.

871
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,272
And we're going to talk a little bit more at the next hearing about

872
01:45:54,835 --> 01:45:57,878
What you could or couldn't commit to in terms of offsite improvements.

873
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:10,451
I think the city would take a similar position here that certain improvements that aren't really required under the the law might

874
01:46:11,517 --> 01:46:19,599
count as credits against this, but my understanding is that the entire project is not actually exempt from linkage.

875
01:46:19,659 --> 01:46:26,741
So there is some amount that in the absence of a waiver would be required under the Medford ordinance.

876
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:34,884
I would have escalated this earlier if I think I had misunderstood the way it was phrased in the waiver list.

877
01:46:35,064 --> 01:46:39,125
So Director Hunt, is that something you could speak to?

878
01:46:42,283 --> 01:46:50,987
I feel like you summarize this extremely well, I'm not sure there's anything I would add on top of that unless there was something there was any confusion.

879
01:46:51,007 --> 01:46:54,588
And I would just want me to add.

880
01:46:56,349 --> 01:47:01,051
So, Mr chair and I would just add based on my recollection that the city actually.

881
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:10,018
You know, so we offered the proponent credit for work done in terms of mitigation work.

882
01:47:10,778 --> 01:47:21,021
I think the city actually wanted, thought that more should be included in the linkage fee than what we actually agreed on.

883
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:30,122
So I would say, my recollection is that the board actually gave the applicant more credit than what the city had recommended.

884
01:47:31,423 --> 01:47:32,363
Yes, thank you, Andre.

885
01:47:34,373 --> 01:47:45,481
There was some back and forth about whether I and I mitigations counted for that particular project, and the board was not in unanimous agreement about that condition.

886
01:47:45,521 --> 01:47:56,508
But yes, ultimately picked a number that was lower than I think what the city had stated.

887
01:47:57,749 --> 01:47:58,769
Director Hunt, please go ahead.

888
01:47:59,410 --> 01:47:59,690
All right.

889
01:48:01,343 --> 01:48:09,889
As a reminder, the process that would occur in a normal situation is that the CD board would be reviewing this.

890
01:48:10,349 --> 01:48:25,299
The staff would take the request for credits to the appropriate department heads because it's credit against water and sewer, against roads and sidewalks, against parks and against

891
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,340
public safety.

892
01:48:27,761 --> 01:48:39,025
And so we would ask each of those areas, do you agree that this is and is the amount that they say it's costing an appropriate amount?

893
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:51,070
Just rather than, it's not that I sit there and say it's the right amount or the board would, but we would ask public safety, engineering, et cetera, if we felt that the credit amount was appropriate.

894
01:48:53,605 --> 01:49:19,932
Okay, so I understand this is the first time the proponent's hearing this, and I don't expect you to be prepared with a detailed response, but I am trying to drive us towards ability to have alignment and sort of agreement in principle on a set of conditions by next Tuesday.

895
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:33,990
And so what I think needs to happen, so clearly, Attorney Havardy is going to review the waiver list, will advise the board if, you know,

896
01:49:35,187 --> 01:49:39,090
He has a particular view on what is and isn't eligible.

897
01:49:40,511 --> 01:49:57,362
If there's a dispute about what is and isn't eligible on next Tuesday, the board can find something for the sake of moving things along and identifying the amount of the waiver even being sought.

898
01:49:58,463 --> 01:50:04,147
But then ultimately, it would be helpful for the board to know

899
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:34,905
whether indeed the applicant is seeking waiver from the full amount or just a portion and associating, if it's a lesser than the full amount, associating that with some of the optional improvements that the applicant has agreed to make along the way, I think would

900
01:50:35,927 --> 01:50:40,490
help the board to understand and justify a lesser number.

901
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:56,121
So I think the applicant might need some details from the city on what the actual amount of the linkage fee would be for the 75% of market rate units.

902
01:50:56,982 --> 01:51:01,025
Is that something we could provide to them relatively quickly?

903
01:51:02,277 --> 01:51:05,960
I just have to pull up the file with the numbers on it.

904
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:08,261
I can do it in the next 10 minutes.

905
01:51:09,322 --> 01:51:15,767
Mr. Chairman, we appreciate your comments and your goal.

906
01:51:16,167 --> 01:51:19,049
We share your goal to reach closure on this.

907
01:51:20,691 --> 01:51:28,997
We do maintain, and we are familiar with the precedent here, but we do maintain that

908
01:51:29,978 --> 01:51:31,479
the project is exempt.

909
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:55,918
Now, we, like you, want to reach closure on it, and we all know that there are a considerable number of commitments that have been made both on-site and off-site that are associated with real value, that to the extent this did apply to the market units, that credit should be given.

910
01:51:56,858 --> 01:51:58,660
And that includes things like

911
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:12,504
the grant of an easement over private property to allow for public parking along Amaranth and Myrtle, where that's real value because that's land area that would be subject to a public easement.

912
01:52:13,605 --> 01:52:16,286
Things like the transportation improvements.

913
01:52:18,226 --> 01:52:28,050
I would suggest that to the extent some of the fairly costly off-site mitigation were to be authorized by DCR,

914
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:40,490
that to the extent we get authorization to do that work and implement it, that those credits could apply and we could we could craft this in a way

915
01:52:41,729 --> 01:52:47,834
But our initial position, as you have to understand, is that this does not apply.

916
01:52:48,414 --> 01:52:58,622
But we will work with you on, you know, again, we're looking at the overall cost here of mitigation associated with the project.

917
01:52:59,142 --> 01:53:10,331
So we'll work with Director Hunt and Attorney Haverty in the coming days to have that discussion and try to drive home, as you've requested, what we're prepared to accept.

918
01:53:12,315 --> 01:53:13,015
Okay, thank you.

919
01:53:13,475 --> 01:53:14,736
That's much appreciated.

920
01:53:15,076 --> 01:53:31,901
And yeah, in light of that position, we'll do a check in again on Tuesday, in case your position changes, if needed, the board can, you know, review the details and make a finding about whether, you know, it does or doesn't apply.

921
01:53:31,921 --> 01:53:32,881
And then we can go from there.

922
01:53:36,427 --> 01:53:37,147
Okay, great.

923
01:53:38,188 --> 01:53:38,608
Thank you.

924
01:53:38,628 --> 01:53:41,069
And sorry, we're having that discussion now.

925
01:53:41,089 --> 01:53:46,031
I would have brought it up earlier had I interpreted the waiver list correctly.

926
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:53,153
Okay, the other questions or comments from members of the board?

927
01:53:53,173 --> 01:54:04,818
Okay, seeing none.

928
01:54:06,383 --> 01:54:12,987
Chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the proposed waiver list.

929
01:54:13,968 --> 01:54:15,709
Do I have a second?

930
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:20,092
Okay, I saw Jim.

931
01:54:20,112 --> 01:54:22,373
We're going to take a roll call.

932
01:54:22,453 --> 01:54:22,833
Jim?

933
01:54:22,853 --> 01:54:24,734
Aye.

934
01:54:25,495 --> 01:54:25,995
Andre?

935
01:54:26,015 --> 01:54:27,316
Aye.

936
01:54:28,096 --> 01:54:28,677
Jamie?

937
01:54:29,537 --> 01:54:29,657
Aye.

938
01:54:30,298 --> 01:54:30,718
Yvette?

939
01:54:31,859 --> 01:54:31,999
Aye.

940
01:54:32,919 --> 01:54:33,180
Mike?

941
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:33,760
Aye.

942
01:54:34,926 --> 01:54:39,969
Okay, we are now taking public comment on the requested waiver list.

943
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:54,158
If you're a member of the public, you'd like to comment on the requested waiver list, you can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, you can type in chat, or you could email dennisdmcdougall at Medford-MA.gov.

944
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:01,263
I see a Richmond Chow.

945
01:55:01,343 --> 01:55:03,024
Please state your name and address for the record.

946
01:55:05,504 --> 01:55:07,847
This is Richmond Chow on 28 Myrtle Street.

947
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:21,583
Obviously, this is new to the board from looking at the waiver list, so I haven't had time to look through the entire thing as well.

948
01:55:21,683 --> 01:55:24,226
But I guess one of my comments is,

949
01:55:25,793 --> 01:55:37,058
I guess I would stress to the board to actively look at the list, and a lot of it is related to the sheer size of the project, right?

950
01:55:37,418 --> 01:55:43,501
And I know that the team has gone through and tried to modify the project through the process, but obviously there is still.

951
01:55:44,902 --> 01:55:49,845
quite a bit of request for waiver in terms of the city ordinances.

952
01:55:51,926 --> 01:56:13,457
To Peter's comment about granting easement onto their property to allow this project to move along, I think part of his framing is not totally exact because granting the easement allows

953
01:56:14,177 --> 01:56:21,184
The ability for the project to remain a certain size square footage from a size overall size of the apartment building versus.

954
01:56:21,825 --> 01:56:24,968
Um, if the streets were still that narrow.

955
01:56:24,988 --> 01:56:33,877
You know, the fire fire truck requirements and all that would would cut into the overall square footage of the building he's trying to build.

956
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:34,037
So.

957
01:56:36,527 --> 01:56:38,768
So I just wanted to get that statement out there.

958
01:56:38,988 --> 01:56:53,137
Although it was framed as a, I don't know, give back or a leniency to the public or the board, there are extreme benefits for granting that easement.

959
01:56:53,317 --> 01:57:03,923
So I think the board should focus on things that they do care about and make sure the developer is held accountable for those things.

960
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:10,384
If you guys are planning to grant some legacy in these waivers.

961
01:57:12,746 --> 01:57:13,106
Thank you.

962
01:57:13,407 --> 01:57:17,310
Yeah, so just a couple of things for public awareness.

963
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:21,193
So in terms of the waiver list,

964
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:30,485
Under the comprehensive permit process, generally the board always would need to grant some waivers.

965
01:57:31,265 --> 01:57:35,768
And the waivers fall into different categories.

966
01:57:35,828 --> 01:57:41,832
Some are technical, some are dimensional, some are very specific to things that aren't

967
01:57:42,910 --> 01:57:45,211
necessarily inherent to the project itself.

968
01:57:46,211 --> 01:57:51,012
And so customarily, the board could do something else.

969
01:57:51,032 --> 01:58:07,775
But customarily, if the waiver is required because the plans that the board has basically seen and been peer-reviewed and iterated upon still violate a dimensional requirement, that will be

970
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:14,865
considered differently than waivers that kind of go beyond the scope of the project.

971
01:58:14,885 --> 01:58:25,774
So if the board couldn't really say, hey, these plans look good, but then we're not going to grant you the waiver required for that plan, either the plans look good or they don't look good.

972
01:58:25,914 --> 01:58:30,658
So I just want to make sure that the public understands that aspect.

973
01:58:30,738 --> 01:58:36,943
And then I don't want to speak on behalf of Attorney Tim, but if I understood him correctly,

974
01:58:38,724 --> 01:58:52,581
He was really focused specifically on some of the more technical elements of linkage and how under linkage, certain voluntary improvements to a project.

975
01:58:53,761 --> 01:58:57,024
can be treated as credits against the fee.

976
01:58:57,124 --> 01:59:14,178
So in this case, if the applicant had insisted that they did not want to do this and grant the easement for the parking places they could have, and then the board would have been considering a project with narrower streets with less parking and so on.

977
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:19,483
So the board does, and the city would customarily do this analysis, hey, which

978
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:23,893
improvements do or don't qualify for linkage credit.

979
01:59:23,913 --> 01:59:28,117
So I interpreted the comment through that narrower lens.

980
01:59:28,157 --> 01:59:43,550
I don't think it really intended to go beyond just this is something voluntary that might qualify as a linkage credit in the event that this product even requires a linkage fee.

981
01:59:49,091 --> 01:59:51,952
All right, I just wanted to get that out there for public awareness.

982
01:59:53,512 --> 01:59:56,153
Are there other comments from members of the public?

983
02:00:05,235 --> 02:00:10,656
Seeing... Motion to close the public comment on the waiver list.

984
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:13,337
Okay, we're going to take a roll call.

985
02:00:13,397 --> 02:00:13,777
Jim?

986
02:00:13,797 --> 02:00:14,717
Aye.

987
02:00:15,677 --> 02:00:16,157
Andre?

988
02:00:16,177 --> 02:00:17,158
Aye.

989
02:00:18,178 --> 02:00:18,558
Jamie?

990
02:00:19,765 --> 02:00:19,865
Aye.

991
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:21,066
Yvette?

992
02:00:22,227 --> 02:00:22,367
Aye.

993
02:00:23,348 --> 02:00:23,608
Mike?

994
02:00:24,148 --> 02:00:24,228
Aye.

995
02:00:24,248 --> 02:00:25,369
All right.

996
02:00:26,009 --> 02:00:28,291
We've now closed public comment on the waiver list.

997
02:00:29,552 --> 02:00:34,716
That brings us to the end of the intended topics for today.

998
02:00:35,656 --> 02:00:41,720
So I just want to rehash my understanding of what we should expect by next meeting.

999
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:44,903
So Attorney Haverty is going to review the waiver list.

1000
02:00:45,687 --> 02:00:48,968
will come prepared on Tuesday with any feedback there.

1001
02:00:50,868 --> 02:01:08,832
The proponent will discuss with the city this topic of linkage and credits and just try to come to the meeting on Tuesday, both with a position on whether linkage should apply to this project, and if so, what a reasonable amount would be.

1002
02:01:08,852 --> 02:01:08,912
The

1003
02:01:13,822 --> 02:01:18,983
Members of the board, please individually review the draft attorney have already sent.

1004
02:01:19,223 --> 02:01:27,485
And I guess to avoid issues of deliberation, we should just send individual marked up copies to Dennis.

1005
02:01:29,126 --> 02:01:34,507
I'd like to, you know, if you see any things that need changing, I'd like to make sure those are reflected.

1006
02:01:34,527 --> 02:01:38,468
I feel like I'm missing one thing.

1007
02:01:38,508 --> 02:01:39,408
There was one other thing.

1008
02:01:41,772 --> 02:01:45,516
Andre, were you going to say something or no?

1009
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:47,979
OK.

1010
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:56,929
Oh, and just generally, the proponent will come prepared on Tuesday to let us know of the draft

1011
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:10,220
conditions, if there are any in particular that they would have concerns with that would like to be modified or addressed.

1012
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,541
So it seems there's at least one.

1013
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:19,903
I think there's a proposed condition surrounding solar, and then there's a requested waiver from solar, but I'm sure there will be others.

1014
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:24,231
full conditions and then just wording of certain conditions.

1015
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:30,172
So yeah, the intention at our Tuesday meeting is we will discuss each of these topics.

1016
02:02:30,752 --> 02:02:40,574
This is also the planned date of the vote on the project itself and the closure of the hearing.

1017
02:02:43,114 --> 02:02:45,375
So before we move on, I just want to check in.

1018
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:46,255
Are there any

1019
02:02:47,247 --> 02:02:51,269
logistical items we should be discussing before we continue.

1020
02:03:00,472 --> 02:03:03,533
Okay, not hearing or seeing any.

1021
02:03:04,714 --> 02:03:13,217
Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to Tuesday,

1022
02:03:15,764 --> 02:03:16,405
May 21st.

1023
02:03:16,765 --> 02:03:18,565
May 21st at 630 p.m.

1024
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:19,386
So moved.

1025
02:03:20,386 --> 02:03:22,087
Do I have a second?

1026
02:03:24,448 --> 02:03:26,088
Looks like Jim seconded.

1027
02:03:26,969 --> 02:03:28,109
We're going to take a roll call.

1028
02:03:28,169 --> 02:03:28,469
Jim?

1029
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:29,710
Aye.

1030
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:30,750
Andre?

1031
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,730
Aye.

1032
02:03:32,631 --> 02:03:33,111
Jamie?

1033
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:34,271
Aye.

1034
02:03:35,012 --> 02:03:35,252
Yvette?

1035
02:03:36,272 --> 02:03:36,392
Aye.

1036
02:03:37,473 --> 02:03:37,733
Mike?

1037
02:03:38,233 --> 02:03:38,333
Aye.

1038
02:03:39,043 --> 02:03:40,304
All right, we are continued.

1039
02:03:40,784 --> 02:03:41,545
Thank you, folks.

1040
02:03:42,726 --> 02:03:44,967
Have a great evening, and we'll see you in a few days.

1041
02:03:46,288 --> 02:03:47,109
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1042
02:03:47,509 --> 02:03:47,870
Thank you.

1043
02:03:51,212 --> 02:03:51,672
All right.

1044
02:03:54,655 --> 02:03:58,618
Dennis, I think we've got a couple of small items on the agenda.

1045
02:03:58,918 --> 02:03:59,798
Oh, did it happen again?

1046
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:00,659
Yeah.

1047
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,962
We still have quorum, so I think, right?

1048
02:04:03,982 --> 02:04:05,042
I didn't jump off this time.

1049
02:04:06,423 --> 02:04:07,144
We still have quorum.

1050
02:04:07,184 --> 02:04:07,904
Yeah, technically.

1051
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:15,270
You're on mute.

1052
02:04:19,332 --> 02:04:22,733
The only thing we have really remaining is, I think it's just approval of some meeting minutes.

1053
02:04:23,554 --> 02:04:28,155
That's probably our, I don't think there's really anything else administrative.

1054
02:04:28,496 --> 02:04:36,739
Basically, I'll let you know, like, whatever I get this week, and I've sent an email to, this is what I did last time too, is to

1055
02:04:38,574 --> 02:04:41,856
Pat Gallagher with Goulston and Storrs, basically with my cell phone number.

1056
02:04:41,916 --> 02:04:51,040
Basically, I do this, you know, when you send it, text me, and that way I'll know that it's in my inbox so I can get it to you all as pretty much to turn around as quickly as possible.

1057
02:04:51,921 --> 02:04:52,101
Okay.

1058
02:04:52,741 --> 02:04:54,182
And same thing with Paul Haverdale.

1059
02:04:54,602 --> 02:05:05,007
I'll do send that to him as well just because I'll be kind of slightly unavailable Friday night into Friday morning, I mean into Saturday morning, but after that I'll be around.

1060
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:05,747
Okay.

1061
02:05:06,148 --> 02:05:06,648
Makes sense.

1062
02:05:07,823 --> 02:05:20,729
In terms of the meeting minutes, I did have a chance to read them if others had a chance.

1063
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:25,472
The ones that we had were March 26th, April 11th, and April 23rd.

1064
02:05:25,512 --> 02:05:27,593
I just posted the May 9th one in there.

1065
02:05:28,853 --> 02:05:33,934
just this morning, so y'all haven't had a chance to look at that, but the other ones have been in for a bit.

1066
02:05:34,314 --> 02:05:39,075
Yeah, the other ones have been in for well over a week at the latest.

1067
02:05:40,235 --> 02:05:44,436
Would anyone like to make a motion regarding those meeting minutes?

1068
02:05:44,456 --> 02:05:46,176
Motion to approve the meeting minutes.

1069
02:05:47,676 --> 02:05:49,357
Give me the dates again.

1070
02:05:51,037 --> 02:05:52,917
March 26th, April 11th.

1071
02:05:54,537 --> 02:05:56,778
Motion to approve the meeting minutes for March 26th.

1072
02:05:58,427 --> 02:05:59,648
April 11th and April 23rd.

1073
02:05:59,668 --> 02:06:01,489
Do we have a second?

1074
02:06:02,649 --> 02:06:02,969
Second.

1075
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:05,250
All right, we'll take a roll call.

1076
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:06,091
Jamie?

1077
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:07,031
Aye.

1078
02:06:07,692 --> 02:06:08,072
Andre?

1079
02:06:08,092 --> 02:06:08,152
Aye.

1080
02:06:08,752 --> 02:06:09,733
Beth?

1081
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:10,933
Aye.

1082
02:06:11,674 --> 02:06:11,914
Mike?

1083
02:06:12,274 --> 02:06:12,414
Aye.

1084
02:06:13,274 --> 02:06:14,895
All right, the meeting minutes are approved.

1085
02:06:14,915 --> 02:06:19,437
I think that brings us to the end, so do I have a motion to adjourn?

1086
02:06:21,739 --> 02:06:22,359
Motion to adjourn.

1087
02:06:23,459 --> 02:06:23,820
Second.

1088
02:06:26,081 --> 02:06:26,421
Seconded.

1089
02:06:27,918 --> 02:06:29,441
All right, do another roll call.

1090
02:06:30,123 --> 02:06:30,624
Jamie?

1091
02:06:31,706 --> 02:06:31,826
Aye.

1092
02:06:32,407 --> 02:06:32,788
Andre?

1093
02:06:32,808 --> 02:06:33,609
Aye.

1094
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:34,411
Beth?

1095
02:06:35,052 --> 02:06:35,173
Aye.

1096
02:06:35,894 --> 02:06:36,134
Mike?

1097
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:36,696
Aye.

1098
02:06:37,096 --> 02:06:37,858
All right, we're adjourned.
