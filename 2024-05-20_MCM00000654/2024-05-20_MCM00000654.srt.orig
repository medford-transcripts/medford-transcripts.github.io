3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie Thompson.

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:09,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:11,494

00:00:11,994 --> 00:00:12,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:14,235

00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:34,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Caldera present to the quorum.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, can you please kick us off?

17
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:48,854
[SPEAKER_08]: On March 29th, 2023, Governor Haley signed into law a supplemental budget bill, which, among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the opening of the meeting on March 31st, 2025.

18
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:55,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at the meeting location.

19
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,796
[SPEAKER_08]: and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

20
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:05,437
[SPEAKER_08]: The language is documenting substantive changes to the open meeting law and extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

21
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:06,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dennis.

22
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you read the first matter, please?

23
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:10,738
[SPEAKER_06]: 970 Felsway, case 40U-2023-01,

24
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,093
[SPEAKER_08]: continue from a night.

25
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:32,263
[SPEAKER_08]: The resumption of consideration of the petition of the idea fells we'll see the Davis companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to that just generalize chapter 40 B for multifamily 6 story apartment development.

26
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:36,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at an approximately 3.4 acres when it meant to be felt like property ID 7 dash 2 dash 10.

27
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:49,809
[SPEAKER_08]: This proposal will be developed as approximately 289 units, consisting of 278 units of multifamily housing and 11 townhomes with 73, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

28
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,291
[SPEAKER_08]: This hearing will discuss the draft decision and conditions.

29
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:54,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

30
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:55,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dennis.

31
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,137
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, folks, this is a long-running hearing.

32
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:01,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been ongoing since November of last year.

33
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:12,485
[SPEAKER_06]: The board, over the course of multiple sessions, has heard about the architecture, the civil engineering, the traffic for this project, and it's been multiple iterations.

34
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:16,627
[SPEAKER_06]: As Dennis mentioned, the intention for today's meeting

35
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:34,682
[SPEAKER_06]: is we're going to be focused on reviewing a draft decision, especially the proposed conditions, as well as reviewing the updated waiver list from the proponent of this project.

36
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:42,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the second to last of the scheduled hearings on this matter, or sessions of the hearing on this matter.

37
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that will be the focus.

38
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:55,134
[SPEAKER_06]: We will take public comment on the proposed conditions and the waivers.

39
00:02:56,835 --> 00:03:00,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we do not intend to vote today.

40
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So the proponent did, I believe, receive a draft of the decision recently, but hasn't had time to fully review it.

41
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:11,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of the things we'll cover in the next hearing is any

42
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,492
[SPEAKER_06]: additional responses or feedback before the board intends to vote.

43
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the plan for today.

44
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:34,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm planning to kick it off with the draft decision, but before I do that, I just want to check in with Pat Noon for the proponent to see if there's any other requests or suggestions before we get started.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Mr. Chair, members of the board.

46
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again for having us this evening.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything specific to address prior to getting into what you discussed.

48
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

49
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,618
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, great.

50
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Attorney Haverty here who will be walking us through the proposed conditions in the decision.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis intends to screen share that document.

52
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: There are aspects of the decision that go beyond the conditions, but the conditions are a salient part of the decision.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where we're going to be focusing our time today.

54
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:15,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The board does get a chance to review the other aspects before we make it official.

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:29,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, with that being said, Dennis, if you could get the version that Cliff updated up in screen sharing, then we can go through the conditions section by section.

56
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start at the section level.

57
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Haverty will provide some details to the board, and then we'll zoom in on particular conditions as needed.

58
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long document, so we won't be reading through it line by line verbatim in today's hearing.

59
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:55,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

60
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:58,548
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that.

61
00:04:58,728 --> 00:04:59,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

62
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So conditions start a few pages down.

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Chair, did you want me to just run through sort of the earlier sections and just give a quick description?

64
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:20,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah, actually, I think that's a good idea.

65
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,853
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if you could just kind of talk section by section what these are each about, that would be helpful.

66
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:36,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so the first section just lays out the procedural history, when the application was filed, the safe harbor process that

67
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:44,855
[SPEAKER_02]: The board went through with the applicant and the housing appeals committee when the matter was remanded back to the board.

68
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:49,984
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some blanks in here where I was looking for some information from the staff.

69
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:59,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get an email just before the hearing started, but I hadn't had the opportunity to review that and fill in these blanks, but those will be filled in.

70
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:13,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It lays out who the applicant's team was, who the board used for peer review, and just sort of gives a sense as to what exactly happened during the course of the public hearing.

71
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,994
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want the board to take a look at is the

72
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:26,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Paragraph number 14, which lists the board members and notes that all of them were attended all of the meetings during the public hearing process.

73
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is not correct, just let me know so that I can make note.

74
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:38,032
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody availed themselves of the Mullen rule exemption, we would want to note that as well.

75
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the second section is the jurisdictional findings.

76
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:53,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way Chapter 40B works, you have to meet specific jurisdictional requirements in order to be eligible to move forward on a comprehensive permit application.

77
00:06:54,574 --> 00:07:06,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is that the, finds that the applicant is a limited liability company, which really is a pretty simple process in which it just agrees to limit its return on profit.

78
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:15,743
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2nd, 1 is the determination that the applicant submitted a copy of a project eligibility letter from a qualifying subsidizing agency.

79
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:25,088
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3rd is that the applicant has the requisite site control by virtue of the quick claim deed that it submitted with its application.

80
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:31,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, that the applicant has agreed to execute a regulatory agreement limiting its annual distributions.

81
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:41,955
[SPEAKER_02]: The next section goes into the statutory minima set forth in the statute, and the safe harbor process.

82
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It notes the fact that the

83
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:56,187
[SPEAKER_02]: The city engaged in that safe harbor process and that it reserves its rights regarding any appeals of the committee's interlocutory determination.

84
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the purpose of that is the safe harbor process that the board undertook regarding its safe harbor claim.

85
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: ended at the Housing Appeals Committee level with their interlocutory decision, the board didn't have any right to take an appeal of that determination at that time.

86
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires the matter to go back to the board, complete its hearing process, and then the board needs to reiterate its claim if and when an appeal is filed with the Housing Appeals Committee.

87
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:32,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to make sure I noted that in the decision and reserved the board's rights.

88
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go through the other safe harbors, noting that the town does not qualify for any of them and did not assert any claims under them.

89
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the next section is factual findings.

90
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just findings specific to the application submitted by the developer.

91
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:58,481
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next section is the conditions.

92
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting on page...

93
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:31,380
[SPEAKER_02]: six is the conditions subsection a general conditions so these are a list of conditions that are typical standard conditions on any chapter 40b development they list out the plans that will ultimately be the approved plans presuming that the board just decides to grant an approval of this development and i think it would be helpful for me to note that i have drafted this decision

94
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:40,920
[SPEAKER_02]: With the presumption that the board is going to approve the project with the conditions, you know, as set forth, but of course, the board is.

95
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the right to make whatever determination it makes.

96
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,143
[SPEAKER_02]: These are only suggestions.

97
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not binding you in any way, shape or form.

98
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I've got a list of the, the.

99
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Plans that were included with the original application.

100
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:07,659
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been revisions throughout this process, and I will be looking for the applicants to provide details with regards to what the actual approved plans will be.

101
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So, going just through these, you know, it's sort of setting forth the.

102
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:28,334
[SPEAKER_02]: number of stories, the maximum heights, all of which is information I'm looking to get either from the applicant or from staff.

103
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are some conditions in here that discuss submittal of final plans, transfer of the comprehensive permit, provisions of the comprehensive permit decision binding upon successes and assigns,

104
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:55,241
[SPEAKER_02]: All sidewalks, driveways, roads, and utilities to remain private.

105
00:10:57,202 --> 00:11:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a question in the end of paragraph A11 with regards to the public sidewalks.

106
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for a response on that.

107
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Section B is affordability.

108
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: section A, I think it would probably logically live in 11.

109
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:40,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was this question raised at a prior hearing about the status of easements for the shared driveway, I guess you'd call it, on the east side of the building between the building and the

110
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:49,531
[SPEAKER_06]: the storage facility, so is that something that would need to be added here?

111
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:56,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a requirement over an easement for access?

112
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:06,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure in the transportation conditions that we got from your peer review consultant that that's addressed there.

113
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

114
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Director Hunt has her hand raised as well.

115
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:29,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, I was actually just looking at that item 11 as well and its weight worded very strongly about that the city should so I understand that the city does not want responsibility for these sidewalks, but the way it's worded seems to take that off the table.

116
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:39,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if in the future the city actually wanted to take control of the sidewalks, it seems to be worded in such a way that would actually prohibit that.

117
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in fact true?

118
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,564
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is it worded so strongly?

119
00:12:45,264 --> 00:13:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's worded strongly to prevent an applicant from coming back to the city and trying to request that the city take ownership of sidewalks and interior roadways and things of that nature.

120
00:13:02,672 --> 00:13:04,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to discourage that.

121
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not prohibit the town of its own volition from taking that.

122
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:13,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something that a comprehensive permit decision can do.

123
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have that authority.

124
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:20,106
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, we can soften this language if you think that that makes sense.

125
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I just, I sort of wanted to protect the city's future rights.

126
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:26,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

127
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:40,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just, since I'm speaking in this moment on this item, the question about the public sidewalks along Myrtle, or the sidewalks along Myrtle Street is one that we should run by the DPW commissioner.

128
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:47,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that actually the city would prefer to have those, but I would not presume to speak for him.

129
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to actually ask him.

130
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:53,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

131
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Dennis, you'll make sure we have an answer to that by Tuesday.

132
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:02,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

133
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:03,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a thumbs up.

134
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So section B is affordability.

135
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:10,654
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all very standard conditions.

136
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:14,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Requires 25% of the units to be affordable.

137
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:26,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Requires units to be restricted for rent to households earning no more than the maximum income as determined by EOHLC or any substitute subsidizing agency.

138
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Addresses certification reports from affordability monitoring agents, the execution of the regulatory agreement, the submittal of the affirmative fair housing marketing plan.

139
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:47,975
[SPEAKER_02]: There is language in here addressing local preference.

140
00:14:49,028 --> 00:15:01,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I did want to get the board sense as to whether or not it wanted to include this condition that would allow up to 70% of the units to be reserved for a local preference category.

141
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:09,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some boards that have represented in the past be less enthusiastic about such a provision.

142
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some, you know, that are very strongly insisted on it.

143
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:14,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to you.

144
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:16,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

145
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So for that one, um,

146
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt, I know in a prior hearing, I forget if it was you or a member of your staff mentioned that the city does typically seek local preference where appropriate for projects like this.

147
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And that I know that the actual

148
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:47,116
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of evidentiary basis for justifying local preference is more of a subsidizing agency thing.

149
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:53,867
[SPEAKER_06]: But could you just maybe speak to the city's position on whether there should be a local preference condition here?

150
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:04,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we prefer local preference and we have standard language that we send to the state every time about the need for that.

151
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:10,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have always had it approved since we've been sending it for the past four years without any issues.

152
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:16,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're happy to provide that, but yes, it is absolutely our preference to have local preference.

153
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:28,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the city's responsibility to submit that language to the subsidizing agency during the final approval process so that you get to assert it.

154
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, it's the subsidizing agency that gets to determine if and what percentage of local preference will be applicable.

155
00:16:37,617 --> 00:16:42,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and our housing planner and our office is familiar with that process.

156
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:51,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis have just make a note that she's aware that that's necessary with this, even though it's a 40 day that it's still on her.

157
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:53,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

158
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So then on this one, what I'm going to suggest to the board is.

159
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:19,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I intend for us to go through all these conditions will hear public comment and then the board can discuss any, you know, conditions that were sort of this like more of a board choice versus a standard thing if they're leaning a certain direction or

160
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: missing conditions, so we'll do that all after we've gone through them all.

161
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:37,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So just if you have a strong preference one way or the other on this one, especially if you would prefer not to have this condition, we can discuss that at the end.

162
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:49,259
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the next section is section C, submission requirements.

163
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all of the materials that the applicant is going to have to submit to the board prior to commencement of construction.

164
00:17:56,683 --> 00:18:02,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as the board is aware, under chapter 40B, an applicant is only required to submit preliminary plans.

165
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:09,751
[SPEAKER_02]: when they seek a comprehensive permit and the board only gets those preliminary plans prior to issuing a comprehensive permit.

166
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:15,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you need to cover yourself and make sure that you're addressing the submittals after the permit has been issued.

167
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:27,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So, C1 talks about submittals prior to any construction or site development activities, which includes if the

168
00:18:28,818 --> 00:18:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: City would generally require it that the applicant fund a peer review consultant to review final plans.

169
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:41,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Requires submittal of a NIPIDES permit if applicable.

170
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:49,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in subsection C, it talks about the review and administrative approval of final engineering drawings and plans.

171
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:53,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the final plans that the applicant has to submit.

172
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the actual detailed construction plans.

173
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:01,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also the final plans that are going to serve

174
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:13,012
[SPEAKER_02]: for review by any local board or staff that would generally review for other permits and approvals.

175
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:23,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, and we had a discussion earlier this afternoon where we were talking about DPW review and approval of sidewalk construction standards.

176
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,869
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant is going to have to submit final plans.

177
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:38,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Those final plans are going to have to be reviewed by the DPW, by, you know, the Board of Health, Conservation Commission, whatever the local board

178
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:49,690
[SPEAKER_02]: would generally review those sort of plans and implement their permitting requirements to the extent that they're not waived under this comprehensive permit.

179
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And any waivers, you know, are going to be very specific.

180
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,753
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be blanket waivers.

181
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what the final plan review purpose is.

182
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsection D talks about the middle of a landscaping plan, and the board and the city staff can review this.

183
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:18,841
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of a standard landscaping plan review that I've included in dozens of comprehensive permit decisions.

184
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got different language that you want to include, then that's certainly your purview.

185
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:36,873
[SPEAKER_02]: includes the requirement for a submittal of a construction mitigation plan, addressing dust control, fill delivery schedules, stockpiling areas, and things of that nature.

186
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:45,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Final plans in subsection F shall include all the various changes that have occurred during the hearing process.

187
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:55,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsection G final plan shall show designated snow storage areas, and that's going to come up multiple actual different spots in this decision.

188
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide notification to the Medford assessor's office for address and unit numbering.

189
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And then section C2 is submittals that are required before the issuance of building permits, which includes evidence of recording of the comprehensive permit decision with a registry of deeds, evidence of final approval from the subsidizing agency, and that's something I should probably get into a little more detail.

190
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:32,823
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're aware, at the beginning of the process, the applicant is required to get a project eligibility letter from a qualifying subsidizing agency.

191
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:42,465
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to move forward and actually commence construction, they've got to get final approval from that subsidizing agency.

192
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:55,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And that final approval includes all of the programmatic materials that the subsidizing agency has jurisdiction over, such as the execution of the regulatory agreement, the monitoring services agreement,

193
00:21:55,868 --> 00:22:12,177
[SPEAKER_02]: review and approval of the affirmative fair housing marketing plan, and a number of other similar matters, all of which have to be completed before the town is actually eligible to count these units on their subsidized housing inventory.

194
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:20,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure that you've got evidence that the final approval has been issued prior to the issuance of building permits.

195
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:31,623
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some language in here about automatic sprinkler systems and showing plans confirming that that's complied with.

196
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Obtain and file with the building commissioner a copy of all required federal, state, and other local permits.

197
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:46,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Obtain all other necessary building, electrical, plumbing, and associated permits required to begin construction of the project as required by state law.

198
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in parentheses, it's understood compliance with this requirement as part of the building permit process.

199
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,940
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than required prior to the issuance of building permits.

200
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:08,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually had an applicant complain about this particular decision because they said, how can we get necessary electrical plumbing and associated permits before we get building permits when it's part of the building permit process?

201
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:20,900
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a number of other specific requirements of things that have to be done prior to the issuance of building permits, all of which are pretty standard.

202
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:32,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsection D, construction completion, certificate of occupancy, so this details submittals that are required before a certificate of occupancy can issue.

203
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we need to cover them in too much detail.

204
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:45,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Section E, project design and construction.

205
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:54,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gets into more of the specific details of how the project's going to be addressed.

206
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:59,281
[SPEAKER_02]: E2 requires a construction management plan be submitted.

207
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And E1 requires a pre-construction conference with representatives of the Medford fire department, department of public works, building commissioner, and other city staff and consultants as may be determined.

208
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:17,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also requires a meeting open to all members of the public.

209
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:24,001
[SPEAKER_02]: to review the construction schedule, hours, policies, procedures, and other neighborhood impacts.

210
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has to be done at least 14 days prior to the start of construction.

211
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:50,568
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I see an E9 that, I think this is Cliff, that has made these suggested changes.

212
00:24:50,608 --> 00:25:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant shall incorporate equipment for electric heating, cooling, and domestic hot water generation for the project and all electric building, as well as rooftop solar array designed to generate electricity or supplement domestic hot water generation.

213
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a helpful change.

214
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:20,821
[SPEAKER_02]: E14, there's some blanks in there, and I think that getting some feedback, and I may already have received it from staff, but I haven't had the opportunity to review it yet, but this addresses the hours of construction.

215
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I'm sorry, go ahead.

216
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:37,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Attorney Haverty, so the former building commissioner in the last 40B hearing we did, I vaguely recall he had some strong opinions about

217
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:58,002
[SPEAKER_06]: language on hours of operation if i'm remembering correctly the it has to do with who's going to enforce violations whether it be building department or police so is that something you could speak to so i see you're recommending that the hours be consistent with

218
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:23,733
[SPEAKER_06]: the hours applicable to non-40B developments in the city, but just for the board's understanding, and this is something we can check with the current building commissioner, in the event that there were some report of violations of the permitted hours and days, that enforcement action would go through the building commissioner, is that correct?

219
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,151
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

220
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:29,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is ultimately a zoning permit.

221
00:26:29,732 --> 00:26:38,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Any violation of this permit goes through the standard zoning enforcement process, which begins with enforcement by the zoning enforcement officer.

222
00:26:38,415 --> 00:26:53,159
[SPEAKER_02]: If the applicant disagrees with the zoning enforcement officer, or if there is an abutter seeking zoning enforcement that the zoning enforcement officer chooses not to enforce, appeals of those decisions come to the Board of Appeals in the standard form.

223
00:26:54,437 --> 00:27:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in the absence of such a condition that expressly stated that ours would, and if there weren't a waiver to the contrary, then it would just be governed by the city ordinance on this.

224
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:11,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

225
00:27:12,572 --> 00:27:12,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

226
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:15,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And this condition should be consistent.

227
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:17,416
[SPEAKER_02]: with the city ordinance.

228
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:23,963
[SPEAKER_02]: The board is not allowed to treat a subsidized housing project differently than an unsubsidized housing project.

229
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:31,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hours of operation should be exactly the same for this as any other construction project in town, in city, sorry.

230
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but so the advantage of codifying this in a condition rather than falling back to the ordinance would be that in the event that there was a violation and a disagreement, it would ultimately come back to the board.

231
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:52,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's sort of reserving board discretion to arbitrate any disagreement on this matter?

232
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:58,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that- Well, one way or the other, an appeal would come to the board.

233
00:27:59,797 --> 00:28:06,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The advantage of actually setting forth the hours of operation in your decision is that it's there.

234
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:13,125
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to look in multiple different sources to try to figure out what can and cannot be done with this.

235
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:19,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in one decision, which is why it's as comprehensive as it is.

236
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even gotten to the waivers and we're already at 31 pages.

237
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:34,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information in here, but it helps to have it all in one document rather than having to search through and try to figure out what exactly is the applicable rule.

238
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

239
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:40,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Haverty, just a question or a minor comment.

240
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

241
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry if it's already in there and I didn't notice it, but could you explicitly reference the Medford Health Department as well?

242
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:59,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think they're responsible for noise, air quality, and things like that.

243
00:28:59,247 --> 00:29:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think like rodent control and et cetera.

244
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can absolutely add that.

245
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:06,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

246
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:07,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

247
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:21,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

248
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:31,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, actually, there's, you know, there's a condition E17 that talks about dumpsters serving the project.

249
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:36,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably get something in there about the health department in that condition.

250
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:46,927
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a condition addressing noise and requirements to comply with the DEP noise policy.

251
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I think there was a, in the, you mentioned the pre-construction meeting.

252
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:54,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think that, like, the health department should be part of that.

253
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, I think, further up.

254
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:57,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

255
00:29:57,125 --> 00:30:03,950
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

256
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I had made a note and I will add that.

257
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:06,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

258
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:14,799
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

259
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:20,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm seeing at the end of section E that there are a number of suggested conditions that Cliff has added.

260
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:25,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All rooftop equipment shall be screened so as to not be visible from any public way.

261
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Open spaces along Myrtle Street and Amaranth Avenue shall be available for use by the public.

262
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:38,072
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant shall explore opportunities for incorporating public art into the development, e.g.

263
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,894
[SPEAKER_02]: murals, outdoor sculptures.

264
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:47,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposals shall be reviewed by, that should be the board or town staff, really depending on

265
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,289
[SPEAKER_02]: what the board wants to do there.

266
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:55,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And documentation for approved proposal shall be included in the documents submitted for permitting.

267
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be in the final plans.

268
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Project plans shall include appropriate accommodations for future connections to the potential rail trail.

269
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:12,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's also in the conditions under the transportation system that were provided by your traffic peer review consultant.

270
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So so on the 30.

271
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to check in with city staff if they have a recommendation on.

272
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Which department would be the logical.

273
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Reviewer of those opportunities.

274
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's something you could speak to director on.

275
00:31:37,592 --> 00:31:41,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, similar condition and.

276
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:46,315
[SPEAKER_08]: previous 40 B. So with the language that we used in that, so I think there was something fairly similar.

277
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:48,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to look at it now while I'm doing a screen share.

278
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:53,378
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can look that up in a minute and see what language we used in that and let you know.

279
00:31:54,099 --> 00:32:04,264
[SPEAKER_06]: My recollection is that one was a little bit more specific in part because of some of the additional discussions about the type of public art.

280
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:10,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it referenced some local, like a local nonprofit or something of that nature.

281
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:25,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I mean, I'm happy to discuss anything the board would like in that area, but I would like to know if it were the city reviewing rather than the board, like who would be logical to review that.

282
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:31,037
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Medford Arts Council is an appointed body of the city of Medford.

283
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:37,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be, they don't really have regulatory authority over anything.

284
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: They are more of a granting body, but they are artists appointed by the mayor.

285
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:44,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's appropriate to me.

286
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:46,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Medford.

287
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:47,392
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that name again?

288
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:49,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Arts Council.

289
00:32:59,004 --> 00:32:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

290
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:14,576
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, the next section is traffic, traffic safety conditions, sidewalks.

291
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a significant amount of feedback from your peer review consultants.

292
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:30,358
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of these conditions came from your peer review consultant addressing issues that were raised during the public hearing.

293
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:36,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's anything specific that you wanted to cover here.

294
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:49,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I do note in F9, the condition suggested was accommodations shall be provided to support telecommuting by residents of the project.

295
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just seemed very vague.

296
00:33:52,473 --> 00:33:56,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't know if we wanted to be more specific with that.

297
00:33:57,657 --> 00:34:18,852
[SPEAKER_06]: So I saw in something, I don't remember if it was the final peer review letter or if it was the conditions they sent, a suggestion of a condition surrounding subsidies for

298
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:26,108
[SPEAKER_06]: commuters, but I guess telecommuting accommodations, yeah.

299
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:33,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have someone from beta on who could speak to that, what the intent was there?

300
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:45,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That is in condition F10, I'm sorry, F9I addresses that request.

301
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:51,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see we have Bill McGrath from data, but I also see Director Hunt has her hand raised.

302
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt, would you like to add something?

303
00:34:55,788 --> 00:35:07,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do want to offer to the board that we are actively talking to the Lower Mystic TMA, which is an organization that does transportation management for multifamily buildings.

304
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:10,774
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not yet at the point of saying

305
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:31,626
[SPEAKER_01]: that we there we're under discussion of should there be something that says new multifamilies should actively participate i would absolutely offer it as a resource to help with some of the tdm requirements um if there was a way to say that if the city uh

306
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:45,437
[SPEAKER_01]: participates with the lower mystic TMA that the applicant would pursue membership in that organization.

307
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:55,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I can elaborate if that's helpful, but I don't know if the board is familiar with those.

308
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:59,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not super familiar with it.

309
00:35:59,248 --> 00:35:59,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe

310
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe first we can check in with Beta.

311
00:36:05,353 --> 00:36:08,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just like to get to an understanding of the current proposed condition.

312
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:13,296
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we could certainly talk about that further.

313
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill, is that something you want to speak to?

314
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:22,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Mr. Chairman.

315
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:24,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, Bill McGrath with Beta Group.

316
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:29,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, Jeff McStudis was not able to attend tonight.

317
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:55,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the condition regarding supporting telecommuting speaks to the building being equipped in public areas for the residents, having Wi-Fi, internet connections, those types of things that would support remote work.

318
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:09,875
[SPEAKER_10]: and not speaking so much to having specific designated areas for remote work or telecommuting.

319
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:13,437
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, got it.

320
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So the spirit of the proposed condition is that there should be some infrastructure or

321
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:33,518
[SPEAKER_06]: shared spaces to support that in the building, and then the specific language is something we could discuss as a board.

322
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that fair?

323
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that's correct.

324
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:40,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

325
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:49,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to check back in with Director Hunt.

326
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I'm not entirely sure I followed the proposal.

327
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:16,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this just a thought as a, like an incentive or, or sort of like a suggestion, Hey, it'd be nice if you participated in this, or, or do you think that bringing in the expertise of that organization would be important in the development of the TDM or something else?

328
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:20,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so organ, so there,

329
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:37,517
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation management authorities that work in regions to help organize transportation for multifamily and other buildings and stuff.

330
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:45,623
[SPEAKER_01]: In some areas, they actually run shuttles that the multifamilies kind of buy into to help rather than each building running its own.

331
00:38:46,203 --> 00:39:05,428
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a level that's called associate membership that's for buildings under development and that level they help the buildings prepare packages of information for their tenants about transportation options other than owning single vehicle occupancy cars.

332
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:24,235
[SPEAKER_01]: They also then have a further level where a building would buy into it that would help with some of these options around getting their residents onto the buses and on the T and organizing things like that, and if necessary, running area shuttles.

333
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:30,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision is that there might in the future be shuttles in this area for multifamily buildings.

334
00:39:31,397 --> 00:39:37,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be nice to hear that the developer would be willing to participate in something like that.

335
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:54,805
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that at the low level of a project under development, to suggest that they could work with the lower Mystic TMA to help provide an appropriate welcome packet for this area, I think would be reasonable.

336
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:56,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

337
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that any project under development

338
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:00,462
[SPEAKER_06]: could do today.

339
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:15,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Would a project work in consultation with them on the TDM itself?

340
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:21,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help develop a TDM for a building.

341
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one way of doing it.

342
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:28,389
[SPEAKER_01]: They do work with buildings on TDM planning.

343
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:31,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, got it.

344
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions from the board on this topic?

345
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:44,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to that.

346
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rest of the traffic conditions really detail

347
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:05,536
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements that have been, I think, discussed throughout the process and being recommended by your peer review consultants.

348
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:14,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's any specific one that you want to delve into here, but they're all laid out through F-16.

349
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:18,026
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a question about F-15.

350
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:28,965
[SPEAKER_02]: which states the applicant shall provide the city of Medford with a way finding signage plan, which shall be implemented by the applicant upon approval by the city of Medford.

351
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:40,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think we need to identify which board or staff is going to be reviewing and providing administrative approval of that.

352
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's me again.

353
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:51,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for just jumping in.

354
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:56,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So chair, the planning office would be appropriate.

355
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:05,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the planning office is reviewing and approving all signs under our zoning ordinance at this time.

356
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:12,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would make sense for the same staff in the planning office to review the wayfinding signage plan.

357
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:20,391
[SPEAKER_06]: For my understanding, more of a technical question.

358
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:22,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a comprehensive permit.

359
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're not granting a waiver to the sign ordinance, that's still okay that there would be a condition in here that would essentially require an approval by a different, in this case, department?

360
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an administrative approval.

361
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:55,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what that means is that they're reviewing and approving the final plans for consistency with the board's decision and for consistency with any local requirements that have not been waived as part of this decision.

362
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:55,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

363
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:56,397
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

364
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:03,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a question about, I think it was F9I, so up a little bit.

365
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:15,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so it's not just about this sub bullet, because I think similar language is used in other proposed conditions.

366
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:21,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So coordinate with the city and assess feasibility.

367
00:43:23,536 --> 00:43:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Functionally, what does that mean?

368
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Who determines whether it's feasible and whether it happens?

369
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:38,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good question.

370
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:41,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I would defer to Beta who proposed this condition.

371
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:47,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill, is that something you could speak to?

372
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:49,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

373
00:43:51,337 --> 00:44:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this is, again, as are some of the other conditions, sort of a encouragement on the part of the applicant as part of the transportation demand management plan.

374
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:16,462
[SPEAKER_10]: to promote public access to subways, public transportation, things like that.

375
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:34,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I would imagine that it would probably be coordinated between the applicant and the planning office, where the applicant would look to provide some of these passes, subsidies, things like that, UBIKE memberships,

376
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:48,674
[SPEAKER_10]: in coordination with the planning office in the city, that insofar as whatever the city may be doing now would wanna be coordinated.

377
00:44:48,694 --> 00:44:57,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the applicant isn't acting on their own necessarily, but coordinating through whatever programs the city has now.

378
00:44:58,907 --> 00:44:59,167
[SPEAKER_06]: got it.

379
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:25,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so it's essentially explicitly codifying a an intention or an encouragement for conditions that for whatever reason, maybe are not entirely within the board's purview or where the board doesn't really and even the proponent doesn't really have full information as to whether

380
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:30,219
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be financially feasible to do the thing.

381
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

382
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:34,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

383
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:45,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think the project is at a point where that firm commitment could be made, certainly from a financial standpoint for the applicant.

384
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:46,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

385
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:47,411
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.

386
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is for Attorney Aberdee.

387
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:55,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So just from a board purview standpoint, it is within the board's discretion

388
00:45:56,541 --> 00:46:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: to, if we wanted to use stronger language for a condition like this to do so, it would run the risk of a feasibility issue down the road that could then be disputed.

389
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:14,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But then with some of the other similar language conditions pertaining to

390
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:25,214
[SPEAKER_06]: the transportation improvements off the site, that would be outside of the board's discretion to outright require those.

391
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:27,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would need to use software language for those, is that right?

392
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:29,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's correct.

393
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, ultimately, a copy of this draft decision has been provided to the applicant.

394
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:41,550
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get feedback from them at some point prior to closing the public hearing, and we'll

395
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:51,011
[SPEAKER_02]: get an idea as to whether or not they object to any of these conditions and whether they think that impacts the economic viability of the project.

396
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:56,613
[SPEAKER_02]: To the extent they don't object to them, then the conditions are good.

397
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:03,816
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is an objection, then the board has to make a determination as to whether the language is too strong or whether it needs to be softened up.

398
00:47:04,897 --> 00:47:05,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

399
00:47:05,437 --> 00:47:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

400
00:47:15,014 --> 00:47:20,297
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the next section, unless there's any other questions about the rest of the traffic conditions.

401
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:25,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Next section addresses police fire and emergency medical.

402
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:33,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Requires professional property management and maintenance personnel on the premises.

403
00:47:34,006 --> 00:47:42,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Addresses a lot of fire concerns requiring it to be sprinkled to NFPA requirements.

404
00:47:44,128 --> 00:48:06,745
[SPEAKER_02]: requiring all state building code and NFPA requirements relating to fire access and safety to be met, requires emergency backup for elevators, fire access road compliant with the fire safety code, and just a number of other specific fire safety provisions.

405
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Section H, water, sewer, and utilities,

406
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: addresses installation of utility services for the project, requires submittal to the DPW with calculations to ensure that the water system has sufficient capacity to meet system demand.

407
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:40,362
[SPEAKER_02]: There's requirements regarding fire hydrant placement and the fire department review of that placement.

408
00:48:42,926 --> 00:48:47,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Service size for the domestic water to be verified by the water superintendent.

409
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Water utility servicing the buildings shall be installed and tested in accordance with applicable city requirements and protocols.

410
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:10,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire demand shall be split into the flow needed to operate the building's fire suppression system and any additional flows required by the fire department for external firefighting and or augmenting the internal sprinkler system.

411
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:18,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Is a condition H7 had a question on with regards to the minimum diameter water main?

412
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:25,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it as an 8 inch and that came from a project with buildings of similar size.

413
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:31,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, we're going to want to refer that to the water department and get their input on that.

414
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:35,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Standard condition regarding underground utilities.

415
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Applicants responsible for all trash and recycling.

416
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:44,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And fire hydrants shall remain private and maintained by the applicant.

417
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:53,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's, I'm presuming that that's what the board and the city wants, but if they want something different than that condition can be modified.

418
00:49:56,524 --> 00:50:09,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsection I, wetlands, floodplain, environmental, civil conditions, really not as big of an issue on this project, but I've got a number of conditions to address potential concerns regarding these issues.

419
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:29,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a number of other general conditions having to do with finality of the comprehensive permit, lapse of the comprehensive permit modifications, and just standard issues and concerns.

420
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:38,746
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also conditions in here that address if the applicant does not maintain the stormwater management system and sets forth

421
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:46,683
[SPEAKER_02]: the rights of the city to go in and ensure that it is properly maintained.

422
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:54,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately it allows it to conduct emergency maintenance or repair if necessary and charge the applicant for that.

423
00:50:54,189 --> 00:51:08,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, the decision reiterates what exactly the permit is granting for the construction of 289 rental units and for the development as described above.

424
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:10,725
[SPEAKER_02]: and then record of vote.

425
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:19,551
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of this, there will be an additional section that is going to be tracking all of the waivers.

426
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:24,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still waiting for the final updated waiver list from the applicant.

427
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:30,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I get that, I will go through it and provide all of my suggested waiver decisions.

428
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:36,224
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the waivers, I will say, similar to what I said at the beginning here,

429
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to provide suggested actions by the board as it relates to the waivers, and those actions are going to be based upon a presumption that the board intends to approve the project.

430
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it does not place any obligations on the board.

431
00:51:55,421 --> 00:52:00,125
[SPEAKER_02]: The board is going to make whatever determinations it believes to be appropriate.

432
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:11,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want you to understand that when you see these draft waivers, that it's not telling you that you have to approve or not approve specific waivers.

433
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are just recommendations consistent with the feedback that I've received to date.

434
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:18,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

435
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Attorney Aberdeen.

436
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:20,528
[SPEAKER_06]: My pleasure.

437
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:39,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll reiterate what I said earlier that I fully intend and expect for the proponent to take a look at this in greater detail and have an opportunity to provide feedback at our next session of the hearing on Tuesday.

438
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,082
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to check in with them briefly in case there's anything

439
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:55,701
[SPEAKER_06]: We heard tonight that you'd like to speak to now, especially if it's something like, you know, now requires additional discussion.

440
00:52:56,161 --> 00:53:04,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It might make sense to do that today rather than Tuesday, but no expectation on my part that we do that.

441
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:05,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just offering the opportunity.

442
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr Chairman.

443
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:14,147
[SPEAKER_11]: On behalf of the Davis companies, Peter Tam from Wilson and stores.

444
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:18,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and thank you for the opportunity to respond.

445
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:30,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We just recently received the draft, and I think is, as Mr Havity and you have suggested, will will provide a careful, thorough review both for project consistency and to ensure

446
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:39,171
[SPEAKER_11]: that the owner operator and any investors and the contractor can comply with these conditions.

447
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:51,133
[SPEAKER_11]: There are, you know, we can identify a number of issues that I think we will be fully prepared to discuss on next Tuesday.

448
00:53:53,093 --> 00:54:00,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can commit to sharing our comments with the board by Monday.

449
00:54:01,437 --> 00:54:02,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

450
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:03,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a plan.

451
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:13,706
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so next I want to check in with the board in terms of questions or comments on what we heard.

452
00:54:13,726 --> 00:54:18,249
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great opportunity if there's conditions

453
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,312
[SPEAKER_06]: that you didn't see in there that you'd like to see to talk about those.

454
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:39,284
[SPEAKER_06]: There's conditions that are in there that you would like to remove, and especially if there's something that came up over the course of the hearing that's not in the proposed conditions that the board should make a determination on, I think we should be discussing it now.

455
00:54:39,384 --> 00:54:43,948
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to check in with members of the board on those topics.

456
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, please go ahead.

457
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:53,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, two items.

458
00:54:54,003 --> 00:55:00,345
[SPEAKER_07]: The subsidized traffic, I was looking at the site that Director Hunt posted.

459
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:05,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's an interesting option to ask them to be partners with that program.

460
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:11,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that covers some of the demand, although it doesn't look like it ties into the MBTA at all.

461
00:55:12,888 --> 00:55:19,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we want to group those together and we might be able to be more, a little bit more flexible

462
00:55:20,347 --> 00:55:25,350
[SPEAKER_07]: subsidy aspect if they do join membership with the Lowell Mystic program.

463
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:48,505
[SPEAKER_07]: The other question I had with regards to the fire, you know in previous construction scenarios we've had conversations about the safety with the pre-sprinkling the building while it's being constructed to prevent potential fire hazards during the build.

464
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:49,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to

465
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:55,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was typically covered by the building commissioner.

466
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to make sure we have that conversation.

467
00:55:59,442 --> 00:56:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

468
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:09,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that second point, I believe we mentioned it in passing in an earlier hearing, but I just want to share my recollection.

469
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:17,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So the former building commissioner shared a lot of useful details.

470
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:44,669
[SPEAKER_06]: in a prior comprehensive permit hearing, which was also the wood frame construct, wood frame high rise was the term he had used, about the fire risk posed by these buildings and some historical examples of construction, a construction fire in the city of Waltham, I believe, for a similar design.

471
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:45,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And so,

472
00:56:47,232 --> 00:56:55,699
[SPEAKER_06]: For that project, he had proposed, so there were two separate buildings.

473
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:03,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had proposed essentially sprinklering, I think, every floor as it was being built or something of the sort.

474
00:57:04,627 --> 00:57:08,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we didn't spend a lot of time on it in this hearing.

475
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:10,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we have a new building commissioner.

476
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:13,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But broadly speaking, you want to discuss

477
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:20,521
[SPEAKER_06]: the safety and whether there's a need to do something similar here.

478
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:21,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

479
00:57:22,282 --> 00:57:35,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the previous case it would be it ended up being in a meeting outside of the board meeting where the building commissioner met with the applicant, reviewed the plan as they were looking at their design and what the

480
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:47,735
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, obviously the cost, the questions of what that would look like, and I just would like to ask that that conversation happen between the building commissioner and the applicant, just based on the current building commissioner's perspective.

481
00:57:48,835 --> 00:58:02,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the request is for the applicant to talk with the current building commissioner and ask whether the current building commissioner has any

482
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: recommendations pertaining to fire safety conditions during construction for this building?

483
00:58:14,026 --> 00:58:14,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

484
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:18,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something we can do?

485
00:58:18,968 --> 00:58:26,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a short turnaround, but maybe it would be nice if we could have that discussion just so that the board has that info by Tuesday.

486
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:32,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chairman, may I make a suggestion?

487
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:32,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Please.

488
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:56,852
[SPEAKER_11]: we'd be completely comfortable with a condition to that effect, that prior to the finalization of final plans, that we coordinate and incorporate into the construction plans any requirements established by the fire department in the course of construction.

489
00:58:59,213 --> 00:58:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

490
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,286
[SPEAKER_06]: address your concern, Jamie.

491
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:03,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

492
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:09,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other one, so on the, I just want to make sure I was understanding the first point.

493
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're, you mentioned that you would like the proponent or the applicant to explore participation in this lower mystic TMA and that if they do, that it might impact your thoughts on the amount of subsidy

494
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:33,231
[SPEAKER_07]: required?

495
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:34,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get that right?

496
00:59:34,192 --> 00:59:34,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

497
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:43,477
[SPEAKER_07]: That program provides subsidy programs for blue bikes and travel recommendations and opportunities for rideshare and things like that.

498
00:59:43,537 --> 00:59:53,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not cover MBTA, but I think that that's an excellent program that's in place today that could be leveraged by the applicant as part of that program.

499
00:59:53,483 --> 01:00:02,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from a subsidies perspective, or if that subsidies item may be able to be restricted just to a conversation about what opportunities there would be,

500
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:03,987
[SPEAKER_07]: for MBTA years.

501
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

502
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:06,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

503
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

504
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:13,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So to that end, and I'm going to mention a related topic with this.

505
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:23,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a member of the board, I'm contemplating conditions

506
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:41,106
[SPEAKER_06]: on that topic, participation in the lower Mystic TMA, as well as conditions pertaining some of the traffic improvements off-site that do not require coordination with DCR.

507
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:45,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the DCR one, we already know that can't be a strongly worded condition.

508
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,928
[SPEAKER_06]: But because I'm contemplating

509
01:00:50,184 --> 01:01:08,770
[SPEAKER_06]: stronger wording on each of these things, it would be great if the proponent could come to the next meeting with a position on whether they would be on board with or not conditions essentially requiring

510
01:01:09,908 --> 01:01:18,692
[SPEAKER_06]: participation in the lower Mystic TMA and any of the proposed traffic improvements.

511
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like the board to have clarity on the applicant's position on each of these conditions, just so we know we're not spending a lot of time going back and forth on something we all agree on.

512
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:34,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I don't want to just assume at the outset that

513
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:39,730
[SPEAKER_06]: None of these are a possibility and just use the weak language for all of them.

514
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like the board to know, you know, as of information we have today, what the applicant is and isn't willing to do in those areas.

515
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:54,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that something we could review on Tuesday, just so the board has clarity?

516
01:01:56,667 --> 01:02:04,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. Chairman, I won't speak for Mike Cantalupa or Pat Noon of the Davis Companies, but I think what you suggest is reasonable.

517
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:19,446
[SPEAKER_11]: What we've done in the past with respect to those items that are within state control, in this case, DCR, is that we would expect, and I think Van Ness has indicated that

518
01:02:20,356 --> 01:02:27,720
[SPEAKER_11]: we will advance those items within DCR to the extent they're approved by DCR.

519
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:33,423
[SPEAKER_11]: So that language can be further strengthened to that effect.

520
01:02:34,104 --> 01:02:37,746
[SPEAKER_11]: What we can't do is commit that DCR will approve them, right?

521
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,727
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they do, we will advance them and build them.

522
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:45,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And that should give the board some comfort there.

523
01:02:46,057 --> 01:03:06,865
[SPEAKER_11]: With respect to subsidies, I mean, I think we all recognize the variety of different improvements with respect to transit that are being made, including our indication that with the bus stop right there, we want to improve that to the extent we can.

524
01:03:08,065 --> 01:03:08,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that

525
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:13,303
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea about TMA makes sense.

526
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:20,465
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll investigate it with Van Ness and be able to indicate what level of commitment we can make.

527
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:40,472
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that said, the applicant has to sort of reserve their right to assess the totality of mitigation and the costs associated with that before making an absolute commitment here that we can advance the project

528
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:42,984
[SPEAKER_11]: in an economic way.

529
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:54,670
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I guess that point is, as we all advance together, we're working in good faith with you to get to a project that can be constructed and can be successful.

530
01:03:56,391 --> 01:04:08,398
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will need, and this goes to Mike and Pat, we'll need to assess sort of comprehensively at the very end of this discussion,

531
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,802
[SPEAKER_11]: whether or not all of this mitigation in totality is feasible.

532
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood, thank you.

533
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:28,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, even getting to a point by the next meeting where you could indicate, you know, these are the mitigations we're most concerned about from a feasibility standpoint, I think would be helpful for the board.

534
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Will do.

535
01:04:31,074 --> 01:04:31,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

536
01:04:32,355 --> 01:04:36,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Other comments or questions from the board?

537
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:55,285
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, seeing none, chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the proposed conditions.

538
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:56,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

539
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:58,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a second?

540
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:00,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

541
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,191
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

542
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:04,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?

543
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:05,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

544
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:06,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

545
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

546
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

547
01:05:09,136 --> 01:05:10,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

548
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Beth?

549
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

550
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:14,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, aye.

551
01:05:16,326 --> 01:05:18,508
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, public comment is now open.

552
01:05:18,568 --> 01:05:25,856
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a member of the public and you'd like to speak on the proposed conditions, you may do so now.

553
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:35,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Please raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, and type in chat, or you can email DennisDMcDougall at Medford-MA.gov.

554
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a Richmond Chow.

555
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

556
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Richmond Chow.

557
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:55,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 128 Myrtle Street, so direct to Butter.

558
01:05:56,375 --> 01:06:08,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess in terms of the conditions, my comment is kind of related to, I guess, the section for parking and the parking plan and whatnot.

559
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:14,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just, you know, I know you've heard comments from multiple people input.

560
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:17,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to, you know, if you guys have

561
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:26,803
[SPEAKER_04]: specific conditions that I would like to see put in there, more specificity versus a plan would be submitted.

562
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:32,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think there've been comments previously like, what is the cost of on-site parking?

563
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:40,957
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a concern if the parking is too high, would people just park on the neighboring streets and resident streets in a wood neighborhood?

564
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:52,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Be allowed to park on on site during certain times, you know, if there's certain conditions that I think the board might feel like is beneficial to the neighboring community.

565
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:59,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to kind of put that in place upfront versus leaving it up to a general plan that might be.

566
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, undiscussed or discuss for the down the road or something like that.

567
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:18,058
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's things like that, I would like to kind of have the board put that conditions in from a traffic and parking and and, you know, if it also, if you had more concerns about telecommuting or having a shuttle.

568
01:07:18,078 --> 01:07:25,061
[SPEAKER_04]: 44, you know, that that brings people from the resident to to to T stations versus, you know, having them.

569
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, or, you know, things like that, so.

570
01:07:28,856 --> 01:07:29,917
[SPEAKER_04]: from a condition standpoint.

571
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:33,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I have more concerns about the overall project, but I guess that's neither here.

572
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:35,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not at this time, but.

573
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

574
01:07:39,661 --> 01:07:57,190
[SPEAKER_06]: To that point, Attorney Haverty, could you maybe speak broadly about what is and isn't within the board's discretion in terms of conditions as it pertains to parking and trying to mitigate impact to the neighborhood?

575
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:16,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the board's purview relating to parking is a little bit broader than you might otherwise think, given the fact that they are requesting waivers of parking requirements.

576
01:08:18,497 --> 01:08:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So in granting those waivers, it's appropriate for the board to be taking into account

577
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:31,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Ways in which you can ensure that you are not going to be having a negative impact on abutting properties.

578
01:08:33,314 --> 01:08:38,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's it's very fact, you know, specific in terms of what the proposed conditions would be.

579
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:43,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Any at the end of the day.

580
01:08:43,062 --> 01:08:49,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the board's decision, if it if all of the conditions and waiver decisions in the aggregate.

581
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: render the project on economic, you leave yourself vulnerable to having that decision overturned on appeal.

582
01:08:56,793 --> 01:09:06,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure that, you know, you're not imposing conditions that are going to have a significant detrimental economic impact on the project.

583
01:09:06,896 --> 01:09:14,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there are conditions, you know, that you believe are necessary and appropriate, I think that's within your purview to implement them.

584
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

585
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:35,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just since it was given as a specific example, and I understand this is on the stronger end of the spectrum for conditions, but what about a condition surrounding the actual pricing of parking on the premise?

586
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that within the board's purview?

587
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,447
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of your

588
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to set what the applicant should charge for parking as part of the approval?

589
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:51,910
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my understanding of the public comment.

590
01:09:51,990 --> 01:10:06,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a question about whether the board could, as a condition, impose some restriction on the pricing of the on-premise parking.

591
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going a little bit far afield.

592
01:10:12,811 --> 01:10:20,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you can require the applicants to submit to the board the information regarding what they plan to charge for parking.

593
01:10:21,514 --> 01:10:30,877
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that trying to actually dictate what is charged probably wouldn't be upheld if it was challenged.

594
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:32,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

595
01:10:32,857 --> 01:10:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd like to, yeah, so I was gonna check in with the proponent.

596
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,082
[SPEAKER_06]: As I understand it, there will be a different company managing the property.

597
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:45,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to know if that's information you even have available right now.

598
01:10:48,085 --> 01:11:01,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Mr. Chairman, as we've stated and coordinated with Director Hunt and other staff throughout this hearing, the project has been designed to accommodate

599
01:11:02,412 --> 01:11:06,354
[SPEAKER_11]: tenants and guests on site and not to have an adverse impact on the neighborhood.

600
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:22,621
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think rather than, and there's a balance between you charge for parking separately, we've seen that as a way to sort of disincentivize folks with cars, but that might drive them into the neighborhood.

601
01:11:22,941 --> 01:11:31,625
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I think we would be prepared to consider and we can work on in our draft is an additional condition that

602
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:55,141
[SPEAKER_11]: the board and Mr. Haverty can review, that would essentially require that we, in the tenants leases, that they not be eligible for any parking specific sticker or regulation that would be implemented in the future by the city.

603
01:11:57,082 --> 01:12:00,584
[SPEAKER_11]: As a way to ensure that

604
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:04,710
[SPEAKER_11]: there isn't any spillover overnight parking in the neighborhoods.

605
01:12:07,052 --> 01:12:08,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one idea.

606
01:12:08,273 --> 01:12:12,416
[SPEAKER_11]: But we would work with Mr. Hafferty and Director Hunt on the specific language.

607
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:17,099
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we need to get into, are you charging, are you not?

608
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:18,340
[SPEAKER_11]: There's adequate parking.

609
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:24,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We've right-sized it on the site to accommodate both the project needs and the self-storage needs.

610
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:29,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt, is there something you wanted to add on this topic?

611
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just checking if it was needed.

612
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:46,613
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come up with language that we've been incorporating into some other decisions through the planning board lately of residents are not eligible for Medford resident permit parking stickers.

613
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,454
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is one of the conditions that the board recommends.

614
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:57,455
[SPEAKER_06]: From a planning perspective, is that advisable?

615
01:12:58,451 --> 01:13:04,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intention there is to basically say to the developer, put your money where your mouth is.

616
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:09,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tenants will be mad if you didn't put enough parking into this.

617
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:16,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't lean into getting people onto the T and the blue bikes, et cetera, and you'll need some visitor parking too.

618
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:21,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives some teeth behind the idea.

619
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if residents of this building

620
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:41,931
[SPEAKER_01]: were to say it was built and they went tomorrow to the parking office and started asking for resident permit parking or guest permits, the parking director would be very upset and she would come to me and say, I don't have space for 800 more cars on the Medford street.

621
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:45,775
[SPEAKER_01]: How come we're letting these guys have parking permits on our streets?

622
01:13:46,992 --> 01:13:53,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sort of gets that out in advance before the building is ever built that we all know there.

623
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:58,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the resident said, we're entitled to park in the street, I don't like parking in a garage.

624
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,115
[SPEAKER_01]: The streets couldn't handle it.

625
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:02,635
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not that space.

626
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:06,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a way of sort of codifying that and putting that up front.

627
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:08,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

628
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:09,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre, please go ahead.

629
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:30,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I, you know, I think this is an area where I actually wanted to commend the applicant, because I do think it's good practice to kind of charge separately for parking as a way of reducing the overall number of cars that a project uses.

630
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:33,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm grateful that they're doing that.

631
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if many other projects in Medford actually have done that before.

632
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:54,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also very appreciative of what Attorney Tam just said about being willing to consider a condition around limiting public parking permits in the future.

633
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:57,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be a good condition to include.

634
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:09,149
[SPEAKER_09]: One question I do have, because now I don't remember talking about it, is whether there is a number of visitor parking spots planned on site.

635
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:13,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd be interested to hear about that if possible.

636
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:25,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my recollection is that there were some short-term parking spots designated at the front of the building, but I don't recall if we talked about longer-term visitor parking.

637
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:28,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something someone can speak to?

638
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can jump in on that.

639
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:49,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We in previous sessions have reviewed the site plan and parking plan, which reflected visitor parking on the site outside of the covered garage as a part of the peer review process with the beta team.

640
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, I don't know if it's specifically in these conditions.

641
01:15:55,776 --> 01:16:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I know as a comment that has come back from them and something that has been discussed as becoming one of the conditions is that a part of our final plans would include the identification of long-term and short-term visitor parking to a greater extent in our plan set.

642
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:15,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would endorse that.

643
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:16,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

644
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:18,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

645
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:25,544
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, looks like we have another member of the public that would like to speak on this matter.

646
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Christina Katch, please state your name and address for the record.

647
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Christina Katch, 130 Myrtle Street.

648
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:37,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to step away briefly at the beginning of this.

649
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:44,835
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I ask my question about parking, I want to ask a question that may have already been covered, but I missed it because I had to step away.

650
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:49,217
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of these, excuse me,

651
01:16:50,134 --> 01:17:02,525
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed conditions that are listed, who is it that's in charge of monitoring all those line items to make sure that they are happening as stated?

652
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:09,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the building department is in charge of enforcing all things zoning.

653
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:16,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could file a complaint with the building department in the event that any of the proposed conditions are violated.

654
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:20,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

655
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:29,689
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so my question, it's changed a little bit since the discussion that we just had about parking.

656
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:38,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my thought doesn't ring with any sense, just let me know and I'll try to rephrase it.

657
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:51,651
[SPEAKER_00]: The document E-29, it says that spaces on Myrtle and Amaranth are going to be available for use by the public.

658
01:17:53,172 --> 01:18:07,675
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the conversation we just had, I'm feeling a little turned around because as Director Hunt just said, the streets aren't going to be able to handle all those cars coming in.

659
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:22,418
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have it as a condition that they can park on, that the public can park on Myrtle Street, even though we can't handle it.

660
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:29,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you already knew, but Myrtle Street is not a resident permit parking street because it's a thruway.

661
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:37,122
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing stopping the residents of the housing complex from parking on Myrtle Street.

662
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:42,265
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to go to the town hall and get a parking permit.

663
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:52,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they decide that they don't want to park in the garage, and it's easier to park on Myrtle Street to get where they're going in the morning, there's nothing preventing them from doing that.

664
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:55,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

665
01:18:56,136 --> 01:19:05,924
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally would like to see, I think, Richmond, you also were maybe hinting at this a little bit, that I'd like to see a little bit more specificity in the language about public.

666
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:13,202
[SPEAKER_00]: public yes is us the residents and them and visitors.

667
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:27,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seemed a little vague and we've been bringing up the parking concern for the residents of Myrtle Street and Amaranth for a while now.

668
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,832
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, let me just recap because that was a lot.

669
01:19:33,493 --> 01:19:37,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Myrtle Street does not have a requirement to have a resident parking sticker.

670
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:55,390
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is going to prevent your residents from figuring that out and not paying for parking and not going to the town hall to get a parking sticker because they don't need it and taking our spots on Myrtle Street for those of us who live here.

671
01:19:58,609 --> 01:19:58,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

672
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:04,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a few things to unpack there, so I'll just try to go through them.

673
01:20:04,752 --> 01:20:12,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some I have the details for, some I might need to check in with Director Hunt or others.

674
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:25,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So the document we reviewed, so before this discussion, it didn't have any language in there proposing to prevent

675
01:20:27,329 --> 01:20:39,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Now and in the future, the residents of this development from seeking out parking permits, which I'll come back to that because I understand you're saying that that's not presently required.

676
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:44,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But so what we reviewed didn't have any language surrounding that.

677
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:54,082
[SPEAKER_06]: One proposal is that the board could add a condition and the applicant would be amenable to that.

678
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:55,163
[SPEAKER_06]: It says,

679
01:20:57,703 --> 01:20:59,203
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially now and into the future.

680
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:19,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's ever permit parking for this street, that the residents of the development would be ineligible for that, which I think was proposed as a condition intended to preserve that parking for others on the street.

681
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the

682
01:21:23,024 --> 01:21:50,763
[SPEAKER_06]: My understanding, which we can check with Attorney Aberdee, is that if there weren't language stating that the spaces on Myrtle and Amaranth that are partially on private property, if there wasn't any wording clarifying that they're available to non-residents of this development, which current language says the public, then technically,

683
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:59,821
[SPEAKER_06]: that would be inaccessible that the owner or maybe even property manager at any time could take those out of the supply.

684
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:07,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the intention was to clarify that the area residents could use those spaces.

685
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:19,494
[SPEAKER_06]: But I take your point that currently it sounds like the street is maybe a private way, which is the case I'm familiar with where

686
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:23,712
[SPEAKER_06]: the city of Medford doesn't require permit parking.

687
01:22:24,092 --> 01:22:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to check in with Director Hunt on that.

688
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:37,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how would a street that doesn't currently have permit parking even start to have permit parking if they chose?

689
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:41,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And what role do the different residents have in getting to that point?

690
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:53,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the sorry, Mister chairman, there's the current policy that has been under effect and where the traffic commission is moving.

691
01:22:53,812 --> 01:23:07,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So permit parking is regulated by the traffic commission in the city of Medford, which by law is consists of the police chief, the DPW commissioner, the planning director and two residents.

692
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:11,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so as such, I'm on the traffic commission.

693
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:12,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

694
01:23:14,408 --> 01:23:31,392
[SPEAKER_01]: If a, the way the policy has been is that if a street in Medford wanted permit parking, they would need to go to the residents of that street and collect at least 50% of the signatures and present the petition to the traffic commission saying we want permit parking on our street.

695
01:23:31,992 --> 01:23:34,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently Medford has street by street permit parking.

696
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:40,074
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a permit, if you live on the street, you can only park on that street and your visitors can only park on that street.

697
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:47,678
[SPEAKER_01]: This system is incredibly unwieldy and it is very dated.

698
01:23:47,998 --> 01:23:59,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the city has been working on moving away from this policy to a zoned parking program as was recommended in the parking study that was done.

699
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:04,808
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a parking committee that looked at this citywide and made recommendations.

700
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:28,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now the city has just voted the commission to implement its first zone of parking zone, so that anyone in the new what's called the green line extension zone can get a permit for that they live in the zone, you get a permit to park inside the zone, you can park anywhere in the zone on any street, your visitors are still expected to park.

701
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:34,923
[SPEAKER_01]: on your street or within a block or so of the house that your visitor's permit is for.

702
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:39,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually very similar to how Somerville's is handled that way, if anybody's familiar with it.

703
01:24:40,995 --> 01:25:04,080
[SPEAKER_01]: We're piloting this new zone, and it is our hope that if and when more permit parking is needed in the city, in other parts of the city, that we would implement zones so that people who live around, you could park around the corner from your house, you wouldn't have to go three blocks up the same street to find parking, for example.

704
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is our hope.

705
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:18,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best of my knowledge, and I will tell you, I do not have my parking maps in front of me here, is I don't think Myrtle Street is a private way, but I could check.

706
01:25:18,889 --> 01:25:21,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually do have to remember where to find that online.

707
01:25:23,112 --> 01:25:25,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a matter of the residents asking.

708
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:37,577
[SPEAKER_01]: If a street is a private way, then the residents of that street can post no parking and arrange for towing and stuff on their street.

709
01:25:37,938 --> 01:25:47,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has a web page on that, and I will go after I mute myself and find the link for private ways and just drop it in the chat for reference.

710
01:25:49,190 --> 01:26:09,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough information as a planning director is to put a condition in that residents of this building would not be eligible for resident permit parking and just leave it blanketly like that because there may not be permit parking on the street, but there may be in the future and that would just sort of cover it in the future.

711
01:26:09,781 --> 01:26:10,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, got it.

712
01:26:10,361 --> 01:26:23,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm hearing is that, you know, presuming both roads are public ways, then it's really up to the residents to come before the commission today if they'd like to institute it now.

713
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:31,037
[SPEAKER_06]: on a public way, having language stating that it's open to the public isn't granting an extra permission.

714
01:26:31,217 --> 01:26:38,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just sort of reinforcing that since these spots are on private property, that they remain open to the public.

715
01:26:39,182 --> 01:26:44,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then having language stating such and

716
01:26:46,068 --> 01:27:04,391
[SPEAKER_06]: a condition restricting residents from gaining permit parking in the future would protect the street, whatever and if ever that is enacted such that those spaces would be reserved for other residents.

717
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:05,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

718
01:27:07,552 --> 01:27:07,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

719
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:13,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually was able to very quickly find our list and Myrtle Street is a public way in the city of Medford.

720
01:27:14,273 --> 01:27:15,053
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Amarant?

721
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:23,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just... Amaranth Ave is a public way.

722
01:27:23,797 --> 01:27:24,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

723
01:27:24,637 --> 01:27:29,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually drop the list as well in the chat just in case anybody wants to check.

724
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:31,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

725
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so I know it's outside the board's purview to

726
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:42,592
[SPEAKER_06]: impose any restrictions on the residents or on the commission in terms of whether or not to request permit parking.

727
01:27:42,652 --> 01:27:57,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it sounds like the language clarifying that those spaces are open to the public, plus the restriction for residents of the development is about as strong as the board can get there.

728
01:27:59,360 --> 01:27:59,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

729
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

730
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Other comments from members of the public?

731
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:29,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing, okay, in general, I'm hoping we'll do one comment per member, but since we don't have a lot, and I didn't say that up front, Richmond Chow, please state your name and address again for the record.

732
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:32,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Richmond Chow, 126 Myrtle Street.

733
01:28:33,035 --> 01:28:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to

734
01:28:35,945 --> 01:28:48,719
[SPEAKER_04]: FYI, there is no residential or parking in any of the neighborhoods surrounding this entire area, just because there's no development this size and there hasn't been any need.

735
01:28:51,481 --> 01:28:52,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for clarifying that.

736
01:28:52,863 --> 01:28:56,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was saying, the board can't really force the neighborhood

737
01:28:57,893 --> 01:29:01,756
[SPEAKER_06]: to implement that within its purview.

738
01:29:01,816 --> 01:29:16,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if the neighborhood had a grassroots campaign to organize and make that, 50% of the residents would be sufficient pre-construction to put that in place.

739
01:29:16,566 --> 01:29:23,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And then otherwise, I think the residents of the new development would also be counted in the 50%.

740
01:29:23,811 --> 01:29:25,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So those seem to be the options.

741
01:29:27,202 --> 01:29:27,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

742
01:29:27,923 --> 01:29:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I also had another comment on, is there any area of possibility of adding conditions for like exterior lighting or things like that, you know, from a building standpoint that might, because it's so large.

743
01:29:41,374 --> 01:29:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we glossed over it in the summary, but there is a condition on exterior lighting and the shielding and the type of lighting in there.

744
01:29:52,403 --> 01:29:55,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's consistent with the,

745
01:29:56,086 --> 01:30:08,877
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, type of lighting that was previously presented that's going to ensure, um, there isn't, um, forget the technical term, but essentially light pollution that spills onto the neighboring properties.

746
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:09,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

747
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:10,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

748
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:15,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Jamie, do you want to add something?

749
01:30:16,283 --> 01:30:17,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dark sky certified.

750
01:30:18,685 --> 01:30:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

751
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:19,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

752
01:30:21,928 --> 01:30:22,248
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

753
01:30:23,354 --> 01:30:25,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Other comments from members of the public?

754
01:30:30,396 --> 01:30:37,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to close public comment on the proposed conditions.

755
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:40,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

756
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:42,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

757
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,781
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

758
01:30:45,861 --> 01:30:46,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?

759
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:47,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

760
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:48,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

761
01:30:49,342 --> 01:30:49,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

762
01:30:50,142 --> 01:30:50,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

763
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:51,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

764
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

765
01:30:54,316 --> 01:30:55,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, aye.

766
01:30:56,057 --> 01:30:59,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Public comment is now closed on the proposed conditions.

767
01:30:59,539 --> 01:30:59,840
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

768
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:14,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the other item on the agenda, I believe, I don't know whether it's Attorney Tam or Attorney Gallagher, but I believe someone for the proponent intends to walk us through the updated waiver list.

769
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?

770
01:31:17,052 --> 01:31:17,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

771
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:18,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

772
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:41,521
[SPEAKER_11]: both Pat Gallagher and I will do this sort of in tandem and we'll be brief because as Paul Haverty mentioned he hasn't had an opportunity to review the updated waiver list yet so we'd expect to give him the opportunity to help refine the list and provide any clarifications to the board on Tuesday.

773
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:41,581
[SPEAKER_11]: So

774
01:31:44,177 --> 01:31:47,518
[SPEAKER_11]: We can show you and kind of scroll through.

775
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:53,500
[SPEAKER_11]: We just circulated this to Attorney Haverty and to Director Hunt within the last hour.

776
01:31:54,501 --> 01:32:03,664
[SPEAKER_11]: We've updated the waiver list that was requested as part of the revised submission to reflect the updated building program.

777
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:20,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And topically, I think it might make sense in five minutes or less, because you have not had the opportunity to review this, to just show you the types of waivers that we have sought and the reasons why.

778
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:30,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we would expect that we'll be refining this list with Attorney Haverty in the context of the overall decision for next week.

779
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:41,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to keep in mind that these are waivers being sought from local regulation in order to construct the project.

780
01:32:41,479 --> 01:32:53,370
[SPEAKER_11]: And the project, as we've reviewed with you, has been revised and refined so that it's our understanding, based on the prior discussions with the board,

781
01:32:54,297 --> 01:33:02,523
[SPEAKER_11]: that the scale, location, these issues, you're really focused on the project plans.

782
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:09,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is what the board is reviewing and ultimately approving by granting these waivers.

783
01:33:10,129 --> 01:33:17,135
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll kind of run through them, and a couple of them go to the decision themselves.

784
01:33:18,536 --> 01:33:22,679
[SPEAKER_11]: The first waiver we're seeking is from the Solar Energy System Ordinance.

785
01:33:23,835 --> 01:33:32,219
[SPEAKER_11]: As we've discussed with the board, the project does not at this time involve rooftop solar.

786
01:33:32,979 --> 01:33:39,302
[SPEAKER_11]: The multifamily structure is capable of accommodating rooftop solar.

787
01:33:39,362 --> 01:33:40,462
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an all electric building.

788
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:48,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is the level of the commitment that has been made at this stage.

789
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:52,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So a waiver has been sought from the application of that provision.

790
01:33:53,836 --> 01:34:07,187
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a historical preservation ordinance with a demo delay provision to the extent this old industrial building, this would apply to the removal of that building.

791
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:11,891
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeking a waiver as well from that section of the ordinance.

792
01:34:13,572 --> 01:34:22,280
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a number of technical waivers that we're seeking relating to sidewalk dimensions, street trees,

793
01:34:23,609 --> 01:34:28,041
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's discretion granted in the city council with respect to.

794
01:34:30,863 --> 01:34:31,963
[SPEAKER_11]: underground utilities.

795
01:34:32,463 --> 01:34:36,764
[SPEAKER_11]: And so for these, we're seeking waivers to build in accordance with the plan.

796
01:34:37,264 --> 01:34:47,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, on the street trees, we're dealing with in the context of a site that's fully private, that's entirely paved or impervious.

797
01:34:47,686 --> 01:34:54,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's going to be considerably a lot new landscape and buffer relative to what's out there today.

798
01:34:55,508 --> 01:34:57,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, this is one where

799
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,901
[SPEAKER_11]: quite literally, you don't want to lose the forest from the trees.

800
01:35:00,941 --> 01:35:03,363
[SPEAKER_11]: We're seeking the waivers to the extent they apply.

801
01:35:05,584 --> 01:35:12,908
[SPEAKER_11]: The additional provisions here are technical zoning provisions.

802
01:35:12,989 --> 01:35:17,791
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is a restriction on two principal structures on the same lot.

803
01:35:18,032 --> 01:35:25,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, there'll be more than one principal structure here between the townhomes and the principal multifamily building.

804
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:27,017
[SPEAKER_11]: So a waiver is being sought.

805
01:35:28,492 --> 01:35:41,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Similarly, there are use requirements associated with accessory uses for which we're out of an abundance of caution seeking waivers as well.

806
01:35:42,564 --> 01:35:46,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the bulk and dimensional requirements we've identified here.

807
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:54,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Things like yards are driven by, in many cases, by building height.

808
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why you see these

809
01:35:57,068 --> 01:36:02,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, these numbers, um, and and those, those changed as the building changed.

810
01:36:02,777 --> 01:36:03,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

811
01:36:03,197 --> 01:36:12,371
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you can understand this and we can review it in the context of the site plan to the extent the board or any members of the public have questions.

812
01:36:18,128 --> 01:36:22,110
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a number of other technical requirements about inner courts.

813
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:27,713
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, the building has courtyards, and it goes to the dimensions of those.

814
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:36,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the courtyards that have been designed and revised in accordance with your peer review are appropriately scaled.

815
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:40,599
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're seeking waivers from the technical requirements here.

816
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,242
[SPEAKER_11]: There are additional yard requirements that

817
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:53,493
[SPEAKER_11]: At this late hour, I don't think we need to get into unless you'd like us to.

818
01:36:53,733 --> 01:37:09,219
[SPEAKER_11]: But both side yard requirements and other dimensional requirements for accessory structures here, that it's detailed and noted as to why and how we're seeking these waivers.

819
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:11,720
[SPEAKER_11]: On parking,

820
01:37:12,998 --> 01:37:22,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to note, and this was a question that was raised both in connection with peer review by the board by members of the public and has even come up tonight.

821
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:27,617
[SPEAKER_11]: We've detailed and Vanessa has prepared.

822
01:37:29,073 --> 01:37:33,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And Beda has reviewed our parking plans, including the parking demand analysis.

823
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:51,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We are seeking waiver from the technical requirements that would be required for both multifamily as well as the self-storage in the context of your ability to grant a, quote, shared parking special permit.

824
01:37:53,013 --> 01:37:58,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that is subsumed within the comp permit and the appropriate waivers are set out here.

825
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:09,066
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also additional technical parking design requirements that are noted here, and we've noted where we need relief.

826
01:38:11,548 --> 01:38:18,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, all of these items have been peer reviewed in terms of the adequacy, the size, the dimension, et cetera.

827
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:21,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there was questions about signage.

828
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:30,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there is a waiver side here, uh, with respect to the process by which, um, to, uh, obtain signage.

829
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:38,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can review this in detail with Mr. Havardy and ultimately with the board, you know, in connection with the plants.

830
01:38:43,185 --> 01:38:46,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So a number of other waivers here.

831
01:38:46,446 --> 01:38:51,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these appear somewhat redundant because they come up in different sections of the ordinance.

832
01:38:52,627 --> 01:38:59,408
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't want to be, I don't want to blow through these, but if you have any questions, we can get into the details.

833
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, if not tonight, then on Tuesday.

834
01:39:08,849 --> 01:39:12,410
[SPEAKER_11]: There is, we're seeking,

835
01:39:14,247 --> 01:39:37,901
[SPEAKER_11]: both waivers from the application of these special residential regulations and also from the provision for development linkage fees.

836
01:39:44,296 --> 01:39:55,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also talked about... Attorney Tam, just double checking, because I received this too, but it was recently, and this may not even be a change from the prior version.

837
01:39:56,021 --> 01:40:04,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the linkage one, it's a waiver is requested from the process or from the fees?

838
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:11,948
[SPEAKER_11]: This was in our original application, I believe, as well.

839
01:40:13,946 --> 01:40:23,271
[SPEAKER_11]: that if you read the ordinance, we believe we're exempt from the linkage fee.

840
01:40:24,932 --> 01:40:29,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And we confirm this, and we can review it with Attorney Haverty.

841
01:40:30,175 --> 01:40:36,258
[SPEAKER_11]: But on a number of these, we've included them out of sort of an abundance of caution, because we don't want any ambiguity.

842
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:47,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's something I'd like to come back to later tonight, because this was something we discussed at length in the prior comprehensive permit, but thank you for clarifying.

843
01:40:47,866 --> 01:40:49,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We can come back to that at the end.

844
01:40:57,312 --> 01:41:07,318
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a number of processes that are subsumed by this comp permit, including site plan review to the extent it would apply, so we've noted those here.

845
01:41:13,018 --> 01:41:15,600
[SPEAKER_11]: There is some other technical submittal requirements.

846
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:29,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've provided a number of renderings and elevations over the course of this hearing, but we've retained this to the extent it would apply, and we haven't otherwise fulfilled it.

847
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:41,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I know the team from Bowler is still on, but to the extent there are questions, we've identified and sought

848
01:41:42,132 --> 01:42:07,782
[SPEAKER_11]: relief from the stormwater management rules and regs as well, specifically for this particular requirement in terms of rate of runoff and how it would apply to this development and how the stormwater management system and the stormwater plan has been analyzed and submitted.

849
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:24,388
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's fair to say this isn't, you know, I think Attorney Haverty will have an opportunity to review this.

850
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:36,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Your peer review consultants who have had the original waiver list, this is largely consistent with the original waiver list, but it's been updated to reflect a new project plans.

851
01:42:37,888 --> 01:42:49,413
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll have an opportunity to review this and we can respond to any questions that board members or members of staff or your consultants have on Tuesday evening.

852
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:51,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

853
01:42:52,874 --> 01:42:57,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do want to check in with the board for questions.

854
01:42:58,297 --> 01:42:59,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I am just going to

855
01:43:00,570 --> 01:43:17,424
[SPEAKER_06]: preempt the linkage topic in particular just by restating, or by not restating, by stating some of the details of what was discussed in the prior comprehensive permit as it may apply here.

856
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:25,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the prior comprehensive permit hearing, there was a request also from that applicant

857
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:31,861
[SPEAKER_06]: to waive the linkage requirements under the ordinance.

858
01:43:32,501 --> 01:43:35,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Their position was that the building was exempt.

859
01:43:36,222 --> 01:43:49,105
[SPEAKER_06]: The city weighed in and had a different position that only the subsidized units were exempt under Medford's development linkage fee.

860
01:43:49,185 --> 01:43:55,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So the remaining 75% units were in fact subject to the linkage fee.

861
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:01,932
[SPEAKER_06]: There was quite a bit of back and forth in that hearing.

862
01:44:03,193 --> 01:44:13,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The board issued a finding asserting that, in fact, only 25% of the units were exempt from the linkage.

863
01:44:14,943 --> 01:44:20,828
[SPEAKER_06]: This board is not precedent setting, so if things go that direction, we might have to have a similar consideration here.

864
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:46,181
[SPEAKER_06]: the basically where we landed just I'm sharing this in the in an effort to potentially speed up some some of the discussions is that under Medford's ordinance the just the subsidized units would be exempt unless there's something special beyond that about this project that would qualify

865
01:44:47,351 --> 01:45:00,728
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the units or a greater portion of the units as exempt from the linkage, which then meant that requesting this waiver required the board, you know, to consider that

866
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:07,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So what about the project needed that waiver?

867
01:45:07,783 --> 01:45:24,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there was some back and forth about how in that other project, there were some offsite improvements that had been agreed to, which the city treated as, I'm forgetting the technical term, but basically credits against linkage.

868
01:45:25,356 --> 01:45:29,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And the board ultimately issued a condition

869
01:45:31,102 --> 01:45:39,466
[SPEAKER_06]: to assert how much linkage was required for that project in light of the different improvements.

870
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:49,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another project where you've been working with us as a board and adjusting the design, and there's discussion.

871
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to talk a little bit more at the next hearing about

872
01:45:54,835 --> 01:45:57,878
[SPEAKER_06]: What you could or couldn't commit to in terms of offsite improvements.

873
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:10,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the city would take a similar position here that certain improvements that aren't really required under the the law might

874
01:46:11,517 --> 01:46:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: count as credits against this, but my understanding is that the entire project is not actually exempt from linkage.

875
01:46:19,659 --> 01:46:26,741
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some amount that in the absence of a waiver would be required under the Medford ordinance.

876
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:34,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have escalated this earlier if I think I had misunderstood the way it was phrased in the waiver list.

877
01:46:35,064 --> 01:46:39,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So Director Hunt, is that something you could speak to?

878
01:46:42,283 --> 01:46:50,987
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you summarize this extremely well, I'm not sure there's anything I would add on top of that unless there was something there was any confusion.

879
01:46:51,007 --> 01:46:54,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just want me to add.

880
01:46:56,349 --> 01:47:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr chair and I would just add based on my recollection that the city actually.

881
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:10,018
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so we offered the proponent credit for work done in terms of mitigation work.

882
01:47:10,778 --> 01:47:21,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the city actually wanted, thought that more should be included in the linkage fee than what we actually agreed on.

883
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:30,122
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say, my recollection is that the board actually gave the applicant more credit than what the city had recommended.

884
01:47:31,423 --> 01:47:32,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you, Andre.

885
01:47:34,373 --> 01:47:45,481
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some back and forth about whether I and I mitigations counted for that particular project, and the board was not in unanimous agreement about that condition.

886
01:47:45,521 --> 01:47:56,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, ultimately picked a number that was lower than I think what the city had stated.

887
01:47:57,749 --> 01:47:58,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt, please go ahead.

888
01:47:59,410 --> 01:47:59,690
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

889
01:48:01,343 --> 01:48:09,889
[SPEAKER_01]: As a reminder, the process that would occur in a normal situation is that the CD board would be reviewing this.

890
01:48:10,349 --> 01:48:25,299
[SPEAKER_01]: The staff would take the request for credits to the appropriate department heads because it's credit against water and sewer, against roads and sidewalks, against parks and against

891
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,340
[SPEAKER_01]: public safety.

892
01:48:27,761 --> 01:48:39,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would ask each of those areas, do you agree that this is and is the amount that they say it's costing an appropriate amount?

893
01:48:40,246 --> 01:48:51,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Just rather than, it's not that I sit there and say it's the right amount or the board would, but we would ask public safety, engineering, et cetera, if we felt that the credit amount was appropriate.

894
01:48:53,605 --> 01:49:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I understand this is the first time the proponent's hearing this, and I don't expect you to be prepared with a detailed response, but I am trying to drive us towards ability to have alignment and sort of agreement in principle on a set of conditions by next Tuesday.

895
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:33,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I think needs to happen, so clearly, Attorney Havardy is going to review the waiver list, will advise the board if, you know,

896
01:49:35,187 --> 01:49:39,090
[SPEAKER_06]: He has a particular view on what is and isn't eligible.

897
01:49:40,511 --> 01:49:57,362
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a dispute about what is and isn't eligible on next Tuesday, the board can find something for the sake of moving things along and identifying the amount of the waiver even being sought.

898
01:49:58,463 --> 01:50:04,147
[SPEAKER_06]: But then ultimately, it would be helpful for the board to know

899
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:34,905
[SPEAKER_06]: whether indeed the applicant is seeking waiver from the full amount or just a portion and associating, if it's a lesser than the full amount, associating that with some of the optional improvements that the applicant has agreed to make along the way, I think would

900
01:50:35,927 --> 01:50:40,490
[SPEAKER_06]: help the board to understand and justify a lesser number.

901
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:56,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the applicant might need some details from the city on what the actual amount of the linkage fee would be for the 75% of market rate units.

902
01:50:56,982 --> 01:51:01,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something we could provide to them relatively quickly?

903
01:51:02,277 --> 01:51:05,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to pull up the file with the numbers on it.

904
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:08,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it in the next 10 minutes.

905
01:51:09,322 --> 01:51:15,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chairman, we appreciate your comments and your goal.

906
01:51:16,167 --> 01:51:19,049
[SPEAKER_11]: We share your goal to reach closure on this.

907
01:51:20,691 --> 01:51:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: We do maintain, and we are familiar with the precedent here, but we do maintain that

908
01:51:29,978 --> 01:51:31,479
[SPEAKER_11]: the project is exempt.

909
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:55,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we, like you, want to reach closure on it, and we all know that there are a considerable number of commitments that have been made both on-site and off-site that are associated with real value, that to the extent this did apply to the market units, that credit should be given.

910
01:51:56,858 --> 01:51:58,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And that includes things like

911
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:12,504
[SPEAKER_11]: the grant of an easement over private property to allow for public parking along Amaranth and Myrtle, where that's real value because that's land area that would be subject to a public easement.

912
01:52:13,605 --> 01:52:16,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Things like the transportation improvements.

913
01:52:18,226 --> 01:52:28,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I would suggest that to the extent some of the fairly costly off-site mitigation were to be authorized by DCR,

914
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:40,490
[SPEAKER_11]: that to the extent we get authorization to do that work and implement it, that those credits could apply and we could we could craft this in a way

915
01:52:41,729 --> 01:52:47,834
[SPEAKER_11]: But our initial position, as you have to understand, is that this does not apply.

916
01:52:48,414 --> 01:52:58,622
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will work with you on, you know, again, we're looking at the overall cost here of mitigation associated with the project.

917
01:52:59,142 --> 01:53:10,331
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll work with Director Hunt and Attorney Haverty in the coming days to have that discussion and try to drive home, as you've requested, what we're prepared to accept.

918
01:53:12,315 --> 01:53:13,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

919
01:53:13,475 --> 01:53:14,736
[SPEAKER_06]: That's much appreciated.

920
01:53:15,076 --> 01:53:31,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, in light of that position, we'll do a check in again on Tuesday, in case your position changes, if needed, the board can, you know, review the details and make a finding about whether, you know, it does or doesn't apply.

921
01:53:31,921 --> 01:53:32,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can go from there.

922
01:53:36,427 --> 01:53:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

923
01:53:38,188 --> 01:53:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

924
01:53:38,628 --> 01:53:41,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And sorry, we're having that discussion now.

925
01:53:41,089 --> 01:53:46,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have brought it up earlier had I interpreted the waiver list correctly.

926
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:53,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the other questions or comments from members of the board?

927
01:53:53,173 --> 01:54:04,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, seeing none.

928
01:54:06,383 --> 01:54:12,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the proposed waiver list.

929
01:54:13,968 --> 01:54:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

930
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:20,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I saw Jim.

931
01:54:20,112 --> 01:54:22,373
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a roll call.

932
01:54:22,453 --> 01:54:22,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

933
01:54:22,853 --> 01:54:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

934
01:54:25,495 --> 01:54:25,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

935
01:54:26,015 --> 01:54:27,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

936
01:54:28,096 --> 01:54:28,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?

937
01:54:29,537 --> 01:54:29,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

938
01:54:30,298 --> 01:54:30,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

939
01:54:31,859 --> 01:54:31,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

940
01:54:32,919 --> 01:54:33,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

941
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:33,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

942
01:54:34,926 --> 01:54:39,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we are now taking public comment on the requested waiver list.

943
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:54,158
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a member of the public, you'd like to comment on the requested waiver list, you can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, you can type in chat, or you could email dennisdmcdougall at Medford-MA.gov.

944
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:01,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a Richmond Chow.

945
01:55:01,343 --> 01:55:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

946
01:55:05,504 --> 01:55:07,847
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Richmond Chow on 28 Myrtle Street.

947
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:21,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, this is new to the board from looking at the waiver list, so I haven't had time to look through the entire thing as well.

948
01:55:21,683 --> 01:55:24,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess one of my comments is,

949
01:55:25,793 --> 01:55:37,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I would stress to the board to actively look at the list, and a lot of it is related to the sheer size of the project, right?

950
01:55:37,418 --> 01:55:43,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that the team has gone through and tried to modify the project through the process, but obviously there is still.

951
01:55:44,902 --> 01:55:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit of request for waiver in terms of the city ordinances.

952
01:55:51,926 --> 01:56:13,457
[SPEAKER_04]: To Peter's comment about granting easement onto their property to allow this project to move along, I think part of his framing is not totally exact because granting the easement allows

953
01:56:14,177 --> 01:56:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability for the project to remain a certain size square footage from a size overall size of the apartment building versus.

954
01:56:21,825 --> 01:56:24,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if the streets were still that narrow.

955
01:56:24,988 --> 01:56:33,877
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the fire fire truck requirements and all that would would cut into the overall square footage of the building he's trying to build.

956
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:34,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

957
01:56:36,527 --> 01:56:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to get that statement out there.

958
01:56:38,988 --> 01:56:53,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it was framed as a, I don't know, give back or a leniency to the public or the board, there are extreme benefits for granting that easement.

959
01:56:53,317 --> 01:57:03,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the board should focus on things that they do care about and make sure the developer is held accountable for those things.

960
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:10,384
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are planning to grant some legacy in these waivers.

961
01:57:12,746 --> 01:57:13,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

962
01:57:13,407 --> 01:57:17,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so just a couple of things for public awareness.

963
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:21,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the waiver list,

964
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:30,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the comprehensive permit process, generally the board always would need to grant some waivers.

965
01:57:31,265 --> 01:57:35,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And the waivers fall into different categories.

966
01:57:35,828 --> 01:57:41,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are technical, some are dimensional, some are very specific to things that aren't

967
01:57:42,910 --> 01:57:45,211
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily inherent to the project itself.

968
01:57:46,211 --> 01:57:51,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And so customarily, the board could do something else.

969
01:57:51,032 --> 01:58:07,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But customarily, if the waiver is required because the plans that the board has basically seen and been peer-reviewed and iterated upon still violate a dimensional requirement, that will be

970
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: considered differently than waivers that kind of go beyond the scope of the project.

971
01:58:14,885 --> 01:58:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the board couldn't really say, hey, these plans look good, but then we're not going to grant you the waiver required for that plan, either the plans look good or they don't look good.

972
01:58:25,914 --> 01:58:30,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that the public understands that aspect.

973
01:58:30,738 --> 01:58:36,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I don't want to speak on behalf of Attorney Tim, but if I understood him correctly,

974
01:58:38,724 --> 01:58:52,581
[SPEAKER_06]: He was really focused specifically on some of the more technical elements of linkage and how under linkage, certain voluntary improvements to a project.

975
01:58:53,761 --> 01:58:57,024
[SPEAKER_06]: can be treated as credits against the fee.

976
01:58:57,124 --> 01:59:14,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this case, if the applicant had insisted that they did not want to do this and grant the easement for the parking places they could have, and then the board would have been considering a project with narrower streets with less parking and so on.

977
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:19,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So the board does, and the city would customarily do this analysis, hey, which

978
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:23,893
[SPEAKER_06]: improvements do or don't qualify for linkage credit.

979
01:59:23,913 --> 01:59:28,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So I interpreted the comment through that narrower lens.

980
01:59:28,157 --> 01:59:43,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it really intended to go beyond just this is something voluntary that might qualify as a linkage credit in the event that this product even requires a linkage fee.

981
01:59:49,091 --> 01:59:51,952
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I just wanted to get that out there for public awareness.

982
01:59:53,512 --> 01:59:56,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there other comments from members of the public?

983
02:00:05,235 --> 02:00:10,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing... Motion to close the public comment on the waiver list.

984
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're going to take a roll call.

985
02:00:13,397 --> 02:00:13,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

986
02:00:13,797 --> 02:00:14,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

987
02:00:15,677 --> 02:00:16,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

988
02:00:16,177 --> 02:00:17,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

989
02:00:18,178 --> 02:00:18,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?

990
02:00:19,765 --> 02:00:19,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

991
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:21,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

992
02:00:22,227 --> 02:00:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

993
02:00:23,348 --> 02:00:23,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

994
02:00:24,148 --> 02:00:24,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

995
02:00:24,248 --> 02:00:25,369
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

996
02:00:26,009 --> 02:00:28,291
[SPEAKER_06]: We've now closed public comment on the waiver list.

997
02:00:29,552 --> 02:00:34,716
[SPEAKER_06]: That brings us to the end of the intended topics for today.

998
02:00:35,656 --> 02:00:41,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to rehash my understanding of what we should expect by next meeting.

999
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:44,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So Attorney Haverty is going to review the waiver list.

1000
02:00:45,687 --> 02:00:48,968
[SPEAKER_06]: will come prepared on Tuesday with any feedback there.

1001
02:00:50,868 --> 02:01:08,832
[SPEAKER_06]: The proponent will discuss with the city this topic of linkage and credits and just try to come to the meeting on Tuesday, both with a position on whether linkage should apply to this project, and if so, what a reasonable amount would be.

1002
02:01:08,852 --> 02:01:08,912
[SPEAKER_06]: The

1003
02:01:13,822 --> 02:01:18,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Members of the board, please individually review the draft attorney have already sent.

1004
02:01:19,223 --> 02:01:27,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess to avoid issues of deliberation, we should just send individual marked up copies to Dennis.

1005
02:01:29,126 --> 02:01:34,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to, you know, if you see any things that need changing, I'd like to make sure those are reflected.

1006
02:01:34,527 --> 02:01:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm missing one thing.

1007
02:01:38,508 --> 02:01:39,408
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one other thing.

1008
02:01:41,772 --> 02:01:45,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre, were you going to say something or no?

1009
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1010
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:56,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and just generally, the proponent will come prepared on Tuesday to let us know of the draft

1011
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:10,220
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions, if there are any in particular that they would have concerns with that would like to be modified or addressed.

1012
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:12,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems there's at least one.

1013
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:19,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a proposed condition surrounding solar, and then there's a requested waiver from solar, but I'm sure there will be others.

1014
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: full conditions and then just wording of certain conditions.

1015
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:30,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the intention at our Tuesday meeting is we will discuss each of these topics.

1016
02:02:30,752 --> 02:02:40,574
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also the planned date of the vote on the project itself and the closure of the hearing.

1017
02:02:43,114 --> 02:02:45,375
[SPEAKER_06]: So before we move on, I just want to check in.

1018
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any

1019
02:02:47,247 --> 02:02:51,269
[SPEAKER_06]: logistical items we should be discussing before we continue.

1020
02:03:00,472 --> 02:03:03,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, not hearing or seeing any.

1021
02:03:04,714 --> 02:03:13,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to Tuesday,

1022
02:03:15,764 --> 02:03:16,405
[SPEAKER_06]: May 21st.

1023
02:03:16,765 --> 02:03:18,565
[SPEAKER_06]: May 21st at 630 p.m.

1024
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:19,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So moved.

1025
02:03:20,386 --> 02:03:22,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have a second?

1026
02:03:24,448 --> 02:03:26,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like Jim seconded.

1027
02:03:26,969 --> 02:03:28,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a roll call.

1028
02:03:28,169 --> 02:03:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim?

1029
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:29,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1030
02:03:30,330 --> 02:03:30,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

1031
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1032
02:03:32,631 --> 02:03:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?

1033
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:34,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1034
02:03:35,012 --> 02:03:35,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yvette?

1035
02:03:36,272 --> 02:03:36,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1036
02:03:37,473 --> 02:03:37,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?

1037
02:03:38,233 --> 02:03:38,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1038
02:03:39,043 --> 02:03:40,304
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we are continued.

1039
02:03:40,784 --> 02:03:41,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, folks.

1040
02:03:42,726 --> 02:03:44,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great evening, and we'll see you in a few days.

1041
02:03:46,288 --> 02:03:47,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1042
02:03:47,509 --> 02:03:47,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1043
02:03:51,212 --> 02:03:51,672
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1044
02:03:54,655 --> 02:03:58,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, I think we've got a couple of small items on the agenda.

1045
02:03:58,918 --> 02:03:59,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did it happen again?

1046
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:00,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1047
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have quorum, so I think, right?

1048
02:04:03,982 --> 02:04:05,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't jump off this time.

1049
02:04:06,423 --> 02:04:07,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have quorum.

1050
02:04:07,184 --> 02:04:07,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, technically.

1051
02:04:14,790 --> 02:04:15,270
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on mute.

1052
02:04:19,332 --> 02:04:22,733
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing we have really remaining is, I think it's just approval of some meeting minutes.

1053
02:04:23,554 --> 02:04:28,155
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably our, I don't think there's really anything else administrative.

1054
02:04:28,496 --> 02:04:36,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, I'll let you know, like, whatever I get this week, and I've sent an email to, this is what I did last time too, is to

1055
02:04:38,574 --> 02:04:41,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Pat Gallagher with Goulston and Storrs, basically with my cell phone number.

1056
02:04:41,916 --> 02:04:51,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, I do this, you know, when you send it, text me, and that way I'll know that it's in my inbox so I can get it to you all as pretty much to turn around as quickly as possible.

1057
02:04:51,921 --> 02:04:52,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1058
02:04:52,741 --> 02:04:54,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And same thing with Paul Haverdale.

1059
02:04:54,602 --> 02:05:05,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do send that to him as well just because I'll be kind of slightly unavailable Friday night into Friday morning, I mean into Saturday morning, but after that I'll be around.

1060
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:05,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1061
02:05:06,148 --> 02:05:06,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.

1062
02:05:07,823 --> 02:05:20,729
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of the meeting minutes, I did have a chance to read them if others had a chance.

1063
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:25,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The ones that we had were March 26th, April 11th, and April 23rd.

1064
02:05:25,512 --> 02:05:27,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I just posted the May 9th one in there.

1065
02:05:28,853 --> 02:05:33,934
[SPEAKER_08]: just this morning, so y'all haven't had a chance to look at that, but the other ones have been in for a bit.

1066
02:05:34,314 --> 02:05:39,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the other ones have been in for well over a week at the latest.

1067
02:05:40,235 --> 02:05:44,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anyone like to make a motion regarding those meeting minutes?

1068
02:05:44,456 --> 02:05:46,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve the meeting minutes.

1069
02:05:47,676 --> 02:05:49,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me the dates again.
