[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, how are you?

43
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary Ann, if you can give us a little update on what's happening.

44
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:53,535
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.

45
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:54,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to.

46
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.

47
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody.

48
00:02:56,557 --> 00:03:13,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have good news today, our Metro North collaboration, regional collaboration with the other communities are dispensing site at the Tufts Gansher Center is going to be live and ready to go this week.

49
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:18,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So as of tomorrow, and Thursday, there will be appointments available.

50
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:23,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of limited tomorrow and Thursday, but we will be building up.

51
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:33,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that is kicking off and that's great news because, uh, as a collaborating community, we get a certain allocations.

52
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:47,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, we get an allocation of doses that we can use and we are going to be able to offer a, uh, a clinic at the high school, uh, Thursday afternoon, um, for

53
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:53,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford High School students ages 16 plus, because it is the Pfizer vaccine.

54
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:59,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly kids ages 16 and 17 will need parental consent.

55
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:05,474
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need their parents to be with them, but they actually do have to bring in the consent form.

56
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,636
[SPEAKER_01]: The school is putting out information today and will again tomorrow.

57
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:17,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really exciting because we've seen, you know, luckily we've seen our cases

58
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally starting to decline a little bit, where we've been seeing single digits for the first time in a long time, as far as daily case counts go.

59
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:41,697
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really interesting in that the majority of our cases are under 20 year olds, or 20, I should say 20 and under year olds, and split really half and half.

60
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:45,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanna get our students, our kids vaccinated

61
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:57,015
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that next week, the FDA goes forward with the EUA approval for Pfizer to actually be able to vaccinate 12 to 15 year olds.

62
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:02,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with this collaboration, we believe going forward, we'll have doses.

63
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:11,261
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to actually continue to do some clinics that we can move forward with our students and our children.

64
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really exciting news because that's what we're seeing now, the majority of our cases

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good news.

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:26,602
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing a lot of cases in our, I think we had two cases in 80 year olds and under five at 70 years old.

67
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:31,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that the vaccine has been out there.

68
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:36,784
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done about 4,000 doses since the board of health for the city of Medford.

69
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:40,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about 2000 plus totally vaccinated.

70
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two doses, right?

71
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So about over 2000 folks we've been able to vaccinate

72
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of that was our elders.

73
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're glad to see that.

74
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing less hospitalizations, less severe illness.

75
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good thing, but we're not out of the woods yet.

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:10,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though the state is loosening up on some of its gathering limits and requirements for vaccinated or not, we're still asking people, wear your masks, socially distance.

77
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep this up until we get it done.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,121
[SPEAKER_01]: but certainly things are looking better.

79
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

80
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,942
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Marianne, how are the nursing homes doing?

81
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:23,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well.

82
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:29,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I haven't heard any cases of them.

83
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of their clients have been vaccinated.

84
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:40,827
[SPEAKER_01]: They do take on COVID positive people, but I know like the Medford Rehab has not seen a positive case in a long time.

85
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,620
[SPEAKER_01]: and the same with Glen Ridge.

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so we're doing, they're doing much better.

87
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh, so much better.

88
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:50,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

89
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions for Marianne?

90
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:55,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

91
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member.

92
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

93
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here, Marianne.

94
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:08,218
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to confirm for the, the vaccination site at Tufts is the, the way to register for that is still through that state website.

95
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

96
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for bringing that up.

97
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:15,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's a chat function here that I can, I will put in the chat.

98
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:23,004
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go through the MassFact site, the typical, on the website, the MassFact site.

99
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:33,932
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little harder to find, but you can do, you'll find an exact link for the Gansher Center at Tufts if you put in your zip code.

100
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:42,142
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll put the chat, the specific one, because it does say Metro North, and that takes you right to the Gancho Center.

101
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:47,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be operating 11 to four right now on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

102
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:53,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll be able to expand that going forward, but as far as the doses go right now.

103
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of this collaborative, we have three sites.

104
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:03,967
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Encore Casino is offering, we have the Gancho Center at Tufts,

105
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:13,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of next week, we will have what's currently the Cambridge Health Alliance used to be, I believe a target in Somerville that they're using now.

106
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:22,113
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll come online next week, but this week it's the Gancher and the Encore are accepting appointments tomorrow and Thursday.

107
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:29,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will put that in the chat, but yes, you go through the MassFact site, you'll be able to find it as well.

108
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:30,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

109
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:35,192
[SPEAKER_00]: And are all of those sites are appointment only, none are walk-in, those are all appointments only?

110
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:46,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Working towards walk-in because access is important, and I know people are intimidated by the process of even going online trying to find an appointment.

111
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:51,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to be able to accept walk-ins.

112
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,341
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just starting this week, so we're gonna get staffing up, but walk-ins, I think, is definitely our goal going forward.

113
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:05,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, we were lucky enough, Tufts had extra doses that they had purchased for their students,

114
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:12,206
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they didn't have them all fulfilled, they put it, we put it out there.

115
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:22,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think on that Thursday or Friday last week, they had 300 appointments and 400 walk-ins.

116
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did 700 in that day and 400 of those walk-ins.

117
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have, we can do it, but we want to make sure that, you know, we're able to,

118
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,169
[SPEAKER_01]: to publicize it the right way.

119
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,191
[SPEAKER_01]: So walk-ins is definitely our goal.

120
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:37,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

121
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:38,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marianne.

122
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.

123
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:51,623
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a story recently in Kaiser Health News about what local directors of public health have really been dealing with for the past 14 months above and beyond just the actual work, kind of the stress of the job.

124
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:54,645
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate just what you've done and what your team has done.

125
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again.

126
00:09:55,506 --> 00:10:00,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Marianne, CBS is doing them also, I think.

127
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:08,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, CVS and Walgreens are there, and I believe they're working towards walk-ins as well.

128
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:21,384
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much everyone's goal right now, as far as we wanna get folks who have a little bit of hesitancy or a little bit of nervousness about accessing and trying to use that registration site.

129
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:29,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone's goal is going really towards walk-ins, but Walgreens and CVS, yes, and they're pretty easy to get appointments at this point.

130
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

131
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

132
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:38,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Maryann, when you were last here, we spoke a lot about how busy your office was.

133
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:45,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that time, you indicated that your office was working about 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you had about between nine and 11 employees.

134
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:46,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that still the case?

135
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better.

136
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:55,236
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not working as much weekends now.

137
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:55,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And

138
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are getting a little bit easier.

139
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,063
[SPEAKER_01]: The contact tracing is, you know, again, we're in single digit cases, which is nice to see.

140
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:14,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are gonna be able to hopefully keep offering clinics, but certainly that it feels better.

141
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:19,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels better that we're not putting in as many hours as.

142
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,219
[SPEAKER_12]: as was required earlier.

143
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Loosen the restrictions on outdoor gatherings.

144
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:29,966
[SPEAKER_12]: What impact does that have on the rental of our public facilities here in the city of Metro?

145
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:37,292
[SPEAKER_01]: So outdoor events, as of May 19th, you're going to be able to have 250 folks at outdoor gatherings.

146
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors, they're talking 200.

147
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,116
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be as of May 19th.

148
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:56,113
[SPEAKER_01]: They have already loosened the restrictions and rescinded a lot of the guidance on certain sectors.

149
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:59,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're expecting a lot of that to change.

150
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:06,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even as of May 10th, they're talking about like the pool restrictions will be changing.

151
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,342
[SPEAKER_01]: They rescinded the beach restrictions.

152
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:13,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about Tufts pool and Wrights pond, like things are definitely opening up.

153
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:18,824
[SPEAKER_12]: as really with the fields, because the fields are a revenue generating entity that we have here in this community.

154
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:24,106
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we were last here, we discussed a little bit about how the permitting process has changed.

155
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:30,149
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, ultimately those fields do about $215,000 a season each.

156
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we're approaching close to $700,000 in the rental of those fields.

157
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,311
[SPEAKER_12]: They're a revenue generating entity.

158
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:40,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And my concern is that we're not missing out on applicants that are seeking

159
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:46,216
[SPEAKER_12]: to rent our fields when there are vacancies because of bureaucracy and bureaucratic delays.

160
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:52,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So as of right now, their safety plans are still in, the guidance is still in place for sports.

161
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reviewing all of the rental requests.

162
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't denied any of them.

163
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:08,750
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their safety plans and that's all we've been requiring that they tell us they're gonna, you know, fulfill the guidance and adhere to their safety plans.

164
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so nothing has been denied.

165
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:22,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and as restrictions loosen up as far as spectators and that type of thing, which has not changed, the sports guidance will probably change, um, by the end of the month.

166
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, it's still in place.

167
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:30,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just where we're going with the safety plans, but nothing's been denied.

168
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:38,868
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still applications are coming in daily for soccer and on that point, have applications not been acted upon.

169
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,154
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they've all been acted upon.

170
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:42,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

171
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:57,302
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've spoken with a number of entities that have requested to use field space that have said, you know, on a Thursday afternoon, they find out that there's a vacancy at Medford and then they ask them to use the field space and then they never get a response and then they don't get to use the field space that weekend.

172
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I don't know who they're asking.

173
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't speak to that.

174
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:07,148
[SPEAKER_12]: A very popular ultimate Frisbee group, the Whitecaps actually, if you remember back a few years ago, the city of Medford was,

175
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:13,756
[SPEAKER_12]: actually featured on ESPN's top 10 moments when someone at Hormel stadium made an amazing ultimate Frisbee catch.

176
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:18,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really know what that means, but, um, there was somebody that made, you know, a great play and they were on ESPN.

177
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:27,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that was recorded at Hormel stadium and that group, the whitecaps, um, which historically used the field, um, in my experience, they've never had a problem until recently.

178
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, do we know, um, so in terms of applications that come in per week, how many applications are you looking at?

179
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

180
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:46,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, I haven't seen any this week, but I think we're up to date with all the applications we've gotten.

181
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,165
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one we did was we had jumbo soccer.

182
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did an ultimate frisbee one, actually.

183
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an adult women's soccer.

184
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:56,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've all been, they're up to date.

185
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:03,315
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever applications are in-house have all been processed and they've gone on to the whole middle stadium commission.

186
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And how does it work now?

187
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,018
[SPEAKER_12]: So an application will go into where?

188
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,901
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes into the mayor's office.

189
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,261
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a checklist.

190
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,743
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes to me next for approval as far as the safety plans are concerned.

191
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,724
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I approve that, it goes on to the whole mail commission.

192
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're up to date as far as I know.

193
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, it goes to the mayor's office.

194
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,669
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the mayor's office do to send it to your office?

195
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:41,386
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a checklist, they have their own checklist around, I believe, insurance requirements and those types of things.

196
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only involved in the safety.

197
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,389
[SPEAKER_12]: The field administrator handled that for a hundred years.

198
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually the way it would work would be that the application would go into the field administrator, the field administrator would check for availability.

199
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,177
[SPEAKER_12]: If the availability was there, they'd secure the field for the applicant.

200
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,358
[SPEAKER_12]: The applicant would then fill out the paperwork.

201
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:03,501
[SPEAKER_12]: If the paperwork wasn't completed and the payment wasn't attached, then the applicant wouldn't get to use the field.

202
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:08,778
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like it was a little bit more streamlined and it was a little bit more of a guarantee that we were getting some money in our coffers.

203
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:23,512
[SPEAKER_12]: My disappointment with the process is well known and well publicized, Madam Director, and I'm hoping that with the restrictions that are being loosened by the administration at the state level that they will also be loosened at this level.

204
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:29,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there was just a problem that they were being able to be scheduled before their safety plans were approved.

205
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that's been, but yeah, I appreciate it.

206
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:34,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

207
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:41,249
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be micromanaging as well, but I just think that it's a really, you know, over bureaucratic and unnecessary stuff.

208
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It's requirements from the state that we have to follow.

209
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,731
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we do.

210
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think anybody hasn't.

211
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:49,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is, but that's okay.

212
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne, thank you very much for your update and the hard work of you and your department.

214
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:00,764
[SPEAKER_06]: A quick question regarding the vaccination clinics at Tufts University.

215
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that indefinitely every Wednesday and Thursday?

216
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:09,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Going forward, we're hoping we'll expand it to more days than just Wednesday and Thursday.

217
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:16,576
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as vaccine availability right now from the state, it looks like Wednesdays and Thursdays at least are definite.

218
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,538
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're hoping to expand to more days going forward.

219
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:20,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

220
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:26,454
[SPEAKER_06]: And with regard to mobile vaccination, we talked about that before.

221
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:27,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give us an update?

222
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:31,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we still or is the city still have a mobile vaccination program?

223
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,542
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as a homebound goes?

224
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

225
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

226
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:46,233
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, we're still taking folks if they're interested in needing a homebound vaccination, they can certainly still contact us.

227
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:50,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we, we, we completed our list.

228
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have three people maybe left this week to do.

229
00:17:53,713 --> 00:18:00,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we've done pretty close to 200 people, um, have been completed as far as homebound vaccinations go.

230
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:13,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but again, if people still need, um, they can still contact our multi resource, uh, line multi, uh, legal resource line and, um, be happy to put them on a list and get them done.

231
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:14,737
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have, um,

232
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,642
[SPEAKER_01]: J J vaccine for homebound if folks are interested in it.

233
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly please call us.

234
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

235
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:35,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And last time we talked, we talked a little bit about, I believe there was about populations that were not maybe hesitant towards getting the vaccine.

236
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:42,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We were working, I believe you had mentioned that we were working maybe with the state or there was another program that the city was working with to

237
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,517
[SPEAKER_06]: get people that were hesitant, vaccine hesitant, vaccinated.

238
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:48,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that still in play?

239
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are launching that campaign very soon.

240
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:57,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, so there is vaccine hesitancy we found among different groups.

241
00:18:57,423 --> 00:19:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: We have information, we're kind of targeted by sectors, so faith-based business info.

242
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will be holding a town hall on May 19th.

243
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:30,591
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to access the ambassadors that the state have already hired and have in place that speak multi languages and culturally aware and they can come out and depending on where we're holding our events, they can come out and speak to people with specific issues, but there will be.

244
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:39,837
[SPEAKER_01]: We're planning on a town hall on May 19 to hopefully address people's fears and issues around, you know, vaccine hesitancy.

245
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:41,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be via Zoom?

246
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:44,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, via Zoom.

247
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:49,618
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at a couple of different options.

248
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,721
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be able to hold it in different locations and then also via Zoom.

249
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:56,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

250
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

251
00:19:59,084 --> 00:19:59,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions?

252
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:01,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Marianne.

253
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:02,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

254
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:03,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.

255
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:04,828
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

[SPEAKER_09]: The city is applying

284
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,729
[SPEAKER_09]: or $1,546,980 block grant funds.

285
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:54,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Beginning April 12th, 2020, the annual draft action plan will be available for review and comment and can be obtained by contacting the Office of Community Development at 781-393-2480 or OCD at MedfordMethod.gov.

286
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:18,231
[SPEAKER_09]: written comments must be submitted no later than May 12th, 2021 to Ashley Williams, City Hall 85, George P. Hesse Drive, room 308, FMS 0255, or abwilliams at medfordmass.gov.

287
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, do we have a, where this is a public hearing, do we have anyone here speaking in favor of this?

288
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I may.

289
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:38,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight, I think it might make sense that we just give a brief breakdown.

290
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:51,464
[SPEAKER_12]: I have the paper in front of me, actually, of the agency that's applied for the funding and the recommendation for the upcoming CDBG fiscal year block grant that's being made by the Office of Community Development to the administration.

291
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:57,767
[SPEAKER_12]: That recommendation would go to the mayor, and then the mayor would have the opportunity to either say, I like the recommendation or she can

292
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,089
[SPEAKER_12]: use our executive authority to change that recommendation, Mr. President.

293
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:07,733
[SPEAKER_12]: But in looking at this, I think it's important that we do inform the general public about what it is exactly that's being appropriated.

294
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:14,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we look at Bread of Life, they'd be recommended for the fiscal year, $2,603.

295
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,458
[SPEAKER_12]: For Community Tasks Incorporated, $5,045.

296
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,079
[SPEAKER_12]: For Community Family Inc., $5,000.

297
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,560
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Medford Council on Aging, $34,200.

298
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,629
[SPEAKER_12]: For Housing Families Incorporated, $13,000.

299
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:31,810
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Immigrant Learning Center, $6,200.

300
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,792
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, $15,000, Mr. President.

301
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,573
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Medford Public Schools, $10,000.

302
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:39,855
[SPEAKER_12]: For the YMCA and Mystic Community Market Boys and Girls Club, $10,000.

303
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:41,676
[SPEAKER_12]: For the Mystic Valley Urban Services, $5,000.

304
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,657
[SPEAKER_12]: For SCM Transportation, $105,000.

305
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:45,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the West Medford Community Center, $21,000, Mr. President.

306
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:04,674
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a total award for FY 21-22 of $1,546,988 with a 15% cap waived, allowing the public service entities to be afforded $232,048.

307
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:05,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

308
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:06,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Hunt, you had your hand up.

309
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:38,772
[SPEAKER_04]: As the Community Development Director, I am here to present the paper if necessary or to answer any questions.

311
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:46,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to acknowledge that Ashley Williams, who is the staff person that administrates this grant, is also here this evening.

312
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:49,599
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the one that comments would be going to.

313
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,182
[SPEAKER_04]: this was advertised starting in mid April.

314
00:24:54,202 --> 00:25:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: To date, Ashley informs me that we have not received any public comments outside of the meetings that we had with the city council on this.

315
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:12,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And shortly before the public comment section time opened, we had a public meeting and we received comments at that public meeting.

316
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Those have been incorporated into this plan already.

317
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there are further questions.

318
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:20,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

319
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else in favor of this petition?

320
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this portion of the hearing.

321
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:31,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone here that is in opposition to this plan?

322
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:36,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the meeting.

323
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Vice President Knight.

324
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:43,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking as a citizen out of 9200 Rubin Street, I'd like to see an increase in the funding for the metric consumer commissions.

325
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:44,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have

326
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:50,685
[SPEAKER_12]: an opportunity here to really build upon some of the successes that we've made and the strides that we've made over the past years.

327
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:54,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And this represents a reduction in benefits and an award from last year.

328
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,714
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that that's something that should be looked at a little bit further.

329
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,840
[SPEAKER_12]: The individuals that are employed in the Medford Consumer Commission work right here out of City Hall.

330
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:12,786
[SPEAKER_12]: They provide a valuable service to many of the residents here in this community, especially our senior citizens who have been falling victim to many of these COVID-19 scams, Social Security scams, and the like.

331
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:24,929
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to speak out in opposition of the current protocols that are – the current recommendations that are in there and request that the Consumer Commission be afforded additional funds in line with at least last year's award.

332
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:27,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

333
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:35,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have received several calls from people that have used that office and we're happy with the results of that office.

334
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:39,100
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do support the additional funding if it is available.

335
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

336
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Councilor Marks.

337
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:51,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I wholeheartedly agree with Vice President Knight, but I remember at the public hearing and someone can correct me if I'm wrong,

339
00:26:52,062 --> 00:27:01,189
[SPEAKER_11]: the mayor was gonna supplement the decrease in funding and the community block grant money with money in the FY22 budget.

340
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that not correct, Mr. President?

341
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:06,834
[SPEAKER_08]: You are correct.

342
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:11,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did receive a commitment and maybe Alicia can speak to that.

343
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:15,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that a commitment that was made by the city administration?

344
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:17,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia?

345
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you.

346
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:20,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

347
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:28,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be clear, last year, we were allowed to not follow the cap of 15% of CDBG funds.

348
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:37,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were able to provide additional funding to several communities, or to several organizations, including that organization.

349
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,013
[SPEAKER_04]: organization is actually receiving an increase from the amount that they had been.

350
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:50,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Every other organization was level funded from previous years, from multiple previous years.

351
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:57,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the one public service agency that we were able to increase by actually decreasing a different public service.

352
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:05,951
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, in order to increase that agency, we would have to decrease one of the other agencies funding on the list.

353
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: because there is a cap this year.

354
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: There was not a cap last year because of the pandemic.

355
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:15,215
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has committed to increasing the funding.

356
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:23,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So this office has not previously received budget funding for personnel and salaries in the city's budget.

357
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:35,423
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has informed me and has informed the director of that office that she will be supplementing that budget this year in the city's general fund budget, which is new this year.

358
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:39,073
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, they've only received a budget for office supplies.

359
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:44,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, do we have an indication of what the dollar amount will be?

360
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have, Alicia, do we have an indication of what the dollar amount will be?

361
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:54,600
[SPEAKER_04]: She did not tell me specifically, so I don't want to misrepresent it.

362
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,863
[SPEAKER_04]: She did indicate that she would make up what we couldn't provide, but she didn't use numbers.

363
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:04,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

364
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:04,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

365
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We will close that part of the meeting in opposition.

366
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a motion on the floor to accept the plan?

367
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mr. President, it's a 30 day public comment period.

368
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:27,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.

369
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:33,787
[SPEAKER_09]: When we vote on this, it will be put in the paper for the 30 day commentary.

370
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:39,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So it requires a vote tonight to put into it for a 30 day comment period?

371
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it doesn't.

372
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The 30 day comment period closes on actually the May 11th.

373
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that number was the date was just in the hearing that you read.

374
00:29:52,754 --> 00:30:02,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Our hope would be that you would vote to approve it this evening so that we could submit it the day after the comment period closes, assuming that we don't receive any further comments.

375
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,223
[SPEAKER_04]: The one other thing, I actually have a request.

376
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:17,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Several Councilors commented that they received comments about this amount and that they went directly to the Councilors.

377
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, please direct residents to send public comment to Ashley or to OCD as is in the public comment in the hearing notice.

378
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:36,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a federal program, we need to receive the comments with names and addresses directly in order to technically take them into account.

379
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:52,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We're happy to take the Councilor's request into account, and that's why we're here to do that, but we really need the residents to contact our office directly so that we can include that information when we do our filings with the federal government.

380
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:55,965
[SPEAKER_04]: They prefer not to get hearsay.

381
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:08,323
[SPEAKER_12]: On that point, Mr. President, what's the purpose of us having a public hearing, then, if the people that come here and make comments in favor or opposition aren't counted towards the decision-making process?

382
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:17,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight, your name and address will go on that list of public comment, but all the residents that you have heard from, we don't have their names and addresses on our list.

383
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:19,606
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not here making the comments.

384
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just submit it.

385
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:29,112
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll submit it with the comments that we have, but we do submit the public comments to the federal government.

386
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, I'm gonna submit a comment that says that the councilor received comments from residents making this request.

387
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that those voices would be louder if we also had their names and addresses.

388
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,676
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm concerned about.

389
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:48,497
[SPEAKER_12]: I spoke as a citizen in opposition and asked for an increase in this funding in this line item.

390
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, if my,

391
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,338
[SPEAKER_12]: voice isn't gonna be heard or recorded.

392
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:54,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't talked about that.

393
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said that your name and address will be recorded.

394
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,407
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a comment that you'd heard from many residents.

395
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:08,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just asking that residents be directed to send us their comments for the record.

396
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:11,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I have told residents to call.

397
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:14,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you call me, get asked them to call your office and the mayor's office.

398
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:15,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

399
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:19,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, any further questions?

400
00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:27,335
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Marks for approval, seconded by Vice President Knight.

401
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:28,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

402
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:35,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears?

403
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:36,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

404
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco?

405
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

406
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

407
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,001

00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:41,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

413
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:46,343
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

414
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:46,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

415
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

416
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:48,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passed.

417
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

418
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

419
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:57,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions are as a resolution to one, three, four, six office by vice-president night.

420
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:02,259
[SPEAKER_09]: We have so resolved that the Medford city council requested DPW address the following items.

421
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,762
[SPEAKER_09]: One sidewalk hole in front of Highland development on Winchester street and Albion street.

422
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:17,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, deep pothole at third street and Bradbury across from Harris park baseball basketball court.

423
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:21,484
[SPEAKER_09]: sidewalk trip hazard at 436 Riverside Avenue.

424
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:26,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, sidewalk trip hazard and tree inspection at 32 Walker Street.

425
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:31,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Five, bicycle frame attached to the pole on Bradley Road near the credit union.

426
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:33,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

427
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

428
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:46,315
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see, one might guess that opening day for Medford Little League has happened and I've been spending a lot of time down the fields and also a lot of time in our various neighborhoods in our community.

429
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And through my travels, I have been approached by a variety of our residents here in the community requesting service requests.

430
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:58,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these requests, I did direct the citizenry to go on to C-Click Fix.

431
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:03,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them I didn't, but you'll see some of these on C-Click Fix right now, Mr. President.

432
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:07,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Sidewalk hole, you know, majority of them are public safety issues, trip hazards.

433
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:13,324
[SPEAKER_12]: The bicycle frame attached to the pole on Bradley Road is something that I think should be addressed immediately.

434
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:14,605
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been there for about, oh,

435
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:21,252
[SPEAKER_12]: month and a half, Mr. President, it's been stripped down now to just the bicycle frame, no tires, no seat, no pedals.

436
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:27,077
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just literally a frame of a bike attached to a pole, and it's been there for an extended period of time.

437
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:34,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm asking that these items be addressed by IDPW or the appropriate department to rectify the situation.

438
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:42,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Sidewalk Hole in front of Highland Development is a trip hazard, Deep Pothole and 3rd Street in Bradbury across from Harris Park is a trip hazard as well as the

439
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,950
[SPEAKER_12]: trip hazards on Riverside Avenue and Walter Street.

440
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Riverside Avenue and Walter Street are the result of tree roots, Mr. President, uplifting the sidewalk.

441
00:34:51,753 --> 00:35:00,399
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support these measures and request that the DPW or the appropriate department take necessary impromptu action to rectify the situation.

442
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, any further questions?

443
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:07,924
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

444
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,445
[SPEAKER_09]: To collect, please call the roll.

445
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

446
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:15,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

447
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

448
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:17,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice president Knight.

449
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:17,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

450
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:18,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

451
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:19,004
Yes.

452
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:19,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

453
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:20,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

454
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent, president Caraviello.

455
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:25,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent motion passes.

456
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:37,216
[SPEAKER_09]: 21347 offered by vice president Knight be it so resolved that the Medford city council extend a deep and sincere congratulations to Rita Lennox on the momentous celebration of her 90th birthday.

457
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:37,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice president Knight.

458
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:40,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

459
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Rita Lennox is a lifelong Medford resident.

460
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,785
[SPEAKER_12]: She resides in West Medford with her husband, Peter.

461
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:52,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was one point in time when it could be argued that Rita was the person to call if you wanted to get anything done in the city of Medford.

462
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:59,514
[SPEAKER_12]: If you called Rita Lennox and you put Rita Lennox on it, you better believe that Mike McGlynn was getting a phone call every single hour until it got taken care of.

463
00:35:59,554 --> 00:36:00,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Rita's been a great person.

464
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:06,657
[SPEAKER_12]: She's been someone who's been committed to her community, to her family, and most certainly committed to service, Mr. President.

465
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,674
[SPEAKER_12]: She's been a lifelong resident in this community and because of her methods without a place.

466
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:18,278
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just like to take this opportunity to wish her a happy 90th birthday on this momentous occasion.

467
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,239
[SPEAKER_12]: She was surrounded by friends and family and was able to celebrate it wonderfully.

468
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:22,660
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope she has 90 moments.

469
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,521
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

470
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

471
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion by vice president seconded by councilor Falco council locks.

472
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:43,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Rita Lennox has been a fixture in this community for a number of years, and Councilor Knight is absolutely correct.

473
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:50,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Rita was very involved in the community and someone that was instrumental and volunteered our services for many years.

474
00:36:50,776 --> 00:37:01,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to work with Rita at the Registry of Deeds back some years ago, and indeed, she ran the Registry of Deeds as well, Mr. President.

475
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:05,760
[SPEAKER_11]: So Rita, in whatever capacity, was always a leader and still is a leader.

476
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:10,099
[SPEAKER_11]: and I wanna congratulate her reaching her 90th birthday, Mr. President.

477
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

478
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Box.

479
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:17,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

480
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:21,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

481
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:22,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

482
00:37:23,646 --> 00:37:24,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

483
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:24,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

484
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:25,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

485
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:25,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

486
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:26,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

487
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:27,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

488
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

489
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:28,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

490
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli-Thompson, President Caraviello.

491
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, six in favor, one absent, motion passes.

492
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:46,106
[SPEAKER_09]: 21348 offered by Vice President Rice, it's so resolved that the Medford City Council extended Stephen's sincere congratulations to Nancy White on the momentous celebration of her 80th birthday.

493
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:47,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Rice.

494
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:49,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

495
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy birthday to Nancy.

496
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:55,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Nancy White has been a long-time resident of Medford, very involved in the

497
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:58,827
[SPEAKER_12]: the Massachusetts Democratic Party, the Medford Wooden City Committee.

498
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:06,433
[SPEAKER_12]: But she was also a wonderful educator, Mr. President, worked in the Medford public schools for a number of years and touched the lives of many students, mine included.

499
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:15,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, Nancy White's someone that's really been a asset to our community, someone that has provided troubled youth with guidance.

500
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:20,504
[SPEAKER_12]: She's been willing to dedicate her time for progressive values that we all share.

501
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:24,627
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's someone that has truly made a difference in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

502
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:34,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution, wishing Nancy a happy 80th birthday, and hope she had a great day.

503
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

504
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:36,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

505
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

506
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

507
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:50,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also like to wish Nancy White a very happy birthday, as Councilor Knight stated, and have some very nice memories of Nancy.

508
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,602
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in the school committee,

509
00:38:53,678 --> 00:39:01,003
[SPEAKER_06]: working in the school system, always helping out and always helping out with the method democratic board and sitting committee.

510
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:09,829
[SPEAKER_06]: We choose a vice chair for the longest time and always ran a good meeting and very nice person and I just want to wish her a very happy birthday.

511
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:10,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

512
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

513
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:17,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on.

515
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how he gets all the birthdays but

516
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:30,547
[SPEAKER_11]: But truly, Nancy White, Mr. President, touched so many lives of students in this community for many, many decades.

517
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,949
[SPEAKER_11]: She was a star worth within the school department.

518
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:41,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I consider Nancy White someone that has always been behind the scenes and the person that makes everything happen.

519
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:45,295
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you always have the person out front that takes the credit.

520
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,817
[SPEAKER_11]: But Nancy White, when it came to the school department, she was the one

521
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,444
[SPEAKER_11]: That was behind the scenes, Mr. President, making sure the school department operated appropriately.

522
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:59,608
[SPEAKER_11]: But with the Democratic Ward and City Committee, Nancy White was the one that put together all the meetings.

523
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,910
[SPEAKER_11]: She was the one that sent out all the minutes.

524
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,632
[SPEAKER_11]: She was the one that was really driving it for so many years.

525
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:11,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you had a face of the committee, but we all knew where the work was taking place.

526
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was Nancy White.

527
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:17,641
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to congratulate her on her 80th birthday and wish her many, many more to come, Mr. President.

528
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:18,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

529
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Best.

530
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

531
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:24,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just want to say happy birthday to Nancy.

532
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:31,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew Nancy for many years as part of the Medford Democratic City Committee and I would definitely agree with Councilor Marks.

533
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:35,601
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the one pulling everyone together, making sure the meetings got done.

534
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy birthday, Nancy.

535
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:39,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

536
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:52,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, myself personally, want to thank, wish Nancy a happy birthday, both as a friend, an educator, and one of the driving forces behind the Democratic Party in the city of Metro, which many of us are involved in.

537
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, Nancy, happy birthday, and I wish you many more.

538
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:01,502
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Balco.

539
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

540
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:06,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

541
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:07,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

542
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:08,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Tocco?

543
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:09,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

544
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

545
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:10,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

546
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:11,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

547
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:12,045
Yes.

548
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:12,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

549
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:13,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

550
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Caraviello?

551
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, six in favor, one absent, motion passes.

552
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:32,015
[SPEAKER_09]: 21349, offered by Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the City of Medford City Council request copies of the letters of appointments from incumbents holding the titles of city solicitor, director of human resources and diversity,

553
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:35,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And Director of Community Development, Vice President Knight.

554
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

555
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:45,628
[SPEAKER_12]: This was a resolution that was derivative of the conversations that we recently had over the employee classifications to Committee of the Whole as we've had the past two weeks on Tuesday nights.

556
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:58,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm asking that the administration provide us with copies of the letters of appointment for the incumbents holding the titles of City Solicitor, Director of Human Resources and Diversity, and Director of Community Development, and I guess that would be Energy and the Environment.

557
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:06,461
[SPEAKER_12]: the administration in our earlier meeting and the meeting last week has indicated that they have these letters available.

558
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:12,066
[SPEAKER_12]: They're a public document that I'm asking now that the council be provided them so that we can include them in our records, Mr. President.

559
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:18,371
[SPEAKER_12]: As we begin our discussions for the budget, I think it'll be very interesting to see where these go with these positions.

560
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:26,358
[SPEAKER_12]: But with that being said, it's something that I think is necessary for us if we're gonna move forward to be sure that we have all the documents in front of us to make a fully vetted and viable decision.

561
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:31,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the motion by vice-president seconded by second.

562
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by councilor Falco, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

563

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to defer to Councilor Bears to go first on this one.

582
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

583
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:13,557

00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:20,683
[SPEAKER_05]: purpose of this resolution is just to congratulate Max Heining, he's a longtime teacher at Medford High School.

585
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: He was my 10th grade English teacher, and a really active community member through Medford Brewing Company and now through his successful and award winning poetry so thank you to Max Heining, who I always want to call Mr. Heining, and I would like to ask the clerk to send a certificate of our congratulations.

586
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:41,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

587
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:45,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:52,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think echoing Councilor Bears, I think it's important that we recognize our residents for their vast contribution to the arts.

589
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And Max Heinegg is just one person doing this among many in our community.

590
00:43:56,621 --> 00:44:00,982
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to read a few sentences from the award commendation.

591
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:12,526
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, Max Heinegg's Good Harbor is one of those rare collections of poems in which a confidence emerges almost immediately that we are in the hands of a poet who creates the sensation that life is writing itself.

592
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:19,310
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on from there, but I think if people can look that up, it's a great note on one of the artists in our community.

593
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to extend my congratulations.

594
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:22,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

595
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,371

598
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,752

599
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:37,114
[SPEAKER_11]: As they stated, Max Heine has been an outstanding teacher, exemplary teacher for a number of years.

600
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,015
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a brewmaster and now a poet.

601
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I never knew he was a poet.

602
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:47,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm thinking he may have got much of his inspiration from Method Eel to write some of his poetry.

603
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:53,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe I might try some Method Eel and maybe give me a little inspiration, Mr. President.

604
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:58,550
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wanna thank him for all he does in this community, Mr. President.

605
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

606
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

607
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:09,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to also thank Councilor Morell and Councilor Piz for bringing this forward and congratulating Max on his achievement.

608
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:18,284
[SPEAKER_06]: As everyone has noted, Max is one of our very dedicated volunteers and a teacher in our community and we wish him well.

609
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:19,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say congratulations.

610
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:20,586

612
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:26,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself, I want to thank Max for being a teacher and a businessman in the community.

635
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:22,358
[SPEAKER_12]: to give him an opportunity to speak on this matter.

636
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:31,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli this evening is at the National Armed Society dinner, where his son, John, who's the president of the Medford National Sahana Society, he's giving the commencement speech.

637
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,001

[SPEAKER_09]: Lieutenant Richard Mahoney has shared with honor, integrity, and distinction the residents of Massachusetts for the past 34 years.

655
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:26,017
[SPEAKER_09]: be it further resolved that Lieutenant Richard Mahoney receive a council accommodation, recognizing his dedication and commitment to all he served.

656
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:27,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

657
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

658
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:47,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I rise tonight to honor one of our very own, Mr. President, and that is Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney, a lifelong Method resident, someone that if you know him, Mr. President, you'll know that he loves this community.

659
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:49,334
[SPEAKER_11]: He loves his family.

660
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:58,616
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, he's a gentleman that served with distinction for 34 years to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

661
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:09,138
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a gentleman that served in very trying times, Mr. President, and has had an unblemished career for 34 years.

662
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:16,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that speaks volumes on the type of person that Rich Mahoney is, Mr. President.

663
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,580
[SPEAKER_11]: He finished his

664
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:22,870
[SPEAKER_11]: illustrious career as detective lieutenant with the Massachusetts State Police.

665
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:32,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Every day, Mr. President, going to work, putting his life on the line to protect and serve the residents of this commonwealth.

666
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:35,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did it with honor and respect.

667
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:40,161
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that says a lot about his character, Mr. President.

668
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:46,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Rich was also very highly respected by his peers.

669
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,165
[SPEAKER_11]: And as he rose through the ranks, Mr. President, he got there through hard work and dedication.

670
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:58,088
[SPEAKER_11]: And his commitment to this commonwealth, I believe, goes unmatched.

671
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:07,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this day and age, you hear a lot about police, about defunding the police, about police this, police that.

672
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:13,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's fair to say that Rich Mahoney is one of the 99.999%

673
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:26,198
[SPEAKER_11]: of police officers that get up every day, serve the public, Mr. President, do a tremendous job, put their life on the line every day.

674
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:28,779
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not many professions you can say that.

675
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Police, fire, are a few that come to mind.

676
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,722
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's every day, not knowing if you're gonna come home, Mr. President.

677
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:45,105
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I really believe that, you know, when our officers retire, Mr. President,

678
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:47,234
[SPEAKER_11]: they shouldn't just go out with a thank you.

679
00:49:47,594 --> 00:49:51,877
[SPEAKER_11]: They should go out with a warm welcome and thank you from the residents.

680
00:49:52,797 --> 00:50:03,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna thank Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney on behalf of the residents of this community, on behalf of the residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

681
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:11,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna also thank him, Mr. President, for being the family man he is, because with Rich, family comes first.

682
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna thank him for all his years of dedication

683
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:26,826
[SPEAKER_11]: and ask that the city clerk send a citation to honor his career on behalf of the Commonwealth and the residents of this community.

684
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:27,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

685
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:28,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

686
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:31,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

687
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:36,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly second Councilor Mark's motion and also his thoughts.

688
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:44,475
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know Richard personally, but anybody that's served on the Massachusetts State Police for 34 years and has rose to the rank of lieutenant is someone that's a by the book type of person.

689
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,812
[SPEAKER_12]: who understands fairness, who understands what it means to be a public servant.

690
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:56,817
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't last 34 years in the Massachusetts State Police and rise to the rank of lieutenant, unless you have that type of character and that type of integrity.

691
00:50:56,837 --> 00:51:02,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to echo Councilor Marks' sentiments and second the motion, Mr. President.

692
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

693
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:04,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

694
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

695
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:10,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and also echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

696
00:51:11,684 --> 00:51:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, being in law enforcement, it's not an easy job, especially now more than ever.

697
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:21,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, when you leave to go to work in the morning or whatever shift you're on, you don't know if you're coming back.

698
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:30,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And to work to do that for 34 years is an amazing commitment, an amazing commitment.

699
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:36,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to congratulate him on a long career, wish him well.

700
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:39,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thank Council of Ops for bringing this forward.

701
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:41,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

702
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:48,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention his lovely wife, Marianne.

703
00:51:50,097 --> 00:52:00,421
[SPEAKER_11]: And Marianne's the one that got him up for work every day, combed his hair, laid out the clothes on the bed, laid out his uniform, and got him to work, Mr. President.

704
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:03,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank Marianne, Mr. President, as well.

705
00:52:04,463 --> 00:52:04,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

706
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:10,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Council Member Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

707
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

708
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

709
00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:16,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

710
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:16,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

711
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:17,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

712
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:18,403
Yes.

713
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:19,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

714
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

715
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:21,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

716
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:21,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

717
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli has just arrived.

718
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:28,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you want to vote on this commendation for Lieutenant Mahoney?

719
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

720
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:29,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

721
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:31,091
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello.

722
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:31,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

723
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:39,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Assembly affirmative, motion passes.

724
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:42,158
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-1-3-5-3 offered by Councilor Marks.

725
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:54,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the city administration notify Medford City Council, whether it is still involved with looking at exception reports as they relate to water and sewer bills.

726
00:52:54,785 --> 00:53:02,794
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the administration still has the capability to run the exception reports or run count of water on behalf of the residents and homeowners of this community.

727
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

728
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:06,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'll be brief on this.

729
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:14,182
[SPEAKER_11]: This was what was brought up last week under community participation by former city councilor Robert Penta.

730
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it speaks for itself.

731
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:34,895
[SPEAKER_11]: We're asking for whether or not the city still looks at acceptor reports, which are reports that show a spike in the usage of water throughout the community so we can notify residents if they do have a leak within their home or on their property that they're unaware of, Mr. President.

732
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:37,967
[SPEAKER_11]: and being charged, so I move approval, Mr. President.

733
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

734
00:53:38,387 --> 00:53:41,549
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, a motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

735
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:44,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

736
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:50,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Pat, if you could put the mic on, on the podium.

737
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:52,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, and name and address of the record, please.

738
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:55,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Castagnetti Andrew, Cushman Street.

739
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:57,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna- Is that it, Mr. Chair?

740
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:58,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.

741
00:53:58,598 --> 00:53:58,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

742
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Councilor Marks, for bringing this on your agenda.

743
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:18,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe last week, Councilor Penta was right when he said back when we installed these meters in 2002, thereabouts, that as Councilor Penta says, they sold us a bill of sale.

744
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like a bill of goods.

745
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:32,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe back then it was stated by the department heads in the water and Mr. Geer, that if there's an unusual increase in our water meters,

746
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:36,883
[SPEAKER_07]: that we would be notified through the computer system.

747
00:54:38,123 --> 00:54:42,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember it like it was yesterday, even though it's probably 18 years ago.

748
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:54,130
[SPEAKER_07]: So a friend of mine received a bill instead of the usual bill, it was like six times per bill.

749
00:54:55,471 --> 00:55:00,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And she owns Bell Raviolis, it happened in her home.

750
00:55:01,573 --> 00:55:03,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was very upset about it.

751
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:12,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess she used the bathroom downstairs in the cellar and went upstairs and probably didn't go back for two more months until she received the bill.

752
00:55:13,653 --> 00:55:15,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably six times the usual bill.

753
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard for her to make the steps.

754
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very sad.

755
00:55:21,717 --> 00:55:25,419
[SPEAKER_07]: She went to pay the bill or actually question it.

756
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,141
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess she just paid it, period.

757
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:30,442
[SPEAKER_07]: As they say, it counts by city hall.

758
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:39,008
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an abatement process for people that have water bills that have spiked.

759
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:45,892
[SPEAKER_09]: All she has to do is ask for an abatement with the Water and Sewer Commission.

760
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:48,134
[SPEAKER_09]: They will listen to her request.

761
00:55:49,174 --> 00:55:50,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear that.

762
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:59,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, since the city has approximately $5 million in the so-called water fund account,

763
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:06,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, in my opinion, it's like an overcharge to all us rate payers.

764
00:56:08,149 --> 00:56:10,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, the money's just sitting there.

765
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:22,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm thinking outside the box that the city could figure it out or the city council to give us a one strike, one time only shot.

766
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:30,613
[SPEAKER_07]: If it is increased by double and triple or better, that you could forgive it

767
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:33,566
[SPEAKER_07]: through the $5 million overcharge fund.

768
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:47,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a thought, if you want to take it on the committee as a whole, because sometimes you face City Hall, if you appeal it, you probably, maybe you don't have any requests after the fact.

769
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all I wanted to say.

770
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to consider something like that with the $5 million, but the commission, that's what you're hiring.

771
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:14,985
[SPEAKER_09]: The Water and Soil Commission does have the authority to listen and to say they make, whether you have medical condition or a senior citizen or whatever you need, they have rules in place now for people that do have water problems and they do work with them to help them out of this situation.

772
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:17,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do suggest you do that.

773
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:24,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, they do help people out that do, if they have financial means they can't pay it, they do help them out.

774
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing to do with me at the moment.

775
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:31,970
[SPEAKER_09]: You can inform your friend just to apply for the abatement with the water source.

776
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a meeting and they can discuss it.

777
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:40,195
[SPEAKER_09]: She completed a case there and they usually, she's maybe a senior and couldn't get down there to do it.

778
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:46,840
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of conditions where they are allowed to give them an abatement on the bill.

779
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:54,106
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, because please urge you to do that to receive a bill that's like five or 10 or 20 times your usual.

780
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:57,690
[SPEAKER_07]: That might hurt a lot of people who are having struggles in these times.

781
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, sir.

782
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:00,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

783
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:03,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, just if I could follow up.

784
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:05,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate Mr. Castagnetti.

785
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:09,363
[SPEAKER_11]: He always brings reason to a conversation.

786
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:26,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think that was the whole, if we recall back so many years ago, as Mr. Castagnetti mentioned some 18 years ago, the whole intent for this system was to draw out any exceptions that we have throughout the community.

787
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:35,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not that, you know, that we're waiting till something happens and then after the fact say, okay, we just throw money at it.

788
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:39,516
[SPEAKER_11]: This was to be proactive and say, we're aware that this spike

789
00:58:40,205 --> 00:58:41,514
[SPEAKER_11]: spikes within your account.

790
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:47,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And there may be a leak because ultimately what happens is we don't just forgive a bill.

791
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:50,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So even if someone gets an abatement, guess who's paying for that?

792
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,809
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the rest of the rate payers that are paying for that.

793
00:58:54,189 --> 00:59:09,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So the whole logic behind this was to get these spikes ahead of time so we don't have to pay, whether it's through the surplus money, as Mr. Castagnetti mentioned, over 5 million, or not approving the abatement and having the resident pay.

794
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:11,593
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the whole anticipation.

795
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:15,434
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what was brought up by Councilor Penta was 100% correct.

796
00:59:15,774 --> 00:59:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's a service that we pay for, we want to know, indeed, is someone looking at this daily?

797
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:27,138
[SPEAKER_11]: If so, how many people have been notified in the last year regarding spikes in their water?

798
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:32,600
[SPEAKER_11]: How many snowbirds may be in Florida and don't realize they have a leak for four or five months?

799
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,261
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very costly.

800
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:41,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we can work on behalf of the residents through this reporting, then I think we're obligated to do so, Mr. President.

801
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: and I appreciate Mr. Castagnetti coming up.

802
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:44,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Markswell.

803
00:59:46,472 --> 00:59:46,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

804
00:59:47,632 --> 00:59:53,757
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Markswell, seconded by Councilor Scapello and Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

805
00:59:58,381 --> 00:59:59,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

806
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:00,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

807
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:01,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

808
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:02,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

809
01:00:02,844 --> 01:00:03,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

810
01:00:03,985 --> 01:00:04,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

811
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:05,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks.

812
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:05,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

813
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:06,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

814
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:07,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

815
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:08,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

816
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

817
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:12,065
[SPEAKER_09]: 7 affirmative motion passes.

818
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:27,080
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-1, 3-5-4 by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the administration report back to the Medford City Council the status of the water meters systems in our community, including when and if these meters are being looked at for replacement.

819
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:27,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

820
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:29,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

821
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:33,386
[SPEAKER_11]: This was another issue that was brought up by Councilor Penter under

822
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:37,517
[SPEAKER_11]: community participation last week.

823
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:44,482
[SPEAKER_11]: We couldn't take a vote on it, Mr. President, because our new rules require that it appear on the following agenda for proper notification.

824
01:00:44,823 --> 01:00:46,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why it appears tonight.

825
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:49,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I support this wholeheartedly.

826
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,990
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe from what we were told that the current city administration

827
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,644
[SPEAKER_11]: is actually looking at the life expectancy of our existing meters.

828
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:14,498
[SPEAKER_11]: As I spoke last week, we purchased meters back some 18 to 20 years ago because the city was estimating over 50%, 50% of our bills, water and sewer bills, were being estimated.

829
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:26,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not a way to operate a city, because your bill could either, you could be good and get a lower bill, or you could be on the other end where they're charging the extra of water that you're actually not using.

830
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:30,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And the best way to do it, Mr. President, is to have an accurate and fair bill.

831
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we went to new meters.

832
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:49,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And we never want to go down that path again where we had hundreds, I think it was 750 in a year span of abatements that residents, 750 residents came forward and said there was a problem with their water and sewer bill, the way it was being tabulated.

833
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:51,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And we never want to experience that again.

834
01:01:51,768 --> 01:02:01,594
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hoping that the city administration moves forward with notifying this council on what the next steps are to look at our

835
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:06,660
[SPEAKER_11]: aging water meters to make sure we never experienced what we did back some years ago.

836
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:07,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

837
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

838
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:15,783
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilmarks seconded by anyway, Council felt almost the correct is called the role.

839
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President on that.

840
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:23,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President night, I think Councilor Penta did make some good points when he spoke last week.

841
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:25,187
[SPEAKER_12]: When he got

842
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,575
[SPEAKER_12]: to around the year 2015 or 16.

843
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:33,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we started a little far back in time and then it made our way into the present day.

844
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:42,988
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, but one of those things that he was speaking about that I was concerned about, really concerned about, was the inflow and infiltration.

845
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:45,610
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think Consul Max has been an advocate for this for a long time.

846
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,793
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, he's been speaking on it for years now at this point.

847
01:02:48,853 --> 01:02:49,453
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, decades.

848
01:02:49,493 --> 01:02:51,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's been a decade at least that he's been speaking on this.

849
01:02:52,178 --> 01:03:00,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that I think does warrant some discussion, or at least recommend some commentary from the Chairman of our Water and Sewer Commission, just to see what's going on.

850
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:02,747
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wholeheartedly support this resolution.

851
01:03:02,787 --> 01:03:05,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank the Council for bringing it up.

852
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:13,215
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think sometimes Councilor Penta does a great job giving us information and providing us with initiatives in the community.

853
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:14,937
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, sometimes

854
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:18,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that, but in this one, I do think that this is something that we need to take a look at.

855
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:23,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And I certainly think that it's a worthy cause, so I support the measure wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

856
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

857
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:25,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

858
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:26,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Box.

859
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't miss an opportunity to speak about INI.

860
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:32,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And the council vice president's right.

861
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:36,938
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been two decades that I've been speaking about inflow and infiltration.

862
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:39,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not a sexy issue.

863
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:44,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Underground, like I always say, out of sight, out of mind, unfortunately.

864
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:53,277
[SPEAKER_11]: But Mr. President, over the years, we've talked dating back so many years ago that someday your water and sewer bill will be higher than your tax bill.

865
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:57,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're approaching the point where it's getting in that realm.

866
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,001
[SPEAKER_11]: It may not be that close, but it's getting in that realm.

867
01:04:01,322 --> 01:04:04,563
[SPEAKER_11]: And residents will always say, how can we lower our water and sewer rate?

868
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:09,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's really not many ways, Mr. President, other than looking at the infrastructure.

869
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And INI is all it is, is water that's seeping.

870
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:22,633
[SPEAKER_11]: This is rainwater that's seeping into the ground and then finding its way into our sewer system, through cracks, through holes and so forth.

871
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:36,840
[SPEAKER_11]: That water, which is just rain runoff water, which typically goes into the Mystic River, now is going out to Deer Island and being treated as raw sewage at a great expense to the taxpayers and rate payers of this community.

872
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Multi-million dollars a year.

873
01:04:39,684 --> 01:04:41,084
[SPEAKER_11]: goes to INI.

874
01:04:41,104 --> 01:04:41,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I lost check.

875
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:49,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was about 45 to 50% of INI in our community is through infiltration.

876
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a major concern.

877
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:54,489
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a major concern to the taxpayers.

878
01:04:54,809 --> 01:05:01,491
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear very little talk about it, but it's happening every year and it's costing us, Mr. President, every year.

879
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:03,752
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing that up.

880
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:13,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think these are the conversations that probably aren't going to be brought to us, but we have to keep on speaking about them, saying what's happening.

881
01:05:14,129 --> 01:05:18,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say over the years, the city has made some headway on INI.

882
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:21,255
[SPEAKER_11]: They reline pipes.

883
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:25,098
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a system where you don't even have to dig up the pipe, you just reline it.

884
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,340
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a real cost effective

885
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:29,956
[SPEAKER_11]: efficient way of relining our pipes.

886
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:39,478
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another system, Mr. President, we have right now, we have catch basins, which are supposed to catch rain runoff water and send it out to the mystic.

887
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:43,139
[SPEAKER_11]: These catch basins are hooked up to our sewer system.

888
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,620
[SPEAKER_11]: So that we know every time it rains, it's going right into our sewer system.

889
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have ways of indicating where these catch basins are.

890
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,782
[SPEAKER_11]: They drop what they call a smoke bomb into the catch basin,

891
01:05:56,263 --> 01:06:00,125
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it comes out the manhole cover, the sewer system, you know they're connected.

892
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:05,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're aware of at least, last I heard was probably 10 to 12 of these catch basins.

893
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time it rains, you can imagine the gallons of water that are pouring into our sewer system and going out.

894
01:06:13,272 --> 01:06:18,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it expensive to take these catch basins and reline them and make them go where they're supposed to?

895
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

896
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,417
[SPEAKER_11]: But is it worthwhile in the long run?

897
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:24,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, Mr. President.

898
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:25,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the issues I hope

899
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:29,285
[SPEAKER_11]: We continue to discuss in our community on behalf of the ratepayer.

900
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:29,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

901
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

902
01:06:31,626 --> 01:06:36,668
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

903
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:37,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

904
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:38,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

905
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

906
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

907
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:41,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

908
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:42,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Nye.

909
01:06:42,952 --> 01:06:43,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

910
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:44,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

911
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:46,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

912
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:48,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

913
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:49,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

914
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:51,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven affirmative motion passes.

915
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:53,677
[SPEAKER_09]: 21355 offered by Councilor Marks.

916
01:06:54,692 --> 01:07:02,693
[SPEAKER_09]: be it resolved that the submission of the city budget to the city council procedure for approval, rejection or alteration be discussed.

917
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:03,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

918
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:05,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:09,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I put this on the agenda because our budget process is coming up soon.

920
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:22,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna make sure that this council is aware of our role during the budget and aware of what we have as recourse

921
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,611
[SPEAKER_11]: when the budget is presented to us.

922
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:41,421
[SPEAKER_11]: And last week, Mr. President, I was told by an administrative staff that this council has a line item cut authority, which over the years, I guess, depending on the administration, I've been told otherwise.

923
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:42,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't speak for my colleagues.

924
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:45,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we should set the record straight.

925
01:07:46,364 --> 01:07:48,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at chapter 44, section 32.

926
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:51,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at some old opinions

927
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,620
[SPEAKER_11]: from former city solicitors.

928
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at a letter from the Department of Revenue that was submitted back in 2014.

929
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:04,623
[SPEAKER_11]: This council over the years, not many occasions, has offered cuts to the budget.

930
01:08:05,323 --> 01:08:21,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember back some years ago, and this was what I referenced last week, there was a motion to cut the then assistant director of DPW, because we're in tough budget times, and the motion passed, and the administration decided

931
01:08:22,193 --> 01:08:26,795
[SPEAKER_11]: not to make that line item cut, but cut somewhere else within the budget.

932
01:08:27,055 --> 01:08:36,438
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a motion a while back to take money and cut the water and sewer budget, Mr. President, by over $600,000.

933
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,639
[SPEAKER_11]: This was back in 2014.

934
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:51,563
[SPEAKER_11]: And the council voted to cut 600,000 and use, if we remember, use the water and sewer surplus account, which you can only use it for two purposes,

935
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:55,199
[SPEAKER_11]: One is to use it for infrastructure improvements.

936
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:58,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other one is to offset water and sewer costs and rates.

937
01:08:59,562 --> 01:09:01,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So the council said, you have 5 million in an account.

938
01:09:02,324 --> 01:09:04,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't remember the exact dollar amount at the time.

939
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:06,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we keep on raising the rate?

940
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:13,333
[SPEAKER_11]: So we thought within the budget that slashed this line item by 600,000, take it out of the enterprise account.

941
01:09:13,874 --> 01:09:17,056
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor at the time, Mayor McGlynn, didn't like that idea.

942
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:20,539
[SPEAKER_11]: And he vetoed our cut, Mr. President,

943
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we overrode the mayor's veto and that stood actually.

944
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:33,939
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's so crucial now that we understand what our role is, Mr. President, and what our abilities are to make cuts.

945
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:44,487
[SPEAKER_11]: And I ask that we either contact the Department of Revenue, or we ask for an opinion from the city solicitor, what our responsibilities are on the budget.

946
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we just make bottom line cuts to departments?

947
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we just make bottom line cuts in general?

948
01:09:53,586 --> 01:10:05,713
[SPEAKER_11]: From my reading of the Department of Revenue in chapter 44 of the general laws, it states if we do make bottom line cuts, we also have to indicate where the cut, what lines will be cut.

949
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:09,956
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this would be very, you know, I've been on the council a lot of years.

950
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:16,920
[SPEAKER_11]: When I received conflicting information, one administration saying you have zero authority over line items.

951
01:10:17,299 --> 01:10:22,321
[SPEAKER_11]: And then another administration saying you have the ability to cut a line item in the last budget.

952
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,142
[SPEAKER_11]: That's conflicting to me.

953
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the very least, I think we need clarification.

954
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:31,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask under your leadership, Mr. President, that we seek out that clarification.

955
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:46,851
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would put it in the form of a motion that we ask the city solicitor what role the council has in the either approving, rejecting or cutting

956
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,732
[SPEAKER_11]: line items within the city budget.

957
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

958
01:10:52,713 --> 01:10:54,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with this.

959
01:10:54,314 --> 01:10:56,516
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very important thing with the budget coming up soon.

960
01:10:57,136 --> 01:11:07,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this may be something we should discuss in our community the whole with the with the semester, and maybe the director of finance and and whoever else we deem necessary.

961
01:11:07,402 --> 01:11:12,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to get someone from the department or maybe somebody from the Department of Revenue

962
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:16,046
[SPEAKER_09]: the Department of Local Services that joined in the meeting.

963
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:22,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will make some calls tomorrow and see if we can arrange that very soon, sooner than later.

964
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:26,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

965
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:27,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

966
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:34,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think that Councilor Marks and Director Nunley are saying the wrong thing.

967
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:36,731
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the same thing, not the wrong thing, the same thing.

968
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:39,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that Director Nunley's

969
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:45,547
[SPEAKER_12]: saying that we have the ability to reduce by department, but not necessarily line it.

970
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:52,273
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I read her email and I look at the general block, I think what you're, what she's referring to is exactly what counsel Knox is saying.

971
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:53,834
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just really an interpretation issue.

972
01:11:54,535 --> 01:12:01,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, my understanding was that we didn't have the right to do line items, vetoes, and that's from the division of local services where

973
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:14,112
[SPEAKER_12]: because our budget is presented to us by department for ordinary and personnel expenses, we have the right to cut the department saying we want to cut ordinary expenses by X or personnel expenses by Y and take that from the bottom line out of that department.

974
01:12:14,672 --> 01:12:22,815
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that the division of local services language, if you look at their briefer on it, it would say that the reason that they do that is because that would leave the

975
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:31,940
[SPEAKER_12]: If you didn't do it by department, it would leave the authority up to the mayor to determine where to make the cuts, and the council would, in essence, just be reducing the bottom line of the budget, but not focusing on the department.

976
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:38,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think if we're going to take that steps, the way that we would have to do it is the way that was done in the past when it came to the assistant director at DPW's position.

977
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,884
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the proper and appropriate way to do it.

978
01:12:41,784 --> 01:12:51,108
[SPEAKER_12]: So when it comes to the line item veto, I think that the finance director understands it the same way that we understand it, but she's just saying it differently.

979
01:12:51,806 --> 01:13:01,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I may be saying it in a way that we're not necessarily interpreting it to be the same, but my discussions with her over the week seem to be in line right with what Councilor Marksley said.

980
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:07,456
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd be interested to have a committee of the whole as well, Councilor, President Caraviello, because I think that this is something that needs to be done.

981
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:08,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

982
01:13:09,997 --> 01:13:13,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

983
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

984
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:18,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

985
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:19,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

986
01:13:20,323 --> 01:13:21,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

987
01:13:21,084 --> 01:13:21,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

988
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:22,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

989
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:22,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

990
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:23,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

991
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:23,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

992
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:24,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

993
01:13:24,816 --> 01:13:25,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

994
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:26,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

995
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

996
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:27,897
[SPEAKER_09]: President Caraviello?

997
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:29,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I move the affirmative, motion passes.

998
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:33,520
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-1-3-5-6, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

999
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:41,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Traffic Commission re-evaluate the permit parking policy on Mystic Street off of High Street.

1000
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:42,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1001
01:13:44,106 --> 01:13:44,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1002
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:46,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1003
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:58,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I get into this resolution, I want to thank my colleagues and apologize for my absence in the meeting earlier and for being tidy for a couple of meetings.

1004
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:16,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes family issues take precedent and my mom was going through a health crisis and my brother and sister and I are trying to do the best we can to make sure that she's in a good place and we're working through some health issues.

1005
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:24,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I appreciate the professionalism and the caring of my fellow Councilors and understanding and giving me some leeway.

1006
01:14:24,842 --> 01:14:32,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize to my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford that I have been a little tardy and a little absent.

1007
01:14:32,986 --> 01:14:36,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So be sure that I'm still involved with everything that's going on.

1008
01:14:37,468 --> 01:14:43,831
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that I'm doing it bedside and that's something mom loves to hear Council Mark say, Mr. President, Mr. President.

1009
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:46,261
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when we know she's getting better.

1010
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:48,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank everyone for that.

1011
01:14:48,623 --> 01:14:50,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So the resolution is very simple.

1012
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:58,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the residents from Mystic Street and High Street are really getting beaten up with their public parking.

1013
01:14:59,234 --> 01:15:07,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And for what was intended for that area is to eliminate the illegal parking for non-residents to come in and, you know,

1014
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:21,477
[SPEAKER_10]: and park in front in that neighborhood, we're seeing that park, Metro Republic parking is now going in and writing these outrageous tickets for the most outrageous reasons.

1015
01:15:21,737 --> 01:15:33,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And for elderly neighbors in that area, if they're parking what is a supposedly a curb, but is not a curb, somewhere where they parked forever, that's just a level land.

1016
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:40,281
[SPEAKER_10]: they're getting ticketed for something simple as parking on a sidewalk.

1017
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:48,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it just seems like they're trying to fill a quota and going out to those areas and really affecting that neighborhood in a negative way.

1018
01:15:48,466 --> 01:16:05,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to send a resolution to the parking commission, traffic commission, maybe to set up a meeting with the neighbors just so they can share some concerns and maybe invite them to the next traffic commission meeting that they can really, they can understand what's going on to maybe say,

1019
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:11,190
[SPEAKER_10]: put in some changes in that in that area of Mystic Street.

1020
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,471
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for your time.

1021
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:14,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1022
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:14,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President.

1023
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:19,456
[SPEAKER_12]: On that, Mr. President, how long has Mystic Street been in public parking?

1024
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:25,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate Councilmember Council Vice President, I bring this up.

1025
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:34,188
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the confusion with the neighbors that public parking has now they, everybody should know that they can go into any neighborhood now.

1026
01:16:34,749 --> 01:16:34,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And

1027
01:16:36,563 --> 01:16:54,870
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been, you know, if you parked outside the driveway that you parked for many years and your back, your end is sticking out a little bit, they're ticketing you overnight for parking on the curb or, you know, even if they're ticketing for police action where a sticker might be expired.

1028
01:16:54,950 --> 01:17:00,192
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are the things people don't realize that is still happening with public parking, so.

1029
01:17:01,503 --> 01:17:09,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, if we can at least look at that neighborhood and if we have to go neighborhood to neighborhood, I think this is a going to, it'll be a bigger issue than it is.

1030
01:17:09,331 --> 01:17:22,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is just scratching the top and I'm glad that we heard the mayor talk about today in the early meeting that looking to bring in in house traffic and parking which

1031
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:24,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think it's a great idea.

1032
01:17:24,776 --> 01:17:28,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that council max worked on for years to make that come to fruition.

1033
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, but again, thank you.

1034
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:32,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Council, uh, council night.

1035
01:17:32,278 --> 01:17:33,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Jim.

1036
01:17:33,799 --> 01:17:34,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1037
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:35,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, council Scarpelli.

1038
01:17:35,579 --> 01:17:40,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the reason I bring it up is because I'm thinking back now we've got a lot of construction going on high street right now.

1039
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:48,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And it wasn't too long ago that, uh, several members of this council stood up and tried to secure some parking spots along that stretch of high street.

1040
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,852
[SPEAKER_12]: when this construction project was going in.

1041
01:17:51,133 --> 01:18:06,784
[SPEAKER_12]: And the response that we got from the administration was that the traffic engineer did a dashboard survey and feels as though there's adequate parking in that area for the residents, and that this would cause no disruption whatsoever.

1042
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:10,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're seeing the construction started, what, last Monday?

1043
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:18,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And now Park Metro is in the neighborhood tagging all the secondary streets off of High Street, which leads me to believe that

1044
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:24,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the dashboard survey that was conducted might not have been the most accurate assessment of the parking needs of the neighborhood.

1045
01:18:26,272 --> 01:18:28,272
[SPEAKER_12]: But that horse is out of the barn, Mr. President.

1046
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:29,353
[SPEAKER_12]: That project is underway.

1047
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:33,074
[SPEAKER_12]: We've accepted the funding, a million dollars from the state, and that project is underway.

1048
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:35,934
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit about the project.

1049
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:47,337
[SPEAKER_12]: With the Eversource project that's going on along Winter Street, and the High Street project that's going on along High Street,

1050
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:59,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Every street in between Winthrop and Hyde that run parallel to each other looks like a loading yard for a construction group, whether it be the Eversource project or the High Street project.

1051
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,442
[SPEAKER_12]: There's just trucks parked all over every single neighborhood.

1052
01:19:03,482 --> 01:19:09,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I drove down a street today, Mystic Street, the street that Councilor Scarpelli is talking about, up on Mystic in front of Tile Park.

1053
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:12,488
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was like a rig that took up

1054
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:14,674
[SPEAKER_12]: 19 parking spots, you know what I mean?

1055
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:16,695
[SPEAKER_12]: All heavy equipment that was there all day long.

1056
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:19,437
[SPEAKER_12]: There has to be a better way, Mr. President.

1057
01:19:19,857 --> 01:19:27,842
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, if we wanna put these improvements in, that's one thing, but can we do it in a way that's maybe a little bit less detrimental to the neighborhood?

1058
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:36,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe a little bit, you know, kinder to the eye, because right now, it seems like that winter street stretch, these residents are getting croaked.

1059
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:42,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's between the rotary, the Ebbersworth project, the water pipe replacement project,

1060
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:45,427
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been under construction now for eight years.

1061
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Eight years.

1062
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,852
[SPEAKER_12]: So there has to be some relief in sight, Mr. President.

1063
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:51,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank the council for bringing it up.

1064
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:55,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hoping that the administration, as she said, hears it loud and clear.

1065
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,582
[SPEAKER_12]: She hears the council loud and clear when we talk.

1066
01:19:57,622 --> 01:20:00,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping that this makes it to the corner office.

1067
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:10,293
[SPEAKER_12]: that, you know, we need to come up with a better plan when it comes to engineering and permitting, ground opening and construction projects that we need to come up with a better plan that doesn't impact the neighborhood so much.

1068
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:16,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what I feel like is happening in this community is someone gets a permit from the engineering department, and then they can do whatever they want.

1069
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:20,899
[SPEAKER_12]: They can dig wherever they want, park wherever they want, leave their equipment, their debris, their materials, wherever they want.

1070
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:23,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's starting to take an effect, Mr. President.

1071
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,741
[SPEAKER_12]: The weather's getting nicer.

1072
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:26,402
[SPEAKER_12]: People are opening their windows.

1073
01:20:26,442 --> 01:20:27,722
[SPEAKER_12]: People are spending more time outside.

1074
01:20:27,762 --> 01:20:29,183
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what they want to see in their community.

1075
01:20:29,682 --> 01:20:31,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure with that being said, I think the council will bring the measure forward.

1076
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:32,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I support all of it.

1077
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:35,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

1078
01:20:35,244 --> 01:20:39,866
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can, I know that you triggered something, Councilor Knight, that I found fascinating.

1079
01:20:40,406 --> 01:20:55,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we're seeing with the Winthrop Street project with Ebersource, this past week, driving back and forth to see my mom in Woburn, I go through Winchester and often get trapped by the construction workers.

1080
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:57,133
[SPEAKER_10]: What I found that's amazing is,

1081
01:20:57,974 --> 01:21:16,483
[SPEAKER_10]: all of the construction trucks that are in Winchester drive all the way down, they pull into the T parking lot, and they park all of the utility trucks and all the apparatus for the construction in that parking lot on a daily basis.

1082
01:21:17,363 --> 01:21:26,488
[SPEAKER_10]: But Councilor Knight says in Medford, they just leave all their trucks and their apparatus and their metal plates

1083
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,043
[SPEAKER_10]: that we're going to be able to get that.

1084
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Cones and everything up and down with the tree.

1085
01:21:30,504 --> 01:21:36,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that you know that brings up bring us a huge point that you know to mend the paper that we asked again.

1086
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:41,468
[SPEAKER_10]: That ever source looks into cleaning up that area.

1087
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:46,229
[SPEAKER_10]: With eliminating all of the, um, debris.

1088
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh and machinery.

1089
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,371
[SPEAKER_10]: That deals with this construction.

1090
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:50,691
[SPEAKER_10]: So again,

1091
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:58,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Knight.

1092
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:13,993
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wouldn't mind a further amendment, Councilor Scarpelli, I'd also like to ask that the city engineer and traffic engineer try to determine a lot where potentially we could do the same thing that Winchester's doing.

1093
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:21,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears, if I can answer that for you, the construction company runs a lot in Midford currently.

1094
01:22:22,394 --> 01:22:25,195
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have a lot in Midford where they do park their trucks.

1095
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:27,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So they should be driving this, not that far.

1096
01:22:28,059 --> 01:22:30,821
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be driving the trucks back there.

1097
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:31,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

1098
01:22:31,462 --> 01:22:35,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one further comment, Mr. President.

1099
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:36,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1100
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:45,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you received any update from the city engineer or Eversource as to expediting the Eversource project as we discussed several weeks ago?

1101
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:52,259
[SPEAKER_09]: We have not, I think it was up to the police chief because Eversource wanted three crews.

1102
01:22:52,899 --> 01:23:03,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the chief has told them that they don't have the manpower to put three crews of policemen on the three crews that Eversource is requesting.

1103
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:07,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still, I know that we had asked that they try to come to an agreement.

1104
01:23:09,242 --> 01:23:12,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I only see one crew working at a time.

1105
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:15,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could put a comment on this,

1106
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:17,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Councilor Scott Perry for bringing this up.

1107
01:23:17,894 --> 01:23:19,095
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my neighborhood where I live.

1108
01:23:20,135 --> 01:23:30,799
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been working there for the last two weeks, and they're parking cars, trucks on both ends, and other side streets, and they leave them all night, and in the school parking lot.

1109
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you live on Mystic Street, there's very few sidewalks there.

1110
01:23:36,062 --> 01:23:39,263
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only maybe one or two sidewalks, mostly all grass lot.

1111
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:40,413
[SPEAKER_09]: and things.

1112
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:44,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a shame that they just continue to do whatever they want.

1113
01:23:45,074 --> 01:23:52,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's happening also is they're directing the Shetland High Street down at different points and just sending it through the neighborhoods.

1114
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:57,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And now these guys are rolling through neighborhoods and just not even paying attention to the law.

1115
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:07,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could say one more thing on what Councilor Scott probably brought up about the construction between Method and Winchester, I'm appalled that they're using our cemetery

1116
01:24:07,937 --> 01:24:10,837
[SPEAKER_09]: to lay down all those plates and ruin the grass.

1117
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:16,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to amend this paper that those plates be removed immediately and the grass be replaced.

1118
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:18,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1119
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:19,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Should be ashamed of themselves.

1120
01:24:20,019 --> 01:24:20,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1121
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:22,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tonko.

1122
01:24:22,499 --> 01:24:23,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1123
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:30,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward and Councilor Knight for mentioning the Eversource project.

1124
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:37,422
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could amend the paper further to specifically look at, I believe it is at the end of Lorraine Road, there was a piece of

1125
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,768
[SPEAKER_06]: construction equipment that has been there.

1126
01:24:40,228 --> 01:24:54,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was there pretty much for like the past couple of weeks that they park it there on the street after hours, which is completely against the agreement that we struck with them when this went into effect, this construction project many years ago.

1127
01:24:55,913 --> 01:25:00,454
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I remember, there was supposed to be no construction equipment on the road after hours.

1128
01:25:01,035 --> 01:25:01,995
[SPEAKER_06]: That has been violated.

1129
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:04,996
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could, if I could please amend the paper

1130
01:25:05,969 --> 01:25:08,952
[SPEAKER_06]: ask specifically why that piece of equipment is there.

1131
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also thank you for bringing up the point about the metal plates.

1132
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:15,157
[SPEAKER_06]: The metal plates have been there for a long time.

1133
01:25:15,797 --> 01:25:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe we inquired about them many times and they still haven't removed them.

1134
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thank you for adding that amendment.

1135
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to hearing a response soon from Eversource.

1136
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:26,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1137
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:27,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1138
01:25:27,227 --> 01:25:28,168
[SPEAKER_12]: On that point, Mr. President, thank you.

1139
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:38,681
[SPEAKER_12]: I do believe when the council at first met with representatives from the city administration in ever so us at the suggestion of Council of marks.

1140
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:49,452
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the items that came up was that as a condition of permitting, they not leave equipment materials, or use city property for state.

1141
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:53,402
[SPEAKER_12]: and that they agreed that they were going to take everything at the end of the day and get it out of there.

1142
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:56,426
[SPEAKER_12]: The trucks weren't going to travel alone if they weren't a licensed vehicle.

1143
01:25:56,446 --> 01:26:08,802
[SPEAKER_12]: The backhoes and excavators were going to be escorted with a truck in front of it and behind it so that no one would get hurt because we remember what happened in Mississippi and Doreen and one of our crossing guys as well I believe right down in West Medford Square where they got hit.

1144
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:23,098
[SPEAKER_12]: during a construction project, when they were doing some work down there, I believe it was the Complete Streets Project, Mr. President of the Brooks School, where two residents were struck by construction vehicles because they didn't have proper safety protocols in place.

1145
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:27,720
[SPEAKER_12]: So then I believe the Eversource project was put out to bid, and I think Feeney Construction got it, right?

1146
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,281
[SPEAKER_12]: The Feeney brother construction firm got it?

1147
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:30,442
[SPEAKER_12]: McCourt.

1148
01:26:31,122 --> 01:26:36,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Feeney backed out of the bid, and then it ended up getting awarded to McCourt.

1149
01:26:36,745 --> 01:26:38,626
[SPEAKER_12]: But the discussions that we had initially

1150
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're all with Feeney brothers.

1151
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:52,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm wondering if those restrictions and requirements that the council asked me to put in place on the permits carried over when the entity that was performing the work had changed.

1152
01:26:56,599 --> 01:26:57,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

1153
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1154
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:03,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on.

1155
01:27:03,242 --> 01:27:04,743
[SPEAKER_11]: He's 100% right on all these issues.

1156
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:07,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President Knight is correct.

1157
01:27:08,197 --> 01:27:12,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We put a laundry list of conditions and the staging I think was your condition.

1158
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember you speaking about having a staging area set up so they can put the equipment in trucks.

1159
01:27:19,603 --> 01:27:26,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we find out who the clerk of the work is on behalf of the city of Medford.

1160
01:27:26,947 --> 01:27:35,892
[SPEAKER_11]: We also should be asking this person if they're adhering to all the conditions, because let's be quite honest, I'm not looking and I'm not on that job site every day.

1161
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,281
[SPEAKER_11]: to make sure that they're adhering to all these.

1162
01:27:38,602 --> 01:27:43,047
[SPEAKER_11]: But clearly, if you take a ride by, you're seeing the equipment left overnight.

1163
01:27:43,588 --> 01:27:45,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly, I forget who brought it up last week.

1164
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:54,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember if it was Councilor Bears or Councilor Scarpelli about sweeping after every day's work.

1165
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:59,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were notified and then the Councilor Falco, I apologize.

1166
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:03,820
[SPEAKER_11]: And these things aren't happening, Mr. President.

1167
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:09,423
[SPEAKER_11]: When we also discussed, we made a recommendation about having the three crews be put back.

1168
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:16,886
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have the area residents on Winthrop Street reaching out saying, we've already had to put up with this for the last year and a half, two years.

1169
01:28:17,227 --> 01:28:19,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to extend the project,

1170
01:28:20,222 --> 01:28:24,185
[SPEAKER_11]: by not having enough crews, that just makes my life more miserable.

1171
01:28:24,685 --> 01:28:26,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're already hearing this from residents.

1172
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:29,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's unacceptable for the chief, Mr. President.

1173
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:31,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he was on the line, I'd say it right to his face.

1174
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:41,716
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unacceptable that the chief unilaterally is going to make a decision to slow down a project that we've been working on for the past five years, Mr. President.

1175
01:28:42,177 --> 01:28:43,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's impacting residents now.

1176
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:45,599
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unacceptable.

1177
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:49,028
[SPEAKER_11]: unless he can tell me it's a public safety concern.

1178
01:28:49,368 --> 01:28:55,189
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can't get enough offices on the detail, Mr. President, go outside the community.

1179
01:28:55,449 --> 01:28:56,650
[SPEAKER_11]: They do it every day.

1180
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:02,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Go outside the community, find some offices, Mr. President, that want to fill the detail.

1181
01:29:02,691 --> 01:29:07,973
[SPEAKER_11]: But to slow down a project of this magnitude and have residents put up with this, it's unacceptable.

1182
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:09,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It's extremely unacceptable.

1183
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:21,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree with Council Vice President Knight, we should find out what that laundry list of conditions are from the Clerk of the Works, find out who the Clerk of the Works is, first of all, and have a discussion regarding that.

1184
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:35,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Regarding the parking program, Mr. President, I believe the parameters within Park Method, their contract only states that they can operate on resident permit parking streets.

1185
01:29:35,594 --> 01:29:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: They cannot operate outside of that contract.

1186
01:29:39,976 --> 01:29:57,440
[SPEAKER_11]: So if indeed they are going around giving out tickets on non-resident parking, permit parking streets, then we should be notified of that and find out when this change took place, why it took place, Mr. President, and maybe this was their decision and they want to increase their revenue.

1187
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but that's not the way we should operate.

1188
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,241
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have a signed contract, we should operate within the four walls of the contract.

1189
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:09,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's my last impression of that contract, that it was only on resident,

1190
01:30:10,088 --> 01:30:11,189
[SPEAKER_11]: permanent parking streets.

1191
01:30:11,869 --> 01:30:12,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1192
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:27,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bears, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, and as amended by Councilor Falco.

1193
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:29,718

[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears.

[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1213
01:31:09,103 --> 01:31:09,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Falco.

1214
01:31:10,944 --> 01:31:13,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice-president.

1215
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:13,727
Yes.

1216
01:31:14,647 --> 01:31:14,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1217
01:31:16,869 --> 01:31:17,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1218
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: 21351 offered by vice-president Knight.

1221
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:37,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the voice of our city's youth has been restricted throughout COVID-19 pandemic end, whereas the youth in the city of Bedford represent not only our future, but our present ends, whereas our youth

1222
01:31:37,862 --> 01:31:46,104
[SPEAKER_09]: deserve every opportunity to flourish and be provided with the resources and services necessary to meet the challenges and problems they face.

1223
01:31:46,664 --> 01:32:06,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so ordered that the Medford City Council adopt the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40, Section 80, enabling the establishment of a youth commission for the purpose of carrying out the programs which may be designed or established to meet the opportunities, challenges, and problems of youth in the city of Medford, and be it resolved

1224
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:13,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford City Council requests that the city solicitor provide to Medford City Council with a draft ordinance.

1225
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The language of section 8E can be found below for the following reference purposes.

1226
01:32:18,902 --> 01:32:21,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 8E, a city- Mr. President, you don't have to get into that.

1227
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:22,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry?

1228
01:32:23,224 --> 01:32:25,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I have it all highlighted out so I can read it for you if you'd like.

1229

[SPEAKER_09]: A city or town which accepts this section may establish a youth commission, herein I recall the commission, the purpose of carrying out programs which may be designed to establish, meet the opportunities, challenges, and problems of youth

01:32:54,523 --> 01:32:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Commission may appoint such clerks and other employees as they may from time to time require.

[SPEAKER_09]: Commission shall consist of not less than three

1236
01:33:05,145 --> 01:33:08,327

[SPEAKER_09]: The members shall be appointed by the mayor subject to the provision of the city charter.

1238
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:16,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the cities that having or operating on the plan D or provision of the city charter.

1239
01:33:18,374 --> 01:33:22,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Such appointments shall be made by citizens subject to the provisional charter and the towns.

1240
01:33:22,977 --> 01:33:26,660
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be appointed by the selection, accepting towns, having a manager or form of government.

1241
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Which towns appointments shall be made by the town manager subject to the approval of the selection.

1242
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:45,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Commission is first established, the terms of the members shall be for one, two, or three years, so arranged that the terms of approximately one-third of the members will expire each year, and their successors shall be appointed for a term of three years each.

[SPEAKER_09]: Any member of the commission so appointed may, after public meeting if requested, be removed for cause by the vacancy occurring otherwise by the expiration of a term, and the city or town shall be filled for the unexpired term

1244
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:04,182
[SPEAKER_09]: in the same manner as the original appointment.

01:34:04,783 --> 01:34:21,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Said commission may receive gifts of property, both real and personal, in the name of the city and town, subject to the approval of the city council, and the city council, where the selectmen in the town, such gifts managed and controlled by the commission for purposes of this selection.

01:34:22,607 --> 01:34:23,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

1247
01:34:23,647 --> 01:34:24,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1248
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,728
[SPEAKER_12]: So what this paper is, is it's a request.

1249
01:34:27,165 --> 01:34:33,328
[SPEAKER_12]: for the city council to adopt a local auction provided by the Massachusetts state legislature to establish a youth commission.

1250
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:38,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wouldn't expect the council to adopt the provisions of chapter 40, section 80 this evening.

1251
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:42,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to send this to a committee in the hall to be further discussed with the city solicitor.

1252
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:46,194
[SPEAKER_12]: However, Mr. President, the intent of this is to give the youth in our community a voice.

1253
01:34:48,895 --> 01:34:55,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We have commissions for everything, but we don't have a commission for probably the most valuable asset in this community, our youth.

1254
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,521
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, I think this is a step in the right direction, Mr. President.

1255
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:01,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking at the language that you just read.

1256
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:03,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate you going through that.

1257
01:35:04,544 --> 01:35:13,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, what this would do is establish a commission from not less than three and not more than 21 persons that serve for a term of three years, appointed by the mayor subject to the provisions of the charter.

1258
01:35:14,771 --> 01:35:25,037
[SPEAKER_12]: The city council can also create an ordinance that will go along with that, that would outline the defined parameters as to who's eligible to serve, similar to many of the other ordinances this council has passed.

1259
01:35:25,735 --> 01:35:29,297
[SPEAKER_12]: relative to the creation or establishment of boards and commissions.

1260
01:35:29,317 --> 01:35:31,738
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, this will be a statutory commission.

1261
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:41,003
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that I think is necessary in this community, especially based on the high levels of isolation that you have seen across Medford over the past year.

1262
01:35:41,043 --> 01:35:43,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Just finally, we're finally getting out to the ball fields.

1263
01:35:44,025 --> 01:35:47,427
[SPEAKER_12]: We're finally getting out of the house with the vaccination moving along in the right direction.

1264
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:54,633
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's important, Mr. President, that we create a mechanism for us to actually hear directly from our youth and don't let them be a voice.

1265
01:35:55,333 --> 01:36:00,256
[SPEAKER_12]: We've seen what great work the CCSR has done up at the high school.

1266
01:36:00,897 --> 01:36:06,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Great work it's done in getting youth engaged in the government processing and getting them to be civically responsible.

1267
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:17,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that this is just adding to that, Mr. President, to step in the right direction for us to continue to build upon the many successes that we've already had in engaging our youth and getting them to be involved civically.

1268
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:25,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So in looking at this, Mr. President, I think it's a great opportunity for us to move forward and create something that could make a difference here in the city of Michigan.

1269
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:27,849
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.

1270
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:29,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked my council colleagues to support this.

1271
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:42,338
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion will be to send it to a committee of the whole for further review and discussion and for us to also ask the city solicitor to be present so that if it is the council's intent to move forward with this, she can draft a ordinance that would support it.

1272
01:36:42,978 --> 01:36:47,842
[SPEAKER_12]: With that being said, I would arrest my case, Mr. President referred to before the councilor, Scarpelli.

1273
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:50,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1274
01:36:50,544 --> 01:36:51,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1275
01:36:51,604 --> 01:37:12,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And what an unbelievable resolution because it's funny because I've been searching and trying to figure out in our subcommittee with recreation youth and what we can do to try to have this city council step forward to give the youth their voice in a way that they can be heard.

1276
01:37:13,473 --> 01:37:37,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And with today's social justice issues and the outcry of our students and children in our community, the city truly doesn't allow an avenue where they can come to this forum or have an avenue with this forum in the city side to really express their concerns, their issues and their wishes.

1277
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:42,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, typical Councilor Knight,

1278
01:37:44,244 --> 01:37:56,552
[SPEAKER_10]: studies every day, looks at what every single community does, finds what best fits the city of Medford and how we can help our constituents and our most important constituents, our children.

1279
01:37:57,173 --> 01:38:06,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanna applaud you again for finding this topic to push forward a very important agenda.

1280
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:12,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when I first started in Somerville, we had set up a recreation commission.

1281
01:38:13,017 --> 01:38:30,582
[SPEAKER_10]: a commission that really focuses on doing some fundraising through the city with the recreation department that would allow kids that couldn't afford different sports or different participation fees for programs and made sure everybody had an opportunity to participate.

1282
01:38:31,522 --> 01:38:33,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only that, they work together.

1283
01:38:33,403 --> 01:38:35,563
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my first years there, I thought was amazing.

1284
01:38:36,223 --> 01:38:41,685
[SPEAKER_10]: We were having some serious issues in Somerville with some social justice issues and some suicide issues.

1285
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:55,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And they worked together with the school department and the commission and Tina Palman to have a round table forum for our youth to come out and speak of what they wanted.

1286
01:38:55,765 --> 01:39:03,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest with you, it's one of the reasons why I love my position in Somerville as a program developer where my door's open.

1287
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:11,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't tell you how many times a young man, a young lady came to my door and sat down in front of me in my office and said,

1288
01:39:12,862 --> 01:39:15,944
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, coach, I really want to do this now.

1289
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:41,498
[SPEAKER_10]: What was important is the typical recreation people think of what's traditionally recreation, sports, you know, games, activities, what came out of that, those conversations and having the ability to have a commission, our kids that needed other outlets, whether it be music, whether it be arts, whether it be band, whether it be, you know, um,

1290
01:39:43,115 --> 01:39:48,458
[SPEAKER_10]: different social issues and having different type of clubs arranged through our commission.

1291
01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:53,600
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is something our community needs.

1292
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:59,123
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that Councilor Knight said, did his homework.

1293
01:39:59,563 --> 01:40:04,646
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where we can put people that are invested in our youth and want to work together.

1294
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:08,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you what, there's 100,000 fundraisers that go out there,

1295
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:15,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Something simple as having a commission that works together that will hold a golf tournament.

1296
01:40:15,808 --> 01:40:17,949
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we did in Somerville, held a golf tournament.

1297
01:40:18,849 --> 01:40:20,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they did a road race.

1298
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:29,952
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only did they bring the community out, they raised valuable funds for kids at risk or youth that wanted to do something different.

1299
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:33,553
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was never a no.

1300
01:40:33,853 --> 01:40:36,253
[SPEAKER_10]: It was always an avenue to do something positive.

1301
01:40:36,273 --> 01:40:39,214
[SPEAKER_10]: In today's climate, where our kids really need a voice,

1302
01:40:40,392 --> 01:40:51,616
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I'm so glad that they have the, you know, the teachers to reach out to and the CCSR, because I think, you know, our advisors have done an amazing job.

1303
01:40:52,056 --> 01:41:08,161
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is a piece where if we sat in a round table, when we talked about race issues in our community, one of the things that came out of those meetings is really putting our foot forward and really putting things into action.

1304
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:16,765
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we talked earlier about the diversity director, and I think everybody says we need that as a full-time position, and we all support that.

1305
01:41:17,326 --> 01:41:22,270
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm glad to see my councilors stood strong with that to make sure that's a standalone program.

1306
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:31,579
[SPEAKER_10]: You look at something Councilor Knight just brought up with the commission, these are the types of initiatives that really lend to what people are asking for.

1307
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:34,482
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know I'm a little winded, but I'm really passionate about this.

1308
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,406
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I do in my life.

1309
01:41:36,686 --> 01:41:43,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna see kids succeed and find avenues to help them succeed.

1310
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:48,912
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Knight, again, one week it's Councilor Marks, another week it's yourself.

1311
01:41:48,992 --> 01:41:55,055
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate your commitment to this community and your professionalism when it comes to this committee.

1312
01:41:56,436 --> 01:42:01,799
[SPEAKER_10]: This is spot on and I second the motion and love to see this move forward.

1313
01:42:01,839 --> 01:42:02,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1314
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:05,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1315
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:11,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw Councilor Morell, so I'm happy to defer to her.

1316
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:12,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1317
01:42:12,765 --> 01:42:16,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Councilor Bears is first, and I'll just go for the sake of being quick.

1318
01:42:16,707 --> 01:42:19,588
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank Vice President Knight for raising this.

1319
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:23,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great opportunity for the youth of Medford and really for the city of Medford itself.

1320
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:26,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with what's been said that the students in CCSR

1321
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:35,703
[SPEAKER_00]: do such great work and are so engaged and have come before the council many times with many great ideas that they've really pushed for and presented in such a great way.

1322
01:42:36,404 --> 01:42:42,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd expect nothing less than them and the rest of our youth in the city who might want to take part in this.

1323
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:53,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would hope that this commission can really reflect the diversity of the city, which is something that I know is also hope for the Gender Equity Commission that has been in the works for some two years now.

1324
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:56,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love to see both of those come to fruition.

1325
01:42:56,433 --> 01:42:56,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1326
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:58,695
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the best?

1327
01:42:59,436 --> 01:43:00,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1328
01:43:01,197 --> 01:43:09,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate Vice President Knight bringing this forward and what Councilor Scarpelli said, and I think it's a great way to link the great work that's being done in our schools.

1329
01:43:10,466 --> 01:43:18,516
[SPEAKER_05]: with the city government and hopefully, you know, I think these students actually have some policy ideas that hopefully we could consider as well.

1330
01:43:18,936 --> 01:43:20,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did also want to lift up.

1331
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:27,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope that we can advance the Gender Equity Commission promptly as well alongside the Youth Commission.

1332
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:30,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will put a plug in for

1333
01:43:30,682 --> 01:43:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: the pilot commission on payments in lieu of taxes that I proposed last January.

1334
01:43:37,147 --> 01:43:40,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of these commissions are worthy efforts that would really benefit the city.

1335
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:44,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1336
01:43:46,013 --> 01:43:46,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1337
01:43:46,814 --> 01:43:49,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

1338
01:43:50,136 --> 01:43:52,978
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a key resolution and Councilor Scarpelli you're right.

1339
01:43:53,098 --> 01:43:55,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives the youth of our community a voice.

1340
01:43:55,991 --> 01:43:57,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really important.

1341
01:43:57,051 --> 01:44:05,873
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take a look at CCSR, remember when that first came about when we were on the school committee, that program has grown tremendously throughout the years.

1342
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:15,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And you look at the good works that the students have been doing throughout the years, the programs, the things that they've come to propose to us with regards to ordinances and whatnot.

1343
01:44:16,035 --> 01:44:22,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a great way for them to be involved in public service and giving back to the community.

1344
01:44:22,617 --> 01:44:24,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So I support this a hundred percent.

1345
01:44:25,117 --> 01:44:27,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to discussing this further in committee the whole.

1346
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:33,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight, I thank you for bringing this forward and I would also second the resolution.

1347
01:44:33,063 --> 01:44:33,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1348
01:44:34,524 --> 01:44:37,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1349
01:44:37,566 --> 01:44:38,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1350
01:44:38,447 --> 01:44:46,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanna thank Council Vice President Knight for bringing this up and Councilor Scarpelli for his passion on this issue.

1351
01:44:46,533 --> 01:44:52,137
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been dealing with the youth of our community for many decades and I think has his finger on the pulse

1352
01:44:53,362 --> 01:45:00,104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, anytime you can expand the seat at the table where decisions are being made, I think is a positive step.

1353
01:45:00,564 --> 01:45:07,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And to have youth involved in decision making, I think is a very positive step in this community.

1354
01:45:08,527 --> 01:45:16,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the days back some years ago, Mr. President, the council, under the leadership of the president of the council, would allow members to invite

1355
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:45,598
[SPEAKER_11]: a business owner behind the reel, invite a student behind the reel, invite any one of your choice per week, Mr. President, and they would sit right next to you and they would have input, naturally they didn't have a vote, but they would have input during the meeting and be able to discuss and give input about how this may impact their business or impact their life or impact their family or whatever it might be, Mr. President,

1356
01:45:45,878 --> 01:45:54,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just thought it was a great way of all too often you hear people saying that they don't have a seat at the table or they're left out of the process.

1357
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:58,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was just a nice way of including members of the community.

1358
01:45:58,402 --> 01:46:12,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really would like to see us get back into that, Mr. President, and maybe under your leadership, we can once again reignite that and allow the council members to invite someone behind the real

1359
01:46:12,906 --> 01:46:16,667
[SPEAKER_11]: of their choice, Mr. President, to partake in city government.

1360
01:46:16,927 --> 01:46:19,748
[SPEAKER_11]: But getting back to this, I support this wholeheartedly.

1361
01:46:20,128 --> 01:46:29,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I support anything that would bring additional people to the table and therefore get additional opinions on how city government should operate.

1362
01:46:29,872 --> 01:46:31,272
[SPEAKER_11]: And I support this wholeheartedly.

1363
01:46:31,772 --> 01:46:32,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1364
01:46:32,573 --> 01:46:37,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, I'd love to get some bodies in here and be more than happy to bring someone up here.

1365
01:46:38,955 --> 01:46:39,595
[SPEAKER_09]: The room is open.

1366
01:46:40,722 --> 01:46:43,625
[SPEAKER_09]: If some students want to come in, we'd be more than happy to have them in here.

1367
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:44,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

1368
01:46:44,806 --> 01:46:45,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you.

1369
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:52,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to point out there's some differences between this commission and the commissions that were mentioned.

1370
01:46:53,112 --> 01:46:54,473
[SPEAKER_12]: This commission is statutory in nature.

1371
01:46:54,513 --> 01:46:58,016
[SPEAKER_12]: So this will be adopting a local option that's been provided to us by the state legislature.

1372
01:46:58,677 --> 01:47:04,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And because it's statutory in nature, there is a defined framework and parameters that are already in place that we have to work with.

1373
01:47:05,987 --> 01:47:13,873
[SPEAKER_12]: quite frankly, this might be one of the easiest things we've ever had to do in our life, because the law pretty much says what's required in the ordinance and at the local level.

1374
01:47:14,214 --> 01:47:32,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we're talking about the Gender Equity Commission, which started out as, I believe, a Women's Commission, and then turned into a Gender Equity Commission with investigatory authority and all this other stuff, quite frankly, I think that during that discussion about the gender equity stuff, I think a lot of the message got lost in the process, Mr. President, what it was we were trying to accomplish.

1375
01:47:32,288 --> 01:47:33,829
[SPEAKER_12]: We got, I think, a little bit too

1376
01:47:36,267 --> 01:47:45,089
[SPEAKER_12]: involved with the minutiae and the details, bringing it down to the lowest possible level when we could have been able to put a framework together in a much more timely fashion.

1377
01:47:45,129 --> 01:47:49,409
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can certainly appreciate the frustration that Councilor Morell has expressed.

1378
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:55,190
[SPEAKER_12]: However, this is a little bit different than that situation, because this is something that's statutory in nature.

1379
01:47:55,250 --> 01:48:00,491
[SPEAKER_12]: By adopting the enabling language, we already have the defined parameters and frameworks that's necessary for us to move forward.

1380
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:04,052
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, I do thank my council colleagues for their kind words, and I move for approval.

1381
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:09,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:48:10,042 --> 01:48:14,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1383

[SPEAKER_09]: To refer to a committee of the whole.

1384
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:26,214

[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell.

1394
01:48:36,762 --> 01:48:36,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm in support of the motion passes.

01:48:42,144 --> 01:48:47,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Communications from the mayor.

1400
01:48:47,406 --> 01:48:51,947
[SPEAKER_09]: 21357 to the all present members of Medford City Council, City Hall MFMS.

1401
01:48:55,688 --> 01:49:04,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request to recommend that your own body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

1402
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:18,101
[SPEAKER_09]: requesting the appropriation of $62,500 from the CPA General Reserve to action for Boston Community Development for the remainder of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program.

1403
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:23,886
[SPEAKER_09]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category affordable housing.

1404
01:49:24,206 --> 01:49:27,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely, Brianna Montgomery, Mayor.

1405
01:49:27,809 --> 01:49:31,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have somebody from the CPA?

1406
01:49:31,713 --> 01:49:33,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta, are you gonna be speaking?

1407
01:49:35,493 --> 01:49:39,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, if you can unmute Roberta Cameron for a brief presentation.

1408
01:49:40,577 --> 01:49:40,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1409
01:49:41,357 --> 01:49:50,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So the council had previously approved all but the 62,500 of the 250,000 that the CPC recommended for an emergency rental assistance program last year.

1410
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,532
[SPEAKER_03]: in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

1411
01:50:02,253 --> 01:50:11,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ABCD has so far spent close to 100 or they've expanded close to $160,000

1412
01:50:17,462 --> 01:50:35,059
[SPEAKER_03]: of the funds toward, um, paying assisting Medford residents with their rental payments and have an additional, um, set of applications in the pipeline that would bring them up to about $170,000 that they would have spent toward, um,

1413
01:50:40,093 --> 01:50:42,254
[SPEAKER_03]: paying for the rental assistance.

1414
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:49,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are running close to the end of the funds that the council has approved to date.

1415
01:50:49,738 --> 01:51:00,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are coming back to ask that the council approve the remaining funds to enable them to finish the program that we recommended for them last year.

1416
01:51:00,104 --> 01:51:02,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1417
01:51:04,046 --> 01:51:05,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions for Roberta Cameron?

1418
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:16,395
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion by Councilor Scarpelli for approval, seconded by Councilor Falco.

[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight.

1444
01:51:58,999 --> 01:51:59,299

[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello.

1452
01:52:06,122 --> 01:52:06,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1453
01:52:06,462 --> 01:52:07,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in favor of the motion passes.

1454
01:52:09,177 --> 01:52:10,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1455
01:52:10,498 --> 01:52:25,067
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-0-8-0-6, 90-day review report on El Tecuba, Cochina and Tequila Bar for petition for a special permit hours granted by this council as amended to require the 90-day report to begin on the opening of the restaurant.

1456
01:52:25,087 --> 01:52:25,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

1457
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:35,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, El Tecuba, Cochina and Tequila Bar is probably one of the most frequent questions I get asked when I go through Medford.

1458
01:52:35,494 --> 01:52:36,495
[SPEAKER_12]: When is this place opening?

1459
01:52:36,635 --> 01:52:37,615
[SPEAKER_12]: When is this place opening?

1460
01:52:37,675 --> 01:52:38,496
[SPEAKER_12]: When is this place opening?

1461
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:46,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we've had a tough year, Mr. President, in terms of the economy, the shutdown, the pandemic, and the like.

1462
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:53,697
[SPEAKER_12]: But with that being said, from what I can see, they have a building permit on the windowsill, the windowsill wrapped up like there's some construction going on inside.

1463
01:52:54,157 --> 01:53:05,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hoping that we could just shoot off a correspondence by authorizing the city clerk to do such, asking for an update on the status of their expansion from Tanaka to Alta Cuba, Kachina, and Tequila Bar, Mr. President.

1464
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:10,372
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that a lot of that business plan was contingent upon the reopening of Shibahia Auditorium.

1465
01:53:11,052 --> 01:53:20,641
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I heard this morning, or earlier in the meeting, I should say, from the Director of the Board of Health was, it seems very promising that we're going to have events there at some point in time in the near future.

1466
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:30,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, hopefully we can kind of get a little update as to what's going on with El Tecuba and also with what's going on at Shibahia Auditorium, Mr. President.

1467
01:53:30,578 --> 01:53:38,780
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd asked the city clerk to send off an email provided that my council colleagues support this resolution to reach out to the business owner and just ask what's the status.

1468
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:45,623
[SPEAKER_12]: This was a license that was granted by the council and it was placed on a list for a 90 day review, 90 days after opening.

1469
01:53:47,143 --> 01:53:52,825
[SPEAKER_12]: The 90 days, the summer of 2020 maybe, June of 2020.

1470
01:53:53,025 --> 01:53:54,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's been a while.

1471
01:53:54,785 --> 01:53:59,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's been a bit of time and you know, that's okay.

1472
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:05,342
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm just more curious than anything else, Mr. President, as to what the status is.

1473
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:11,545
[SPEAKER_12]: If nothing, then maybe this is something that we refer up to a new Director of Economic Development.

1474
01:54:12,426 --> 01:54:25,652
[SPEAKER_12]: If in fact there are some hurdles or some problems that this business faces in expanding because there's so much community excitement for it, there might actually be a resource there in City Hall that can help them cut through some of the red tape or find some creative ways to meet some of the needs that they have.

1475
01:54:26,156 --> 01:54:31,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was, you know, the whole goal and purpose of us creating the position of Director of Economic Development.

1476
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:37,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that being said, Mr. President, maybe this can be the first project that he gets assigned, and now we can see if Delta Cuba can open.

1477
01:54:38,265 --> 01:54:39,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1478
01:54:39,546 --> 01:54:43,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I do remember the mayor going in there sometime during the year.

1479
01:54:43,809 --> 01:54:46,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw it on Twitter or somewhere.

1480
01:54:46,311 --> 01:54:48,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I know she did a little walkthrough there.

1481
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:50,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's been some time.

1482
01:54:50,226 --> 01:54:52,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I can give you a little bit of an answer on Chevalier.

1483
01:54:52,967 --> 01:55:09,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they are planning some things in the very near future there, but unfortunately, with their limited capacity, and they're going to have, I think, just comedians at the moment because of the cost of the acts and the amount of people.

1484
01:55:09,914 --> 01:55:14,876
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you will see some stuff coming out there, some announcement in the next few weeks, Vice President May.

1485
01:55:15,196 --> 01:55:15,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

1486
01:55:16,945 --> 01:55:27,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, that we get a report on this and Shavia, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1487
01:55:28,856 --> 01:55:29,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Scripps, please call the roll.

1564
01:57:37,498 --> 01:57:39,219

01:57:39,947 --> 01:57:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1566
01:57:40,207 --> 01:57:41,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1567
01:57:41,528 --> 01:57:44,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Councilors marks and Falco.

1568
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:46,090
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two great subcommittee meetings.

1569
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,711
[SPEAKER_05]: This first one is on elderly and housing affairs.

1570
01:57:49,171 --> 01:57:59,096
[SPEAKER_05]: We discussed housing stability, um, and I got an update from our folks in our health department about how housing is being incorporated into the social work

1571
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:02,158
[SPEAKER_05]: that they are doing from Alicia and Penny.

1572
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:12,983
[SPEAKER_05]: We reported out in motion from the subcommittee to recommend that the mayor include $50,000 in the fiscal year 22 budget to continue emergency rental assistance.

1573
01:58:13,623 --> 01:58:17,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'd be possible that the city administration could pursue additional grants as well.

1574
01:58:18,726 --> 01:58:22,767
[SPEAKER_05]: We also discussed Councilor Falco's proposal for a housing stability notification ordinance.

1575
01:58:23,448 --> 01:58:28,370
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be getting a red line copy from the city solicitor and discussing that at our next meeting.

1576
01:58:29,255 --> 01:58:30,035
[SPEAKER_05]: and I move approval.

1577
01:58:31,116 --> 01:58:31,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1578
01:58:31,696 --> 01:58:34,937
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1579
01:58:35,437 --> 01:58:35,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1580
01:58:36,798 --> 01:58:38,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Matz.

1581
01:58:38,658 --> 01:58:39,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1582
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:44,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one clarification, and I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco.

1583
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:50,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're making some real headway on housing issues within our community.

1584
01:58:51,342 --> 01:58:56,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, the 50,000 that we asked to be in the budget

1585
01:58:56,952 --> 01:59:02,395
[SPEAKER_11]: was for housing assistance and not rental assistance.

1586
01:59:03,316 --> 01:59:11,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to clarify because I know there was some contention around why not just make a general statement regarding housing assistance and not rental.

1587
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:15,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want the record to reflect it's, I believe it's housing assistance.

1588
01:59:16,084 --> 01:59:16,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1589
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:18,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is reflected in the actual report.

1590
01:59:18,545 --> 01:59:19,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1591
01:59:19,206 --> 01:59:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I just used the wrong word.

1592
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:21,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's fine.

1593
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1594
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:28,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1595
01:59:28,691 --> 01:59:29,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Bears?

1596
01:59:29,931 --> 01:59:30,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1597
01:59:30,852 --> 01:59:31,512

1598
01:59:31,572 --> 01:59:31,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1599
01:59:31,912 --> 01:59:32,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President Knight?

1600
01:59:32,972 --> 01:59:33,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1601
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:33,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks?

1602
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:34,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1603
01:59:34,493 --> 01:59:35,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell?

1604
01:59:35,433 --> 01:59:35,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1605
01:59:36,394 --> 01:59:37,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1606
01:59:37,274 --> 01:59:37,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1607
01:59:37,534 --> 01:59:38,374
[SPEAKER_12]: President Caraviello?

1608
01:59:38,514 --> 01:59:38,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1609
01:59:38,735 --> 01:59:42,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

1610
01:59:42,636 --> 01:59:45,917
[SPEAKER_09]: 20573, April 28th, 2020, Public Works Subcommittee.

1611
01:59:46,638 --> 01:59:47,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

1612
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:49,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1613
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, once again, Councilor Marks, Councilor Falco and myself met

1614
01:59:53,594 --> 01:59:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: this time to discuss snow removal with the public works subcommittee.

1615
01:59:57,859 --> 02:00:11,755
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a discussion again of the priority sidewalks list, and we did make a motion to recommend that the city administration issue an RFI or find another way to determine the cost of a city priority sidewalk

1616
02:00:13,672 --> 02:00:16,454
[SPEAKER_05]: to include that in the next snow and ice removal plan.

1617
02:00:17,354 --> 02:00:20,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had extensive discussion of the ordinance language.

1618
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:34,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We did make some motions to accept changes, and we will be looking at a red line copy at our next meeting with the solicitor along with Commissioner Moki and code enforcement to discuss the enforcement section of the ordinance.

1619
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:37,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you on the motion by

1620
02:00:41,113 --> 02:00:41,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Vice President, bye.

1621
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1622
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:52,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I was contacted with some concern that the sidewalk snow removal processes would be something that would be privatized or subcontracted.

1623
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:57,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the intention or the desire of the direction that the committee is going in?

1624
02:00:57,369 --> 02:00:59,551
[SPEAKER_12]: I had brief conversations with Councilor Marks.

1625
02:00:59,591 --> 02:01:01,532
[SPEAKER_12]: He seemed rather indifferent.

1626
02:01:01,552 --> 02:01:03,253
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't care who does it as long as it gets done.

1627
02:01:04,154 --> 02:01:11,279
[SPEAKER_12]: But I didn't know if this was something where we were looking at get a private group that will go out and do it or if this is something that you would try to adopt in-house.

1628
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:12,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this council in the past

1629
02:01:13,989 --> 02:01:18,210
[SPEAKER_12]: voted multiple times for us to purchase a bombardier to go and clear our sidewalk.

1630
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:29,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was just wondering if there was any focus on having this done privately or having this done as a government contractor, as part of the normal and regular DPW operations.

1631
02:01:30,733 --> 02:01:31,473
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, Mr. President.

1632
02:01:31,493 --> 02:01:33,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether or not it's all up in the air for discussion.

1633
02:01:33,694 --> 02:01:40,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the question I got a call from Steve South who had some questions about how this was going to play out.

1634
02:01:41,136 --> 02:01:42,236
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just hoping I can get some answers.

1635
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:44,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Best.

1636
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:45,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1637
02:01:45,981 --> 02:02:01,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we discussed both them looking for a contract to do it and also did mention that, I believe Councilor Marks mentioned, and we were all supportive of the idea of doing it in-house, purchasing the machines and identifying the manpower to do so.

1638
02:02:02,265 --> 02:02:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are waiting back to hear from the city administration what their determination is on cost for both of those ideas.

1639
02:02:13,378 --> 02:02:13,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

1640
02:02:13,678 --> 02:02:14,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1641
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

1642
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

1643
02:02:18,902 --> 02:02:19,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1644
02:02:19,823 --> 02:02:23,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco.

1645
02:02:23,866 --> 02:02:30,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say we've been working on this ordinance for a period of time, but we're finally making some serious headway.

1646
02:02:31,592 --> 02:02:36,235
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, Mr. President, it's not going to be just a knee jerk reaction.

1647
02:02:36,676 --> 02:02:38,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very thoughtful process.

1648
02:02:39,058 --> 02:02:42,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, the ordinance itself,

1649
02:02:43,008 --> 02:02:51,418
[SPEAKER_11]: which has some accountability within the ordinance, which I think will go a long way for pedestrian improving pedestrian safety.

1650
02:02:51,859 --> 02:03:00,870
[SPEAKER_11]: But secondly, Mr. President, I think adding a component of city responsibility, you know, the ordinance originally was a focus on

1651
02:03:01,303 --> 02:03:09,769
[SPEAKER_11]: residents, residents have to clear the corners, residents have to clear the sidewalks, they have to clear the front of the hybrids, residents have to do this, residents have to do that.

1652
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:22,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the subcommittee after digesting some of this said, you know what, in order to get a buy-in from the residents, we need the city to also step up and take responsibility.

1653
02:03:23,019 --> 02:03:28,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what we found is by offering this priority sidewalk, where we're looking at 26 miles

1654
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:33,014
[SPEAKER_11]: of Ontario roads.

1655
02:03:33,495 --> 02:03:36,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So every road that's currently being swept right now

1656
02:03:37,196 --> 02:03:51,682
[SPEAKER_11]: in our pilot program will now become part of, over a certain amount of inches, will now become part of an automatic plow that goes on the sidewalk and plow the sidewalk over a certain number of inches.

1657
02:03:52,103 --> 02:04:01,927
[SPEAKER_11]: What that does, as we've discussed, myself, Councilor Falco and Chairman Beers, is create the connectivity that we're talking about from business district to business district

1658
02:04:02,187 --> 02:04:10,012
[SPEAKER_11]: from school to school, from elderly housing to elderly housing, from bus stop to bus stop, and it creates that automatic connectivity.

1659
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:26,943
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the amount that we're looking at for upwards of $3,000 to $4,000 on an average snowstorm for a city this size, I think we all felt that this is our biggest bang for our buck to implement such a program.

1660
02:04:27,523 --> 02:04:31,466
[SPEAKER_11]: How it gets implemented, whether we outsource or see if we can

1661
02:04:31,815 --> 02:04:36,337
[SPEAKER_11]: handle it in-house, still remains, and still a work in progress.

1662
02:04:36,397 --> 02:04:42,040
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we've made a lot of headway in improving pedestrian safety.

1663
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:46,782
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would welcome Steve South to any one of our open meetings.

1664
02:04:46,822 --> 02:04:47,802
[SPEAKER_11]: They've all been open.

1665
02:04:48,122 --> 02:04:49,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had members of the Chamber of Commerce.

1666
02:04:50,123 --> 02:04:51,584
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had members of WOC Method.

1667
02:04:51,864 --> 02:04:55,886
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had members of WOC Boston attend our meetings and give input.

1668
02:04:56,366 --> 02:05:01,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're always welcome to hear input, Mr. President, on how we can better

1669
02:05:01,795 --> 02:05:02,895
[SPEAKER_11]: improve this process.

1670
02:05:03,275 --> 02:05:08,696
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the big issue that we've been struggling with is the crossings.

1671
02:05:09,257 --> 02:05:18,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now, the ordinance states that the homeowner that lives at the corner would be responsible for clearing out the crossing.

1672
02:05:18,939 --> 02:05:26,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we all know, many of the trucks plow to the corners, and in a big storm, you could have four, five, six feet of ice.

1673
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do you have a homeowner that's gonna be responsible

1674
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:31,631
[SPEAKER_11]: for clearing that out.

1675
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:41,797
[SPEAKER_11]: So part of the process for the priority sidewalk was to have 26 miles of these corners cleaned out automatically with these bombardiers.

1676
02:05:42,497 --> 02:05:53,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're still trying to create a process that we can have snow counted off, or we can have a better policy on the city side where they don't plow directly to corners.

1677
02:05:53,745 --> 02:06:00,609
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's some administrative stuff we can work on, some ordinance stuff, and maybe some contractual stuff to help improve

1678
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,921
[SPEAKER_11]: pedestrian safety in this community.

1679
02:06:03,281 --> 02:06:04,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to thank my colleagues.

1680
02:06:05,082 --> 02:06:22,249
[SPEAKER_11]: We've put a lot of hours into this, and I hope eventually when we present it to the council for their input, that they'll see the amount of hours that we put into this and, you know, have their input as well, but see that really, I think this makes a lot of sense for our community.

1681
02:06:22,589 --> 02:06:27,031
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco for their input on this.

1682
02:06:28,191 --> 02:06:30,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And the DPW commissioner as well, he's been

1683
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,381
[SPEAKER_11]: instrumental in this process, Mr. President.

1684
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:34,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1685
02:06:34,961 --> 02:06:36,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the clarification.

1686
02:06:37,162 --> 02:06:38,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Baxter.

1687
02:06:39,403 --> 02:06:49,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank Councilor Marks and you know, my usual intention around these is to keep them short, but I think I might get in touch with Councilor Marks next time so I can do it the full justice that he just did.

1688
02:06:49,907 --> 02:06:50,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1689
02:06:52,267 --> 02:06:52,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1690
02:06:53,128 --> 02:06:54,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1691
02:06:54,328 --> 02:06:56,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Peters

1692
02:06:58,105 --> 02:07:01,046
[SPEAKER_06]: These subcommittee meetings have been very, very productive.

1693
02:07:01,666 --> 02:07:08,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Councilor Marks mentioned, there's been a lot of input from business owners, the community, the department heads, and different organizations.

1694
02:07:08,649 --> 02:07:17,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to working with them to resolve these issues and bring them to a future Committee of the Whole meeting.

1695
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:21,693
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've been very productive meetings and I look forward to working with them to

1696
02:07:22,621 --> 02:07:23,682
[SPEAKER_06]: bring everything to fruition.

1697
02:07:23,722 --> 02:07:27,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks again to the Councilor Marks and Councilor Bears for their hard work on these issues.

1698
02:07:29,566 --> 02:07:30,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Councilor Falco.

1699
02:07:31,748 --> 02:07:35,271
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1700
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1703
02:07:40,855 --> 02:07:45,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for the identification, you know, Councilor Bears gave a great explanation.

1704
02:07:46,359 --> 02:07:49,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want anyone to think that we didn't share

1705
02:07:49,587 --> 02:07:51,127
[SPEAKER_11]: the information as we go along.

1706
02:07:51,567 --> 02:07:54,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So at no time could someone say, geez, I didn't know they were working on that.

1707
02:07:55,088 --> 02:07:57,788
[SPEAKER_11]: We laid it all out on the table, what we've been looking at.

1708

1709
