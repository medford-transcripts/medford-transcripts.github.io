00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:18,876
Councilor Scarpelli is going to be late I believe.

15
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:19,016
Yes.

16
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:19,776
President Caravaglia.

17
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:23,517
Yes, if I have an affirmative, two absent, please rise and float the flag.

18
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:28,138
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

19

Vice President Knight?

34
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:24,770

35
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,883
Councilor Marks is absent, Councilor Morrell?

00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:32,584
Yes.

37
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,204
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio?

41
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,067
Good evening, Mary Ann.

42
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:47,927
Good evening, how are you?

43
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,928
Mary Ann, if you can give us a little update on what's happening.

44
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:53,535
sure.

45
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:54,156
Happy to.

46
00:02:54,636 --> 00:02:55,316
Thanks for having me.

47
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:56,257
Good evening, everybody.

48
00:02:56,557 --> 00:03:13,385
Um, so we have good news today, our Metro North collaboration, regional collaboration with the other communities are dispensing site at the Tufts Gansher Center is going to be live and ready to go this week.

49
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:18,347
So as of tomorrow, and Thursday, there will be appointments available.

50
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:23,513
Um, kind of limited tomorrow and Thursday, but we will be building up.

51
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:33,496
Uh, so that is kicking off and that's great news because, uh, as a collaborating community, we get a certain allocations.

52
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:47,440
So because of that, we get an allocation of doses that we can use and we are going to be able to offer a, uh, a clinic at the high school, uh, Thursday afternoon, um, for

53
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:53,728
Medford High School students ages 16 plus, because it is the Pfizer vaccine.

54
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:59,211
Certainly kids ages 16 and 17 will need parental consent.

55
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:05,474
They don't need their parents to be with them, but they actually do have to bring in the consent form.

56
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,636
The school is putting out information today and will again tomorrow.

57
00:04:11,257 --> 00:04:17,300
And that's really exciting because we've seen, you know, luckily we've seen our cases

58
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,913
Finally starting to decline a little bit, where we've been seeing single digits for the first time in a long time, as far as daily case counts go.

59
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:41,697
But it's really interesting in that the majority of our cases are under 20 year olds, or 20, I should say 20 and under year olds, and split really half and half.

60
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:45,898
So we wanna get our students, our kids vaccinated

61
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:57,015
We're hoping that next week, the FDA goes forward with the EUA approval for Pfizer to actually be able to vaccinate 12 to 15 year olds.

62
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:02,797
And again, with this collaboration, we believe going forward, we'll have doses.

63
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:11,261
We'll be able to actually continue to do some clinics that we can move forward with our students and our children.

64
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,803
So that's really exciting news because that's what we're seeing now, the majority of our cases

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,780
And that's good news.

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:26,602
We're not seeing a lot of cases in our, I think we had two cases in 80 year olds and under five at 70 years old.

67
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:31,023
So we know that the vaccine has been out there.

68
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:36,784
We've done about 4,000 doses since the board of health for the city of Medford.

69
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:40,844
So that's about 2000 plus totally vaccinated.

70
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,024
That's two doses, right?

71
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:44,865
So about over 2000 folks we've been able to vaccinate

72
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,765
And the majority of that was our elders.

73
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,286
So we're glad to see that.

74
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:53,188
We're seeing less hospitalizations, less severe illness.

75
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,050
So it's a good thing, but we're not out of the woods yet.

76
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:10,857
And even though the state is loosening up on some of its gathering limits and requirements for vaccinated or not, we're still asking people, wear your masks, socially distance.

77
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,998
Let's keep this up until we get it done.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,121
but certainly things are looking better.

79
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,181
So.

80
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,942
All right, Marianne, how are the nursing homes doing?

81
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:23,542
Very well.

82
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:29,404
I know I haven't heard any cases of them.

83
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,324
Most of their clients have been vaccinated.

84
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:40,827
They do take on COVID positive people, but I know like the Medford Rehab has not seen a positive case in a long time.

85
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,620
and the same with Glen Ridge.

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,783
And so, so we're doing, they're doing much better.

87
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,164
Oh gosh, so much better.

88
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:50,745
Thank you.

89
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,788
Any questions for Marianne?

90
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:55,288
Mr. President.

91
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,070
Council Member.

92
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,511
Thank you, Mr. President.

93
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,972
Thank you for being here, Marianne.

94
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:08,218
So just to confirm for the, the vaccination site at Tufts is the, the way to register for that is still through that state website.

95
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,374
Oh, thank you.

96
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,695
Thanks for bringing that up.

97
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:15,559
Actually, there's a chat function here that I can, I will put in the chat.

98
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:23,004
You can go through the MassFact site, the typical, on the website, the MassFact site.

99
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:33,932
It's a little harder to find, but you can do, you'll find an exact link for the Gansher Center at Tufts if you put in your zip code.

100
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:42,142
but I'll put the chat, the specific one, because it does say Metro North, and that takes you right to the Gancho Center.

101
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:47,803
So that'll be operating 11 to four right now on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

102
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:53,905
Hopefully we'll be able to expand that going forward, but as far as the doses go right now.

103
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,305
So out of this collaborative, we have three sites.

104
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:03,967
We have the Encore Casino is offering, we have the Gancho Center at Tufts,

105
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:13,225
And as of next week, we will have what's currently the Cambridge Health Alliance used to be, I believe a target in Somerville that they're using now.

106
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:22,113
That'll come online next week, but this week it's the Gancher and the Encore are accepting appointments tomorrow and Thursday.

107
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:29,500
So I will put that in the chat, but yes, you go through the MassFact site, you'll be able to find it as well.

108
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:30,524
Okay, thank you.

109
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:35,192
And are all of those sites are appointment only, none are walk-in, those are all appointments only?

110
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:46,356
Working towards walk-in because access is important, and I know people are intimidated by the process of even going online trying to find an appointment.

111
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:51,598
So our goal is to be able to accept walk-ins.

112
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:59,341
We're just starting this week, so we're gonna get staffing up, but walk-ins, I think, is definitely our goal going forward.

113
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:05,944
Last week, we were lucky enough, Tufts had extra doses that they had purchased for their students,

114
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:12,206
And when they didn't have them all fulfilled, they put it, we put it out there.

115
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:22,049
And I think on that Thursday or Friday last week, they had 300 appointments and 400 walk-ins.

116
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,650
So they did 700 in that day and 400 of those walk-ins.

117
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,992
So we do have, we can do it, but we want to make sure that, you know, we're able to,

118
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,169
to publicize it the right way.

119
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,191
So walk-ins is definitely our goal.

120
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:37,572
Okay, great.

121
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:38,313
Thank you, Marianne.

122
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,113
Thank you for being here.

123
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:51,623
There was a story recently in Kaiser Health News about what local directors of public health have really been dealing with for the past 14 months above and beyond just the actual work, kind of the stress of the job.

124
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:54,645
So I really appreciate just what you've done and what your team has done.

125
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,486
So thank you again.

126
00:09:55,506 --> 00:10:00,570
Marianne, CBS is doing them also, I think.

127
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:08,461
Yes, CVS and Walgreens are there, and I believe they're working towards walk-ins as well.

128
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:21,384
That's pretty much everyone's goal right now, as far as we wanna get folks who have a little bit of hesitancy or a little bit of nervousness about accessing and trying to use that registration site.

129
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:29,466
So everyone's goal is going really towards walk-ins, but Walgreens and CVS, yes, and they're pretty easy to get appointments at this point.

130
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Vice President Knight.

131
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,611
Mr. President, thank you very much.

132
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:38,152
Maryann, when you were last here, we spoke a lot about how busy your office was.

133
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:45,794
And at that time, you indicated that your office was working about 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you had about between nine and 11 employees.

134
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:46,694
Is that still the case?

135
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:50,915
It's better.

136
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:55,236
We're not working as much weekends now.

137
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:55,797
And

138
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:59,219
Things are getting a little bit easier.

139
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,063
The contact tracing is, you know, again, we're in single digit cases, which is nice to see.

140
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:14,771
And we are gonna be able to hopefully keep offering clinics, but certainly that it feels better.

141
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:19,055
It feels better that we're not putting in as many hours as.

142
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:22,219
as was required earlier.

143
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,361
Loosen the restrictions on outdoor gatherings.

144
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:29,966
What impact does that have on the rental of our public facilities here in the city of Metro?

145
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:37,292
So outdoor events, as of May 19th, you're going to be able to have 250 folks at outdoor gatherings.

146
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,333
Indoors, they're talking 200.

147
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,116
That will be as of May 19th.

148
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:56,113
They have already loosened the restrictions and rescinded a lot of the guidance on certain sectors.

149
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:59,075
But we're expecting a lot of that to change.

150
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:06,561
Like even as of May 10th, they're talking about like the pool restrictions will be changing.

151
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,342
They rescinded the beach restrictions.

152
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:13,986
So when you're talking about Tufts pool and Wrights pond, like things are definitely opening up.

153
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:18,824
as really with the fields, because the fields are a revenue generating entity that we have here in this community.

154
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:24,106
And when we were last here, we discussed a little bit about how the permitting process has changed.

155
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:30,149
You know, ultimately those fields do about $215,000 a season each.

156
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,191
So, you know, we're approaching close to $700,000 in the rental of those fields.

157
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,311
They're a revenue generating entity.

158
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:40,133
And my concern is that we're not missing out on applicants that are seeking

159
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:46,216
to rent our fields when there are vacancies because of bureaucracy and bureaucratic delays.

160
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:52,520
So as of right now, their safety plans are still in, the guidance is still in place for sports.

161
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,482
I've been reviewing all of the rental requests.

162
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,683
I haven't denied any of them.

163
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:08,750
They have their safety plans and that's all we've been requiring that they tell us they're gonna, you know, fulfill the guidance and adhere to their safety plans.

164
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,367
Um, so nothing has been denied.

165
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:22,535
Um, and as restrictions loosen up as far as spectators and that type of thing, which has not changed, the sports guidance will probably change, um, by the end of the month.

166
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,718
But as of right now, it's still in place.

167
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:30,581
So it's just where we're going with the safety plans, but nothing's been denied.

168
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:38,868
They're still applications are coming in daily for soccer and on that point, have applications not been acted upon.

169
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,154
No, they've all been acted upon.

170
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:42,194
I don't know.

171
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:57,302
So I've spoken with a number of entities that have requested to use field space that have said, you know, on a Thursday afternoon, they find out that there's a vacancy at Medford and then they ask them to use the field space and then they never get a response and then they don't get to use the field space that weekend.

172
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,944
Oh, I don't know who they're asking.

173
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,705
I can't speak to that.

174
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:07,148
A very popular ultimate Frisbee group, the Whitecaps actually, if you remember back a few years ago, the city of Medford was,

175
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:13,756
actually featured on ESPN's top 10 moments when someone at Hormel stadium made an amazing ultimate Frisbee catch.

176
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:18,597
I don't really know what that means, but, um, there was somebody that made, you know, a great play and they were on ESPN.

177
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:27,458
Um, that was recorded at Hormel stadium and that group, the whitecaps, um, which historically used the field, um, in my experience, they've never had a problem until recently.

178
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,500
Um, do we know, um, so in terms of applications that come in per week, how many applications are you looking at?

179
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:36,320
Um,

180
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:46,223
Not, I haven't seen any this week, but I think we're up to date with all the applications we've gotten.

181
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:49,165
The last one we did was we had jumbo soccer.

182
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,847
I think I did an ultimate frisbee one, actually.

183
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:54,328
I did an adult women's soccer.

184
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:56,850
So they've all been, they're up to date.

185
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:03,315
So whatever applications are in-house have all been processed and they've gone on to the whole middle stadium commission.

186
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,517
And how does it work now?

187
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,018
So an application will go into where?

188
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,901
It comes into the mayor's office.

189
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,261
There's a checklist.

190
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,743
It comes to me next for approval as far as the safety plans are concerned.

191
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,724
And once I approve that, it goes on to the whole mail commission.

192
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,507
And we're up to date as far as I know.

193
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,908
Sure, it goes to the mayor's office.

194
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,669
What's the mayor's office do to send it to your office?

195
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:41,386
There's a checklist, they have their own checklist around, I believe, insurance requirements and those types of things.

196
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,287
I'm only involved in the safety.

197
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,389
The field administrator handled that for a hundred years.

198
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,574
Usually the way it would work would be that the application would go into the field administrator, the field administrator would check for availability.

199
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,177
If the availability was there, they'd secure the field for the applicant.

200
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,358
The applicant would then fill out the paperwork.

201
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:03,501
If the paperwork wasn't completed and the payment wasn't attached, then the applicant wouldn't get to use the field.

202
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:08,778
It seems like it was a little bit more streamlined and it was a little bit more of a guarantee that we were getting some money in our coffers.

203
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:23,512
My disappointment with the process is well known and well publicized, Madam Director, and I'm hoping that with the restrictions that are being loosened by the administration at the state level that they will also be loosened at this level.

204
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:29,237
Yeah, I think there was just a problem that they were being able to be scheduled before their safety plans were approved.

205
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:34,105
So now that's been, but yeah, I appreciate it.

206
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:34,565
Thank you.

207
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:41,249
It could be micromanaging as well, but I just think that it's a really, you know, over bureaucratic and unnecessary stuff.

208
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,650
It's requirements from the state that we have to follow.

209
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,731
So that's what we do.

210
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,832
I don't think anybody hasn't.

211
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:49,534
Now it is, but that's okay.

212
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,795
Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:56,558
Marianne, thank you very much for your update and the hard work of you and your department.

214
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:00,764
A quick question regarding the vaccination clinics at Tufts University.

215
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,566
So is that indefinitely every Wednesday and Thursday?

216
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:09,090
Going forward, we're hoping we'll expand it to more days than just Wednesday and Thursday.

217
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:16,576
But as far as vaccine availability right now from the state, it looks like Wednesdays and Thursdays at least are definite.

218
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,538
But we're hoping to expand to more days going forward.

219
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:20,919
Thank you.

220
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:26,454
And with regard to mobile vaccination, we talked about that before.

221
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:27,255
Can you give us an update?

222
00:17:27,275 --> 00:17:31,959
Are we still or is the city still have a mobile vaccination program?

223
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:34,542
As far as a homebound goes?

224
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,023
Correct.

225
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,304
Yeah.

226
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:46,233
So we've, we're still taking folks if they're interested in needing a homebound vaccination, they can certainly still contact us.

227
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:50,513
Um, but we, we, we completed our list.

228
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,973
I think we have three people maybe left this week to do.

229
00:17:53,713 --> 00:18:00,914
Um, so we've done pretty close to 200 people, um, have been completed as far as homebound vaccinations go.

230
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:13,317
Uh, but again, if people still need, um, they can still contact our multi resource, uh, line multi, uh, legal resource line and, um, be happy to put them on a list and get them done.

231
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:14,737
We do have, um,

232
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,642
J J vaccine for homebound if folks are interested in it.

233
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,443
So certainly please call us.

234
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:25,523
Thank you.

235
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:35,867
And last time we talked, we talked a little bit about, I believe there was about populations that were not maybe hesitant towards getting the vaccine.

236
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:42,430
We were working, I believe you had mentioned that we were working maybe with the state or there was another program that the city was working with to

237
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,517
get people that were hesitant, vaccine hesitant, vaccinated.

238
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:48,798
Is that still in play?

239
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,121
Yes, we are launching that campaign very soon.

240
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:57,323
We have, so there is vaccine hesitancy we found among different groups.

241
00:18:57,423 --> 00:19:04,768
We have information, we're kind of targeted by sectors, so faith-based business info.

242
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,410
And we will be holding a town hall on May 19th.

243
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:30,591
We're hoping to access the ambassadors that the state have already hired and have in place that speak multi languages and culturally aware and they can come out and depending on where we're holding our events, they can come out and speak to people with specific issues, but there will be.

244
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:39,837
We're planning on a town hall on May 19 to hopefully address people's fears and issues around, you know, vaccine hesitancy.

245
00:19:40,872 --> 00:19:41,913
Would that be via Zoom?

246
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:44,274
Yes, via Zoom.

247
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:49,618
We're looking at a couple of different options.

248
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,721
We may be able to hold it in different locations and then also via Zoom.

249
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:56,182
Great.

250
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,223
Thank you very much.

251
00:19:59,084 --> 00:19:59,745
Any other questions?

252
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:01,386
Thank you, Marianne.

253
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:02,747
Thank you.

254
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:03,647
Have a good night.

255
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:04,828
All right.

256
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,270
Motion to revert back to regular business.

00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,886

Hearings.

274
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:38,384
2145, legal notice, City of Medford.

275
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:44,536
CBBG annual action plan, public hearing, and 30 day public comment period.

276
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:52,301
A virtual public hearing will be held by the Memphis City Council on Tuesday, May 4th, 2021 via remote video conferencing.

277
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:56,244
Conferencing details will be posted on the city clerk's office prior to the hearing.

278
00:20:56,304 --> 00:21:06,030
The purpose of the public hearing will be to invite the general public and representative of public service agencies to express comments regarding the city's annual action plan for community development and planning.

279
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,692
The action plan contains proposed use

280
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:15,980
community development block grant funds for the program year, which extends from July 1st, 2021 through June 30th, 2022.

281
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:31,628
The office of community development will be requesting that the city, that the Memphis city council authorize Mayor Brian McLaren, official representative of the city of Memphis to submit the annual action plan application for funds and all other assurances and certifications to the U.S.

282
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:34,529
departments of housing and urban development.

283
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:36,130
The city is applying

284
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,729
or $1,546,980 block grant funds.

285
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:54,471
Beginning April 12th, 2020, the annual draft action plan will be available for review and comment and can be obtained by contacting the Office of Community Development at 781-393-2480 or OCD at MemphisMethod.gov.

286
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:18,231
written comments must be submitted no later than May 12th, 2021 to Ashley Williams, City Hall 85, George P. Hesse Drive, room 308, FMS 0255, or abwilliams at medfordmass.gov.

287
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:28,658
Okay, do we have a, where this is a public hearing, do we have anyone here speaking in favor of this?

288
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,520
Mr. President, if I may.

289
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:38,277
Vice President Knight, I think it might make sense that we just give a brief breakdown.

290
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:51,464
I have the paper in front of me, actually, of the agency that's applied for the funding and the recommendation for the upcoming CDBG fiscal year block grant that's being made by the Office of Community Development to the administration.

291
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:57,767
That recommendation would go to the mayor, and then the mayor would have the opportunity to either say, I like the recommendation or she can

292
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,089
use our executive authority to change that recommendation, Mr. President.

293
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:07,733
But in looking at this, I think it's important that we do inform the general public about what it is exactly that's being appropriated.

294
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:14,437
So if we look at Bread of Life, they'd be recommended for the fiscal year, $2,603.

295
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,458
For Community Tasks Incorporated, $5,045.

296
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:17,079
For Community Family Inc., $5,000.

297
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,560
For the Medford Council on Aging, $34,200.

298
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,629
For Housing Families Incorporated, $13,000.

299
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:31,810
For the Immigrant Learning Center, $6,200.

300
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,792
For the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, $15,000, Mr. President.

301
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,573
For the Medford Public Schools, $10,000.

302
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:39,855
For the YMCA and Mystic Community Market Boys and Girls Club, $10,000.

303
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:41,676
For the Mystic Valley Urban Services, $5,000.

304
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,657
For SCM Transportation, $105,000.

305
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:45,779
And for the West Medford Community Center, $21,000, Mr. President.

306
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:04,674
We have a total award for FY 21-22 of $1,546,988 with a 15% cap waived, allowing the public service entities to be afforded $232,048.

307
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:05,454
Thank you.

308
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:06,715
Alicia Hunt, you had your hand up.

309
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:30,567
Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:38,772
As the Community Development Director, I am here to present the paper if necessary or to answer any questions.

311
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:46,017
I also want to acknowledge that Ashley Williams, who is the staff person that administrates this grant, is also here this evening.

312
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:49,599
She's the one that comments would be going to.

313
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,182
this was advertised starting in mid April.

314
00:24:54,202 --> 00:25:04,486
To date, Ashley informs me that we have not received any public comments outside of the meetings that we had with the city council on this.

315
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:12,730
And shortly before the public comment section time opened, we had a public meeting and we received comments at that public meeting.

316
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,171
Those have been incorporated into this plan already.

317
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,112
So if there are further questions.

318
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:20,598
Thank you.

319
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:22,940
Is there anyone else in favor of this petition?

320
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,824
Hearing and seeing none, we close this portion of the hearing.

321
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:31,228
Is there anyone here that is in opposition to this plan?

322
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:36,072
Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the meeting.

323
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,034
Mr. President, Vice President Knight.

324
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:43,439
Speaking as a citizen out of 9200 Rubin Street, I'd like to see an increase in the funding for the metric consumer commissions.

325
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:44,440
I think we have

326
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:50,685
an opportunity here to really build upon some of the successes that we've made and the strides that we've made over the past years.

327
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:54,890
And this represents a reduction in benefits and an award from last year.

328
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,714
And I think that that's something that should be looked at a little bit further.

329
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,840
The individuals that are employed in the Medford Consumer Commission work right here out of City Hall.

330
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:12,786
They provide a valuable service to many of the residents here in this community, especially our senior citizens who have been falling victim to many of these COVID-19 scams, Social Security scams, and the like.

331
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:24,929
So with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to speak out in opposition of the current protocols that are – the current recommendations that are in there and request that the Consumer Commission be afforded additional funds in line with at least last year's award.

332
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:27,429
Thank you, Mr. President.

333
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:35,196
And I have received several calls from people that have used that office and we're happy with the results of that office.

334
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:39,100
So I do support the additional funding if it is available.

335
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,560
Mr. President.

336
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,682
Vice Councilor Marks.

337
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,484
Thank you, Mr. President.

338
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:51,331
I wholeheartedly agree with Vice President Knight, but I remember at the public hearing and someone can correct me if I'm wrong,

339
00:26:52,062 --> 00:27:01,189
the mayor was gonna supplement the decrease in funding and the community block grant money with money in the FY22 budget.

340
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,251
Is that not correct, Mr. President?

341
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:06,834
You are correct.

342
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:11,497
So we did receive a commitment and maybe Alicia can speak to that.

343
00:27:11,878 --> 00:27:15,000
Was that a commitment that was made by the city administration?

344
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:17,242
Alicia?

345
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,843
Mr. President, thank you.

346
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:20,284
Yes.

347
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:28,666
So to be clear, last year, we were allowed to not follow the cap of 15% of CDBG funds.

348
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:37,709
So we were able to provide additional funding to several communities, or to several organizations, including that organization.

349
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,013
organization is actually receiving an increase from the amount that they had been.

350
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:50,158
Every other organization was level funded from previous years, from multiple previous years.

351
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:57,584
And this is the one public service agency that we were able to increase by actually decreasing a different public service.

352
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:05,951
This year, in order to increase that agency, we would have to decrease one of the other agencies funding on the list.

353
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:08,913
because there is a cap this year.

354
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:11,374
There was not a cap last year because of the pandemic.

355
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:15,215
The mayor has committed to increasing the funding.

356
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:23,438
So this office has not previously received budget funding for personnel and salaries in the city's budget.

357
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:35,423
The mayor has informed me and has informed the director of that office that she will be supplementing that budget this year in the city's general fund budget, which is new this year.

358
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:39,073
In the past, they've only received a budget for office supplies.

359
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:44,175
Mr. President, do we have an indication of what the dollar amount will be?

360
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,457
I do not have, Alicia, do we have an indication of what the dollar amount will be?

361
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:54,600
She did not tell me specifically, so I don't want to misrepresent it.

362
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,863
She did indicate that she would make up what we couldn't provide, but she didn't use numbers.

363
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:04,344
Thank you, Mr. President.

364
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:04,925
Thank you.

365
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,773
We will close that part of the meeting in opposition.

366
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:19,578
Do we have a motion on the floor to accept the plan?

367
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,102
I think Mr. President, it's a 30 day public comment period.

368
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:27,723
Yes, yes.

369
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:33,787
When we vote on this, it will be put in the paper for the 30 day commentary.

370
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:39,669
So it requires a vote tonight to put into it for a 30 day comment period?

371
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,409
No, no, it doesn't.

372
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,532
The 30 day comment period closes on actually the May 11th.

373
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,693
Sorry, that number was the date was just in the hearing that you read.

374
00:29:52,754 --> 00:30:02,918
Our hope would be that you would vote to approve it this evening so that we could submit it the day after the comment period closes, assuming that we don't receive any further comments.

375
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,223
The one other thing, I actually have a request.

376
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:17,989
Several counselors commented that they received comments about this amount and that they went directly to the counselors.

377
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:26,573
Please, please direct residents to send public comment to Ashley or to OCD as is in the public comment in the hearing notice.

378
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:36,617
Because this is a federal program, we need to receive the comments with names and addresses directly in order to technically take them into account.

379
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:52,784
We're happy to take the counselor's request into account, and that's why we're here to do that, but we really need the residents to contact our office directly so that we can include that information when we do our filings with the federal government.

380
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:55,965
They prefer not to get hearsay.

381
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:08,323
On that point, Mr. President, what's the purpose of us having a public hearing, then, if the people that come here and make comments in favor or opposition aren't counted towards the decision-making process?

382
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:17,845
So tonight, your name and address will go on that list of public comment, but all the residents that you have heard from, we don't have their names and addresses on our list.

383
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:19,606
They're not here making the comments.

384
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,630
And we'll just submit it.

385
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:29,112
We'll submit it with the comments that we have, but we do submit the public comments to the federal government.

386
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:38,574
And I don't, I'm gonna submit a comment that says that the councilor received comments from residents making this request.

387
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:43,595
I think that those voices would be louder if we also had their names and addresses.

388
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,676
That's what I'm concerned about.

389
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:48,497
I spoke as a citizen in opposition and asked for an increase in this funding in this line item.

390
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:49,657
Now, if my,

391
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,338
voice isn't gonna be heard or recorded.

392
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:54,960
I haven't talked about that.

393
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,943
I just said that your name and address will be recorded.

394
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:03,407
But there was a comment that you'd heard from many residents.

395
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:08,571
I'm just asking that residents be directed to send us their comments for the record.

396
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:11,273
I have told residents to call.

397
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:14,875
Once you call me, get asked them to call your office and the mayor's office.

398
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:15,916
Thank you.

399
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:19,479
Okay, any further questions?

400
00:32:21,332 --> 00:32:27,335
On the motion by Councilor Marks for approval, seconded by Vice President Knight.

401
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:28,455
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

402
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:35,878
Councilor Behrs?

403
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:36,579
Yes.

404
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,320
Councilor Fevella?

405
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,620
Yes.

406
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,700
Vice President Knight?

407
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,040
Yes.

408
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,001
Councilor Marks?

409
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:41,421
Yes.

410
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:42,321
Councilor Morrell?

411
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:42,882
Yes.

412
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,062
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

413
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:46,343
President Kerrio?

414
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:46,663
Yes.

415
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:47,944
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

416
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:48,524
Motion passed.

417
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,052
Thank you very much.

418
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:51,912
Thank you.

419
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:57,216
Motions are as a resolution to one, three, four, six office by vice-president night.

420
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:02,259
We have so resolved that the Memphis city council requested DPW address the following items.

421
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,762
One sidewalk hole in front of Highland development on Winchester street and Albion street.

422
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:17,529
Two, deep pothole at third street and Bradbury across from Harris park baseball basketball court.

423
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:21,484
sidewalk trip hazard at 436 Riverside Avenue.

424
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:26,306
Four, sidewalk trip hazard and tree inspection at 32 Walker Street.

425
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:31,909
Five, bicycle frame attached to the pole on Bradley Road near the credit union.

426
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:33,669
Vice President Knight.

427
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,090
Mr. President, thank you very much.

428
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:46,315
As you can see, one might guess that opening day for Medford Little League has happened and I've been spending a lot of time down the fields and also a lot of time in our various neighborhoods in our community.

429
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,586
And through my travels, I have been approached by a variety of our residents here in the community requesting service requests.

430
00:33:53,946 --> 00:33:58,530
Some of these requests, I did direct the citizenry to go on to C-Click Fix.

431
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:03,915
Some of them I didn't, but you'll see some of these on C-Click Fix right now, Mr. President.

432
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:07,879
Sidewalk hole, you know, majority of them are public safety issues, trip hazards.

433
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:13,324
The bicycle frame attached to the pole on Bradley Road is something that I think should be addressed immediately.

434
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:14,605
It's been there for about, oh,

435
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:21,252
month and a half, Mr. President, it's been stripped down now to just the bicycle frame, no tires, no seat, no pedals.

436
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:27,077
It's just literally a frame of a bike attached to a pole, and it's been there for an extended period of time.

437
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:34,082
So I'm asking that these items be addressed by IDPW or the appropriate department to rectify the situation.

438
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:42,789
Sidewalk Hole in front of Highland Development is a trip hazard, Deep Pothole and 3rd Street in Bradbury across from Harris Park is a trip hazard as well as the

439
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,950
trip hazards on Riverside Avenue and Walter Street.

440
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,993
Riverside Avenue and Walter Street are the result of tree roots, Mr. President, uplifting the sidewalk.

441
00:34:51,753 --> 00:35:00,399
So I'd ask my council colleagues to support these measures and request that the DPW or the appropriate department take necessary impromptu action to rectify the situation.

442
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,541
Okay, any further questions?

443
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:07,924
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

444
00:35:08,464 --> 00:35:09,445
To collect, please call the roll.

445
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,520
Yes.

446
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:15,241
Councilor Falco.

447
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,142
Yes.

448
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:17,083
Vice president Knight.

449
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:17,663
Yes.

450
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:18,484
Councilor Marks.

451
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:19,004
Yes.

452
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:19,925
Councilor Morrell.

453
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:20,645
Yes.

454
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,587
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, president Caraballo.

455
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:25,809
Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent motion passes.

456
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:37,216
21347 offered by vice president Knight be it so resolved that the Memphis city council extend a deep and sincere congratulations to Rita Lennox on the momentous celebration of her 90th birthday.

457
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:37,997
Vice president Knight.

458
00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:40,003
Mr. President, thank you very much.

459
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,844
Rita Lennox is a lifelong Medford resident.

460
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,785
She resides in West Medford with her husband, Peter.

461
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:52,490
And there was one point in time when it could be argued that Rita was the person to call if you wanted to get anything done in the city of Medford.

462
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:59,514
If you called Rita Lennox and you put Rita Lennox on it, you better believe that Mike McGlynn was getting a phone call every single hour until it got taken care of.

463
00:35:59,554 --> 00:36:00,554
Rita's been a great person.

464
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:06,657
She's been someone who's been committed to her community, to her family, and most certainly committed to service, Mr. President.

465
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,674
She's been a lifelong resident in this community and because of her methods without a place.

466
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:18,278
And I just like to take this opportunity to wish her a happy 90th birthday on this momentous occasion.

467
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,239
She was surrounded by friends and family and was able to celebrate it wonderfully.

468
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:22,660
And I hope she has 90 moments.

469
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,521
I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

470
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:26,542
Second.

471
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:31,665
The motion by vice president seconded by councilor Falco council locks.

472
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:43,154
Rita Lennox has been a fixture in this community for a number of years, and Councilor Knight is absolutely correct.

473
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:50,316
Rita was very involved in the community and someone that was instrumental and volunteered our services for many years.

474
00:36:50,776 --> 00:37:01,519
I had the opportunity to work with Rita at the Registry of Deeds back some years ago, and indeed, she ran the Registry of Deeds as well, Mr. President.

475
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:05,760
So Rita, in whatever capacity, was always a leader and still is a leader.

476
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:10,099
and I wanna congratulate her reaching her 90th birthday, Mr. President.

477
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,160
Thank you.

478
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,222
So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Box.

479
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:17,903
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

480
00:37:21,265 --> 00:37:21,805
Councilor Beers.

481
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:22,645
Yes.

482
00:37:23,646 --> 00:37:24,326
Councilor Fevella.

483
00:37:24,346 --> 00:37:24,566
Yes.

484
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:25,547
Vice President Knight.

485
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:25,947
Yes.

486
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:26,728
Councilor Marks.

487
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:27,308
Yes.

488
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,128
Councilor Morrell.

489
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:28,749
Yes.

490
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,510
Councilor Scarpelli-Thompson, President Caravaglia.

491
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,431
Yes, six in favor, one absent, motion passes.

492
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:46,106
21348 offered by Vice President Rice, it's so resolved that the Memphis City Council extended Stephen's sincere congratulations to Nancy White on the momentous celebration of her 80th birthday.

493
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:47,547
Vice President Rice.

494
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:49,667
Mr. President, thank you very much.

495
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,188
Happy birthday to Nancy.

496
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:55,069
Nancy White has been a long-time resident of Memphis, very involved in the

497
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:58,827
the Massachusetts Democratic Party, the Medford Wooden City Committee.

498
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:06,433
But she was also a wonderful educator, Mr. President, worked in the Medford public schools for a number of years and touched the lives of many students, mine included.

499
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:15,860
So with that being said, Mr. President, Nancy White's someone that's really been a asset to our community, someone that has provided troubled youth with guidance.

500
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:20,504
She's been willing to dedicate her time for progressive values that we all share.

501
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:24,627
And she's someone that has truly made a difference in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

502
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:34,456
So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution, wishing Nancy a happy 80th birthday, and hope she had a great day.

503
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:35,116
Thank you.

504
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:36,457
Councilor Falco.

505
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:38,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

506
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:41,578
And I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

507
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:50,941
And I would also like to wish Nancy White a very happy birthday, as Councilor Knight stated, and have some very nice memories of Nancy.

508
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,602
When I was in the school committee,

509
00:38:53,678 --> 00:39:01,003
working in the school system, always helping out and always helping out with the method democratic board and sitting committee.

510
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:09,829
We choose a vice chair for the longest time and always ran a good meeting and very nice person and I just want to wish her a very happy birthday.

511
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:10,309
Thank you.

512
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,950
Thank you.

513
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,452
Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:17,274
I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on.

515
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,696
I don't know how he gets all the birthdays but

516
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:30,547
But truly, Nancy White, Mr. President, touched so many lives of students in this community for many, many decades.

517
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,949
She was a star worth within the school department.

518
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:41,853
I consider Nancy White someone that has always been behind the scenes and the person that makes everything happen.

519
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:45,295
You know, you always have the person out front that takes the credit.

520
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,817
But Nancy White, when it came to the school department, she was the one

521
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,444
That was behind the scenes, Mr. President, making sure the school department operated appropriately.

522
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:59,608
But with the Democratic Ward and City Committee, Nancy White was the one that put together all the meetings.

523
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,910
She was the one that sent out all the minutes.

524
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,632
She was the one that was really driving it for so many years.

525
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:11,297
And then you had a face of the committee, but we all knew where the work was taking place.

526
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:12,277
And that was Nancy White.

527
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:17,641
I want to congratulate her on her 80th birthday and wish her many, many more to come, Mr. President.

528
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:18,462
Thank you.

529
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,027
Councilor Best.

530
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,129
Thank you, Mr. President.

531
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:24,771
I also just want to say happy birthday to Nancy.

532
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:31,717
I knew Nancy for many years as part of the Medford Democratic City Committee and I would definitely agree with Councilor Marks.

533
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:35,601
She was the one pulling everyone together, making sure the meetings got done.

534
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:36,982
So happy birthday, Nancy.

535
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:39,496
Thank you, Councillor Bares.

536
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:52,880
And I, myself personally, want to thank, wish Nancy a happy birthday, both as a friend, an educator, and one of the driving forces behind the Democratic Party in the city of Metro, which many of us are involved in.

537
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,241
Again, Nancy, happy birthday, and I wish you many more.

538
00:40:56,841 --> 00:41:01,502
So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councillor Balco.

539
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,703
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

540
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:06,624
Councillor Bares.

541
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:07,284
Yes.

542
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:08,903
Councilor Tocco?

543
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:09,203
Yes.

544
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,144
Vice President Knight?

545
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:10,524
Yes.

546
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:11,305
Councilor Marks?

547
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:12,045
Yes.

548
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:12,965
Councilor Morrell?

549
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:13,546
Yes.

550
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,387
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio?

551
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,508
Yes, six in favor, one absent, motion passes.

552
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:32,015
21349, offered by Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the City of Memphis City Council request copies of the letters of appointments from incumbents holding the titles of city solicitor, director of human resources and diversity,

553
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:35,180
And Director of Community Development, Vice President Knight.

554
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,162
Mr. President, thank you very much.

555
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:45,628
This was a resolution that was derivative of the conversations that we recently had over the employee classifications to Committee of the Whole as we've had the past two weeks on Tuesday nights.

556
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:58,998
I'm asking that the administration provide us with copies of the letters of appointment for the incumbents holding the titles of City Solicitor, Director of Human Resources and Diversity, and Director of Community Development, and I guess that would be Energy and the Environment.

557
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:06,461
the administration in our earlier meeting and the meeting last week has indicated that they have these letters available.

558
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:12,066
They're a public document that I'm asking now that the council be provided them so that we can include them in our records, Mr. President.

559
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:18,371
As we begin our discussions for the budget, I think it'll be very interesting to see where these go with these positions.

560
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:26,358
But with that being said, it's something that I think is necessary for us if we're gonna move forward to be sure that we have all the documents in front of us to make a fully vetted and viable decision.

561
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:31,356
I know the motion by vice-president seconded by second.

562
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:33,816
Second by councilor Falcone, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

563
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:36,817
Councilor Bears.

564
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:37,757
Yes.

565
00:42:38,677 --> 00:42:39,258
Councilor Falcone.

566
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:39,538
Yes.

567
00:42:40,298 --> 00:42:40,998
Vice-president Knight.

568
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:41,738
Yes.

569
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:42,458
Councilor Marks.

570
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:42,898
Yes.

571
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:43,819
Councilor Morrell.

572
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:44,399
Yes.

573
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,039
Councilor Scarpelli.

574
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:47,319
Is absent.

575
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,020
President Kerrio.

576
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,240
Yes.

577
00:42:49,796 --> 00:42:50,457
motion passes.

578
00:42:50,677 --> 00:43:02,887
21350 offered by Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell being so resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Max Hennig on winning the inaugural Paul Nemzer book prize for his poetry collection, Good Harbour.

579
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:05,690
Councilor Morrell.

580
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:08,072
Thank you, Mr. President.

581
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:10,174
I'm going to defer to Councilor Beers to go first on this one.

582
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,556
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

583
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:13,557
Thank you, Mr. President.

584
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:20,683
purpose of this resolution is just to congratulate Max Heining, he's a longtime teacher at Medford High School.

585
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:40,609
He was my 10th grade English teacher, and a really active community member through Medford Brewing Company and now through his successful and award winning poetry so thank you to Max Heining, who I always want to call Mr. Heining, and I would like to ask the clerk to send a certificate of our congratulations.

586
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:41,369
Thank you.

587
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:45,817
Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:52,379
Yeah, I think echoing Councilor Behrs, I think it's important that we recognize our residents for their vast contribution to the arts.

589
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,581
And Max Heinegg is just one person doing this among many in our community.

590
00:43:56,621 --> 00:44:00,982
And I just want to read a few sentences from the award commendation.

591
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:12,526
So it says, Max Heinegg's Good Harbor is one of those rare collections of poems in which a confidence emerges almost immediately that we are in the hands of a poet who creates the sensation that life is writing itself.

592
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:19,310
It goes on from there, but I think if people can look that up, it's a great note on one of the artists in our community.

593
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,310
So I just want to extend my congratulations.

594
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:22,210
Thank you.

595
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,371
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

596
00:44:25,391 --> 00:44:27,051
Councilor Baxton.

597
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:27,892
Thank you, Mr. President.

598
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,752
I want to thank Councilor Beaz and Councilor Morrell for putting this on.

599
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:37,114
As they stated, Max Heine has been an outstanding teacher, exemplary teacher for a number of years.

600
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,015
He's a brewmaster and now a poet.

601
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:41,115
I never knew he was a poet.

602
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:47,740
And I'm thinking he may have got much of his inspiration from Method Eel to write some of his poetry.

603
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:53,565
So maybe I might try some Method Eel and maybe give me a little inspiration, Mr. President.

604
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:58,550
But I wanna thank him for all he does in this community, Mr. President.

605
00:44:58,890 --> 00:44:59,231
Thank you.

606
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,173
Thank you, Mr. President.

607
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:09,397
I want to also thank Councilor Morrell and Councilor Piz for bringing this forward and congratulating Max on his achievement.

608
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:18,284
As everyone has noted, Max is one of our very dedicated volunteers and a teacher in our community and we wish him well.

609
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:19,765
I just want to say congratulations.

610
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:20,586
Congratulations.

611
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:21,527
Thank you, Mr. President.

612
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:26,551
Myself, I want to thank Max for being a teacher and a businessman in the community.

613
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:29,493
And congratulations on this poetry collection, good hopper.

614
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,611
Nico, did you have your hand up?

615
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,633
Nico, did I see a hand up for you?

616
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:38,654
Okay, none.

617
00:45:38,934 --> 00:45:44,217
All right, on the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

618
00:45:45,057 --> 00:45:46,198
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

619
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:49,959
Councilor Behrs?

620
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:50,980
Yes.

621
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,461
Councilor Tocco?

622
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:52,721
Yes.

623
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:53,801
Vice President Knight?

624
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:54,382
Yes.

625
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:55,182
Councilor Marks?

626
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:55,822
Yes.

627
00:45:56,102 --> 00:45:56,663
Councilor Morrell?

628
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:57,203
Yes.

629
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,962
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio.

630
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:02,164
Yes, affirmative one absent motion passes.

631
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:05,526
21321351 offered by vice president.

632
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:11,350
Whereas I'm gonna ask that this matter be placed on the table till Councilor Scott Kelly's arrival.

633
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,892
I spoke to him earlier in the day after the agenda came out.

634
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:20,256
He's requested that if he wasn't able to make it here in time when it came up that I table it for an hour.

635
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:22,358
to give him an opportunity to speak on this matter.

636
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:31,920
Councilor Scott Pelli this evening is at the National Armed Society dinner, where his son, John, who's the president of the Medford National Sahana Society, he's giving the commencement speech.

637
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,001
So I think he's on his way to the council chambers as we speak, Mr. President.

638
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:40,241
So I'm asking to be laid on the table until such time as Councilor Scott Pelli is able to join us.

639
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:40,761
Second.

640
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:44,662
On the motion by Vice Mayor Slate to table this, seconded by Councilor Mox.

641
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:46,422
So clerk, please call the roll.

642
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:47,622
Councilor Behrs.

643
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:48,383
Yes.

644
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:50,063
Councilor Falcone.

645
00:46:50,223 --> 00:46:50,423
Yes.

646
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:52,794
Vice President Knight, Councilor Marks.

647
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:53,354
Yes.

648
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:54,335
Councilor Morrell.

649
00:46:54,735 --> 00:46:54,975
Yes.

650
00:46:55,936 --> 00:46:57,876
Councilor Scarpelli is absent, President Kerrio.

651
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:01,398
Six in the affirmative, one in the absent, motion passes.

652
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,499
21352 offered by Councilor Marks.

653
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:12,124
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council commend and congratulate long-time Memphis resident, Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney on his recent retirement from the Massachusetts State Police.

654
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:18,067
Lieutenant Richard Mahoney has shared with honor, integrity, and distinction the residents of Massachusetts for the past 34 years.

655
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:26,017
be it further resolved that Lieutenant Richard Mahoney receive a council accommodation, recognizing his dedication and commitment to all he served.

656
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:27,078
Councilor Marks.

657
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,579
Thank you, Mr. President.

658
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:47,230
I rise tonight to honor one of our very own, Mr. President, and that is Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney, a lifelong Method resident, someone that if you know him, Mr. President, you'll know that he loves this community.

659
00:47:48,334 --> 00:47:49,334
He loves his family.

660
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:58,616
And, you know, he's a gentleman that served with distinction for 34 years to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

661
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:09,138
He was a gentleman that served in very trying times, Mr President, and has had an unblemished career for 34 years.

662
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:16,060
I think that speaks volumes on the type of person that Rich Mahoney is, Mr President.

663
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,580
He finished his

664
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:22,870
illustrious career as detective lieutenant with the Massachusetts State Police.

665
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:32,276
Every day, Mr. President, going to work, putting his life on the line to protect and serve the residents of this commonwealth.

666
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:35,838
And he did it with honor and respect.

667
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:40,161
And I think that says a lot about his character, Mr. President.

668
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:46,665
Rich was also very highly respected by his peers.

669
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,165
And as he rose through the ranks, Mr. President, he got there through hard work and dedication.

670
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:58,088
And his commitment to this commonwealth, I believe, goes unmatched.

671
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:07,716
And in this day and age, you hear a lot about police, about defunding the police, about police this, police that.

672
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:13,601
And it's fair to say that Rich Mahoney is one of the 99.999%

673
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:26,198
of police officers that get up every day, serve the public, Mr. President, do a tremendous job, put their life on the line every day.

674
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:28,779
There's not many professions you can say that.

675
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,960
Police, fire, are a few that come to mind.

676
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,722
And that's every day, not knowing if you're gonna come home, Mr. President.

677
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:45,105
And, you know, I really believe that, you know, when our officers retire, Mr. President,

678
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:47,234
they shouldn't just go out with a thank you.

679
00:49:47,594 --> 00:49:51,877
They should go out with a warm welcome and thank you from the residents.

680
00:49:52,797 --> 00:50:03,303
And I wanna thank Detective Lieutenant Richard Mahoney on behalf of the residents of this community, on behalf of the residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

681
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:11,968
And I wanna also thank him, Mr. President, for being the family man he is, because with Rich, family comes first.

682
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,170
And I wanna thank him for all his years of dedication

683
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:26,826
and ask that the city clerk send a citation to honor his career on behalf of the Commonwealth and the residents of this community.

684
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:27,647
Thank you, Mr. President.

685
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:28,567
Thank you, Councilor.

686
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:31,369
Vice President Knight.

687
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:36,291
I certainly second Councilor Mark's motion and also his thoughts.

688
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:44,475
I don't know Richard personally, but anybody that's served on the Massachusetts State Police for 34 years and has rose to the rank of lieutenant is someone that's a by the book type of person.

689
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,812
who understands fairness, who understands what it means to be a public servant.

690
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:56,817
You don't last 34 years in the Massachusetts State Police and rise to the rank of lieutenant, unless you have that type of character and that type of integrity.

691
00:50:56,837 --> 00:51:02,880
I just wanted to echo Councilor Marks' sentiments and second the motion, Mr. President.

692
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,261
Thank you.

693
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:04,081
Councilor Falcone.

694
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,202
Thank you, Mr. President.

695
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:10,685
I'd also like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and also echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

696
00:51:11,684 --> 00:51:15,446
You know, being in law enforcement, it's not an easy job, especially now more than ever.

697
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:21,630
And you know, when you leave to go to work in the morning or whatever shift you're on, you don't know if you're coming back.

698
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:30,875
And to work to do that for 34 years is an amazing commitment, an amazing commitment.

699
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:36,698
And I just want to congratulate him on a long career, wish him well.

700
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:39,719
And I thank Council of Ops for bringing this forward.

701
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:41,793
Thank you.

702
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:48,916
Mr. President, I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention his lovely wife, Marianne.

703
00:51:50,097 --> 00:52:00,421
And Marianne's the one that got him up for work every day, combed his hair, laid out the clothes on the bed, laid out his uniform, and got him to work, Mr. President.

704
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:03,923
And I want to thank Marianne, Mr. President, as well.

705
00:52:04,463 --> 00:52:04,803
Thank you.

706
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:10,406
So on the motion by Council Member Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

707
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,400
Councilor Behrs.

708
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,181
Yes.

709
00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:16,022
Councilor Fevella.

710
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:16,282
Yes.

711
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:17,503
Vice President Knight.

712
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:18,403
Yes.

713
00:52:18,704 --> 00:52:19,304
Councilor Marks.

714
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,185
Yes.

715
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:21,065
Councilor Morrell.

716
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:21,745
Yes.

717
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,087
Councilor Scarpelli has just arrived.

718
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:28,349
Councilor Scarpelli, do you want to vote on this commendation for Lieutenant Mahoney?

719
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,830
Yes.

720
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:29,530
Thank you.

721
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:31,091
President Kerrio.

722
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:31,812
Yes.

723
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:39,877
Assembly affirmative, motion passes.

724
00:52:39,897 --> 00:52:42,158
2-1-3-5-3 offered by Councilor Marks.

725
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:54,565
Be it resolved that the city administration notify Memphis City Council, whether it is still involved with looking at exception reports as they relate to water and sewer bills.

726
00:52:54,785 --> 00:53:02,794
And if the administration still has the capability to run the exception reports or run count of water on behalf of the residents and homeowners of this community.

727
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,576
Councilor Mox.

728
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:06,938
Mr. President, I'll be brief on this.

729
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:14,182
This was what was brought up last week under community participation by former city councilor Robert Penta.

730
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,084
I think it speaks for itself.

731
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:34,895
We're asking for whether or not the city still looks at acceptor reports, which are reports that show a spike in the usage of water throughout the community so we can notify residents if they do have a leak within their home or on their property that they're unaware of, Mr. President.

732
00:53:35,305 --> 00:53:37,967
and being charged, so I move approval, Mr. President.

733
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:38,347
Second.

734
00:53:38,387 --> 00:53:41,549
All right, a motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco.

735
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:44,690
Good evening.

736
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:50,474
Pat, if you could put the mic on, on the podium.

737
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:52,635
Good evening, and name and address of the record, please.

738
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:55,216
Castaneda Andrew, Cushman Street.

739
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:57,458
I'm gonna- Is that it, Mr. Chair?

740
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:58,318
Yes, sir.

741
00:53:58,598 --> 00:53:58,918
Thank you.

742
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,421
Thanks, Councilor Mox, for bringing this on your agenda.

743
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:18,726
And I believe last week, Councilor Penta was right when he said back when we installed these meters in 2002, thereabouts, that as Councilor Penta says, they sold us a bill of sale.

744
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:20,347
It's more like a bill of goods.

745
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:32,352
I believe back then it was stated by the department heads in the water and Mr. Geer, that if there's an unusual increase in our water meters,

746
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:36,883
that we would be notified through the computer system.

747
00:54:38,123 --> 00:54:42,705
And I remember it like it was yesterday, even though it's probably 18 years ago.

748
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:54,130
So a friend of mine received a bill instead of the usual bill, it was like six times per bill.

749
00:54:55,471 --> 00:55:00,593
And she owns Bell Raviolis, it happened in her home.

750
00:55:01,573 --> 00:55:03,094
And she was very upset about it.

751
00:55:04,428 --> 00:55:12,893
I guess she used the bathroom downstairs in the cellar and went upstairs and probably didn't go back for two more months until she received the bill.

752
00:55:13,653 --> 00:55:15,754
Probably six times the usual bill.

753
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,896
And it's hard for her to make the steps.

754
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,657
So, very sad.

755
00:55:21,717 --> 00:55:25,419
She went to pay the bill or actually question it.

756
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,141
And I guess she just paid it, period.

757
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:30,442
As they say, it counts by city hall.

758
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:39,008
There is an abatement process for people that have water bills that have spiked.

759
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:45,892
All she has to do is ask for an abatement with the Water and Sewer Commission.

760
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:48,134
They will listen to her request.

761
00:55:49,174 --> 00:55:50,135
I'm glad to hear that.

762
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:59,500
So therefore, since the city has approximately $5 million in the so-called water fund account,

763
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:06,649
Basically, in my opinion, it's like an overcharge to all us rate payers.

764
00:56:08,149 --> 00:56:10,129
So therefore, the money's just sitting there.

765
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:22,332
Maybe I'm thinking outside the box that the city could figure it out or the city council to give us a one strike, one time only shot.

766
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:30,613
If it is increased by double and triple or better, that you could forgive it

767
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:33,566
through the $5 million overcharge fund.

768
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:47,329
Just a thought, if you want to take it on the committee as a whole, because sometimes you face City Hall, if you appeal it, you probably, maybe you don't have any requests after the fact.

769
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:49,790
So that's all I wanted to say.

770
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:54,871
You might want to consider something like that with the $5 million, but the commission, that's what you're hiring.

771
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:14,985
The Water and Soil Commission does have the authority to listen and to say they make, whether you have medical condition or a senior citizen or whatever you need, they have rules in place now for people that do have water problems and they do work with them to help them out of this situation.

772
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:17,447
So I do suggest you do that.

773
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:24,533
And again, they do help people out that do, if they have financial means they can't pay it, they do help them out.

774
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,547
It's nothing to do with me at the moment.

775
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:31,970
You can inform your friend just to apply for the abatement with the water source.

776
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,292
And they have a meeting and they can discuss it.

777
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:40,195
She completed a case there and they usually, she's maybe a senior and couldn't get down there to do it.

778
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:46,840
There's a lot of conditions where they are allowed to give them an abatement on the bill.

779
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:54,106
All right, because please urge you to do that to receive a bill that's like five or 10 or 20 times your usual.

780
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:57,690
That might hurt a lot of people who are having struggles in these times.

781
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,331
Thank you, sir.

782
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:00,533
Thank you, Mr President.

783
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:03,937
Uh, just if I could follow up.

784
00:58:03,957 --> 00:58:05,539
I appreciate Mr Castaneda.

785
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:09,363
He always brings reason to a conversation.

786
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:26,993
Mr. President, I think that was the whole, if we recall back so many years ago, as Mr. Castaneda mentioned some 18 years ago, the whole intent for this system was to draw out any exceptions that we have throughout the community.

787
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:35,695
And it's not that, you know, that we're waiting till something happens and then after the fact say, okay, we just throw money at it.

788
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:39,516
This was to be proactive and say, we're aware that this spike

789
00:58:40,205 --> 00:58:41,514
spikes within your account.

790
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:47,367
And there may be a leak because ultimately what happens is we don't just forgive a bill.

791
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:50,748
So even if someone gets an abatement, guess who's paying for that?

792
00:58:51,168 --> 00:58:53,809
It's the rest of the rate payers that are paying for that.

793
00:58:54,189 --> 00:59:09,272
So the whole logic behind this was to get these spikes ahead of time so we don't have to pay, whether it's through the surplus money, as Mr. Castaneda mentioned, over 5 million, or not approving the abatement and having the resident pay.

794
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:11,593
That was the whole anticipation.

795
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:15,434
And I think what was brought up by Councilor Penta was 100% correct.

796
00:59:15,774 --> 00:59:20,796
If that's a service that we pay for, we want to know, indeed, is someone looking at this daily?

797
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:27,138
If so, how many people have been notified in the last year regarding spikes in their water?

798
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:32,600
How many snowbirds may be in Florida and don't realize they have a leak for four or five months?

799
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,261
This is very costly.

800
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:41,243
And if we can work on behalf of the residents through this reporting, then I think we're obligated to do so, Mr. President.

801
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:43,629
and I appreciate Mr. Castaneda coming up.

802
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:44,930
Thank you, Councilor Maxwell.

803
00:59:46,472 --> 00:59:46,832
Thank you.

804
00:59:47,632 --> 00:59:53,757
On the motion by Councilor Maxwell, seconded by Councilor Scapello and Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

805
00:59:58,381 --> 00:59:59,041
Councilor Behrs.

806
01:00:00,242 --> 01:00:00,462
Yes.

807
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:01,823
Councilor Fevella.

808
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:02,024
Yes.

809
01:00:02,844 --> 01:00:03,505
Vice President Knight.

810
01:00:03,985 --> 01:00:04,185
Yes.

811
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:05,066
Councilor Marks.

812
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:05,546
Yes.

813
01:00:05,907 --> 01:00:06,507
Councilor Morrell.

814
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:07,208
Yes.

815
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:08,989
Yes.

816
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,150
Yes.

817
01:00:10,924 --> 01:00:12,065
7 affirmative motion passes.

818
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:27,080
2-1, 3-5-4 by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the administration report back to the Memphis City Council the status of the water meters systems in our community, including when and if these meters are being looked at for replacement.

819
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:27,741
Councilor Marks.

820
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:29,583
Thank you, Mr. President.

821
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:33,386
This was another issue that was brought up by Councilor Penter under

822
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:37,517
community participation last week.

823
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:44,482
We couldn't take a vote on it, Mr. President, because our new rules require that it appear on the following agenda for proper notification.

824
01:00:44,823 --> 01:00:46,184
So that's why it appears tonight.

825
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:49,706
Mr. President, I support this wholeheartedly.

826
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,990
I believe from what we were told that the current city administration

827
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,644
is actually looking at the life expectancy of our existing meters.

828
01:00:59,204 --> 01:01:14,498
As I spoke last week, we purchased meters back some 18 to 20 years ago because the city was estimating over 50%, 50% of our bills, water and sewer bills, were being estimated.

829
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:26,211
And that's not a way to operate a city, because your bill could either, you could be good and get a lower bill, or you could be on the other end where they're charging the extra of water that you're actually not using.

830
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:30,836
And the best way to do it, Mr. President, is to have an accurate and fair bill.

831
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,658
And that's why we went to new meters.

832
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:49,007
And we never want to go down that path again where we had hundreds, I think it was 750 in a year span of abatements that residents, 750 residents came forward and said there was a problem with their water and sewer bill, the way it was being tabulated.

833
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:51,368
And we never want to experience that again.

834
01:01:51,768 --> 01:02:01,594
So I'm hoping that the city administration moves forward with notifying this council on what the next steps are to look at our

835
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:06,660
aging water meters to make sure we never experienced what we did back some years ago.

836
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:07,900
Thank you.

837
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,821
Thank you.

838
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:15,783
On the motion by Councilmarks seconded by anyway, Council felt almost the correct is called the role.

839
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,844
Mr. President on that.

840
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:23,706
Vice President night, I think Councilor Penta did make some good points when he spoke last week.

841
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:25,187
When he got

842
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,575
to around the year 2015 or 16.

843
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:33,380
I think we started a little far back in time and then it made our way into the present day.

844
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:42,988
You know, but one of those things that he was speaking about that I was concerned about, really concerned about, was the inflow and infiltration.

845
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:45,610
And I think Consul Max has been an advocate for this for a long time.

846
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,793
I mean, he's been speaking on it for years now at this point.

847
01:02:48,853 --> 01:02:49,453
I mean, decades.

848
01:02:49,493 --> 01:02:51,655
I think it's been a decade at least that he's been speaking on this.

849
01:02:52,178 --> 01:03:00,765
And it's something that I think does warrant some discussion, or at least recommend some commentary from the Chairman of our Water and Sewer Commission, just to see what's going on.

850
01:03:00,785 --> 01:03:02,747
So I wholeheartedly support this resolution.

851
01:03:02,787 --> 01:03:05,449
I thank the Council for bringing it up.

852
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:13,215
You know, I think sometimes Councilor Penta does a great job giving us information and providing us with initiatives in the community.

853
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:14,937
And you know, sometimes

854
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:18,954
I don't think that, but in this one, I do think that this is something that we need to take a look at.

855
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:23,215
And I certainly think that it's a worthy cause, so I support the measure wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

856
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:24,815
Thank you.

857
01:03:25,095 --> 01:03:25,716
Mr. President.

858
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:26,376
Council Box.

859
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:29,096
I can't miss an opportunity to speak about INI.

860
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:32,177
And the council vice president's right.

861
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:36,938
It's been two decades that I've been speaking about inflow and infiltration.

862
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:39,299
And it's not a sexy issue.

863
01:03:40,379 --> 01:03:44,180
Underground, like I always say, out of sight, out of mind, unfortunately.

864
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:53,277
But Mr. President, over the years, we've talked dating back so many years ago that someday your water and sewer bill will be higher than your tax bill.

865
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:57,960
And we're approaching the point where it's getting in that realm.

866
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,001
It may not be that close, but it's getting in that realm.

867
01:04:01,322 --> 01:04:04,563
And residents will always say, how can we lower our water and sewer rate?

868
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:09,826
And there's really not many ways, Mr. President, other than looking at the infrastructure.

869
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,869
And INI is all it is, is water that's seeping.

870
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:22,633
This is rainwater that's seeping into the ground and then finding its way into our sewer system, through cracks, through holes and so forth.

871
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:36,840
That water, which is just rain runoff water, which typically goes into the Mystic River, now is going out to Deer Island and being treated as raw sewage at a great expense to the taxpayers and rate payers of this community.

872
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,961
Multi-million dollars a year.

873
01:04:39,684 --> 01:04:41,084
goes to INI.

874
01:04:41,104 --> 01:04:41,725
I lost check.

875
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:49,527
I think it was about 45 to 50% of INI in our community is through infiltration.

876
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,368
And it's a major concern.

877
01:04:52,668 --> 01:04:54,489
It's a major concern to the taxpayers.

878
01:04:54,809 --> 01:05:01,491
You hear very little talk about it, but it's happening every year and it's costing us, Mr. President, every year.

879
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:03,752
So I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing that up.

880
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:13,848
And I think these are the conversations that probably aren't going to be brought to us, but we have to keep on speaking about them, saying what's happening.

881
01:05:14,129 --> 01:05:18,632
And I have to say over the years, the city has made some headway on INI.

882
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:21,255
They reline pipes.

883
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:25,098
There's a system where you don't even have to dig up the pipe, you just reline it.

884
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,340
And it's a real cost effective

885
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:29,956
efficient way of relining our pipes.

886
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:39,478
There's another system, Mr. President, we have right now, we have catch basins, which are supposed to catch rain runoff water and send it out to the mystic.

887
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:43,139
These catch basins are hooked up to our sewer system.

888
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,620
So that we know every time it rains, it's going right into our sewer system.

889
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,341
And we have ways of indicating where these catch basins are.

890
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:55,782
They drop what they call a smoke bomb into the catch basin,

891
01:05:56,263 --> 01:06:00,125
And if it comes out the manhole cover, the sewer system, you know they're connected.

892
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:05,728
So we're aware of at least, last I heard was probably 10 to 12 of these catch basins.

893
01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:12,472
Every time it rains, you can imagine the gallons of water that are pouring into our sewer system and going out.

894
01:06:13,272 --> 01:06:18,915
Is it expensive to take these catch basins and reline them and make them go where they're supposed to?

895
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:20,136
Absolutely.

896
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,417
But is it worthwhile in the long run?

897
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:24,178
Absolutely, Mr. President.

898
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:25,559
So these are the issues I hope

899
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:29,285
We continue to discuss in our community on behalf of the ratepayer.

900
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:29,645
Thank you.

901
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:30,865
Thank you.

902
01:06:31,626 --> 01:06:36,668
On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco.

903
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:37,649
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

904
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:38,369
Councilor Behrs.

905
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,450
Yes.

906
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,211
Councilor Falco.

907
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:41,631
Yes.

908
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:42,631
Vice President Nye.

909
01:06:42,952 --> 01:06:43,252
Yes.

910
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:44,832
Yes.

911
01:06:46,113 --> 01:06:46,353
Yes.

912
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:48,074
Yes.

913
01:06:49,135 --> 01:06:49,295
Yes.

914
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:51,576
Seven affirmative motion passes.

915
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:53,677
21355 offered by Councilor Marks.

916
01:06:54,692 --> 01:07:02,693
be it resolved that the submission of the city budget to the city council procedure for approval, rejection or alteration be discussed.

917
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:03,374
Councilor Marks.

918
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:05,554
Thank you, Mr. President.

919
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:09,835
I put this on the agenda because our budget process is coming up soon.

920
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:22,457
And I wanna make sure that this council is aware of our role during the budget and aware of what we have as recourse

921
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,611
when the budget is presented to us.

922
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:41,421
And last week, Mr. President, I was told by an administrative staff that this council has a line item cut authority, which over the years, I guess, depending on the administration, I've been told otherwise.

923
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:42,642
I won't speak for my colleagues.

924
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:45,944
And I think we should set the record straight.

925
01:07:46,364 --> 01:07:48,185
I looked at chapter 44, section 32.

926
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:51,687
I looked at some old opinions

927
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,620
from former city solicitors.

928
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,381
I looked at a letter from the Department of Revenue that was submitted back in 2014.

929
01:07:58,301 --> 01:08:04,623
This council over the years, not many occasions, has offered cuts to the budget.

930
01:08:05,323 --> 01:08:21,707
I remember back some years ago, and this was what I referenced last week, there was a motion to cut the then assistant director of DPW, because we're in tough budget times, and the motion passed, and the administration decided

931
01:08:22,193 --> 01:08:26,795
not to make that line item cut, but cut somewhere else within the budget.

932
01:08:27,055 --> 01:08:36,438
There was a motion a while back to take money and cut the water and sewer budget, Mr. President, by over $600,000.

933
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,639
This was back in 2014.

934
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:51,563
And the council voted to cut 600,000 and use, if we remember, use the water and sewer surplus account, which you can only use it for two purposes,

935
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:55,199
One is to use it for infrastructure improvements.

936
01:08:55,539 --> 01:08:58,822
And the other one is to offset water and sewer costs and rates.

937
01:08:59,562 --> 01:09:01,964
So the council said, you have 5 million in an account.

938
01:09:02,324 --> 01:09:04,686
And I can't remember the exact dollar amount at the time.

939
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:06,608
Why do we keep on raising the rate?

940
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:13,333
So we thought within the budget that slashed this line item by 600,000, take it out of the enterprise account.

941
01:09:13,874 --> 01:09:17,056
The mayor at the time, Mayor McGlynn, didn't like that idea.

942
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:20,539
And he vetoed our cut, Mr. President,

943
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,753
And then we overrode the mayor's veto and that stood actually.

944
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:33,939
But I think it's so crucial now that we understand what our role is, Mr. President, and what our abilities are to make cuts.

945
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:44,487
And I ask that we either contact the Department of Revenue, or we ask for an opinion from the city solicitor, what our responsibilities are on the budget.

946
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,070
Do we just make bottom line cuts to departments?

947
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,345
Do we just make bottom line cuts in general?

948
01:09:53,586 --> 01:10:05,713
From my reading of the Department of Revenue in chapter 44 of the general laws, it states if we do make bottom line cuts, we also have to indicate where the cut, what lines will be cut.

949
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:09,956
So I think this would be very, you know, I've been on the council a lot of years.

950
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:16,920
When I received conflicting information, one administration saying you have zero authority over line items.

951
01:10:17,299 --> 01:10:22,321
And then another administration saying you have the ability to cut a line item in the last budget.

952
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,142
That's conflicting to me.

953
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,683
And at the very least, I think we need clarification.

954
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:31,565
So I would ask under your leadership, Mr. President, that we seek out that clarification.

955
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:46,851
And I would put it in the form of a motion that we ask the city solicitor what role the council has in the either approving, rejecting or cutting

956
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,732
line items within the city budget.

957
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:52,653
Thank you very much.

958
01:10:52,713 --> 01:10:54,294
And I agree with this.

959
01:10:54,314 --> 01:10:56,516
This is a very important thing with the budget coming up soon.

960
01:10:57,136 --> 01:11:07,362
I think this may be something we should discuss in our community the whole with the with the semester, and maybe the director of finance and and whoever else we deem necessary.

961
01:11:07,402 --> 01:11:12,125
So I'd like to get someone from the department or maybe somebody from the Department of Revenue

962
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:16,046
the Department of Local Services that joined in the meeting.

963
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:22,488
So I will make some calls tomorrow and see if we can arrange that very soon, sooner than later.

964
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:26,289
Any further discussion?

965
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:27,009
Vice President Knight.

966
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:34,371
I kind of think that Councilor Marks and Director Nunley are saying the wrong thing.

967
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:36,731
I mean, the same thing, not the wrong thing, the same thing.

968
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:39,072
I think that Director Nunley's

969
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:45,547
saying that we have the ability to reduce by department, but not necessarily line it.

970
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:52,273
So when I read her email and I look at the general block, I think what you're, what she's referring to is exactly what counsel Knox is saying.

971
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:53,834
And it's just really an interpretation issue.

972
01:11:54,535 --> 01:12:01,201
Um, you know, my understanding was that we didn't have the right to do line items, vetoes, and that's from the division of local services where

973
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:14,112
because our budget is presented to us by department for ordinary and personnel expenses, we have the right to cut the department saying we want to cut ordinary expenses by X or personnel expenses by Y and take that from the bottom line out of that department.

974
01:12:14,672 --> 01:12:22,815
And I think that the division of local services language, if you look at their briefer on it, it would say that the reason that they do that is because that would leave the

975
01:12:24,056 --> 01:12:31,940
If you didn't do it by department, it would leave the authority up to the mayor to determine where to make the cuts, and the council would, in essence, just be reducing the bottom line of the budget, but not focusing on the department.

976
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:38,843
And I think if we're going to take that steps, the way that we would have to do it is the way that was done in the past when it came to the assistant director at DPW's position.

977
01:12:39,183 --> 01:12:40,884
That was the proper and appropriate way to do it.

978
01:12:41,784 --> 01:12:51,108
So when it comes to the line item veto, I think that the finance director understands it the same way that we understand it, but she's just saying it differently.

979
01:12:51,806 --> 01:13:01,312
I may be saying it in a way that we're not necessarily interpreting it to be the same, but my discussions with her over the week seem to be in line right with what Councilor Moxley said.

980
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:07,456
So I'd be interested to have a committee of the whole as well, Councilor, President Caviello, because I think that this is something that needs to be done.

981
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:08,556
Thank you.

982
01:13:09,997 --> 01:13:13,299
Well, on the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Vice President Knight.

983
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:14,440
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

984
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:18,522
Councilor Behrs.

985
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:19,343
Yes.

986
01:13:20,323 --> 01:13:21,004
Councilor Fevella.

987
01:13:21,084 --> 01:13:21,204
Yes.

988
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:22,234
Vice President Knight?

989
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:22,675
Yes.

990
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:23,295
Councilor Marks?

991
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:23,735
Yes.

992
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:24,436
Councilor Morrell?

993
01:13:24,816 --> 01:13:25,036
Yes.

994
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:26,737
Councilor Scarpelli?

995
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:27,037
Yes.

996
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:27,897
President Kerrio?

997
01:13:27,957 --> 01:13:29,478
Yes, I move the affirmative, motion passes.

998
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:33,520
2-1-3-5-6, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

999
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:41,285
Be it resolved that the Traffic Commission re-evaluate the permit parking policy on Mystic Street off of High Street.

1000
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:42,525
Councilor Scarpelli.

1001
01:13:44,106 --> 01:13:44,386
Thank you.

1002
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:46,367
Thank you, Mr. President.

1003
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:58,941
I get into this resolution, I want to thank my colleagues and apologize for my absence in the meeting earlier and for being tidy for a couple of meetings.

1004
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:16,546
Sometimes family issues take precedent and my mom was going through a health crisis and my brother and sister and I are trying to do the best we can to make sure that she's in a good place and we're working through some health issues.

1005
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:24,822
Again, I appreciate the professionalism and the caring of my fellow counselors and understanding and giving me some leeway.

1006
01:14:24,842 --> 01:14:32,946
I apologize to my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford that I have been a little tardy and a little absent.

1007
01:14:32,986 --> 01:14:36,968
So be sure that I'm still involved with everything that's going on.

1008
01:14:37,468 --> 01:14:43,831
It's just that I'm doing it bedside and that's something mom loves to hear Council Mark say, Mr. President, Mr. President.

1009
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:46,261
That's when we know she's getting better.

1010
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:48,603
So I thank everyone for that.

1011
01:14:48,623 --> 01:14:50,645
So the resolution is very simple.

1012
01:14:50,725 --> 01:14:58,573
It's the residents from Mystic Street and High Street are really getting beaten up with their public parking.

1013
01:14:59,234 --> 01:15:07,943
And for what was intended for that area is to eliminate the illegal parking for non-residents to come in and, you know,

1014
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:21,477
and park in front in that neighborhood, we're seeing that park, Metro Republic parking is now going in and writing these outrageous tickets for the most outrageous reasons.

1015
01:15:21,737 --> 01:15:33,840
And for elderly neighbors in that area, if they're parking what is a supposedly a curb, but is not a curb, somewhere where they parked forever, that's just a level land.

1016
01:15:36,118 --> 01:15:40,281
they're getting ticketed for something simple as parking on a sidewalk.

1017
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:48,406
And so it just seems like they're trying to fill a quota and going out to those areas and really affecting that neighborhood in a negative way.

1018
01:15:48,466 --> 01:16:05,818
So I'd like to send a resolution to the parking commission, traffic commission, maybe to set up a meeting with the neighbors just so they can share some concerns and maybe invite them to the next traffic commission meeting that they can really, they can understand what's going on to maybe say,

1019
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:11,190
put in some changes in that in that area of Mystic Street.

1020
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:12,471
So thank you for your time.

1021
01:16:13,492 --> 01:16:14,132
Thank you.

1022
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:14,753
Vice President.

1023
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:19,456
On that, Mr. President, how long has Mystic Street been in public parking?

1024
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:25,121
I appreciate Councilmember Council Vice President, I bring this up.

1025
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:34,188
This is the confusion with the neighbors that public parking has now they, everybody should know that they can go into any neighborhood now.

1026
01:16:34,749 --> 01:16:34,869
And

1027
01:16:36,563 --> 01:16:54,870
They've been, you know, if you parked outside the driveway that you parked for many years and your back, your end is sticking out a little bit, they're ticketing you overnight for parking on the curb or, you know, even if they're ticketing for police action where a sticker might be expired.

1028
01:16:54,950 --> 01:17:00,192
So these are the things people don't realize that is still happening with public parking, so.

1029
01:17:01,503 --> 01:17:09,271
Like I said, if we can at least look at that neighborhood and if we have to go neighborhood to neighborhood, I think this is a going to, it'll be a bigger issue than it is.

1030
01:17:09,331 --> 01:17:22,285
I think this is just scratching the top and I'm glad that we heard the mayor talk about today in the early meeting that looking to bring in in house traffic and parking which

1031
01:17:23,036 --> 01:17:24,716
Um, I think it's a great idea.

1032
01:17:24,776 --> 01:17:28,517
It's something that council max worked on for years to make that come to fruition.

1033
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,898
So, um, but again, thank you.

1034
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:32,198
Council, uh, council night.

1035
01:17:32,278 --> 01:17:33,759
Sorry, Jim.

1036
01:17:33,799 --> 01:17:34,099
Thank you.

1037
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:35,239
Uh, council Scott Kelly.

1038
01:17:35,579 --> 01:17:40,720
Um, the reason I bring it up is because I'm thinking back now we've got a lot of construction going on high street right now.

1039
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:48,102
And it wasn't too long ago that, uh, several members of this council stood up and tried to secure some parking spots along that stretch of high street.

1040
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,852
when this construction project was going in.

1041
01:17:51,133 --> 01:18:06,784
And the response that we got from the administration was that the traffic engineer did a dashboard survey and feels as though there's adequate parking in that area for the residents, and that this would cause no disruption whatsoever.

1042
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:10,107
Now we're seeing the construction started, what, last Monday?

1043
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:18,133
And now Park Metro is in the neighborhood tagging all the secondary streets off of High Street, which leads me to believe that

1044
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:24,972
Maybe the dashboard survey that was conducted might not have been the most accurate assessment of the parking needs of the neighborhood.

1045
01:18:26,272 --> 01:18:28,272
But that horse is out of the barn, Mr. President.

1046
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:29,353
That project is underway.

1047
01:18:29,393 --> 01:18:33,074
We've accepted the funding, a million dollars from the state, and that project is underway.

1048
01:18:34,894 --> 01:18:35,934
A little bit about the project.

1049
01:18:37,075 --> 01:18:47,337
With the Eversource project that's going on along Winter Street, and the High Street project that's going on along High Street,

1050
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:59,920
Every street in between Winthrop and Hyde that run parallel to each other looks like a loading yard for a construction group, whether it be the Eversource project or the High Street project.

1051
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,442
There's just trucks parked all over every single neighborhood.

1052
01:19:03,482 --> 01:19:09,666
I mean, I drove down a street today, Mystic Street, the street that Councilor Scott Kelly is talking about, up on Mystic in front of Tile Park.

1053
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:12,488
And there was like a rig that took up

1054
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:14,674
19 parking spots, you know what I mean?

1055
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:16,695
All heavy equipment that was there all day long.

1056
01:19:17,976 --> 01:19:19,437
There has to be a better way, Mr. President.

1057
01:19:19,857 --> 01:19:27,842
You know, if we wanna put these improvements in, that's one thing, but can we do it in a way that's maybe a little bit less detrimental to the neighborhood?

1058
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:36,587
Maybe a little bit, you know, kinder to the eye, because right now, it seems like that winter street stretch, these residents are getting croaked.

1059
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:42,430
I mean, it's between the rotary, the Ebbersworth project, the water pipe replacement project,

1060
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:45,427
They've been under construction now for eight years.

1061
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,189
Eight years.

1062
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,852
So there has to be some relief in sight, Mr. President.

1063
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:51,635
I thank the council for bringing it up.

1064
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:55,980
And I'm hoping that the administration, as she said, hears it loud and clear.

1065
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,582
She hears the council loud and clear when we talk.

1066
01:19:57,622 --> 01:20:00,085
So I'm hoping that this makes it to the corner office.

1067
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:10,293
that, you know, we need to come up with a better plan when it comes to engineering and permitting, ground opening and construction projects that we need to come up with a better plan that doesn't impact the neighborhood so much.

1068
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:16,476
Because what I feel like is happening in this community is someone gets a permit from the engineering department, and then they can do whatever they want.

1069
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:20,899
They can dig wherever they want, park wherever they want, leave their equipment, their debris, their materials, wherever they want.

1070
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:23,740
And it's starting to take an effect, Mr. President.

1071
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,741
The weather's getting nicer.

1072
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:26,402
People are opening their windows.

1073
01:20:26,442 --> 01:20:27,722
People are spending more time outside.

1074
01:20:27,762 --> 01:20:29,183
This is what they want to see in their community.

1075
01:20:29,682 --> 01:20:31,943
I'm sure with that being said, I think the council will bring the measure forward.

1076
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:32,743
I support all of it.

1077
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:35,104
Mr. President.

1078
01:20:35,244 --> 01:20:39,866
If I can, I know that you triggered something, Councilor Knight, that I found fascinating.

1079
01:20:40,406 --> 01:20:55,992
So what we're seeing with the Winthrop Street project with Ebersource, this past week, driving back and forth to see my mom in Woburn, I go through Winchester and often get trapped by the construction workers.

1080
01:20:56,032 --> 01:20:57,133
What I found that's amazing is,

1081
01:20:57,974 --> 01:21:16,483
all of the construction trucks that are in Winchester drive all the way down, they pull into the T parking lot, and they park all of the utility trucks and all the apparatus for the construction in that parking lot on a daily basis.

1082
01:21:17,363 --> 01:21:26,488
But Councilor Knight says in Medford, they just leave all their trucks and their apparatus and their metal plates

1083
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,043
that we're going to be able to get that.

1084
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,884
Cones and everything up and down with the tree.

1085
01:21:30,504 --> 01:21:36,786
So I think that you know that brings up bring us a huge point that you know to mend the paper that we asked again.

1086
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:41,468
That ever source looks into cleaning up that area.

1087
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:46,229
With eliminating all of the, um, debris.

1088
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,430
Uh and machinery.

1089
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:50,371
That deals with this construction.

1090
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:50,691
So again,

1091
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:58,949
I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Knight.

1092
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:13,993
If you wouldn't mind a further amendment, Councilor Scarpelli, I'd also like to ask that the city engineer and traffic engineer try to determine a lot where potentially we could do the same thing that Winchester's doing.

1093
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:21,934
Councilor Baird, if I can answer that for you, the construction company runs a lot in Midford currently.

1094
01:22:22,394 --> 01:22:25,195
They do have a lot in Midford where they do park their trucks.

1095
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:27,799
So they should be driving this, not that far.

1096
01:22:28,059 --> 01:22:30,821
They should be driving the trucks back there.

1097
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:31,441
I agree with that.

1098
01:22:31,462 --> 01:22:35,185
I had one further comment, Mr. President.

1099
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:36,185
Yes.

1100
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:45,533
Have you received any update from the city engineer or Eversource as to expediting the Eversource project as we discussed several weeks ago?

1101
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:52,259
We have not, I think it was up to the police chief because Eversource wanted three crews.

1102
01:22:52,899 --> 01:23:03,121
And I think the chief has told them that they don't have the manpower to put three crews of policemen on the three crews that Eversource is requesting.

1103
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:07,162
And it's still, I know that we had asked that they try to come to an agreement.

1104
01:23:09,242 --> 01:23:12,022
I only see one crew working at a time.

1105
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:15,063
And if I could put a comment on this,

1106
01:23:15,613 --> 01:23:17,854
I want to thank Councilor Scott Perry for bringing this up.

1107
01:23:17,894 --> 01:23:19,095
That's my neighborhood where I live.

1108
01:23:20,135 --> 01:23:30,799
They've been working there for the last two weeks, and they're parking cars, trucks on both ends, and other side streets, and they leave them all night, and in the school parking lot.

1109
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:35,561
And if you live on Mystic Street, there's very few sidewalks there.

1110
01:23:36,062 --> 01:23:39,263
There's only maybe one or two sidewalks, mostly all grass lot.

1111
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:40,413
and things.

1112
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:44,694
So it's a shame that they just continue to do whatever they want.

1113
01:23:45,074 --> 01:23:52,095
And what's happening also is they're directing the Shetland High Street down at different points and just sending it through the neighborhoods.

1114
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:57,836
And now these guys are rolling through neighborhoods and just not even paying attention to the law.

1115
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:07,338
And if I could say one more thing on what Councilor Scott probably brought up about the construction between Method and Winchester, I'm appalled that they're using our cemetery

1116
01:24:07,937 --> 01:24:10,837
to lay down all those plates and ruin the grass.

1117
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:16,078
And I'd like to amend this paper that those plates be removed immediately and the grass be replaced.

1118
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:18,639
Mr. President.

1119
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:19,879
Should be ashamed of themselves.

1120
01:24:20,019 --> 01:24:20,459
Absolutely.

1121
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:22,459
Councilor Tonko.

1122
01:24:22,499 --> 01:24:23,340
Thank you, Mr. President.

1123
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:30,441
I also want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward and Councilor Knight for mentioning the Eversource project.

1124
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:37,422
If I could amend the paper further to specifically look at, I believe it is at the end of Lorraine Road, there was a piece of

1125
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,768
construction equipment that has been there.

1126
01:24:40,228 --> 01:24:54,873
I know it was there pretty much for like the past couple of weeks that they park it there on the street after hours, which is completely against the agreement that we struck with them when this went into effect, this construction project many years ago.

1127
01:24:55,913 --> 01:25:00,454
From what I remember, there was supposed to be no construction equipment on the road after hours.

1128
01:25:01,035 --> 01:25:01,995
That has been violated.

1129
01:25:02,035 --> 01:25:04,996
So if we could, if I could please amend the paper

1130
01:25:05,969 --> 01:25:08,952
ask specifically why that piece of equipment is there.

1131
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,114
And I also thank you for bringing up the point about the metal plates.

1132
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:15,157
The metal plates have been there for a long time.

1133
01:25:15,797 --> 01:25:19,380
And I believe we inquired about them many times and they still haven't removed them.

1134
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,282
So I thank you for adding that amendment.

1135
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:25,626
And I look forward to hearing a response soon from Eversource.

1136
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:26,046
Thank you.

1137
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:27,187
Thank you.

1138
01:25:27,227 --> 01:25:28,168
On that point, Mr. President, thank you.

1139
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:38,681
I do believe when the council at first met with representatives from the city administration in ever so us at the suggestion of Council of marks.

1140
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:49,452
One of the items that came up was that as a condition of permitting, they not leave equipment materials, or use city property for state.

1141
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:53,402
and that they agreed that they were going to take everything at the end of the day and get it out of there.

1142
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:56,426
The trucks weren't going to travel alone if they weren't a licensed vehicle.

1143
01:25:56,446 --> 01:26:08,802
The backhoes and excavators were going to be escorted with a truck in front of it and behind it so that no one would get hurt because we remember what happened in Mississippi and Doreen and one of our crossing guys as well I believe right down in West Memphis Square where they got hit.

1144
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:23,098
during a construction project, when they were doing some work down there, I believe it was the Complete Streets Project, Mr. President of the Brooks School, where two residents were struck by construction vehicles because they didn't have proper safety protocols in place.

1145
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:27,720
So then I believe the Eversource project was put out to bid, and I think Feeney Construction got it, right?

1146
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,281
The Feeney brother construction firm got it?

1147
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:30,442
McCourt.

1148
01:26:31,122 --> 01:26:36,685
And then Feeney backed out of the bid, and then it ended up getting awarded to McCourt.

1149
01:26:36,745 --> 01:26:38,626
But the discussions that we had initially

1150
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,513
I think we're all with Feeney brothers.

1151
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:52,738
And I'm wondering if those restrictions and requirements that the council asked me to put in place on the permits carried over when the entity that was performing the work had changed.

1152
01:26:56,599 --> 01:26:57,100
Councilor Marks.

1153
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,240
Thank you, Mr. President.

1154
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:03,142
I want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for putting this on.

1155
01:27:03,242 --> 01:27:04,743
He's 100% right on all these issues.

1156
01:27:05,563 --> 01:27:07,404
Council Vice President Knight is correct.

1157
01:27:08,197 --> 01:27:12,700
We put a laundry list of conditions and the staging I think was your condition.

1158
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,603
I remember you speaking about having a staging area set up so they can put the equipment in trucks.

1159
01:27:19,603 --> 01:27:26,227
I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we find out who the clerk of the work is on behalf of the city of Memphis.

1160
01:27:26,947 --> 01:27:35,892
We also should be asking this person if they're adhering to all the conditions, because let's be quite honest, I'm not looking and I'm not on that job site every day.

1161
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,281
to make sure that they're adhering to all these.

1162
01:27:38,602 --> 01:27:43,047
But clearly, if you take a ride by, you're seeing the equipment left overnight.

1163
01:27:43,588 --> 01:27:45,730
Clearly, I forget who brought it up last week.

1164
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:54,220
I can't remember if it was Councilor Beers or Councilor Scott Pelly about sweeping after every day's work.

1165
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:59,237
And we were notified and then the Councilor Falcone, I apologize.

1166
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:03,820
And these things aren't happening, Mr. President.

1167
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:09,423
When we also discussed, we made a recommendation about having the three crews be put back.

1168
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:16,886
When you have the area residents on Winthrop Street reaching out saying, we've already had to put up with this for the last year and a half, two years.

1169
01:28:17,227 --> 01:28:19,888
And if you want to extend the project,

1170
01:28:20,222 --> 01:28:24,185
by not having enough crews, that just makes my life more miserable.

1171
01:28:24,685 --> 01:28:26,406
So we're already hearing this from residents.

1172
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:29,548
So it's unacceptable for the chief, Mr. President.

1173
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:31,770
And if he was on the line, I'd say it right to his face.

1174
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:41,716
It's unacceptable that the chief unilaterally is going to make a decision to slow down a project that we've been working on for the past five years, Mr. President.

1175
01:28:42,177 --> 01:28:43,838
And that's impacting residents now.

1176
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:45,599
It's unacceptable.

1177
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:49,028
unless he can tell me it's a public safety concern.

1178
01:28:49,368 --> 01:28:55,189
If you can't get enough offices on the detail, Mr. President, go outside the community.

1179
01:28:55,449 --> 01:28:56,650
They do it every day.

1180
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:02,111
Go outside the community, find some offices, Mr. President, that want to fill the detail.

1181
01:29:02,691 --> 01:29:07,973
But to slow down a project of this magnitude and have residents put up with this, it's unacceptable.

1182
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:09,633
It's extremely unacceptable.

1183
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:21,730
So I agree with Council Vice President Knight, we should find out what that laundry list of conditions are from the Clerk of the Works, find out who the Clerk of the Works is, first of all, and have a discussion regarding that.

1184
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:35,034
Regarding the parking program, Mr. President, I believe the parameters within Park Method, their contract only states that they can operate on resident permit parking streets.

1185
01:29:35,594 --> 01:29:39,375
They cannot operate outside of that contract.

1186
01:29:39,976 --> 01:29:57,440
So if indeed they are going around giving out tickets on non-resident parking, permit parking streets, then we should be notified of that and find out when this change took place, why it took place, Mr. President, and maybe this was their decision and they want to increase their revenue.

1187
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,280
I don't know, but that's not the way we should operate.

1188
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,241
If we have a signed contract, we should operate within the four walls of the contract.

1189
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:09,742
And that's my last impression of that contract, that it was only on resident,

1190
01:30:10,088 --> 01:30:11,189
permanent parking streets.

1191
01:30:11,869 --> 01:30:12,909
Thank you, Mr. President.

1192
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:27,397
So on the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Behrs, as amended by Councilor Kerrio, and as amended by Councilor Falco.

1193
01:30:27,937 --> 01:30:29,718
Mr. Clerk, you have all those amendments, correct?

1194
01:30:30,538 --> 01:30:31,779
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1195
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:33,260

Vice President Knight?

1200
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:37,802
Yes.

1201
01:30:38,022 --> 01:30:38,562
Councilor Marks?

1202
01:30:38,702 --> 01:30:38,963
Yes.

1203
01:30:40,284 --> 01:30:40,544
Yes.

1204
01:30:41,404 --> 01:30:42,165
Councilor Scarpelli.

1205
01:30:42,245 --> 01:30:42,465
Yes.

1206
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:43,705
President Kerrio.

1207
01:30:43,745 --> 01:30:43,905
Yes.

1208
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:52,848
I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

1209
01:30:52,928 --> 01:31:00,170
The motion by Vice President Bates to take paper 21351 off the table.

1210
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:04,091
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1211
01:31:06,892 --> 01:31:07,492
Councilor Behrs.

1212
01:31:07,952 --> 01:31:08,152
Yes.

1213
01:31:09,103 --> 01:31:09,764
Councilor Fevella.

1214
01:31:10,944 --> 01:31:13,006
Vice-president.

1215
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:13,727
Yes.

1216
01:31:14,647 --> 01:31:14,887
Yes.

1217
01:31:16,869 --> 01:31:17,129
Yes.

1218
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,650
Yes.

1219
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,612
70 affirmative motion passes.

1220
01:31:21,813 --> 01:31:23,854
21351 offered by vice-president Knight.

1221
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:37,525
Whereas the voice of our city's youth has been restricted throughout COVID-19 pandemic end, whereas the youth in the city of Bedford represent not only our future, but our present ends, whereas our youth

1222
01:31:37,862 --> 01:31:46,104
deserve every opportunity to flourish and be provided with the resources and services necessary to meet the challenges and problems they face.

1223
01:31:46,664 --> 01:32:06,770
Be it so ordered that the Memphis City Council adopt the provisions of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40, Section 80, enabling the establishment of a youth commission for the purpose of carrying out the programs which may be designed or established to meet the opportunities, challenges, and problems of youth in the city of Memphis, and be it resolved

1224
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:13,540
The Memphis City Council requests that the city solicitor provide to Memphis City Council with a draft ordinance.

1225
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,842
The language of section 8E can be found below for the following reference purposes.

1226
01:32:18,902 --> 01:32:21,683
Section 8E, a city- Mr. President, you don't have to get into that.

1227
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:22,344
I'm sorry?

1228
01:32:23,224 --> 01:32:25,805
I have it all highlighted out so I can read it for you if you'd like.

1229
01:32:25,845 --> 01:32:26,486
I'll read it.

1230
01:32:26,586 --> 01:32:36,490
A city or town which accepts this section may establish a youth commission, herein I recall the commission, the purpose of carrying out programs which may be designed to establish, meet the opportunities, challenges, and problems of youth

1231
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:44,500
of said city, town in conjunction with any similar or related programs of any agency of the Commonwealth or any agency of the federal government.

It shall file a name report, which shall be printed in the case of the towns in the annual town report.

1242
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:45,219
Commission is first established, the terms of the members shall be for one, two, or three years, so arranged that the terms of approximately one-third of the members will expire each year, and their successors shall be appointed for a term of three years each.

1243
01:33:45,639 --> 01:34:02,090
Any member of the commission so appointed may, after public meeting if requested, be removed for cause by the vacancy occurring otherwise by the expiration of a term, and the city or town shall be filled for the unexpired term

1244
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:04,182
in the same manner as the original appointment.

1245
01:34:04,783 --> 01:34:21,707
Said commission may receive gifts of property, both real and personal, in the name of the city and town, subject to the approval of the city council, and the city council, where the selectmen in the town, such gifts managed and controlled by the commission for purposes of this selection.

1246
01:34:22,607 --> 01:34:23,407
Vice President Knight.

1247
01:34:23,647 --> 01:34:24,948
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1248
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,728
So what this paper is, is it's a request.

1249
01:34:27,165 --> 01:34:33,328
for the city council to adopt a local auction provided by the Massachusetts state legislature to establish a youth commission.

1250
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:38,350
And I wouldn't expect the council to adopt the provisions of chapter 40, section 80 this evening.

1251
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:42,052
I'd be happy to send this to a committee in the hall to be further discussed with the city solicitor.

1252
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:46,194
However, Mr. President, the intent of this is to give the youth in our community a voice.

1253
01:34:48,895 --> 01:34:55,438
We have commissions for everything, but we don't have a commission for probably the most valuable asset in this community, our youth.

1254
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,521
So with that being said, I think this is a step in the right direction, Mr. President.

1255
01:34:59,641 --> 01:35:01,202
I'm looking at the language that you just read.

1256
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:03,383
I appreciate you going through that.

1257
01:35:04,544 --> 01:35:13,770
Ultimately, what this would do is establish a commission from not less than three and not more than 21 persons that serve for a term of three years, appointed by the mayor subject to the provisions of the charter.

1258
01:35:14,771 --> 01:35:25,037
The city council can also create an ordinance that will go along with that, that would outline the defined parameters as to who's eligible to serve, similar to many of the other ordinances this council has passed.

1259
01:35:25,735 --> 01:35:29,297
relative to the creation or establishment of boards and commissions.

1260
01:35:29,317 --> 01:35:31,738
So with that being said, Mr. President, this will be a statutory commission.

1261
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:41,003
It's something that I think is necessary in this community, especially based on the high levels of isolation that you have seen across Medford over the past year.

1262
01:35:41,043 --> 01:35:43,525
Just finally, we're finally getting out to the ball fields.

1263
01:35:44,025 --> 01:35:47,427
We're finally getting out of the house with the vaccination moving along in the right direction.

1264
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:54,633
But I think it's important, Mr. President, that we create a mechanism for us to actually hear directly from our youth and don't let them be a voice.

1265
01:35:55,333 --> 01:36:00,256
We've seen what great work the CCSR has done up at the high school.

1266
01:36:00,897 --> 01:36:06,541
Great work it's done in getting youth engaged in the government processing and getting them to be civically responsible.

1267
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:17,228
And I think that this is just adding to that, Mr. President, to step in the right direction for us to continue to build upon the many successes that we've already had in engaging our youth and getting them to be involved civically.

1268
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:25,988
So in looking at this, Mr. President, I think it's a great opportunity for us to move forward and create something that could make a difference here in the city of Michigan.

1269
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:27,849
So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.

1270
01:36:27,889 --> 01:36:29,410
I asked my council colleagues to support this.

1271
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:42,338
The motion will be to send it to a committee of the whole for further review and discussion and for us to also ask the city solicitor to be present so that if it is the council's intent to move forward with this, she can draft a ordinance that would support it.

1272
01:36:42,978 --> 01:36:47,842
With that being said, I would arrest my case, Mr. President referred to before the councilor, Scott Pelley.

1273
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:50,484
Councilor Scott Pelley.

1274
01:36:50,544 --> 01:36:51,524
Thank you, Mr. President.

1275
01:36:51,604 --> 01:37:12,680
And what an unbelievable resolution because it's funny because I've been searching and trying to figure out in our subcommittee with recreation youth and what we can do to try to have this city council step forward to give the youth their voice in a way that they can be heard.

1276
01:37:13,473 --> 01:37:37,962
And with today's social justice issues and the outcry of our students and children in our community, the city truly doesn't allow an avenue where they can come to this forum or have an avenue with this forum in the city side to really express their concerns, their issues and their wishes.

1277
01:37:39,703 --> 01:37:42,984
Councilor Knight, typical Councilor Knight,

1278
01:37:44,244 --> 01:37:56,552
studies every day, looks at what every single community does, finds what best fits the city of Medford and how we can help our constituents and our most important constituents, our children.

1279
01:37:57,173 --> 01:38:06,019
So I wanna applaud you again for finding this topic to push forward a very important agenda.

1280
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:12,023
I remember when I first started in Somerville, we had set up a recreation commission.

1281
01:38:13,017 --> 01:38:30,582
a commission that really focuses on doing some fundraising through the city with the recreation department that would allow kids that couldn't afford different sports or different participation fees for programs and made sure everybody had an opportunity to participate.

1282
01:38:31,522 --> 01:38:33,323
Not only that, they work together.

1283
01:38:33,403 --> 01:38:35,563
One of my first years there, I thought was amazing.

1284
01:38:36,223 --> 01:38:41,685
We were having some serious issues in Somerville with some social justice issues and some suicide issues.

1285
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:55,745
And they worked together with the school department and the commission and Tina Palman to have a round table forum for our youth to come out and speak of what they wanted.

1286
01:38:55,765 --> 01:39:03,489
And to be honest with you, it's one of the reasons why I love my position in Somerville as a program developer where my door's open.

1287
01:39:03,609 --> 01:39:11,552
I can't tell you how many times a young man, a young lady came to my door and sat down in front of me in my office and said,

1288
01:39:12,862 --> 01:39:15,944
you know, coach, I really want to do this now.

1289
01:39:16,764 --> 01:39:41,498
What was important is the typical recreation people think of what's traditionally recreation, sports, you know, games, activities, what came out of that, those conversations and having the ability to have a commission, our kids that needed other outlets, whether it be music, whether it be arts, whether it be band, whether it be, you know, um,

1290
01:39:43,115 --> 01:39:48,458
different social issues and having different type of clubs arranged through our commission.

1291
01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:53,600
So this is something our community needs.

1292
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:59,123
This is something that Councilor Knight said, did his homework.

1293
01:39:59,563 --> 01:40:04,646
This is where we can put people that are invested in our youth and want to work together.

1294
01:40:05,206 --> 01:40:08,248
And I'll tell you what, there's 100,000 fundraisers that go out there,

1295
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:15,308
Something simple as having a commission that works together that will hold a golf tournament.

1296
01:40:15,808 --> 01:40:17,949
This is what we did in Somerville, held a golf tournament.

1297
01:40:18,849 --> 01:40:20,129
Then they did a road race.

1298
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:29,952
And not only did they bring the community out, they raised valuable funds for kids at risk or youth that wanted to do something different.

1299
01:40:31,012 --> 01:40:33,553
And there was never a no.

1300
01:40:33,853 --> 01:40:36,253
It was always an avenue to do something positive.

1301
01:40:36,273 --> 01:40:39,214
In today's climate, where our kids really need a voice,

1302
01:40:40,392 --> 01:40:51,616
And, you know, I'm so glad that they have the, you know, the teachers to reach out to and the CCSR, because I think, you know, our advisors have done an amazing job.

1303
01:40:52,056 --> 01:41:08,161
But this is a piece where if we sat in a round table, when we talked about race issues in our community, one of the things that came out of those meetings is really putting our foot forward and really putting things into action.

1304
01:41:08,858 --> 01:41:16,765
You know, we talked earlier about the diversity director, and I think everybody says we need that as a full-time position, and we all support that.

1305
01:41:17,326 --> 01:41:22,270
And I'm glad to see my councilors stood strong with that to make sure that's a standalone program.

1306
01:41:22,691 --> 01:41:31,579
You look at something Councilor Knight just brought up with the commission, these are the types of initiatives that really lend to what people are asking for.

1307
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:34,482
So I know I'm a little winded, but I'm really passionate about this.

1308
01:41:35,145 --> 01:41:36,406
This is what I do in my life.

1309
01:41:36,686 --> 01:41:43,169
I wanna see kids succeed and find avenues to help them succeed.

1310
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:48,912
And Councilor Knight, again, one week it's Councilor Mox, another week it's yourself.

1311
01:41:48,992 --> 01:41:55,055
And I appreciate your commitment to this community and your professionalism when it comes to this committee.

1312
01:41:56,436 --> 01:42:01,799
This is spot on and I second the motion and love to see this move forward.

1313
01:42:01,839 --> 01:42:02,259
So thank you.

1314
01:42:05,001 --> 01:42:05,281
Thank you.

1315
01:42:05,301 --> 01:42:11,484
I actually saw Councilor Morrell, so I'm happy to defer to her.

1316
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:12,745
Thank you, Mr. President.

1317
01:42:12,765 --> 01:42:16,407
I think Councilor Baird is first, and I'll just go for the sake of being quick.

1318
01:42:16,707 --> 01:42:19,588
I thank Vice President Knight for raising this.

1319
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:23,750
I think this is a great opportunity for the youth of Medford and really for the city of Medford itself.

1320
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:26,592
And I agree with what's been said that the students in CCSR

1321
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:35,703
do such great work and are so engaged and have come before the council many times with many great ideas that they've really pushed for and presented in such a great way.

1322
01:42:36,404 --> 01:42:42,106
So I'd expect nothing less than them and the rest of our youth in the city who might want to take part in this.

1323
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:53,351
And I would hope that this commission can really reflect the diversity of the city, which is something that I know is also hope for the Gender Equity Commission that has been in the works for some two years now.

1324
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:56,073
So I would love to see both of those come to fruition.

1325
01:42:56,433 --> 01:42:56,673
Thank you.

1326
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:58,695
What's the best?

1327
01:42:59,436 --> 01:43:00,696
Thank you, Mr. President.

1328
01:43:01,197 --> 01:43:09,662
I really appreciate Vice President Knight bringing this forward and what Councilor Scarpelli said, and I think it's a great way to link the great work that's being done in our schools.

1329
01:43:10,466 --> 01:43:18,516
with the city government and hopefully, you know, I think these students actually have some policy ideas that hopefully we could consider as well.

1330
01:43:18,936 --> 01:43:20,518
But I did also want to lift up.

1331
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:27,507
I would hope that we can advance the Gender Equity Commission promptly as well alongside the Youth Commission.

1332
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:30,030
And I will put a plug in for

1333
01:43:30,682 --> 01:43:36,726
the pilot commission on payments in lieu of taxes that I proposed last January.

1334
01:43:37,147 --> 01:43:40,749
I think all of these commissions are worthy efforts that would really benefit the city.

1335
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:44,032
Thank you.

1336
01:43:46,013 --> 01:43:46,794
Thank you, Mr. President.

1337
01:43:46,814 --> 01:43:49,436
I also want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

1338
01:43:50,136 --> 01:43:52,978
This is a key resolution and Councilor Scott Pele you're right.

1339
01:43:53,098 --> 01:43:55,380
It gives the youth of our community a voice.

1340
01:43:55,991 --> 01:43:57,011
And that's really important.

1341
01:43:57,051 --> 01:44:05,873
If you take a look at CCSR, remember when that first came about when we were on the school committee, that program has grown tremendously throughout the years.

1342
01:44:07,033 --> 01:44:15,375
And you look at the good works that the students have been doing throughout the years, the programs, the things that they've come to propose to us with regards to ordinances and whatnot.

1343
01:44:16,035 --> 01:44:22,056
And it's a great way for them to be involved in public service and giving back to the community.

1344
01:44:22,617 --> 01:44:24,637
So I support this a hundred percent.

1345
01:44:25,117 --> 01:44:27,819
I look forward to discussing this further in committee the whole.

1346
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:33,023
Vice President Knight, I thank you for bringing this forward and I would also second the resolution.

1347
01:44:33,063 --> 01:44:33,363
Thank you.

1348
01:44:34,524 --> 01:44:37,486
Councilor Marks.

1349
01:44:37,566 --> 01:44:38,427
Thank you, Mr. President.

1350
01:44:38,447 --> 01:44:46,493
I wanna thank Council Vice President Knight for bringing this up and Councilor Scott Kelly for his passion on this issue.

1351
01:44:46,533 --> 01:44:52,137
He's been dealing with the youth of our community for many decades and I think has his finger on the pulse

1352
01:44:53,362 --> 01:45:00,104
You know, anytime you can expand the seat at the table where decisions are being made, I think is a positive step.

1353
01:45:00,564 --> 01:45:07,586
And to have youth involved in decision making, I think is a very positive step in this community.

1354
01:45:08,527 --> 01:45:16,929
I remember the days back some years ago, Mr. President, the council, under the leadership of the president of the council, would allow members to invite

1355
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:45,598
a business owner behind the reel, invite a student behind the reel, invite any one of your choice per week, Mr. President, and they would sit right next to you and they would have input, naturally they didn't have a vote, but they would have input during the meeting and be able to discuss and give input about how this may impact their business or impact their life or impact their family or whatever it might be, Mr. President,

1356
01:45:45,878 --> 01:45:54,100
And I just thought it was a great way of all too often you hear people saying that they don't have a seat at the table or they're left out of the process.

1357
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:58,082
And that was just a nice way of including members of the community.

1358
01:45:58,402 --> 01:46:12,446
And I really would like to see us get back into that, Mr. President, and maybe under your leadership, we can once again reignite that and allow the council members to invite someone behind the real

1359
01:46:12,906 --> 01:46:16,667
of their choice, Mr. President, to partake in city government.

1360
01:46:16,927 --> 01:46:19,748
But getting back to this, I support this wholeheartedly.

1361
01:46:20,128 --> 01:46:29,372
I support anything that would bring additional people to the table and therefore get additional opinions on how city government should operate.

1362
01:46:29,872 --> 01:46:31,272
And I support this wholeheartedly.

1363
01:46:31,772 --> 01:46:32,553
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1364
01:46:32,573 --> 01:46:37,834
Councilor Marks, I'd love to get some bodies in here and be more than happy to bring someone up here.

1365
01:46:38,955 --> 01:46:39,595
The room is open.

1366
01:46:40,722 --> 01:46:43,625
If some students want to come in, we'd be more than happy to have them in here.

1367
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:44,325
Vice President Knight.

1368
01:46:44,806 --> 01:46:45,526
Mr. President, thank you.

1369
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:52,832
I just wanted to point out there's some differences between this commission and the commissions that were mentioned.

1370
01:46:53,112 --> 01:46:54,473
This commission is statutory in nature.

1371
01:46:54,513 --> 01:46:58,016
So this will be adopting a local option that's been provided to us by the state legislature.

1372
01:46:58,677 --> 01:47:04,321
And because it's statutory in nature, there is a defined framework and parameters that are already in place that we have to work with.

1373
01:47:05,987 --> 01:47:13,873
quite frankly, this might be one of the easiest things we've ever had to do in our life, because the law pretty much says what's required in the ordinance and at the local level.

1374
01:47:14,214 --> 01:47:32,268
So when we're talking about the Gender Equity Commission, which started out as, I believe, a Women's Commission, and then turned into a Gender Equity Commission with investigatory authority and all this other stuff, quite frankly, I think that during that discussion about the gender equity stuff, I think a lot of the message got lost in the process, Mr. President, what it was we were trying to accomplish.

1375
01:47:32,288 --> 01:47:33,829
We got, I think, a little bit too

1376
01:47:36,267 --> 01:47:45,089
involved with the minutiae and the details, bringing it down to the lowest possible level when we could have been able to put a framework together in a much more timely fashion.

1377
01:47:45,129 --> 01:47:49,409
So I can certainly appreciate the frustration that Councilor Morrell has expressed.

1378
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:55,190
However, this is a little bit different than that situation, because this is something that's statutory in nature.

1379
01:47:55,250 --> 01:48:00,491
By adopting the enabling language, we already have the defined parameters and frameworks that's necessary for us to move forward.

1380
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:04,052
So with that being said, I do thank my council colleagues for their kind words, and I move for approval.

1381
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:09,262
Thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:48:10,042 --> 01:48:14,846
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1383
01:48:19,389 --> 01:48:21,631
To refer to a committee of the whole.

1384
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:26,214
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1385
01:48:28,696 --> 01:48:29,376
Councilor Behrs.

1386
01:48:30,157 --> 01:48:30,397
Yes.

1387
01:48:31,518 --> 01:48:32,218
Councilor Fevella.

1388
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:32,679
Yes.

1389
01:48:33,059 --> 01:48:33,800
Vice President Nights.

1390
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:34,160
Yes.

1391
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:35,040
Councilor Marks.

1392
01:48:35,301 --> 01:48:35,641
Yes.

1393
01:48:35,821 --> 01:48:36,442
Councilor Morrell.

1394
01:48:36,762 --> 01:48:36,942
Yes.

1395
01:48:37,763 --> 01:48:38,503
Councilor Scarpelli.

1396
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:38,843
Yes.

1397
01:48:38,963 --> 01:48:39,804
President Caravaglia.

1398
01:48:39,884 --> 01:48:41,404
Yes, I'm in support of the motion passes.

1399
01:48:42,144 --> 01:48:47,385
Communications from the mayor.

1400
01:48:47,406 --> 01:48:51,947
21357 to the all present members of Memphis City Council, City Hall MFMS.

1401
01:48:55,688 --> 01:49:04,730
Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request to recommend that your own body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee.

1402
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:18,101
requesting the appropriation of $62,500 from the CPA General Reserve to action for Boston Community Development for the remainder of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program.

1403
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:23,886
The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category affordable housing.

1404
01:49:24,206 --> 01:49:27,729
Sincerely, Brianna Montgomery, Mayor.

1405
01:49:27,809 --> 01:49:31,272
Do we have somebody from the CPA?

1406
01:49:31,713 --> 01:49:33,394
Roberta, are you gonna be speaking?

1407
01:49:35,493 --> 01:49:39,516
Mr. Clerk, if you can unmute Roberta Cameron for a brief presentation.

1408
01:49:40,577 --> 01:49:40,957
Thank you.

1409
01:49:41,357 --> 01:49:50,044
So the council had previously approved all but the 62,500 of the 250,000 that the CPC recommended for an emergency rental assistance program last year.

1410
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:01,532
in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

1411
01:50:02,253 --> 01:50:11,378
So the ABCD has so far spent close to 100 or they've expanded close to $160,000

1412
01:50:17,462 --> 01:50:35,059
of the funds toward, um, paying assisting Medford residents with their rental payments and have an additional, um, set of applications in the pipeline that would bring them up to about $170,000 that they would have spent toward, um,

1413
01:50:40,093 --> 01:50:42,254
paying for the rental assistance.

1414
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:49,298
So they are running close to the end of the funds that the council has approved to date.

1415
01:50:49,738 --> 01:51:00,084
And so we are coming back to ask that the council approve the remaining funds to enable them to finish the program that we recommended for them last year.

1416
01:51:00,104 --> 01:51:02,325
Thank you.

1417
01:51:04,046 --> 01:51:05,267
Any questions for Roberta Cameron?

1418
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:16,395
The motion by Councilor Scarpelli for approval, seconded by Councilor Falcone.

1419
01:51:16,415 --> 01:51:17,495
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1420
01:51:19,996 --> 01:51:20,676
Councilor Behrs.

1421
01:51:21,357 --> 01:51:21,597
Yes.

1422
01:51:22,377 --> 01:51:23,077
Councilor Falcone.

1423
01:51:23,157 --> 01:51:23,358
Yes.

1424
01:51:23,558 --> 01:51:24,278
Vice President Knight.

1425
01:51:24,578 --> 01:51:24,838
Yes.

1426
01:51:25,058 --> 01:51:25,618
Councilor Marks.

1427
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:26,119
Yes.

1428
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:26,979
Councilor Morrell.

1429
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:27,519
Yes.

1430
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,060
Councilor Scarpelli.

1431
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:29,520
Yes.

1432
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:30,380
President Kerrio.

1433
01:51:30,681 --> 01:51:31,661
Yes, seven affirmative.

1434
01:51:31,881 --> 01:51:32,861
Motion passes.

1435
01:51:34,242 --> 01:51:35,623
Let's suspend the rules and take paper 2086.

1436
01:51:38,309 --> 01:51:39,850
two zero zero eight six, I'm sorry.

1437
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:49,654
On the motion by Vice President Knight to take paper two zero eight zero zero eight six off the table, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1438
01:51:50,175 --> 01:51:51,355
Mr. Clerk please call the roll.

1439
01:51:54,477 --> 01:51:55,077
Councilor Behrs.

1440
01:51:55,577 --> 01:51:55,837
Yes.

1441
01:51:56,638 --> 01:51:57,318
Councilor Lococo.

1442
01:51:57,598 --> 01:51:57,818
Yes.

1443
01:51:58,138 --> 01:51:58,859
Vice President Knight.

1444
01:51:58,999 --> 01:51:59,299
Yes.

1445
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:00,059
Councilor Marks.

1446
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:00,660
Yes.

1447
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:01,500
Councilor Morrell.

1448
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,140
Yes.

1449
01:52:03,361 --> 01:52:04,101
Councilor Scarpelli.

1450
01:52:04,341 --> 01:52:04,561
Yes.

1451
01:52:04,722 --> 01:52:05,522
President Kerrio.

1452
01:52:06,122 --> 01:52:06,322
Yes.

1453
01:52:06,462 --> 01:52:07,743
I'm in favor of the motion passes.

1454
01:52:09,177 --> 01:52:10,478
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1455
01:52:10,498 --> 01:52:25,067
2-0-8-0-6, 90-day review report on El Tecuba, Cochina and Tequila Bar for petition for a special permit hours granted by this council as amended to require the 90-day report to begin on the opening of the restaurant.

1456
01:52:25,087 --> 01:52:25,688
Vice President Knight.

1457
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:35,434
Mr. President, El Tecuba, Cochina and Tequila Bar is probably one of the most frequent questions I get asked when I go through Memphis.

1458
01:52:35,494 --> 01:52:36,495
When is this place opening?

1459
01:52:36,635 --> 01:52:37,615
When is this place opening?

1460
01:52:37,675 --> 01:52:38,496
When is this place opening?

1461
01:52:39,027 --> 01:52:46,652
I know we've had a tough year, Mr. President, in terms of the economy, the shutdown, the pandemic, and the like.

1462
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:53,697
But with that being said, from what I can see, they have a building permit on the windowsill, the windowsill wrapped up like there's some construction going on inside.

1463
01:52:54,157 --> 01:53:05,405
And I'm hoping that we could just shoot off a correspondence by authorizing the city clerk to do such, asking for an update on the status of their expansion from Tanaka to Alta Cuba, Kachina, and Tequila Bar, Mr. President.

1464
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:10,372
I know that a lot of that business plan was contingent upon the reopening of Shibahia Auditorium.

1465
01:53:11,052 --> 01:53:20,641
And from what I heard this morning, or earlier in the meeting, I should say, from the Director of the Board of Health was, it seems very promising that we're going to have events there at some point in time in the near future.

1466
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:30,069
So with that being said, hopefully we can kind of get a little update as to what's going on with El Tecuba and also with what's going on at Shibahia Auditorium, Mr. President.

1467
01:53:30,578 --> 01:53:38,780
So I'd asked the city clerk to send off an email provided that my council colleagues support this resolution to reach out to the business owner and just ask what's the status.

1468
01:53:39,861 --> 01:53:45,623
This was a license that was granted by the council and it was placed on a list for a 90 day review, 90 days after opening.

1469
01:53:47,143 --> 01:53:52,825
The 90 days, the summer of 2020 maybe, June of 2020.

1470
01:53:53,025 --> 01:53:54,465
Yeah, it's been a while.

1471
01:53:54,785 --> 01:53:59,987
So it's been a bit of time and you know, that's okay.

1472
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:05,342
But I'm just more curious than anything else, Mr. President, as to what the status is.

1473
01:54:05,542 --> 01:54:11,545
If nothing, then maybe this is something that we refer up to a new Director of Economic Development.

1474
01:54:12,426 --> 01:54:25,652
If in fact there are some hurdles or some problems that this business faces in expanding because there's so much community excitement for it, there might actually be a resource there in City Hall that can help them cut through some of the red tape or find some creative ways to meet some of the needs that they have.

1475
01:54:26,156 --> 01:54:31,320
I think that was, you know, the whole goal and purpose of us creating the position of Director of Economic Development.

1476
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:37,084
So with that being said, Mr. President, maybe this can be the first project that he gets assigned, and now we can see if Delta Cuba can open.

1477
01:54:38,265 --> 01:54:39,265
Thank you, Mr. President.

1478
01:54:39,546 --> 01:54:43,769
I do remember the mayor going in there sometime during the year.

1479
01:54:43,809 --> 01:54:46,291
I think I saw it on Twitter or somewhere.

1480
01:54:46,311 --> 01:54:48,052
I know she did a little walkthrough there.

1481
01:54:48,925 --> 01:54:50,186
And I think it's been some time.

1482
01:54:50,226 --> 01:54:52,687
I can give you a little bit of an answer on Chevalier.

1483
01:54:52,967 --> 01:55:09,614
I know they are planning some things in the very near future there, but unfortunately, with their limited capacity, and they're going to have, I think, just comedians at the moment because of the cost of the acts and the amount of people.

1484
01:55:09,914 --> 01:55:14,876
But I think you will see some stuff coming out there, some announcement in the next few weeks, Vice President May.

1485
01:55:15,196 --> 01:55:15,596
Thank you, sir.

1486
01:55:16,945 --> 01:55:27,395
So on the motion by Vice President Knight, that we get a report on this and Shavia, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1487
01:55:28,856 --> 01:55:29,757
Scripps, please call the roll.

1488
01:55:32,099 --> 01:55:32,679

Yes.

1492
01:55:35,462 --> 01:55:36,183
Vice President Knight.

1493
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:36,543
Yes.

1494
01:55:36,823 --> 01:55:37,364
Councilor Marks.

1495
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:37,984
Yes.

1496
01:55:38,144 --> 01:55:38,745
Councilor Morrell.

1497
01:55:39,105 --> 01:55:39,345
Yes.

1498

Councilor Scarpelli.

01:55:41,007 --> 01:55:41,067
Yes.

1500
01:55:41,765 --> 01:55:42,505
President Kerrio.

1501
01:55:42,685 --> 01:55:44,146
Yes, I'm in the permanent motion passes.

1502
01:55:44,186 --> 01:55:45,946
Motion that we bring back to regular business.

1503
01:55:45,966 --> 01:55:46,766
I'll move Mr. President.

1504
01:55:47,106 --> 01:55:50,987
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1505
01:55:51,767 --> 01:55:52,728
Please call the roll.

1506
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:02,330

Yes.

1508
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:04,571
Councilor Fevella.

1509
01:56:04,631 --> 01:56:04,831
Yes.

1510
01:56:05,051 --> 01:56:05,731
Vice President Knight.

1511
01:56:05,911 --> 01:56:06,191
Yes.

Yes.

1514
01:56:07,691 --> 01:56:08,331
Councilor Morrell.

1515
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:08,972
Yes.

Yes, I'm in favor of the motion passes.

This is for the CBDG grant funding.

1545
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:14,432
Motion by vice president for approval, second by councilor Falco.

1546
01:57:14,952 --> 01:57:16,072
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1547
01:57:17,933 --> 01:57:18,593
Councilor Behrs.

1548
01:57:19,053 --> 01:57:19,353
Yes.

1549
01:57:20,093 --> 01:57:20,734
Councilor Falco.

1550
01:57:20,974 --> 01:57:21,214
Yes.

1551
01:57:21,354 --> 01:57:22,014
Vice president Knight.

1552
01:57:22,174 --> 01:57:22,434
Yes.

1553
01:57:22,514 --> 01:57:23,114
Councilor Marks.

1554
01:57:23,434 --> 01:57:23,715
Yes.

1555
01:57:23,835 --> 01:57:24,415
Councilor Morrell.

1556
01:57:24,795 --> 01:57:25,055
Yes.

1557
01:57:25,755 --> 01:57:26,435
Councilor Scarpelli.

1558
01:57:26,575 --> 01:57:26,795
Yes.

1559
01:57:26,855 --> 01:57:27,476
President Kerrio.

1560
01:57:27,576 --> 01:57:27,936
Yes.

1561
01:57:28,216 --> 01:57:29,076
Motion passes.

1562
01:57:29,096 --> 01:57:33,777
2-0-3-0-0 and 2-1-0-5-3, April 28th.

1563
01:57:34,138 --> 01:57:36,318
Subcommittee on elderly housing affairs.

1564
01:57:37,498 --> 01:57:39,219
Councilor Behrs, would you like to report on that?

1565
01:57:39,947 --> 01:57:40,107
Yes.

1566
01:57:40,207 --> 01:57:41,188
Thank you, Mr President.

1567
01:57:41,528 --> 01:57:44,049
I want to thank counselors marks and Falco.

1568
01:57:44,189 --> 01:57:46,090
We had two great subcommittee meetings.

1569
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,711
This first one is on elderly and housing affairs.

1570
01:57:49,171 --> 01:57:59,096
We discussed housing stability, um, and I got an update from our folks in our health department about how housing is being incorporated into the social work

1571
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:02,158
that they are doing from Alicia and Penny.

1572
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:12,983
We reported out in motion from the subcommittee to recommend that the mayor include $50,000 in the fiscal year 22 budget to continue emergency rental assistance.

1573
01:58:13,623 --> 01:58:17,985
And it'd be possible that the city administration could pursue additional grants as well.

1574
01:58:18,726 --> 01:58:22,767
We also discussed Councilor Falco's proposal for a housing stability notification ordinance.

1575
01:58:23,448 --> 01:58:28,370
We will be getting a red line copy from the city solicitor and discussing that at our next meeting.

1576
01:58:29,255 --> 01:58:30,035
and I move approval.

1577
01:58:31,116 --> 01:58:31,516
Thank you.

1578
01:58:31,696 --> 01:58:34,937
On the motion by Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1579
01:58:35,437 --> 01:58:35,877
Mr. President.

1580
01:58:36,798 --> 01:58:38,538
Councilor Matz.

1581
01:58:38,658 --> 01:58:39,658
Thank you, Mr. President.

1582
01:58:40,379 --> 01:58:44,520
Just one clarification, and I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco.

1583
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:50,302
I think we're making some real headway on housing issues within our community.

1584
01:58:51,342 --> 01:58:56,304
I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, the 50,000 that we asked to be in the budget

1585
01:58:56,952 --> 01:59:02,395
was for housing assistance and not rental assistance.

1586
01:59:03,316 --> 01:59:11,141
I just want to clarify because I know there was some contention around why not just make a general statement regarding housing assistance and not rental.

1587
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:15,303
So I just want the record to reflect it's, I believe it's housing assistance.

1588
01:59:16,084 --> 01:59:16,304
Yes.

1589
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:18,505
And that is reflected in the actual report.

1590
01:59:18,545 --> 01:59:19,146
I apologize.

1591
01:59:19,206 --> 01:59:20,146
I just used the wrong word.

1592
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:21,247
Oh, that's fine.

1593
01:59:21,287 --> 01:59:22,147
Thank you.

1594
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:28,331
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1595
01:59:28,691 --> 01:59:29,351
Councilor Behrs?

1596
01:59:29,931 --> 01:59:30,171
Yes.

1597
01:59:30,852 --> 01:59:31,512
Councilor Fevella?

1598
01:59:31,572 --> 01:59:31,792
Yes.

1599
01:59:31,912 --> 01:59:32,612
Vice President Knight?

1600
01:59:32,972 --> 01:59:33,232
Yes.

1601
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:33,873
Councilor Marks?

1602
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:34,353
Yes.

1603
01:59:34,493 --> 01:59:35,113
Councilor Morrell?

1604
01:59:35,433 --> 01:59:35,673
Yes.

1605
01:59:36,394 --> 01:59:37,094
Councilor Scarpelli?

1606
01:59:37,274 --> 01:59:37,494
Yes.

1607
01:59:37,534 --> 01:59:38,374
President Caravaglia?

1608
01:59:38,514 --> 01:59:38,715
Yes.

1609
01:59:38,735 --> 01:59:42,616
Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

1610
01:59:42,636 --> 01:59:45,917
20573, April 28th, 2020, Public Works Subcommittee.

1611
01:59:46,638 --> 01:59:47,378
Councilor Behrs?

1612
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:49,419
Thank you, Mr. President.

1613
01:59:49,639 --> 01:59:52,920
Yes, once again, Councilor Marks, Councilor Fevella and myself met

1614
01:59:53,594 --> 01:59:57,038
this time to discuss snow removal with the public works subcommittee.

1615
01:59:57,859 --> 02:00:11,755
We did have a discussion again of the priority sidewalks list, and we did make a motion to recommend that the city administration issue an RFI or find another way to determine the cost of a city priority sidewalk

1616
02:00:13,672 --> 02:00:16,454
to include that in the next snow and ice removal plan.

1617
02:00:17,354 --> 02:00:20,436
We also had extensive discussion of the ordinance language.

1618
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:34,186
We did make some motions to accept changes, and we will be looking at a red line copy at our next meeting with the solicitor along with Commissioner Moki and code enforcement to discuss the enforcement section of the ordinance.

1619
02:00:35,867 --> 02:00:37,508
Thank you on the motion by

1620
02:00:41,113 --> 02:00:41,878
Vice President, bye.

1621
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,246
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1622
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:52,025
I was contacted with some concern that the sidewalk snow removal processes would be something that would be privatized or subcontracted.

1623
02:00:52,045 --> 02:00:57,289
Is that the intention or the desire of the direction that the committee is going in?

1624
02:00:57,369 --> 02:00:59,551
I had brief conversations with Councilor Marks.

1625
02:00:59,591 --> 02:01:01,532
He seemed rather indifferent.

1626
02:01:01,552 --> 02:01:03,253
He doesn't care who does it as long as it gets done.

1627
02:01:04,154 --> 02:01:11,279
But I didn't know if this was something where we were looking at get a private group that will go out and do it or if this is something that you would try to adopt in-house.

1628
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:12,921
I know this council in the past

1629
02:01:13,989 --> 02:01:18,210
voted multiple times for us to purchase a bombardier to go and clear our sidewalk.

1630
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:29,493
So I was just wondering if there was any focus on having this done privately or having this done as a government contractor, as part of the normal and regular DPW operations.

1631
02:01:30,733 --> 02:01:31,473
If I may, Mr. President.

1632
02:01:31,493 --> 02:01:33,674
Whether or not it's all up in the air for discussion.

1633
02:01:33,694 --> 02:01:40,716
I think that's the question I got a call from Steve South who had some questions about how this was going to play out.

1634
02:01:41,136 --> 02:01:42,236
And I'm just hoping I can get some answers.

1635
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:44,520
Councilor Best.

1636
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:45,941
Thank you, Mr. President.

1637
02:01:45,981 --> 02:02:01,725
Yeah, we discussed both them looking for a contract to do it and also did mention that, I believe Councilor Marks mentioned, and we were all supportive of the idea of doing it in-house, purchasing the machines and identifying the manpower to do so.

1638
02:02:02,265 --> 02:02:10,908
So we are waiting back to hear from the city administration what their determination is on cost for both of those ideas.

1639
02:02:13,378 --> 02:02:13,658
Excellent.

1640
02:02:13,678 --> 02:02:14,399
Thank you very much.

1641
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,240
Appreciate it.

1642
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,441
Mr. President.

1643
02:02:18,902 --> 02:02:19,783
Thank you, Mr. President.

1644
02:02:19,823 --> 02:02:23,366
I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco.

1645
02:02:23,866 --> 02:02:30,991
I have to say we've been working on this ordinance for a period of time, but we're finally making some serious headway.

1646
02:02:31,592 --> 02:02:36,235
And I think, Mr. President, it's not going to be just a knee jerk reaction.

1647
02:02:36,676 --> 02:02:38,457
It's a very thoughtful process.

1648
02:02:39,058 --> 02:02:42,260
And I think, you know, the ordinance itself,

1649
02:02:43,008 --> 02:02:51,418
which has some accountability within the ordinance, which I think will go a long way for pedestrian improving pedestrian safety.

1650
02:02:51,859 --> 02:03:00,870
But secondly, Mr. President, I think adding a component of city responsibility, you know, the ordinance originally was a focus on

1651
02:03:01,303 --> 02:03:09,769
residents, residents have to clear the corners, residents have to clear the sidewalks, they have to clear the front of the hybrids, residents have to do this, residents have to do that.

1652
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:22,478
And I think the subcommittee after digesting some of this said, you know what, in order to get a buy-in from the residents, we need the city to also step up and take responsibility.

1653
02:03:23,019 --> 02:03:28,103
And I think what we found is by offering this priority sidewalk, where we're looking at 26 miles

1654
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:33,014
of Ontario roads.

1655
02:03:33,495 --> 02:03:36,360
So every road that's currently being swept right now

1656
02:03:37,196 --> 02:03:51,682
in our pilot program will now become part of, over a certain amount of inches, will now become part of an automatic plow that goes on the sidewalk and plow the sidewalk over a certain number of inches.

1657
02:03:52,103 --> 02:04:01,927
What that does, as we've discussed, myself, Councilor Falco and Chairman Beers, is create the connectivity that we're talking about from business district to business district

1658
02:04:02,187 --> 02:04:10,012
from school to school, from elderly housing to elderly housing, from bus stop to bus stop, and it creates that automatic connectivity.

1659
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:26,943
And for the amount that we're looking at for upwards of $3,000 to $4,000 on an average snowstorm for a city this size, I think we all felt that this is our biggest bang for our buck to implement such a program.

1660
02:04:27,523 --> 02:04:31,466
How it gets implemented, whether we outsource or see if we can

1661
02:04:31,815 --> 02:04:36,337
handle it in-house, still remains, and still a work in progress.

1662
02:04:36,397 --> 02:04:42,040
But I think we've made a lot of headway in improving pedestrian safety.

1663
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:46,782
And I would welcome Steve South to any one of our open meetings.

1664
02:04:46,822 --> 02:04:47,802
They've all been open.

1665
02:04:48,122 --> 02:04:49,843
We've had members of the Chamber of Commerce.

1666
02:04:50,123 --> 02:04:51,584
We've had members of WOC Method.

1667
02:04:51,864 --> 02:04:55,886
We've had members of WOC Boston attend our meetings and give input.

1668
02:04:56,366 --> 02:05:01,048
And we're always welcome to hear input, Mr. President, on how we can better

1669
02:05:01,795 --> 02:05:02,895
improve this process.

1670
02:05:03,275 --> 02:05:08,696
You know, the big issue that we've been struggling with is the crossings.

1671
02:05:09,257 --> 02:05:18,258
So right now, the ordinance states that the homeowner that lives at the corner would be responsible for clearing out the crossing.

1672
02:05:18,939 --> 02:05:26,200
And as we all know, many of the trucks plow to the corners, and in a big storm, you could have four, five, six feet of ice.

1673
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:30,481
And how do you have a homeowner that's gonna be responsible

1674
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:31,631
for clearing that out.

1675
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:41,797
So part of the process for the priority sidewalk was to have 26 miles of these corners cleaned out automatically with these bombardiers.

1676
02:05:42,497 --> 02:05:53,264
And we're still trying to create a process that we can have snow counted off, or we can have a better policy on the city side where they don't plow directly to corners.

1677
02:05:53,745 --> 02:06:00,609
So there's some administrative stuff we can work on, some ordinance stuff, and maybe some contractual stuff to help improve

1678
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,921
pedestrian safety in this community.

1679
02:06:03,281 --> 02:06:04,762
And I just want to thank my colleagues.

1680
02:06:05,082 --> 02:06:22,249
We've put a lot of hours into this, and I hope eventually when we present it to the council for their input, that they'll see the amount of hours that we put into this and, you know, have their input as well, but see that really, I think this makes a lot of sense for our community.

1681
02:06:22,589 --> 02:06:27,031
And again, I want to thank Chairman Beers and Councilor Falco for their input on this.

1682
02:06:28,191 --> 02:06:30,492
And the DPW commissioner as well, he's been

1683
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,381
instrumental in this process, Mr. President.

1684
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:34,881
Mr. President.

1685
02:06:34,961 --> 02:06:36,342
Thank you for the clarification.

1686
02:06:37,162 --> 02:06:38,283
Councilor Baxter.

1687
02:06:39,403 --> 02:06:49,727
I just want to thank Councilor Marks and you know, my usual intention around these is to keep them short, but I think I might get in touch with Councilor Marks next time so I can do it the full justice that he just did.

1688
02:06:49,907 --> 02:06:50,427
So thank you.

1689
02:06:52,267 --> 02:06:52,968
Councilor Falco.

1690
02:06:53,128 --> 02:06:54,308
Thank you, Mr. President.

1691
02:06:54,328 --> 02:06:56,709
I also want to thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Peters

1692
02:06:58,105 --> 02:07:01,046
These subcommittee meetings have been very, very productive.

1693
02:07:01,666 --> 02:07:08,249
Like Councilor Marks mentioned, there's been a lot of input from business owners, the community, the department heads, and different organizations.

1694
02:07:08,649 --> 02:07:17,031
And I look forward to working with them to resolve these issues and bring them to a future Committee of the Whole meeting.

1695
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:21,693
But they've been very productive meetings and I look forward to working with them to

1696
02:07:22,621 --> 02:07:23,682
bring everything to fruition.

1697
02:07:23,722 --> 02:07:27,665
So thanks again to the Councilor Marks and Councilor Beers for their hard work on these issues.

1698
02:07:29,566 --> 02:07:30,747
Thank you Councilor Falco.

1699
02:07:31,748 --> 02:07:35,271
On the motion by Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1700
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,312
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1701
02:07:37,732 --> 02:07:38,733
Mr. President, if I could.

1702
02:07:39,534 --> 02:07:40,755
