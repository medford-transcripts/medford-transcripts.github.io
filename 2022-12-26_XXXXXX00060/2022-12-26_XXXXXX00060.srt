1
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,438
[SPEAKER_19]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,862
[SPEAKER_19]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:28,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,753
[SPEAKER_19]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:43,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Charlie.

10
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Daniel.

11
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,595
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're sitting here just a couple days before the holidays.

12
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,439
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to be recording our last episode of the year.

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:54,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So exciting.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

15
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,904
[SPEAKER_19]: So we just want to mention, we know a lot of stuff's been going on in the city this week.

16
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:02,909
[SPEAKER_19]: We did hear, just to follow up on our last episode, that the teachers

17
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:04,590
[SPEAKER_19]: ratified their contract.

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:13,378
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like it's a very similar proposal as we heard the Teachers Association talk about on that episode.

19
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:21,826
[SPEAKER_19]: So they did amend some of the plans for Wednesday for extending the day on Wednesday for the elementary schools and it was a similar or the same

20
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:30,538
[SPEAKER_19]: proposal in terms of payment and payment increases over the next three years.

21
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:38,541
[SPEAKER_19]: And what I did not understand, I don't think when we were talking to them, was there's a percentage that they're asking for for a raise, so something around 8%.

22
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:43,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is split up over three years.

23
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:51,567
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll get a portion of that raise the first year, a portion the second year, a portion the third year, and then it sounds like the piece that they were a little on the fence about was,

24
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:57,769
[SPEAKER_19]: last 1% would they would get on the last day of the contract so technically counts for the next year.

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:15,276
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was helpful to get some understanding around but it sounds like we heard in City Council or School Committee, City Council, School Committee this week that they did ratify that but you know obviously there was a lot of other things happening in that meeting that uh Chelly and I did.

26
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It was certainly a heavy meeting.

27
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah heavy meeting.

28
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,557
[SPEAKER_19]: It was heavy week I think.

29
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I don't know if you have anything you want to say about it.

30
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:40,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it's clear to me that folks feel very passionately about all of the ongoings this week and that everyone is wanting to offer a solution that they feel will sort of mitigate the issues at hand.

31
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I think understanding around the structure of leadership and what different roles can do is important to kind of grapple with is think understanding what funding sources are available and for what and what timelines is important to think about.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:08,697
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my biggest takeaways from watching the school committee meeting was to really be thinking about our learning beliefs as a district and to pursue what it would look like to

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:23,114
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine a school system that is built from the lens of critically thinking students and building folks who are resilient learners, pie-in-the-sky thoughts, big thoughts.

34
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:28,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also realize that people are looking for immediate kind of solutions that will

35
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,008
[SPEAKER_03]: support some peace right now.

36
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,431
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of space between those two thoughts.

37
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:44,222
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah I was up early the morning after that meeting just like running through everything that like I wish that I'd been able to say in that or just contribute to that meeting and I think like

38
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:54,308
[SPEAKER_19]: In my real life, I work with victims of trauma, and it just was really striking to me that next morning, like, really sinking in that, like, all these people were really traumatized on Monday, right?

39
00:03:54,348 --> 00:04:02,993
[SPEAKER_19]: The students, the parents wondering what was happening to their kids, teachers, school committee members, just community members knowing that this was something that was going on in our city.

40
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:06,655
[SPEAKER_19]: And I, like, talk a lot in my job about, like,

41
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,086
[SPEAKER_19]: anger, right?

42
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:12,429
[SPEAKER_19]: And anger being a very normal response to situations like this.

43
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:27,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's anger not necessarily being a feeling that we have a lot of control over, though I do think where we can have some control is like how we express that anger and this distinction between destructive anger and constructive anger.

44
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:31,864
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think what would be helpful for us as a community is

45
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:43,368
[SPEAKER_19]: to find some ways to express that anger or to sort of have that anger process a little bit, but to also get to a place where we can use it in a productive way.

46
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:51,692
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that there is an importance to having those feelings, understanding those feelings.

47
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,353
[SPEAKER_19]: And like we heard some people say,

48
00:04:55,734 --> 00:05:01,119
[SPEAKER_19]: having that be a force that unites us, because I think I was hearing a lot of the same things.

49
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,040
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want this to happen.

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,101
[SPEAKER_19]: We never wanted this to happen.

51
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:07,305
[SPEAKER_19]: We want to find a solution, and also, we're kind of overwhelmed by this problem.

52
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:13,932
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know that we totally understand it, and it's not going to be one person or one body that fixes it.

53
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:29,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, and also the notion that obviously this week feels so pertinent to the here and now, but to understand that these pieces have moved in the Medford school systems for many, many years, and that we're seeing patterns.

54
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:40,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I just wanted to kind of highlight, there's a lot of talk about the good kids are doing X, Y, and Z, and other kids are doing something else.

55
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:47,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of the meeting wanting and wishing that I had said that there are no good and bad kids.

56
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: There are kids who have been served in one way and there are kids who have had other experiences.

57
00:05:52,664 --> 00:06:00,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time you're bringing weapons to school, likely you've been failed by systemic reasons or failed by adults or both habitually.

58
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:09,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So to move with that understanding as well as we think about what are good next steps or strong, salient next steps.

59
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:16,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and saying like that sort of not minimizing that whole child, right?

60
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:19,219
[SPEAKER_19]: Like what are they being exposed to outside of school?

61
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,659
[SPEAKER_19]: What are they hearing inside of school?

62
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,040
[SPEAKER_19]: And how does that all kind of come together?

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,461
[SPEAKER_19]: How can that also be part of the solution, right?

64
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,042
[SPEAKER_19]: How do we think about that?

65
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, like to your point,

66
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: We may or may not have been displaying adequate decorum as adults in this city.

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had several years now of recorded behaviors that might be less than

68
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: we can be.

69
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And our kids are watching.

70
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:50,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

71
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:55,810
[SPEAKER_19]: I also just want to mention that we had planned to talk to our mayor today.

72
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,653
[SPEAKER_19]: We decided to sort of give her some space.

73
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:05,679
[SPEAKER_19]: I think she's working on a lot, going through a lot, so we want her to be able to focus on that and we'll hopefully be able to connect with her in the new year.

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,203
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd hope to hear a little bit about the teacher negotiations, but obviously

75
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,647
[SPEAKER_19]: new things have come up and evolved.

76
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:17,031
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, we'll hopefully earmark that for next year.

77
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:17,772
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

78
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:22,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are folks, we realize that people have big feelings on a lot that's gone on this week.

79
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:29,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So if folks feel like they'd want to reach out to Medford Bites and have a conversation, we're super excited about anyone who wants to talk.

80
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:30,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, reach out to us.

81
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:31,726
[SPEAKER_19]: It's pretty easy.

82
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:37,091
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find us on Facebook, Instagram, and also you can email us at medfordpod at gmail.com.

83
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:38,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Email us.

84
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,113
Yeah.

85
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:39,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

86
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:44,198
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, um, we're going to transition to kind of our end of the year.

87
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:45,605
[SPEAKER_19]: episode.

88
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:51,908
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'd asked folks to share with us highlights of this year and hopes that they have for next year.

89
00:07:52,008 --> 00:08:05,094
[SPEAKER_19]: So we, I actually had the great opportunity of going into an eighth grade classroom and talking about podcasting and showing them some of the ways that I do my work here and we got to practice doing that by then.

90
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,255
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll hear from a bunch of students from Ms.

91
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Wayland's class at the Andrews as part of that, but also some other

92
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,738
[SPEAKER_19]: community members that have shared their thoughts.

93
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:15,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

94
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to folks who shared, especially those eighth graders.

95
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:18,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they're great.

96
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,700
[SPEAKER_19]: They're doing some great work in that class.

97
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:33,584
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll hear from it in a couple of episodes, but they are very creative, very dedicated teachers that they have, and she's worked with them a few years in a row, I think, doing this podcast project, but it's really innovative and really cool, I think.

98
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,585
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want me to go first, Shelley?

99
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:38,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sure.

100
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:39,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Ping pong.

101
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,743
[SPEAKER_19]: Ping pong.

102
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:42,364
[SPEAKER_19]: Popcorn.

103
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:42,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

104
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:43,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

105
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely called popcorn.

106
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,246
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we can create our own.

107
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Medford Bites Target.

108
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:56,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think highlights of the year for me, definitely this collaboration.

109
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:02,675
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Jelly and I, we began working together on the podcast this year, and that's been really, really

110
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,244
[SPEAKER_19]: fun and helpful to me and to the podcast.

111
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,990
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been great getting to know you a little bit more, Chelly.

112
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:17,577
[SPEAKER_03]: For me as well, it's amazing that we're already coming up on something that looks like a year as far as this collaboration is concerned.

113
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:27,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been able to use the Medford Bites platform as a space to explore what I've learned in wearing the multiple hats that I have for the city.

114
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:34,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Just learning about what it logistically means to produce and being able to

115
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:40,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Occupy a collaboration that is safe and innovative and forward-thinking has been amazing.

116
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So hats off to us for killing it.

117
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:44,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

118
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:45,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Any other highlights for you?

119
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

120
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:51,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year has meant a lot of transition for me.

121
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:56,281
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the most exciting possibilities is that next year potentially means graduate school.

122
00:09:57,602 --> 00:10:07,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll take all of these multiple hats and pursue some classroom hours and think about what a master's in public policy could look like.

123
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids had a very solid

124
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:24,373
[SPEAKER_03]: this is not a semester, I don't know what they're doing, public schools, but they have also experienced transition and I think they are in a much better place emotionally, socially, academically, and I'm grateful for that.

125
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:27,734
[SPEAKER_03]: There are others.

126
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:32,435
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, kids are a big thing for me, like my older son

127
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:45,275
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a first grader at the Roberts and he has had just a great year and it's just been really nice to see him adjusting to school and just can't say enough about his teacher and the teachers at the Roberts.

128
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:55,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Our other son had more of an interesting year in which he had surgery to remove a tumor, which was not something that we were expecting to go through this year.

129
00:10:56,237 --> 00:11:01,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Would not recommend for anyone, but he had really great care at Boston Children's Hospital.

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Also a place that you never want to have to go to, but they are excellent.

131
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yeah, excellent.

132
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,833
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's been doing great since then, but just, you know, so very grateful for that.

133
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely getting through that was a highlight of our year.

134
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of support from our friends in Medford, though, and our family.

135
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,549
[SPEAKER_19]: So to anyone who's listening who was part of that, thank you so much.

136
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the Medford community is a highlight.

137
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:37,255
[SPEAKER_03]: This platform has given us a chance to connect with folks, build relationships, maintain older relationships.

138
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a blast.

139
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:39,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

140
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,349
[SPEAKER_19]: And one more thing I wanted to do, just give a shout out.

141
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:49,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Every Friday I do a workout group, um, at car park and that's really sustained me through the pandemic.

142
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:56,658
[SPEAKER_19]: And those, the ladies in that group have been really supportive of the podcast and of my mental and physical wellbeing.

143
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,720
[SPEAKER_19]: So I couldn't have gotten through these two years without them.

144
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

145
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Love it.

146
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:02,822
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

147
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,144
[SPEAKER_19]: So you want to think about hopes for next year?

148
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

149
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,006
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you looking forward to?

150
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:08,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

151
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:17,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I am looking forward to intentional excitement.

152
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,302
[SPEAKER_03]: My life has answered to

153
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:45,152
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements that I haven't been able to design and I am looking forward to the opposite of that where I am building strategic plans for my own life and having a better sense of what's coming my way and having a better way of being able to share with my kids what's happening next in life and hopefully reaping benefits and advancement because of knowing what's coming.

154
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:52,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is routine, exercise, better eating, sleep, more coffee, more wine.

155
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:54,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a good place to be.

156
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:55,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All the things.

157
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Good intention there, for sure.

158
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:02,241
[SPEAKER_19]: For me, I'm looking forward to more podcasting.

159
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:07,664
[SPEAKER_19]: The library, I'm going to be doing a workshop for kids on podcasting in February, March.

160
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't miss it.

161
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:08,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

162
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:12,227
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you can sign up through the library, I'm assuming.

163
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I don't know.

164
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,059
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking forward to just what the rest of the year is going to bring or what the new year will bring.

165
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,223
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, I think.

166
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:44,367
[SPEAKER_19]: My wife talks about it later on in the comments, but just looking forward to adventures and spending time with my family and yeah, just also being part of the Charter Review Committee, I'm not exactly, I always get the title wrong, but being involved in the city in that way and really kind of digging into just the way that our city government works.

167
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:45,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're involved in something as well that seems very important.

169
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:49,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Riverbice is busy.

170
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:54,222
[SPEAKER_03]: So Daniel's on the charter review, and I am on the health curriculum review committee.

171
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are in it.

172
00:13:58,223 --> 00:13:58,463
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

173
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:04,145
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure how much we'll be able to talk about on the podcast, but two exciting things to look forward to for next year.

174
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:04,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

175
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Signing off.

176
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

177
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy holidays and wishing everybody a really peaceful, beautiful new year.

178
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:13,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

179
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:17,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy holidays and enjoy the comments from the rest of the people that are coming next.

180
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,189
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Shannon Heaton.

181
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,311
[SPEAKER_12]: I live near Wright's Pond where we now have a safe lacrosse walk.

182
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:33,396
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just love that this year the bike and walking paths expanded even more and connect us all over the place to towns all over the place.

183
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:40,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to more infrastructure, more expansion of stuff for humans, not for cars.

184
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:46,876
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I want to say that I'm really grateful to all the Medford drivers who are so gracious to bikers and pedestrians.

185
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,857
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of us out there, so I hope we keep that up in the new year too.

186
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:53,337
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your name?

187
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:55,538
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Jack.

188
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Jack, and what was the best part of your year?

189
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I played with cars at Denise's.

190
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Playing with cars at Denise's.

191
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,680
[SPEAKER_19]: And what are you excited for for next year?

192
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Going to bees.

193
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:05,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Going where?

00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:48,910

00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:57,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, I am Thomas, an eighth grader at Andrews Middle School.

207
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,039

[SPEAKER_09]: And, yes.

209
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,645
[SPEAKER_09]: This year was, it is a year.

210
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,686
[SPEAKER_09]: We have less COVID around, which is nice.

00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah.

212
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,872

217
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:54,140
[SPEAKER_14]: So my hope for next year is to play basketball.

230
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:14,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Next year, I'm looking forward to going to high school and probably my birthday, too.

238

239
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:45,601
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd say the best highlight of my year was going biking around local area with my friends over the summer.

240
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,682
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I live in North Medford.

241
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:54,245
[SPEAKER_17]: We got to bike to West Medford a lot, and we even biked to Burlington Mall, which was the furthest away we've ever done.

242
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,345
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was really fun.

243
00:18:55,565 --> 00:19:02,048
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'm looking forward to next year is probably the same thing and getting around to new places and trying to explore.

244
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,204
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Harry.

245
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,665
[SPEAKER_11]: My pronouns are he, him.

246
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I am in 8th grade at the Andrews Middle School.

247
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:16,011
[SPEAKER_11]: The highlight of my year was joining marching band, and I'm looking forward to the next season of marching band.

248
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

249
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,534
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Bronwyn.

250
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:27,118
[SPEAKER_18]: My pronouns are she, her, and I'm in 8th grade at the Andrews Middle School.

251
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:31,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, the high- probably the highlight of my year was

252
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:38,822
[SPEAKER_18]: walking from the school to the Medford Public Library with my friends.

253
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:47,408
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cool that such a cool library is just walking distance from the school.

254
00:19:48,429 --> 00:20:00,499
[SPEAKER_18]: And this one time, one of my friends wanted to come with us, but the thing is, she didn't tell her parents, so they ended up calling the police.

255
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:04,264
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was all worked out in the end.

256
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:07,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh... My... I'm...

257
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:19,651
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing that I'm excited for for next year is probably just high school in general.

258
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:27,573
[SPEAKER_18]: They had like a open house thing where you got to go around and see all the classes.

259
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:37,756
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thought it was cool that you could learn stuff like woodworking and culinary in school.

260
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:40,437
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's pretty interesting.

261
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:49,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, this is Teresa and Mike from reimagined and we're wishing you all a wonderful 2023.

263
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:15,114
[SPEAKER_00]: We have met so many of you at various events, and so many of you have reached out and or joined our fun and quirky gym community, and we're so very thankful for that.

264
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:22,478
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning to continue to partner with various Medford events and Medford Recreation over 2023.

265
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:23,518
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing our

266
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,924
[SPEAKER_00]: free sweat into the 80s class all through the summer, through the Medford Rec, and we hope to see you there.

267
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:39,368
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking forward to expanding our team in 2023 and offering more trainings and classes.

268
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,530
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to be part of our team, hit us up.

00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: My pronouns are she, her.

273
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in eighth grade at the Andrews Middle School.

274
00:21:56,022 --> 00:22:02,727
[SPEAKER_04]: My highlight of the year was probably playing volleyball at the club with my friends.

275
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:12,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'm looking forward to is probably the volleyball team at the high school next year.

276
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:20,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, this is Justine Myers, pronouns she, her, hers.

277
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:29,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the honor and privilege of being featured in a Medford Bites podcast episode this past March discussing my business, Acupuncture Together.

278
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to share some highlights from this past year, both personally and professionally.

279
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:41,191
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I am glad that life is feeling more normal these days since the arrival of COVID.

280
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:49,558
[SPEAKER_13]: January and February at the clinic were very quiet, I think due to fears of the Omicron variant, as well as numerous snowstorms.

281
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:58,065
[SPEAKER_13]: As the year progressed, it seems that many people became comfortable going out and to various places, including acupuncture together.

282
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:06,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been so pleased to reconnect with my former patients this year who I had not seen since before COVID once they finally felt comfortable coming back in.

283
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:13,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Our business is back to operating at a sustainable level after having had a couple rocky years following the COVID lockdown.

284

00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:39,547
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm currently in the process of finishing a course on using acupuncture to support breast cancer patients during and after their breast cancer treatments.

286
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:45,831
[SPEAKER_13]: On a personal note, I had some tremendously fun and fulfilling athletic achievements this year.

287
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:57,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I competed in my first open water swim race in August, the Glen Lake One Mile Swim, followed by the Title IX Sprint Triathlon this September, which was my first ever triathlon.

288
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,024
[SPEAKER_13]: At the triathlon, I ran into our very own mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, before the start of the race.

289
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:08,528
[SPEAKER_13]: We chatted while we waited for the start and entered side by side in the swim portion.

290
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:14,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Later this fall, I competed in the Loco Half Marathon and the BAA Half Marathon.

291
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:21,817
[SPEAKER_13]: This was very special for me because for many years, I haven't been able to compete in these sorts of events due to some health problems.

292
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally improving my health and being able to train and compete was truly a joy for me.

293
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:31,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I also enjoyed some wonderful travel this year with my family.

294
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:39,563
[SPEAKER_13]: With my husband, 9-year-old daughter, and 7-year-old son, we traveled to Aruba over February vacation week and to Colorado in August.

295
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:49,595
[SPEAKER_13]: We enjoyed some incredible sightseeing and many firsts for my kids, including horseback riding, snorkeling, and seeing mountains and all kinds of wildlife.

296
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:58,070
[SPEAKER_13]: My children are thriving at the Brooks School this year, and we are grateful that school feels normal for them once again after all the changes that took place for COVID.

297
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:09,154
[SPEAKER_13]: My husband Chet, who is an engineer and project manager at Massport, won two awards this year for his work on the Birth 10 project in Boston, where large container ships come in.

298
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:18,897
[SPEAKER_13]: One award was presented to him in Hawaii, so we had the good fortune to take a trip to Hawaii together, where he received an award and presented two papers on his work.

299
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:25,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Although this year started out a bit difficult, it ended up being a truly great year for me and for my family.

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,271

00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:44,588

306
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,269
