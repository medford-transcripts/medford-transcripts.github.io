    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=9.177">Hey</a>  listeners, this is Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=10.938">And</a>  Shelley. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=12.179">Shelley</a>  is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=15.121">And</a>  Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=18.503">And</a>  this is the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=21.485">Every</a>  two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=29.229">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=32.692">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=43.068">Hey,</a>  Charlie.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=43.529">Hi,</a>  Daniel. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=45.851">So</a>  we're sitting here just a couple days before the holidays. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=49.615">We're</a>  going to be recording our last episode of the year.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=53.739">So</a>  exciting.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=54.82">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=55.781">So</a>  we just want to mention, we know a lot of stuff's been going on in the city this week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=59.945">We</a>  did hear, just to follow up on our last episode, that the teachers <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=63.549">ratified</a>  their contract. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=64.65">It</a>  sounds like it's a very similar proposal as we heard the Teachers Association talk about on that episode. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=73.398">So</a>  they did amend some of the plans for Wednesday for extending the day on Wednesday for the elementary schools and it was a similar or the same <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=84.635">proposal</a>  in terms of payment and payment increases over the next three years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=90.758">And</a>  what I did not understand, I don't think when we were talking to them, was there's a percentage that they're asking for for a raise, so something around 8%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=99.982">And</a>  that is split up over three years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=103.243">So</a>  they'll get a portion of that raise the first year, a portion the second year, a portion the third year, and then it sounds like the piece that they were a little on the fence about was, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=112.707">last</a>  1% would they would get on the last day of the contract so technically counts for the next year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=119.17">So</a>  that was helpful to get some understanding around but it sounds like we heard in City Council or School Committee, City Council, School Committee this week that they did ratify that but you know obviously there was a lot of other things happening in that meeting that uh Chelly and I did.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=135.296">It</a>  was certainly a heavy meeting.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=137.036">Yeah</a>  heavy meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=138.137">It</a>  was heavy week I think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=141.138">Yeah,</a>  I don't know if you have anything you want to say about it.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=143.099">I</a>  mean it's clear to me that folks feel very passionately about all of the ongoings this week and that everyone is wanting to offer a solution that they feel will sort of mitigate the issues at hand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=162.501">I</a>  think understanding around the structure of leadership and what different roles can do is important to kind of grapple with is think understanding what funding sources are available and for what and what timelines is important to think about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=178.25">One</a>  of my biggest takeaways from watching the school committee meeting was to really be thinking about our learning beliefs as a district and to pursue what it would look like to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=190.858">imagine</a>  a school system that is built from the lens of critically thinking students and building folks who are resilient learners, pie-in-the-sky thoughts, big thoughts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=203.895">And</a>  I also realize that people are looking for immediate kind of solutions that will <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=209.705">support</a>  some peace right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=212.749">So</a>  lots of space between those two thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=214.911">Yeah</a>  I was up early the morning after that meeting just like running through everything that like I wish that I'd been able to say in that or just contribute to that meeting and I think like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=225.083">In</a>  my real life, I work with victims of trauma, and it just was really striking to me that next morning, like, really sinking in that, like, all these people were really traumatized on Monday, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=234.348">The</a>  students, the parents wondering what was happening to their kids, teachers, school committee members, just community members knowing that this was something that was going on in our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=243.613">And</a>  I, like, talk a lot in my job about, like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=248.566">anger,</a>  right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=249.146">And</a>  anger being a very normal response to situations like this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=252.809">And</a>  it's anger not necessarily being a feeling that we have a lot of control over, though I do think where we can have some control is like how we express that anger and this distinction between destructive anger and constructive anger. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=267.421">And</a>  I think what would be helpful for us as a community is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=273.142">to</a>  find some ways to express that anger or to sort of have that anger process a little bit, but to also get to a place where we can use it in a productive way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=284.948">I</a>  think that there is an importance to having those feelings, understanding those feelings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=292.933">And</a>  like we heard some people say, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=295.734">having</a>  that be a force that unites us, because I think I was hearing a lot of the same things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=301.179">We</a>  don't want this to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=302.08">We</a>  never wanted this to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=303.422">We</a>  want to find a solution, and also, we're kind of overwhelmed by this problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=307.325">We</a>  don't know that we totally understand it, and it's not going to be one person or one body that fixes it.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=314.759">Sure,</a>  and also the notion that obviously this week feels so pertinent to the here and now, but to understand that these pieces have moved in the Medford school systems for many, many years, and that we're seeing patterns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=331.644">Also,</a>  I just wanted to kind of highlight, there's a lot of talk about the good kids are doing X, Y, and Z, and other kids are doing something else. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=342.177">I</a>  spent a lot of the meeting wanting and wishing that I had said that there are no good and bad kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=347.26">There</a>  are kids who have been served in one way and there are kids who have had other experiences. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=352.664">And</a>  by the time you're bringing weapons to school, likely you've been failed by systemic reasons or failed by adults or both habitually. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=361.329">So</a>  to move with that understanding as well as we think about what are good next steps or strong, salient next steps.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=370.234">Yeah,</a>  and saying like that sort of not minimizing that whole child, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=376.457">Like</a>  what are they being exposed to outside of school? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=379.259">What</a>  are they hearing inside of school? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=380.699">And</a>  how does that all kind of come together? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=383.08">How</a>  can that also be part of the solution, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=385.501">How</a>  do we think about that?</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=387.402">And</a>  frankly, like to your point, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=389.594">We</a>  may or may not have been displaying adequate decorum as adults in this city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=395.8">And</a>  we've had several years now of recorded behaviors that might be less than <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=405.801">we</a>  can be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=407.643">And</a>  our kids are watching.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=410.365">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=412.047">I</a>  also just want to mention that we had planned to talk to our mayor today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=416.691">We</a>  decided to sort of give her some space. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=418.713">I</a>  think she's working on a lot, going through a lot, so we want her to be able to focus on that and we'll hopefully be able to connect with her in the new year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=427.04">We'd</a>  hope to hear a little bit about the teacher negotiations, but obviously <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=432.245">new</a>  things have come up and evolved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=433.707">So</a>  yeah, we'll hopefully earmark that for next year.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=437.432">For</a>  sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=437.812">And</a>  if there are folks, we realize that people have big feelings on a lot that's gone on this week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=442.419">So</a>  if folks feel like they'd want to reach out to Medford Bites and have a conversation, we're super excited about anyone who wants to talk.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=449.664">Yeah,</a>  reach out to us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=451.125">It's</a>  pretty easy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=451.746">You</a>  can find us on Facebook, Instagram, and also you can email us at medfordpod at gmail.com.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=457.612">Email</a>  us.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=459.734">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=459.974">And</a>  so, um, we're going to transition to kind of our end of the year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=465.105">episode.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=465.685">So</a>  we'd asked folks to share with us highlights of this year and hopes that they have for next year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=472.008">So</a>  we, I actually had the great opportunity of going into an eighth grade classroom and talking about podcasting and showing them some of the ways that I do my work here and we got to practice doing that by then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=485.194">So</a>  you'll hear from a bunch of students from Ms. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=487.295">Wayland's</a>  class at the Andrews as part of that, but also some other <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=491.557">community</a>  members that have shared their thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=494.538">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=495.458">Thank</a>  you to folks who shared, especially those eighth graders.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=498.179">Yeah,</a>  they're great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=499.42">They're</a>  doing some great work in that class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=500.72">We'll</a>  hear from it in a couple of episodes, but they are very creative, very dedicated teachers that they have, and she's worked with them a few years in a row, I think, doing this podcast project, but it's really innovative and really cool, I think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=513.604">Do</a>  you want me to go first, Shelley?</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=517.981">Um,</a>  sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=518.421">Ping</a>  pong.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=519.922">Ping</a>  pong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=521.903">Popcorn.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=522.544">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=522.964">Just</a>  kidding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=523.324">It's</a>  definitely called popcorn.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=525.986">No,</a>  we can create our own.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=527.927">We</a>  have Medford Bites Target.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=532.549">Yeah,</a>  I think highlights of the year for me, definitely this collaboration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=536.491">So,</a>  Jelly and I, we began working together on the podcast this year, and that's been really, really <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=543.876">fun</a>  and helpful to me and to the podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=547.585">It's</a>  been great getting to know you a little bit more, Chelly.</p>

href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1341.142">I</a>  had the honor and privilege of being featured in a Medford Bites podcast episode this past March discussing my business, Acupuncture Together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1349.891">I</a>  want to share some highlights from this past year, both personally and professionally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1356.227">First</a>  of all, I am glad that life is feeling more normal these days since the arrival of COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1361.892">January</a>  and February at the clinic were very quiet, I think due to fears of the Omicron variant, as well as numerous snowstorms. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1370.459">As</a>  the year progressed, it seems that many people became comfortable going out and to various places, including acupuncture together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1378.886">I've</a>  been so pleased to reconnect with my former patients this year who I had not seen since before COVID once they finally felt comfortable coming back in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1387.17">Our</a>  business is back to operating at a sustainable level after having had a couple rocky years following the COVID lockdown. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1394.348">This</a>  year, I completed several continuing education courses, including three courses on the treatment of infertility, a course on the treatment of perimenopausal transition, and a course with six different instructors discussing the treatment of shoulder pain with various methods. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1411.221">I'm</a>  currently in the process of finishing a course on using acupuncture to support breast cancer patients during and after their breast cancer treatments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1420.547">On</a>  a personal note, I had some tremendously fun and fulfilling athletic achievements this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1426.832">I</a>  competed in my first open water swim race in August, the Glen Lake One Mile Swim, followed by the Title IX Sprint Triathlon this September, which was my first ever triathlon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1438.6">At</a>  the triathlon, I ran into our very own mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, before the start of the race. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1444.705">We</a>  chatted while we waited for the start and entered side by side in the swim portion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1449.522">Later</a>  this fall, I competed in the Loco Half Marathon and the BAA Half Marathon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1455.169">This</a>  was very special for me because for many years, I haven't been able to compete in these sorts of events due to some health problems. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1463.038">Finally</a>  improving my health and being able to train and compete was truly a joy for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1468.351">I</a>  also enjoyed some wonderful travel this year with my family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1471.775">With</a>  my husband, 9-year-old daughter, and 7-year-old son, we traveled to Aruba over February vacation week and to Colorado in August. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1480.324">We</a>  enjoyed some incredible sightseeing and many firsts for my kids, including horseback riding, snorkeling, and seeing mountains and all kinds of wildlife. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1490.808">My</a>  children are thriving at the Brooks School this year, and we are grateful that school feels normal for them once again after all the changes that took place for COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1499.031">My</a>  husband Chet, who is an engineer and project manager at Massport, won two awards this year for his work on the Birth 10 project in Boston, where large container ships come in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1510.314">One</a>  award was presented to him in Hawaii, so we had the good fortune to take a trip to Hawaii together, where he received an award and presented two papers on his work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1520.008">Although</a>  this year started out a bit difficult, it ended up being a truly great year for me and for my family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CuUzlpgN2atD2ACLV7LEs?t=1525.63">Happy</a>  holidays. <a
