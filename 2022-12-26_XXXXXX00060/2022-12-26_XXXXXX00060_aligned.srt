1
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,558
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,438
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,820
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,862
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,204
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:28,169
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,271
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,753
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:43,508
Hey, Charlie.

10
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,811
Hi, Daniel.

11
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,595
So we're sitting here just a couple days before the holidays.

12
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,439
We're going to be recording our last episode of the year.

13
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:54,740
So exciting.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,721
Yeah.

15
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,904
So we just want to mention, we know a lot of stuff's been going on in the city this week.

16
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:02,909
We did hear, just to follow up on our last episode, that the teachers

17
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:04,590
ratified their contract.

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:13,378
It sounds like it's a very similar proposal as we heard the Teachers Association talk about on that episode.

19
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:21,826
So they did amend some of the plans for Wednesday for extending the day on Wednesday for the elementary schools and it was a similar or the same

20
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:30,538
proposal in terms of payment and payment increases over the next three years.

21
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:38,541
And what I did not understand, I don't think when we were talking to them, was there's a percentage that they're asking for for a raise, so something around 8%.

22
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:43,183
And that is split up over three years.

23
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:51,567
So they'll get a portion of that raise the first year, a portion the second year, a portion the third year, and then it sounds like the piece that they were a little on the fence about was,

24
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:57,769
last 1% would they would get on the last day of the contract so technically counts for the next year.

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:15,276
So that was helpful to get some understanding around but it sounds like we heard in City Council or School Committee, City Council, School Committee this week that they did ratify that but you know obviously there was a lot of other things happening in that meeting that uh Chelly and I did.

26
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,736
It was certainly a heavy meeting.

27
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,077
Yeah heavy meeting.

28
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,557
It was heavy week I think.

29
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:23,079
Yeah, I don't know if you have anything you want to say about it.

30
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:40,025
I mean it's clear to me that folks feel very passionately about all of the ongoings this week and that everyone is wanting to offer a solution that they feel will sort of mitigate the issues at hand.

31
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:55,969
I think understanding around the structure of leadership and what different roles can do is important to kind of grapple with is think understanding what funding sources are available and for what and what timelines is important to think about.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:08,697
One of my biggest takeaways from watching the school committee meeting was to really be thinking about our learning beliefs as a district and to pursue what it would look like to

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:23,114
imagine a school system that is built from the lens of critically thinking students and building folks who are resilient learners, pie-in-the-sky thoughts, big thoughts.

34
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:28,581
And I also realize that people are looking for immediate kind of solutions that will

35
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,008
support some peace right now.

36
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:34,431
So lots of space between those two thoughts.

37
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:44,222
Yeah I was up early the morning after that meeting just like running through everything that like I wish that I'd been able to say in that or just contribute to that meeting and I think like

38
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:54,308
In my real life, I work with victims of trauma, and it just was really striking to me that next morning, like, really sinking in that, like, all these people were really traumatized on Monday, right?

39
00:03:54,348 --> 00:04:02,993
The students, the parents wondering what was happening to their kids, teachers, school committee members, just community members knowing that this was something that was going on in our city.

40
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:06,655
And I, like, talk a lot in my job about, like,

41
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,086
anger, right?

42
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:12,429
And anger being a very normal response to situations like this.

43
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:27,361
And it's anger not necessarily being a feeling that we have a lot of control over, though I do think where we can have some control is like how we express that anger and this distinction between destructive anger and constructive anger.

44
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:31,864
And I think what would be helpful for us as a community is

45
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:43,368
to find some ways to express that anger or to sort of have that anger process a little bit, but to also get to a place where we can use it in a productive way.

46
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:51,692
I think that there is an importance to having those feelings, understanding those feelings.

47
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,353
And like we heard some people say,

48
00:04:55,734 --> 00:05:01,119
having that be a force that unites us, because I think I was hearing a lot of the same things.

49
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,040
We don't want this to happen.

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,101
We never wanted this to happen.

51
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:07,305
We want to find a solution, and also, we're kind of overwhelmed by this problem.

52
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:13,932
We don't know that we totally understand it, and it's not going to be one person or one body that fixes it.

53
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:29,964
Sure, and also the notion that obviously this week feels so pertinent to the here and now, but to understand that these pieces have moved in the Medford school systems for many, many years, and that we're seeing patterns.

54
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:40,747
Also, I just wanted to kind of highlight, there's a lot of talk about the good kids are doing X, Y, and Z, and other kids are doing something else.

55
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:47,220
I spent a lot of the meeting wanting and wishing that I had said that there are no good and bad kids.

56
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,903
There are kids who have been served in one way and there are kids who have had other experiences.

57
00:05:52,664 --> 00:06:00,769
And by the time you're bringing weapons to school, likely you've been failed by systemic reasons or failed by adults or both habitually.

58
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:09,334
So to move with that understanding as well as we think about what are good next steps or strong, salient next steps.

59
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:16,417
Yeah, and saying like that sort of not minimizing that whole child, right?

60
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:19,219
Like what are they being exposed to outside of school?

61
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,659
What are they hearing inside of school?

62
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,040
And how does that all kind of come together?

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,461
How can that also be part of the solution, right?

64
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,042
How do we think about that?

65
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,783
And frankly, like to your point,

66
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:34,339
We may or may not have been displaying adequate decorum as adults in this city.

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,928
And we've had several years now of recorded behaviors that might be less than

68
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,322
we can be.

69
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,444
And our kids are watching.

70
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:50,826
Absolutely.

71
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:55,810
I also just want to mention that we had planned to talk to our mayor today.

72
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,653
We decided to sort of give her some space.

73
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:05,679
I think she's working on a lot, going through a lot, so we want her to be able to focus on that and we'll hopefully be able to connect with her in the new year.

74
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,203
We'd hope to hear a little bit about the teacher negotiations, but obviously

75
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:13,647
new things have come up and evolved.

76
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:17,031
So yeah, we'll hopefully earmark that for next year.

77
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:17,772
For sure.

78
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:22,399
And if there are folks, we realize that people have big feelings on a lot that's gone on this week.

79
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:29,228
So if folks feel like they'd want to reach out to Medford Bites and have a conversation, we're super excited about anyone who wants to talk.

80
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:30,865
Yeah, reach out to us.

81
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:31,726
It's pretty easy.

82
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:37,091
You can find us on Facebook, Instagram, and also you can email us at medfordpod at gmail.com.

83
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:38,052
Email us.

84
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:39,113
Yeah.

85
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:39,914
Right.

86
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:44,198
And so, um, we're going to transition to kind of our end of the year.

87
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:45,605
episode.

88
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:51,908
So we'd asked folks to share with us highlights of this year and hopes that they have for next year.

89
00:07:52,008 --> 00:08:05,094
So we, I actually had the great opportunity of going into an eighth grade classroom and talking about podcasting and showing them some of the ways that I do my work here and we got to practice doing that by then.

90
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,255
So you'll hear from a bunch of students from Ms.

91
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,717
Wayland's class at the Andrews as part of that, but also some other

92
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,738
community members that have shared their thoughts.

93
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:15,418
I love it.

94
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,019
Thank you to folks who shared, especially those eighth graders.

95
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:18,979
Yeah, they're great.

96
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,700
They're doing some great work in that class.

97
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:33,584
We'll hear from it in a couple of episodes, but they are very creative, very dedicated teachers that they have, and she's worked with them a few years in a row, I think, doing this podcast project, but it's really innovative and really cool, I think.

98
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,585
Do you want me to go first, Shelley?

99
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:38,401
Um, sure.

100
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:39,682
Ping pong.

101
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,743
Ping pong.

102
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:42,364
Popcorn.

103
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:42,944
Yeah.

104
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:43,304
Just kidding.

105
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:45,125
It's definitely called popcorn.

106
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,246
No, we can create our own.

107
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,529
We have Medford Bites Target.

108
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:56,451
Yeah, I think highlights of the year for me, definitely this collaboration.

109
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:02,675
So, Jelly and I, we began working together on the podcast this year, and that's been really, really

110
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,244
fun and helpful to me and to the podcast.

111
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:09,990
It's been great getting to know you a little bit more, Chelly.

112
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:17,577
For me as well, it's amazing that we're already coming up on something that looks like a year as far as this collaboration is concerned.

113
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:27,943
I have been able to use the Medford Bites platform as a space to explore what I've learned in wearing the multiple hats that I have for the city.

114
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:34,147
Just learning about what it logistically means to produce and being able to

115
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:40,011
Occupy a collaboration that is safe and innovative and forward-thinking has been amazing.

116
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,373
So hats off to us for killing it.

117
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:44,714
Yeah.

118
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:45,895
Any other highlights for you?

119
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,132
I'm sure.

120
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:51,016
So this year has meant a lot of transition for me.

121
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:56,281
One of the most exciting possibilities is that next year potentially means graduate school.

122
00:09:57,602 --> 00:10:07,070
So I'll take all of these multiple hats and pursue some classroom hours and think about what a master's in public policy could look like.

123
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,133
My kids had a very solid

124
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:24,373
this is not a semester, I don't know what they're doing, public schools, but they have also experienced transition and I think they are in a much better place emotionally, socially, academically, and I'm grateful for that.

125
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:27,734
There are others.

126
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:32,435
Yeah, kids are a big thing for me, like my older son

127
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:45,275
He's a first grader at the Roberts and he has had just a great year and it's just been really nice to see him adjusting to school and just can't say enough about his teacher and the teachers at the Roberts.

128
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:55,097
Our other son had more of an interesting year in which he had surgery to remove a tumor, which was not something that we were expecting to go through this year.

129
00:10:56,237 --> 00:11:01,719
Would not recommend for anyone, but he had really great care at Boston Children's Hospital.

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,624
Also a place that you never want to have to go to, but they are excellent.

131
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,567
Yeah, yeah, excellent.

132
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,833
And he's been doing great since then, but just, you know, so very grateful for that.

133
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:17,416
Definitely getting through that was a highlight of our year.

134
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:22,788
Lots of support from our friends in Medford, though, and our family.

135
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,549
So to anyone who's listening who was part of that, thank you so much.

136
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,391
I mean, I think the Medford community is a highlight.

137
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:37,255
This platform has given us a chance to connect with folks, build relationships, maintain older relationships.

138
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,536
It's a blast.

139
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:39,916
Yeah.

140
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,349
And one more thing I wanted to do, just give a shout out.

141
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:49,293
Every Friday I do a workout group, um, at car park and that's really sustained me through the pandemic.

142
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:56,658
And those, the ladies in that group have been really supportive of the podcast and of my mental and physical wellbeing.

143
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,720
So I couldn't have gotten through these two years without them.

144
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,281
Yeah.

145
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,462
Love it.

146
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:02,822
Awesome.

147
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,144
So you want to think about hopes for next year?

148
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:06,905
Yeah.

149
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,006
What are you looking forward to?

150
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:08,066
Um,

151
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:17,201
I am looking forward to intentional excitement.

152
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,302
My life has answered to

153
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:45,152
requirements that I haven't been able to design and I am looking forward to the opposite of that where I am building strategic plans for my own life and having a better sense of what's coming my way and having a better way of being able to share with my kids what's happening next in life and hopefully reaping benefits and advancement because of knowing what's coming.

154
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:52,636
I think that is routine, exercise, better eating, sleep, more coffee, more wine.

155
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:54,957
Yeah, a good place to be.

156
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:55,837
All the things.

157
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,438
Good intention there, for sure.

158
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:02,241
For me, I'm looking forward to more podcasting.

159
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:07,664
The library, I'm going to be doing a workshop for kids on podcasting in February, March.

160
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:08,465
Oh, don't miss it.

161
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:08,865
Yeah.

162
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:12,227
I think you can sign up through the library, I'm assuming.

163
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,070
Yeah, I don't know.

164
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,059
I'm looking forward to just what the rest of the year is going to bring or what the new year will bring.

165
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,223
And yeah, I think.

166
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:44,367
My wife talks about it later on in the comments, but just looking forward to adventures and spending time with my family and yeah, just also being part of the Charter Review Committee, I'm not exactly, I always get the title wrong, but being involved in the city in that way and really kind of digging into just the way that our city government works.

167
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:45,208
Absolutely.

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,581
And you're involved in something as well that seems very important.

169
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:49,481
Yeah, Riverbice is busy.

170
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:54,222
So Daniel's on the charter review, and I am on the health curriculum review committee.

171
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:57,843
So we are in it.

172
00:13:58,223 --> 00:13:58,463
Yeah.

173
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:04,145
I'm not sure how much we'll be able to talk about on the podcast, but two exciting things to look forward to for next year.

174
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:04,625
Absolutely.

175
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,640
Signing off.

176
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,161
Yeah.

177
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,904
Happy holidays and wishing everybody a really peaceful, beautiful new year.

178
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:13,124
Yeah.

179
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:17,386
Happy holidays and enjoy the comments from the rest of the people that are coming next.

180
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,189
This is Shannon Heaton.

181
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,311
I live near Wright's Pond where we now have a safe lacrosse walk.

182
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:33,396
And I just love that this year the bike and walking paths expanded even more and connect us all over the place to towns all over the place.

183
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:40,674
I look forward to more infrastructure, more expansion of stuff for humans, not for cars.

184
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:46,876
And also, I want to say that I'm really grateful to all the Medford drivers who are so gracious to bikers and pedestrians.

185
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,857
There are a lot of us out there, so I hope we keep that up in the new year too.

186
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:53,337
What's your name?

187
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:55,538

188
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,418

I played with cars at Denise's.

190
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,839
Playing with cars at Denise's.

191
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,680
And what are you excited for for next year?

192
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,698
Going to bees.

193
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:05,958
Going where?

194
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:06,779
To bees.

195
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,459
Going to the beach?

196
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,819
Yeah, to the beach.

197
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,140
That's right.

198
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,460
My name is Cole.

199
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,360
My pronouns are he and him.

00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:24,582
I'm first grade in the Waterbirds Elementary School.

201
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:31,183
The best part of my year was New York Beach and what I'm looking for next year is New York Beach.

202
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,893
My name is Brittany.

203
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,856
My pronouns are she, her.

204

The highlight of my year was getting a clean bill of health for my little son.

205
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:48,910
And the best part that I'm looking forward to next year is all the adventures we're going to take together.

206
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:57,056
Hello, I am Thomas, an eighth grader at Andrews Middle School.

207
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,039

00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,983
And, yes.

209
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,645
This year was, it is a year.

210
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,686
We have less COVID around, which is nice.

211
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:16,349
And, yeah.

212
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,872
I only have one hope for next year, and that's that I don't get sent to Catholic school.

213
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,007
My name is James.

214
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,488
My pronouns are he, him.

215
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:32,330
I'm in eighth grade, and I go to Andrews Middle School.

216
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:42,575
I don't really have any specific highlights of a year, but I enjoy almost every day, because I get to see my friends.

217
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:54,140
So my hope for next year is to play basketball.

218
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:01,307
My name is Sydney, I'm an eighth grader at the Andrews Middle School, and my pronouns are she, her.

219
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:09,911
Some of my highlights over the past year were that I learned a lot in school, and my hopes for the new year are to learn more and to continue to succeed in school.

00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:16,795

221

My name is Sophia, I go to Andrews Middle School, I'm in 8th grade and my pronouns are she, her.

223
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:38,511

00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,074
My name is Avery, my pronouns are she, her.

225
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm in 8th grade at the Andrews Middle School and one of my highlights of this year was playing hockey and one of my hopes for next year is to choose the right high school for me.

226
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:56,566
Hi, my name is Dominic.

227
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:57,347

00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:08,081
This year, one of my highlights is going to Fan Expo Boston and meeting a voice actor for my favorite video game.

230
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:14,569
Next year, I'm looking forward to going to high school and probably my birthday, too.

231
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:17,958
My name is the Angel.

232
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,360
My pronouns are he, him.

233
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,625
The school that I'm in is Angel Middle School.

234
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:24,308
I'm in grade eight.

235
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:29,415
I was new to this school this year, but now I'm happy here.

236
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm looking forward to joining a drama club in high school.

237
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,917
Hi, my name's Kian Morris.

238
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:38,378
I'm an eighth grader at the Andrews Middle School.

239
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:45,601
I'd say the best highlight of my year was going biking around local area with my friends over the summer.

240
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,682
I know I live in North Medford.

241
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:54,245
We got to bike to West Medford a lot, and we even biked to Burlington Mall, which was the furthest away we've ever done.

242
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,345
I thought it was really fun.

243
00:18:55,565 --> 00:19:02,048
What I'm looking forward to next year is probably the same thing and getting around to new places and trying to explore.

244
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,204
My name is Harry.

245
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,665
My pronouns are he, him.

246
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,266
I am in 8th grade at the Andrews Middle School.

247
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:16,011
The highlight of my year was joining marching band, and I'm looking forward to the next season of marching band.

248
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,792
Okay.

249
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,534
My name is Bronwyn.

250
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:27,118
My pronouns are she, her, and I'm in 8th grade at the Andrews Middle School.

251
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:31,661
Uh, the high- probably the highlight of my year was

252
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:38,822
walking from the school to the Medford Public Library with my friends.

253
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:47,408
It's pretty cool that such a cool library is just walking distance from the school.

254
00:19:48,429 --> 00:20:00,499
And this one time, one of my friends wanted to come with us, but the thing is, she didn't tell her parents, so they ended up calling the police.

255
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:04,264
But it was all worked out in the end.

256
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:07,567
Uh... My... I'm...

257
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:19,651
The thing that I'm excited for for next year is probably just high school in general.

258
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:27,573
They had like a open house thing where you got to go around and see all the classes.

259
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:37,756
And I thought it was cool that you could learn stuff like woodworking and culinary in school.

260
00:20:39,057 --> 00:20:40,437
So that's pretty interesting.

261
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:49,443
Hey Medford Bites listeners, this is Teresa and Mike from reimagined and we're wishing you all a wonderful 2023.

262
00:20:49,583 --> 00:21:01,607
We here at reimagined have had a really grateful 2022 with filled with lots of community events and just community in general here in the gym.

263
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:15,114
We have met so many of you at various events, and so many of you have reached out and or joined our fun and quirky gym community, and we're so very thankful for that.

264
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:22,478
We're planning to continue to partner with various Medford events and Medford Recreation over 2023.

265
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:23,518
We will be doing our

266
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,924
free sweat into the 80s class all through the summer, through the Medford Rec, and we hope to see you there.

267
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:39,368
We're also looking forward to expanding our team in 2023 and offering more trainings and classes.

268
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,530
So if you want to be part of our team, hit us up.

269
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,811
We'd love to hear from you.

270
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:48,634
And we hope to see you out there and continue to have a wonderful, awesome days.

271
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,678
Hi, my name is Charlotte Tatey.

272
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:53,300
My pronouns are she, her.

273
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,421
I'm in eighth grade at the Andrews Middle School.

274
00:21:56,022 --> 00:22:02,727
My highlight of the year was probably playing volleyball at the club with my friends.

275
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:12,175
And what I'm looking forward to is probably the volleyball team at the high school next year.

276
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:20,381
Hey Medford Bites listeners, this is Justine Myers, pronouns she, her, hers.

277
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:29,871
I had the honor and privilege of being featured in a Medford Bites podcast episode this past March discussing my business, Acupuncture Together.

278
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:35,076
I want to share some highlights from this past year, both personally and professionally.

279
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:41,191
First of all, I am glad that life is feeling more normal these days since the arrival of COVID.

280
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:49,558
January and February at the clinic were very quiet, I think due to fears of the Omicron variant, as well as numerous snowstorms.

281
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:58,065
As the year progressed, it seems that many people became comfortable going out and to various places, including acupuncture together.

282
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:06,290
I've been so pleased to reconnect with my former patients this year who I had not seen since before COVID once they finally felt comfortable coming back in.

283
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:13,093
Our business is back to operating at a sustainable level after having had a couple rocky years following the COVID lockdown.

284
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:30,360
This year, I completed several continuing education courses, including three courses on the treatment of infertility, a course on the treatment of perimenopausal transition, and a course with six different instructors discussing the treatment of shoulder pain with various methods.

285
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:39,547
I'm currently in the process of finishing a course on using acupuncture to support breast cancer patients during and after their breast cancer treatments.

286
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:45,831
On a personal note, I had some tremendously fun and fulfilling athletic achievements this year.

287
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:57,840
I competed in my first open water swim race in August, the Glen Lake One Mile Swim, followed by the Title IX Sprint Triathlon this September, which was my first ever triathlon.

288
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,024
At the triathlon, I ran into our very own mayor, Brianna Longo Kern, before the start of the race.

289
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:08,528
We chatted while we waited for the start and entered side by side in the swim portion.

290
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:14,648
Later this fall, I competed in the Loco Half Marathon and the BAA Half Marathon.

291
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:21,817
This was very special for me because for many years, I haven't been able to compete in these sorts of events due to some health problems.

292
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,043
Finally improving my health and being able to train and compete was truly a joy for me.

293
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:31,054
I also enjoyed some wonderful travel this year with my family.

294
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:39,563
With my husband, 9-year-old daughter, and 7-year-old son, we traveled to Aruba over February vacation week and to Colorado in August.

295
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:49,595
We enjoyed some incredible sightseeing and many firsts for my kids, including horseback riding, snorkeling, and seeing mountains and all kinds of wildlife.

296
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:58,070
My children are thriving at the Brooks School this year, and we are grateful that school feels normal for them once again after all the changes that took place for COVID.

297
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:09,154
My husband Chet, who is an engineer and project manager at Massport, won two awards this year for his work on the Birth 10 project in Boston, where large container ships come in.

298
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:18,897
One award was presented to him in Hawaii, so we had the good fortune to take a trip to Hawaii together, where he received an award and presented two papers on his work.

299
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:25,610
Although this year started out a bit difficult, it ended up being a truly great year for me and for my family.

300
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,271
Happy holidays.

301
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,951
I wish you all the best in 2023.

302
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:32,412
My name is AD.

303
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:33,953
My pronouns are they, them.

304
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:37,314
I go to the Andrews Middle School, and I'm in eighth grade.

305
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:44,588
Um, the highlight of this year for me was probably learning how to solve like five types of Rubik's cubes.

306
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:46,269
Cause it's fun for me.

307
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:47,269
I like doing them.

308
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:54,293
Um, next year I want to like learn Yoruba, which is the language that my family speaks.

309
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:56,333
