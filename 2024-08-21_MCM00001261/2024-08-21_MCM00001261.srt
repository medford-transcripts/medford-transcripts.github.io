1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're all set to get started.

00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:14,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Public meeting of the City of Medford License Commission for August 21st, which was originally an unscheduled meeting, will come to order.

3
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have an agenda for this meeting.

4
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:26,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the minutes were held up.

5
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So we weren't able to review them.

6
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:30,072
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the 1st item on the agenda.

7
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:34,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, is this, um, is this correct?

8
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:39,637
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, uh, I can make a motion to, um, waive the minutes until the next meeting.

9
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:40,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

10
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:41,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:49,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'll make a motion to waive the minutes of the unscheduled July meeting, um, for,

00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:53,183
[SPEAKER_06]: until the September meeting.

13
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, you want to second that?

14
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I second the motion to waive the minutes of the July 17, and we'll review them in September when we meet.

15
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:14,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

16
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,568
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

17
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Now when we come back.

00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:22,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,000
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

23
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:30,303
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

24
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:30,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

25
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:31,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

26
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:32,664
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

27
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:36,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the motion passes.

28
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Helen, you're coming up broken up again.

29
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:43,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's the same issue we might've had last month.

30
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,191
[SPEAKER_06]: You're freezing, or freezing up.

31
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:48,572
[SPEAKER_06]: But just so you're aware.

32
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see what the next item.

33
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:53,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

34
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:55,114
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

35
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what the next item on the agenda is.

36
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:02,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Fuji.

37
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a representative from Blue Fuji?

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:06,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

39
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:08,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

40
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:13,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you kindly state your name and address for the record, please?

00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,109
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Ziyi Ouyang.

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the assistant manager in Blue Fuji, Manfred.

43
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:21,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

44
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

45
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:33,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what we're here for today, sir, is the, uh, an issue of compliance issue.

46
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:40,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there was a, um, a compliance check done at your establishment.

47
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let me just open up my file.

48
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:44,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

49
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:45,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

50
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:48,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

51
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,039
[SPEAKER_06]: on June 20th of 2024.

52
00:02:52,199 --> 00:03:01,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And you folks attempted to, or did sell alcohol to a minor.

53
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:16,426
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Medford, with the police department, the Board of Health, was doing a compliance check that evening as part of all of the restaurants and package stores in the city.

54
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:25,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You were sent an original notice to appear before this board in July.

55
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a reason why you didn't attend, sir?

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in July 17th, we didn't receive the envelope on time.

57
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:38,382
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we missed the scheduled meeting.

58
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a scheduled meeting.

59
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:43,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a reason why you didn't attend?

60
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we didn't receive the envelope.

61
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:45,764
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why.

62
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:47,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't receive the information?

63
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:58,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, would you be able to I heard that you didn't receive the information because we sent it regular mail and email.

64
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:03,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So, would you kindly just email a secretary area.

65
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Your current information, your email address.

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:18,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Postal address any the managerial license the owner would just send her so we know that we're reaching the right person when we send you a notice.

67
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:19,725
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

68
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:24,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, can I say something?

69
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

70
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:38,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm in China and the blue email and I cannot open in China, so I didn't see any messages from, you know, cannot see any, you know, email.

71
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And the letter you mailed to us, we didn't get it.

72
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:44,719
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we missed the first meeting.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And the email I cannot open in China, so I don't know.

74
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:53,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay, so the mail, I'm sorry, Mr. chair.

75
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:57,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what it's my understanding that you didn't get the mail.

76
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So we sent it by mail, which you didn't get.

77
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you didn't open the email address that we sent from the city of Medford.

78
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, email is because I'm in vacation.

79
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in China.

80
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:15,212
[SPEAKER_12]: In China, I cannot go and open the Google.

81
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:21,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So also my email address is bluefujibosney at gmail.com.

82
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So I cannot open.

83
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,497
[SPEAKER_12]: I also didn't check.

84
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:52,745
[SPEAKER_12]: uh didn't China cannot open so that's why I cannot check when I go back to China when I go back to here and I see the email so I open the mailbox but it's already go because that's why and I we call the city hall immediately and ask and request can we give another choice to and have another meeting that's why I say

85
00:05:53,445 --> 00:06:03,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Daria, if you don't mind, can you kind of explain the procedure when we do want to see some of the merchants come before the commission?

86
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:05,674
[SPEAKER_04]: How much leeway do we give them?

87
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we give them three days?

88
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we give them two weeks?

89
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the procedure to notify the merchants that we'd like to speak with them before the commission when they get caught up in a control compliance check?

90
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this went out July 11th, so July 11th.

91
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and we were asking for them to appear on the 17th, so that's a week.

92
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, according to chapter 138, I don't know the section, but it's either 14 or 10 days, Commissioner, that we have to notify them, and it can't be, it's got to be within

93
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:57,231
[SPEAKER_06]: the 14, so it could be a day before, two days before, 10 days before, 14 days before, whatever it's stated in 138.

94
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:08,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And we kind of try to follow that rule to give everybody ample time, but apparently there's some kind of an issue with your email and maybe going out of the country or something.

95
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:17,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a personal email address that you just have here that, you know, if this commission wants to send you something, we can get you immediately?

96
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two Gmail addresses.

97
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,280
[SPEAKER_13]: They're both owned by my manager here.

98
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:34,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think I briefed both of them at gmail.com.

99
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:37,264
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to give it over the air or over the meeting.

100
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:40,785
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just email it right to Daria from that email, okay?

101
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:45,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way she'll have that email and we have to notify you in the future.

102
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:56,720
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you're wondering, you know, why we're asking questions about this legally, we could have suspended your license but not appearing before the commission.

104
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:04,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So we said, well, maybe there's something here that we don't understand, or maybe they didn't get it.

105
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just something?

106
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:13,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've always prided ourselves on working with the community, the merchants, giving you the benefit of the doubt.

107
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:22,749
[SPEAKER_04]: When we see things, we don't immediately jump to the letter of the law, so to speak, because there's always two sides to every story.

108
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of why we were wondering,

109
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,712
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, why we didn't see you on the 17th.

110
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:39,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So just keep that in mind that we need to get, we need to lock down how to get in touch with you if this ever occurs again.

111
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:44,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, maybe next time we won't be as understanding.

112
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it that way.

113
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:46,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

114
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:47,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

115
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,052
[SPEAKER_12]: next time and we will not be having like this one.

116
00:08:51,152 --> 00:09:00,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if I go back to China, I will give my email and give it to another manager.

117
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:07,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Because this time I didn't give the password when I go back and I didn't give him password.

118
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,163
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why we cannot open.

119
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:13,105
[SPEAKER_12]: But the next time I will, I will give him before I go back.

120
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,167
[SPEAKER_12]: But normally I will not go back to them.

121
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:17,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sorry for that.

122
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we, we understand.

123
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:19,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

124
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

125
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:30,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well at this time, what I'm going to do is turn this, um, this hearing, uh, for this particular case over to Lieutenant Lockowitz, Medford Police Department.

126
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:36,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And he can, um, he can address, um, you folks and, and we'll go from there.

127
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:44,216
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you an opportunity to respond to Lieutenant Lockowitz and, um, and, uh, Officer Smith as well.

128
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:46,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Lieutenant?

129
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you commissioners and everybody else.

130
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:51,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Good afternoon.

131
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:04,393
[SPEAKER_11]: This violation occurred on June 20th as part of one of two days in which we conducted citywide compliance checks.

132
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, being that there's just this one, we did all the other ones prior.

133
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I figured I'll, I'll turn it over to officer Smith, um, because the entire report is, is written from him.

134
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, if that's okay, I'll just turn it to officer Smith.

135
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:21,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

136
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:23,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.

137
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,427
[SPEAKER_01]: On Thursday, June 20th, myself and Ms.

138
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:36,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Dhingra, who is the City of Medford's Prevention and Outreach Manager, conducted compliance checks with two 17-year-old juveniles in the City of Medford.

139
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:41,212
[SPEAKER_01]: At approximately 6.20 p.m., I parked on Ashland Street.

140
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in an unmarked vehicle with Ms.

141
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Dhingra and the two 17-year-olds.

142
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:51,839
[SPEAKER_01]: The two 17-year-olds were instructed to enter Blue Fuji and attempt to purchase alcohol.

143
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,902
[SPEAKER_01]: They were instructed to purchase Bud Light if possible.

144
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,784
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not trying to deceive anyone.

145
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:04,949
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were asked their age, they were told to say that they were 17 years old.

146
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,712
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no form of identification on their person before entering.

147
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,294
[SPEAKER_01]: and the two 17-year-olds entered Blue Fuji.

148
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximately five minutes later, Ms.

149
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:29,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Dingor received a text from the juveniles and stated that they had been served alcohol, at which time I entered Blue Fuji and observed the two juveniles sitting at a booth in front of them with two Bud Light bottles.

150
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,621
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an alcoholic beverage.

151
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I approached the juveniles.

152
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked them what had transpired.

153
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:40,749
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they had ordered Bud Lights and they were not asked for identification.

154
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:44,372
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not asked how old they were, and they were served the alcohol.

155
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:52,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked them who served them alcohol, and they pointed to the server who was later identified as Ms.

156
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Ziyi Ouyang.

157
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,681
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

158
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,483
[SPEAKER_01]: The gentleman's before the commission today.

159
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that he was the assistant manager.

160
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:03,890
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that he was a server and he'd only worked there a couple months.

161
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: The juveniles then returned to Ms.

162
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:17,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Dhingra, and I spoke to Mr. Ouyang, and I asked him, you know, I explained that he had served alcohol to two juveniles that was 17 years old.

163
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,096
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that he apologized.

164
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:26,860
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that he thought they were tough students and that he usually does not card anybody if they look over the age of 30.

165
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,942
[SPEAKER_01]: These were two 17-year-olds that looked nowhere close to 30.

166
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:38,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked for the manager and I learned that the manager was on vacation.

167
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:43,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I informed Mr. Yang that this would be documented and submitted to this commission.

168
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are essentially the facts.

169
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:49,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

170
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:50,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Officer Smith.

171
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:51,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Officer Smith.

172
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:52,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

173
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

174
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Dinger, would you care to comment?

175
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no additional comments.

176
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That was very accurate as to what happened.

177
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:04,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

178
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, would you like to say anything in your defense?

179
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to speak about the matter of Blue Fuji?

180
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,266
[SPEAKER_13]: I did it by mistake.

181
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so it was a mistake, it was, okay.

182
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Commissioner Allen, would you like to comment?

183
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, these control compliance checks, we take them very seriously.

184
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:48,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll just flip the cards and say, thank goodness,

185
00:13:49,457 --> 00:14:00,761
[SPEAKER_04]: These two were served, and they were double served and triple served, and then they got in the car and they hit somebody or they were wrapped in the car around a tree.

186
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:04,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Because ultimately, that's the whole purpose of this.

187
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:12,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just glad it was a controlled compliance check.

188
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,467
[SPEAKER_04]: As I read through the report, it sounded like they were the only two there.

189
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

190
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Is some business better than no business?

191
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:24,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure what Blue Fuji's philosophy is.

192
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a little disappointed.

193
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:38,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, to be honest with you, we're disappointed with everybody because in this last round of checks, it seemed like we snagged a lot.

194
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:47,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if it's a function of everybody's getting too lax or everyone's just damn grateful that people are coming in and spending money.

195
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what it is.

196
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevertheless, we thank the city for doing these control compliance checks.

197
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, we'll get back to zero rather than whatever the last number was.

198
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair and Mr. Delfano,

199
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, what irks me the most is the phrase about, I thought they were tough students.

200
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure what that means.

201
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that if you're a tough student, you just get a free ticket to come and drink at Blue Fuji?

202
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:32,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure what that sentence means, or maybe I'm reading into it.

203
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Can one of the two of you kind of explain what exactly does that mean, we thought they were tough students?

204
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, at the time, I saw they were above 21 years old.

205
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:45,643
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I mean.

206
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that, making any confusion.

207
00:15:52,452 --> 00:16:01,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you know that if a tough student comes in and they just show you a student ID, it's not okay to serve them, correct?

208
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not acceptable.

209
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:09,578
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a driver's license or passport or something of that nature.

210
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:14,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as we're clear on that from this point forward.

211
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone else on the call that would like to speak on behalf of this?

212
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:39,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, you know, what we feel as though on the first time, it's like my predecessor Alan said, we give everybody one bite of the apple.

213
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:45,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just had your bite of the apple because you didn't show up last month, okay?

214
00:16:46,389 --> 00:17:00,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people that did show up, they got a year probation and it was put into their file that if there were any incidences, we'd have to go to the next step.

215
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:07,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go right to the next step today, because you didn't show up the first time.

216
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:21,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you didn't show up the first time, I could have ordered Lieutenant Larkowitz to go right to your establishment, take the license off the wall, and you wouldn't have been able to sell any liquor for these 30 days between the two meetings.

217
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we didn't have a meeting today, you wouldn't have been able to sell until a scheduled meeting in September.

218
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:29,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how serious this is.

219
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:30,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

220
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want you to understand that.

221
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:42,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the next step is what we're going to do is we're going to give you a one day suspension, but we're going to hold it in abidance.

222
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:53,971
[SPEAKER_06]: What that means is if you don't have any issues like this for the next year, you're all set.

223
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to worry.

224
00:17:56,373 --> 00:18:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do have an issue, then we suspend your license, okay?

225
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,779
[SPEAKER_12]: So, excuse me, can I say something?

226
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I work for Blue Fuji already for almost 10 years.

227
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the time, I do all the job by myself.

228
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:24,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Because this month, it's in June, I go back to China.

229
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:29,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hire this person, Tesla, for I think one and a half months.

230
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,569
[SPEAKER_12]: And I tell them, and a check ID or something, a check ID must do your service at home.

231
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,810
[SPEAKER_12]: I tell them.

232
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, but maybe, and he is new.

233
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:49,997
[SPEAKER_12]: work for this position and have experience is not too many.

234
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:58,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, their day is nearly close, maybe he be busy to closing something.

235
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,472
[SPEAKER_12]: don't check the ID.

236
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:08,376
[SPEAKER_12]: He told me he thinks he's a top student and more than 21.

237
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,559
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks about that, so he forgot to check.

238
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,941
[SPEAKER_12]: This is his mistake.

239
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:19,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I told him he must check, but he didn't do it.

240
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:24,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the time, I think in the day, you do, right?

241
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,572
[SPEAKER_12]: He stays close to something that we forgot to check it.

242
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:30,952
[SPEAKER_12]: It's his mistake.

243
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,273
[SPEAKER_12]: But most of the time, I do.

244
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not on vacation all the time.

245
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I work every day.

246
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

247
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:39,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I check every time.

248
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:45,079
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see when I think you not check only one time.

249
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you check many times.

250
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,723
[SPEAKER_12]: But we didn't make a mistake because I always check ID.

251
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:54,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Even I look at he is a little older.

252
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:59,206
[SPEAKER_12]: The one time I check the customer, can I use your ID?

253
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,567
[SPEAKER_12]: He say, I'm older.

254
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 37.

255
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:05,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I say, for me, I see you are younger.

256
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,070
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I check ID.

257
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:12,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, I promise you, I check every time, even when he looks a little older.

258
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,792
[SPEAKER_12]: When I wonder, I must check the ID immediately.

259
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:19,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I show it, and he will give me the key.

260
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:26,995
[SPEAKER_12]: But because I hire this person in just a short time, and it's just one and a half months, because I go back to China.

261
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:28,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, really so sorry.

262
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you give us a chance.

263
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:31,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

264
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:46,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, we've got a solution for that because the other part of this is from this point forward, any employees that you hire are going to be required to be TIP certified.

265
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what TIP certified is?

266
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:50,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

267
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,300
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called T-I-P-S.

268
00:20:59,411 --> 00:20:59,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I have it.

269
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:01,211
[SPEAKER_06]: You have that?

270
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:01,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

271
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:01,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

272
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:14,895
[SPEAKER_06]: From this point forward, any waiter, waitress, attender, anybody that works in there that's going to handle alcohol will need to be TIP certified.

273
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:25,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what we're requiring you to do is when you hire a new employee, they have 30 days to get their certification.

274
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:26,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they do,

275
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:31,809
[SPEAKER_06]: You take that copy of that certification and you keep it in your file.

276
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:39,935
[SPEAKER_06]: But your current employees, starting today, are going to need to be TIP certified.

277
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:45,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to have 90 days for them to do it, which is three months.

278
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to require you to send those certifications to Daria at the Liquor Commission.

279
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:59,597
[SPEAKER_06]: to prove that they're all TIP certified.

280
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:02,258
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three months to do that, okay?

281
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:11,521
[SPEAKER_06]: From that point on, anybody that comes in that's hired, you have them TIP certified and you keep it in your own file.

282
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,961
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need a copy.

283
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:17,183
[SPEAKER_06]: But just your current employees, we're gonna need a copy, okay?

284
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:20,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all part of this.

285
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:23,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're gonna have the one day suspension held in abidance.

286
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:30,417
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to require all of your employees to be TIP certified.

287
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will verify in 90 days.

288
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll verify in 90 days that they are.

289
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that sound OK to you, Mr. Commissioner?

290
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a little more stringent.

291
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:43,325
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

292
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fair because of the severity of the incident.

293
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:48,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We could be a lot

294
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: harsher because if you go by the rules that have been written by our predecessors, they're a little more harsh.

295
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're fair in working.

296
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:10,823
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand this was a one-time because Blue Fuji, I was very surprised to see you all on the list, honestly, because you guys have always been good.

297
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:14,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're being fair.

298
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:23,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So Daria, if you don't mind, I will second the motion that Chairman Delafano has just laid out.

299
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do second the motion.

300
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:27,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

301
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:29,827
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor, aye.

302
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:31,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

303
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:33,328
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

304
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

305
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:37,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passed.

306
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you folks, you have any questions?

307
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:41,782
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set?

308
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, very good.

309
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

310
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:46,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

311
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming.

312
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for attending.

313
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:52,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

314
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

315
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:55,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

316
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:58,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We are next on the agenda.

317
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:05,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuisine and local at 344 Salem Street.

318
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys still on the call?

319
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, did I see Brian?

320
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw Brian earlier.

321
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:16,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that his dapper picture on the right corner there?

322
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

323
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:18,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

324
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:19,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian, you here?

325
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:22,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.

326
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: This is muting.

327
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:23,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

328
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear you now.

329
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, what is going on here?

330
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoom is not... Hang on one second.

331
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on one second, Brian.

332
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Lieutenant Lockowitz, I'm sorry.

333
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:36,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all set.

334
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: If you and Officer Smith would like to leave, you can.

335
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,927
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not, you're more than welcome to stay on.

336
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:51,528
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a few things going on today, as you can see, and trying to keep you in the loop at the same time, but totally up to you, sir.

337
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

338
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:53,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

339
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

340
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, General.

341
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And same with you, Mr. Griffin, as well.

342
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

343
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

344
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:04,936
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so Brian, you're up next.

345
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, everybody.

346
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:09,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.

347
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, Brian, tell us a little about the event.

348
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's similar to any of the other performance events that we've had here.

349
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:27,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's a local showcase to some music.

350
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a collaboration that we've done with JJ and Cuisine on Locale.

351
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, beer and wine and then food available for service.

352
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just featuring some local musicians.

353
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:49,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

354
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:53,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian, you always do a good job.

355
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We never have any issues with you.

356
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:56,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

357
00:25:56,604 --> 00:26:01,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Daria has your insurance on file and we kind of know the layout there.

358
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So this all looks good as usual.

359
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:08,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have an issue with any of it.

360
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked it over.

361
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:11,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, do you?

362
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I agree.

363
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:17,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, I looked at it too, and you're absolutely right.

364
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:20,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian runs a good shop.

365
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:21,268
[SPEAKER_04]: You must have a huge bouncer.

366
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it is?

367
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the secret?

368
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

369
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a big bouncer?

370
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

371
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Just joking.

372
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,191
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right.

373
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:32,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have the insurance on file, and you could have a great track record.

374
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:39,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'm just going to make a motion to approve the one-day license

375
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: for event them for Thursday, August 22nd on Salem Street.

376
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:49,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

377
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:51,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I will second that motion.

378
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:52,725
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

379
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

380
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:56,227
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

381
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:00,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, motion is passed.

382
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:01,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set, pal.

383
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:02,873
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Brian, you're all set.

384
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:03,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

385
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:04,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone.

386
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:05,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care now.

387
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:05,975
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

388
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, next item on the agenda.

389
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Nick, I believe, right?

390
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take a look.

391
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Nick, yes, you're up next.

392
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:25,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, my apologies.

393
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have made a slight error in my application form.

394
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:30,106
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Daria sent me a new one.

395
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,768
[SPEAKER_14]: whinging in Alan's ear early about traveling a lot.

396
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I said I was a non-profit.

397
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,052
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will click and make sure I didn't do that incorrectly.

398
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,673
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll send this to Daria.

399
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:48,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't do it speedily enough to correct my fat finger clicking the wrong thing.

400
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:52,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So my apologies for... Yeah, not a problem.

401
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:57,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I noticed too, Nick, was under the full description,

402
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:03,644
[SPEAKER_06]: On page 2, you wrote the alcohol will only be served in and it stopped there.

403
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know where you were going with that.

404
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you picked that up and maybe corrected it on the new application that you sent the dairy.

405
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:11,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

406
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I better correct that as well.

407
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,933
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, just check it out.

408
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about what's going on.

409
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:21,475
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of event is it?

410
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:28,157
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is basically in West Medford, in the car park behind Snappy Patty's.

411
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:35,800
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in collaboration with the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the West Medford Chapter.

412
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,196
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically, it's a celebration.

413
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,899
[SPEAKER_14]: They used to do a thing, I think, a while back for Halloween.

414
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that ended.

415
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,301
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was chatting with them.

416
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,504
[SPEAKER_14]: They're trying to revitalize some fun in West Bedford.

417
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,185
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got together with the chamber.

418
00:28:52,626 --> 00:29:00,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically, it's a food tasting, music, and beer event, which will be from 4 to 8 p.m.

419
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Sort of very family-friendly.

420
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:05,214
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got two bands playing, all local people.

421
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:13,514
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Chamber is in charge of getting various food vendors who are all from all around the world.

422
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,096
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Paul Revere Cafe is going to be doing some stuff.

423
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:19,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming Simple Fare, Snappy Patty.

424
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, it's just a very sort of community-ized event.

425
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,646
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's about it.

426
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:27,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

427
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they still have that container out back there?

428
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:37,742
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a small container that goes on the back of a tractor trailer that the side was cut out that Nick can make like a little area.

429
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:41,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that's probably Snappy Patty says that.

430
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:42,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is it?

431
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

432
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that was theirs.

433
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it there.

434
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:51,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think it's their sort of outdoor dining experience.

435
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:53,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Gotcha.

436
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:58,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always liked that spot for events because it's only three points to get in.

437
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:02,290
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only three ways you can get in and out of that whole area.

438
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very easy to control, you know.

439
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of them you can enter by car and then there's that alley in between.

440
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:14,200
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Pompeo insurances and I forget the other.

441
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a great place.

442
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:24,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions.

443
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick is right.

444
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:29,368
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to do the Halloween one there, and then it kind of stopped.

445
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:29,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if

446
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: If COVID put the kibosh on it, I'm just not sure.

447
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:41,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm glad that an outdoor event has been resurrected to be held there in the municipal parking lot, right?

448
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I kept seeing Karpack.

449
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, he's up the heights?

450
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I see Karpack, I immediately think North Medford.

451
00:30:49,712 --> 00:31:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me start my babbling here and let me make a motion to approve the one day license for the event of September 14th in West Medford in the municipal parking lot behind 465 High Street.

452
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that motion.

453
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:16,378
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could just add to it to make sure that we have the updated application as well beforehand.

454
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.

455
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:21,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second the motion.

456
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:22,263
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

457
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:23,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

458
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:24,845
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

459
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:27,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the motion passes.

460
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set, Nick.

461
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you very much, and I'll get that off to you.

462
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to rain that day, so you're going to be good.

463
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent, thank you.

464
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with the event.

465
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers, have a good one.

466
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:40,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye now.

467
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:46,076
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, next on the agenda, deep cuts.

468
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Jeff here.

469
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:52,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I saw Jeff earlier, didn't I?

470
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

471
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering the same thing, but I sent him the Zoom link, so I don't know.

472
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:01,084
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you know what we can do, Dario?

473
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll move him down to the end so we don't tie people up.

474
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:07,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

475
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:08,227
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

476
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:12,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll put him down the back here, and we'll go from there.

477
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll circle back.

478
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:13,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

479
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

480
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:16,351
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

481
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Next on the agenda is D1 Soccer.

482
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:22,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Mr. Georges here.

483
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:24,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon, Mrs. Georges.

484
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:25,376
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

485
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:26,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.

486
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:27,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm well.

487
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:31,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.

488
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,950
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple of applications for one day licenses.

489
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let you tell us about the event in a minute, if you don't mind.

490
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:46,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it's the same as the other ones you brought before the commission.

491
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:50,161
[SPEAKER_06]: What I just did notice is that I see

492
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: One day license for the 24th of August and another one for the 25th of August.

493
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:00,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having two events or just one of the days?

494
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:05,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I had to resubmit the application.

495
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:09,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the 25th that I need, not the 24th.

496
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:11,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is the 25th.

497
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

498
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:13,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

499
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:13,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

500
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:15,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's okay.

501
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:17,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the 1 that just came over to us.

502
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:18,836
[SPEAKER_06]: That was corrected.

503
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:19,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

504
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:23,900
[SPEAKER_04]: So the 2nd, 1 of September 15th, that's the 2nd, 1, right?

505
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

506
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

507
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:33,773
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, you can go ahead and tell us a little bit about what's going on with it and give us a little insight, and we should be good.

508
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:34,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

509
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:37,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a lot of the same from last time.

510
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's the same people that are here.

511
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:44,376
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're a semi-pro soccer league.

512
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:48,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We try to create an atmosphere for semi-pro players to play.

513
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:54,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we bring the fans over and have a little festivity.

514
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:03,388
[SPEAKER_10]: We like the fans to have an opportunity to enjoy the game, and sometimes a beer and wine helps.

515
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:13,538
[SPEAKER_10]: We are requesting a DJ because we were told we can't do DJs, and we try to respect the city, the people living in the area.

516
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:18,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So on certain days, especially like the playoffs, it would be nice to be able to entertain the fans.

517
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

518
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

519
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:21,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

520
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And you put the, on the new applications that you were in, in fact, having a entertainment, correct?

521
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:29,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

522
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So the applications.

523
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:33,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

524
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:35,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

525
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ's music.

526
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:37,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

527
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Commissioner, you have any questions?

528
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I do not.

529
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:43,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

530
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I've reviewed it.

531
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand what's going on, what he's asking for.

532
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So no, I don't.

533
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than the bigger question, how are you doing with your

534
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Fans, how's all that going?

535
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:03,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Any incidents, anything?

536
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:06,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know you're very smart, Mr. Georges.

537
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:12,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you know that you got to do the balance.

538
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to make everybody happy, including the city.

539
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you doing with that?

540
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:19,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's gone well.

541
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:27,141
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've, we've seen, we've had more police activity in terms of calling for the police detail that showed up.

542
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:31,043
[SPEAKER_10]: We've managed to get the fans out in a decent amount of time.

543
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:38,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we have open communication with Kevin and the other staff with the city.

544
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Whenever there's something that they don't, that happened that they might have some issue with, they contact us right away and we find ways to correct it.

545
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,052
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of give them, okay, thank you for letting us know.

546
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's an update of what we're doing.

547
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:52,157
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we can do to manage the situation.

548
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:53,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

549
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

550
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you to be successful.

551
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,505
[SPEAKER_04]: The city wants you to be successful.

552
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: We love it that you chose the Metfit venue.

553
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just keep evolving and growing.

554
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever bugs there are, we'll get through them so we can have a lot of great years going forward.

555
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:15,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

556
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mr. Chairman, I don't I don't have any other questions or concerns.

557
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

558
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:28,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, if is there anybody else here that would like to speak on behalf of these dis license being issued?

559
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:30,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

560
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:44,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I'll make a motion to grant two one-day licenses to D1 Soccer for events being held from 5 to 9 p.m.

561
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:49,569
[SPEAKER_06]: at Hormel Stadium, one on August 25th of 2024 and one on September 15th of 2024.

562
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:56,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

563
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

564
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:05,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that motion to grant both licenses on the August 25th and September 15th.

565
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all those in favor.

566
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:08,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

567
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:09,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

568
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed.

569
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

570
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. George is both your license granted.

571
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:19,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

572
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:20,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

573
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I have one more question.

574
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:27,618
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were approved on the, for the 31st.

575
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:32,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it possible to change the dates around or is that in stone?

576
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to the secretary, Terry.

577
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:38,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's a problem with that, right?

578
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:40,132
[SPEAKER_06]: The one on the 31st.

579
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:44,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you're trying to do this like in playoffs or something, right?

580
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:45,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

581
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,254
[SPEAKER_10]: We're juggling a couple of things around.

582
00:37:47,274 --> 00:38:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're looking to move the 31st into September 8th to do more like a fan appreciation type of day and not do the DJs instead of the live band, which would be less noise.

583
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

584
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:07,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, let me make a motion.

585
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:16,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I motion that we extend the license for August and move it to September 8th for an appreciation day.

586
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:17,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

587
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

588
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that motion.

589
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:22,693
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor, aye.

590
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed.

591
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:26,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

592
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:27,537
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

593
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:28,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passed.

594
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:29,939
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all set.

595
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

596
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

597
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:32,759
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, cool.

598
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you go away, Daria, is that OK?

599
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,300
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it all, Daria?

600
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:37,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's fine.

601
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to you guys, not up to me.

602
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:45,463
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, Alan had to take the lead on that one, because that was a new one for me.

603
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:47,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Georges.

604
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with your events.

605
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:49,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

606
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:50,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good day.

607
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,045
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, bye-bye.

608
00:38:53,318 --> 00:39:01,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of thinking possibly just go a little out of order if Cordova is here.

609
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:03,266
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a license surrender.

610
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:07,009
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be real quick, and we won't have to tie them up.

611
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any representatives from Cordova?

612
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,995
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we told them, Bobby, we just told them that, yeah, they need to appear.

613
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:15,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.

614
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we received the license.

615
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to do anything.

616
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,419
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do a surrender.

617
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have asked why, you know.

618
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the email, but pretty much they just had to surrender.

619
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:34,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to time record it, and then once it gets approved by you guys, I just send it us to the state that it was surrendered.

620
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:35,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

621
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:38,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should make a motion to approve the surrender?

622
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

623
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:41,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

624
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a motion.

625
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I motion to accept the surrender of the Q Dahlberg liquor license that we have in our possession.

626
00:39:52,072 --> 00:40:02,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll second that motion all those in favor I. Liquor and entertainment sorry guys entertainment, yes, just modify.

627
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,362
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor I yeah.

628
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:18,352
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed Aaron and saying none guys have it and the motion passes Okay, so we got that now we can go on to.

629
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:19,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Brian.

630
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:24,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, at Great American Bale Hall.

631
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:27,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Alan.

632
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:28,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

633
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:29,282
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

634
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob, how are you?

635
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:30,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

636
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:30,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

637
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:31,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

638
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:31,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

639
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Driven by recently, but- Oh, yes.

640
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I go by real slow and look and look and go.

641
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:42,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm even tempted to put my hot helmet on and go wander around and see how far I can get.

642
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,368
[SPEAKER_08]: We could use the help.

643
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, I wanted to tell us a little about what's going on and what's been happening in a perfect world.

644
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:54,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We would be open by now.

645
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but I, I am going to ask Kyle on the call.

646
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,784
[SPEAKER_08]: He's part of our team to give an update.

647
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:03,104
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a background in construction and can do a better job than I can.

648
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:03,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

649
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I just give an update.

650
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:06,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

651
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,494
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Kyle Harnish.

652
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:14,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm part of the ownership team of the Great American Beer Hall, and I'm a builder developer by trade, so I have a little bit of experience in this.

653
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:21,028
[SPEAKER_07]: We've experienced some slight delays here towards the end, and basically we have met with our

654
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:27,353
[SPEAKER_07]: general contractor and have outlined the following dates for our final inspections and getting our CO.

655
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:39,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Our biggest concern here is we are just within a few days of receiving our CO, but don't want to have to wait another month to come before you guys if there's some way to work something out.

656
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to lay out those timelines for you more specifically.

657
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with tomorrow.

658
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow will be our final plumbing inspection.

659
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:51,560
[SPEAKER_07]: On Friday, we will have our final electrical inspection.

660
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,483
[SPEAKER_07]: On Monday, we will have our final building inspection.

661
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:58,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And on Tuesday, we will have our life safety inspection.

662
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:05,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And we expect the issuance of the full certificate of occupancy by Tuesday afternoon.

663
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should be able to pick it up Wednesday morning.

664
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:16,238
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, we're having preliminary tests over the next few days in preparation for those final tests to make sure that we do pass.

665
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:22,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And that includes having the fire department out as early as tomorrow just to do an initial run test.

666
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:28,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So all that being said, I understand that you guys meet, you know, once a month.

667
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:35,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, assuming that we fulfill all these conditions over the next few days and get all our final sign-offs, we are asking

668
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:44,779
[SPEAKER_07]: upon final occupancy certificate being issued next Wednesday, a full liquor license so that we can operate for the Labor Day weekend.

669
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

670
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you a couple of questions.

671
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,081
[SPEAKER_06]: The

672
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:59,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We gave you a list of things, occupancy permit number one.

673
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:06,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I understand that you're saying is you're going to be doing a full occupancy, not a partial, correct?

674
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:07,188
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

675
00:43:07,848 --> 00:43:08,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

676
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:12,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that occupancy, you're going to have the fire safety.

677
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: You said they're coming out tomorrow.

678
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:19,712
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get, you do have your liability insurance for your insurance company.

679
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:20,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I said that to Daria.

680
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:24,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and the common vigil is licensed.

681
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:26,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you obtain that from the city clerk?

682
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:28,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet.

683
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:34,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that needs to be done before you can.

684
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:35,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

685
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:40,449
[SPEAKER_06]: before you can serve any alcohol because in the city of Medford, you can't serve alcohol unless there's food.

686
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't have food without your common vigilance.

687
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,371
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

688
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:46,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a no-brainer.

689
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Full license, you've got to serve food.

690
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:50,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of remember it that way.

691
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:56,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And what goes with the common vigilance is the Board of Health approval.

692
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:58,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the last thing.

693
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:02,958
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing we're waiting for, uh, so we actually got the gas turned on today.

694
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So the hot water test, um, is all happening.

695
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, uh, the disease coming out tomorrow from the board of health.

696
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:12,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, great.

697
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:19,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I mean, as long as you have those, um, items in hand,

698
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:25,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. Commissioner, you can comment as well on this.

699
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:31,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But as long as you have those in hand, you can start serving at that point.

700
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:32,334
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

701
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,355
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your license.

702
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:40,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we were concerned about is that you were only able to serve in

703
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Just certain areas of your building, because you were initially looking for partial occupancy.

704
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:52,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that was the case, it was still okay just to serve in those areas.

705
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:56,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and just in those areas expanded, then it goes out, but.

706
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:12,136
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is it and everything's squared away and say, oh, geez, I don't know, the fire department couldn't get here, there's something wrong with the sprinkler system, we're gonna be delayed another, don't worry about it.

707
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:20,582
[SPEAKER_06]: when you get all of these documents to Daria, our secretary, that's the minute you can start serving.

708
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:33,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Chairman, it was always, Brian, you remember, John, we always said we'll keep moving forward, but we'll approve this.

709
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:37,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's always conditioned upon the city signing off on everything.

710
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So we liked what you were doing.

711
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew the state liked what you were doing.

712
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So the chairman is right.

713
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:49,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you got all the check marks, the green check marks.

714
00:45:50,862 --> 00:45:51,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.

715
00:45:51,322 --> 00:45:51,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

716
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:59,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the only thing I ask, if you don't mind, which I'm sure you won't, is that.

717
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:09,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, by our next meeting, which September 19th or something, just please appear before the commission again.

718
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

719
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:19,214
[SPEAKER_06]: We can finalize everything that you, in fact, did have all of this stuff done and we can put the rubber stamp on it, make it efficient.

720
00:46:19,434 --> 00:46:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: September 18th would be the next.

721
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:23,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting that's when we I'll be there.

722
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:27,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, and I'm not you guys are kind of new to the game and method.

723
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But with us on the commission, we meet once a month.

724
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:49,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's kind of like, you know, we, we try to be as accommodating as possible that we can give you a few days like we just did, or if something needs to be corrected, as you've seen in the past couple of licenses pending the corrections that the licenses are granted, we don't like.

725
00:46:49,972 --> 00:47:04,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan said, we don't want to harm anybody or tie anybody up, but we just want you to know that no matter what the emergency is, from this point forward, we meet the third Wednesday every month at one o'clock.

726
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:07,640
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no, hey, Bobby, hey, Alan, I need a meeting tomorrow.

727
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to have the time.

728
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:09,601
[SPEAKER_06]: None of that.

729
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:11,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, it's a good point.

730
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:15,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so we all are on the same page,

731
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:23,032
[SPEAKER_04]: We've learned from past experience that everyone kind of shuts their brains off in July and August.

732
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's taking vacations.

733
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:30,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, all through City Hall, architects, lawyers, everyone wants to enjoy the summer.

734
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:34,886
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of adopted ages ago to be off on

735
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:42,334
[SPEAKER_04]: July and August, because it was very difficult to get anything done because everyone was either North or South.

736
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:49,000
[SPEAKER_04]: But Chairman Delafano said, let's have a meeting in August.

737
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can tie up some loose ends so we go into the September meeting fast.

738
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for this.

739
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,151
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not a problem.

740
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:07,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone else on the call that would like to speak in favor or against this particular license?

741
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:14,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the building commissioner and Green Lifetime and Lins S23 Ultra.

742
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anybody that wants to speak.

743
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:23,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with all of it.

744
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:25,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, do you want to make a motion?

745
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would you like me to make a motion?

746
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:39,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a motion that we allow GAB to go forward, providing they meet the city checkmarks and they meet all the compliance rules.

747
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:40,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

748
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:42,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

749
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

750
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:43,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

751
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:44,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Commissioner.

752
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:44,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

753
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I second that motion.

754
00:48:47,772 --> 00:48:48,433
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

755
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:49,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

756
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:50,693
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

757
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:55,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And seeing none, the ayes have it, motion is passed.

758
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:57,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck with your new business, guys.

759
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:57,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

760
00:48:58,425 --> 00:48:59,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

761
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

762
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what do we got next?

763
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:14,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just... What do we have left?

764
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Just deep cuts, right?

765
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's the gym application too.

766
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:18,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

767
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:19,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

768
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Jim.

769
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:27,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have somebody from the gym present?

770
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:29,345
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

771
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:31,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

772
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:37,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and the gym's name for the record.

773
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:39,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Kiana Green.

774
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:43,994
[SPEAKER_15]: I am the studio leader for Lifetime Medford at Station Landing.

775
00:49:44,994 --> 00:49:49,497
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have Lynn here from Lifetime, the North Shore location.

776
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how you doing?

777
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about what's going on, why you're coming before us today and what the plan is.

778
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So tomorrow we plan on doing a social event.

779
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,832
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be a class event for the members.

780
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:06,152
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a members only club.

781
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:10,055
[SPEAKER_15]: And then after that, we're going to have a social down in our lobby.

782
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:11,556
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have a DJ.

783
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:12,676
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have photo booth.

784
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:17,879
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have some food like charcuterie board, avocado toast.

785
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:22,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also wanted to have beer and wine options as well.

786
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:24,066
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

787
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:30,611
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a new gym that's coming into the city in that area?

788
00:50:30,972 --> 00:50:32,513
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been here for two years now.

789
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:33,133
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

790
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:36,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Where were you exactly?

791
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,077
[SPEAKER_06]: You were where Boston Sports was?

792
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:38,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

793
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:40,739
[SPEAKER_15]: We're in the same building as Boston Sports Club.

794
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:41,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I got you.

795
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:42,301
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

796
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:46,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were you two years ago to kick something like that off?

797
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:47,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

798
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:50,264
[SPEAKER_16]: We are now ready to go and get kicked.

799
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:51,825
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, we need to reach out to Medford.

800
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:53,145
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to talk to all these people.

801
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:53,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get it going.

802
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:54,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I just got into this position.

803
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:55,405
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Darren.

804
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:59,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I am the assistant to Kiana when it comes to the classes in the club.

805
00:51:00,426 --> 00:51:01,146
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

806
00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:01,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

807
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:09,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And now this particular event, it's a closed to the public open invitation only to your members, correct?

808
00:51:10,508 --> 00:51:10,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

809
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:11,508
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

810
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no charge for the alcohol?

811
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is there a charge for the alcohol?

812
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make a difference.

813
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:23,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we were thinking about just doing some drink tickets.

814
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:28,467
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't fleshed that one out if we were going to charge or do drink tickets.

815
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:32,769
[SPEAKER_15]: We're more on the side of handing out drink tickets, maybe two drink tickets.

816
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:36,671
[SPEAKER_15]: They can get a glass of wine and a glass of beer and call it a day.

817
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,172
[SPEAKER_15]: But we haven't fleshed out if it was going to be for sale or not.

818
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:43,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that is the reason why you needed to apply for the one-day license.

819
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:44,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

820
00:51:45,092 --> 00:52:04,522
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it was just a private, closed event by invitation only, that you're gonna serve a little food and alcoholic beverages in your own facility, there'd be no need for the one-day, but when it involves possibly selling tickets or whatever, this is the best way for you to go.

821
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And just do yourself a favor,

822
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:11,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Check with your insurance company to make sure you have liability insurance.

823
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:16,397
[SPEAKER_06]: God forbid one of your patrons leaves there and has an accident.

824
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:20,359
[SPEAKER_06]: kill somebody, whatever, God forbid, like I said.

825
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: But you may want to just cover your own butts that way.

826
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:25,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's super cheap.

827
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:30,608
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it for one day if they want to put a rider on it.

828
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:33,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can call them today and say, how much is it?

829
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put it on for tomorrow.

830
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 100% your decision.

831
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would be a wise thing to do.

832
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:41,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, be safe and sorry.

833
00:52:41,676 --> 00:52:47,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And your bartender, of course, will be TIP certified, or they'll be certified one way or another?

834
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

835
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:59,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Lynn, I'm the North Shore leader, and we have 206, well, we have 70 clubs within the US that are certified to serve full liquor, beer, and wine license.

836
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at North Shore, we have a full license through Massachusetts under my name, so I'm the one who's gonna be serving.

837
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:05,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm TIP certified.

838
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, very good, very good.

839
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:10,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

840
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:11,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

841
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we, did we get a sketch?

842
00:53:14,802 --> 00:53:15,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we did.

843
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:16,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the sketch.

844
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:16,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

845
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:20,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can see where the alcohol is going to be served.

846
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:24,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's food table there.

847
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything looks good.

848
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:29,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like you folks have done this once or twice.

849
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:30,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure.

850
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that written on a napkin?

851
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:33,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that drawn on a napkin?

852
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I worked really hard on that one.

853
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:41,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I told her I was not doing it, so she had to.

854
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

855
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:43,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfectly fine.

856
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:46,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be from an architect or an engineer.

857
00:53:46,678 --> 00:53:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give us a lay of the land, so to speak.

858
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

859
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,680
[SPEAKER_06]: We got them on pizza boxes before, too.

860
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

861
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a classic.

862
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

863
00:53:58,882 --> 00:53:59,382
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

864
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:01,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.

865
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:01,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you?

866
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:03,373
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.

867
00:54:04,194 --> 00:54:14,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make a motion to accept a one-day license to be held August 22nd at 70 Station Landing.

868
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:16,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I will second that motion.

869
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

870
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

871
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

872
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

873
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:23,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

874
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:24,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Ayes have it.

875
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:25,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are good to go.

876
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:26,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

877
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:26,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

878
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

879
00:54:28,443 --> 00:54:29,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

880
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:31,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Donald.

881
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:31,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Ciao.

882
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

883
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:37,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I guess the only one left is deep cuts, right?

884
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:39,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard from him, Dara.

885
00:54:39,967 --> 00:54:40,747
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I haven't.

886
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:41,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I called them too.

887
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:45,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

888
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:46,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask you a question?

889
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I just noticed the address.

890
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:50,650
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 21 Main Street.

891
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,590
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not deep cuts premise, right?

892
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:54,311
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

893
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:01,810
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?

894
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their address.

895
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:04,311
[SPEAKER_02]: With an 810 Main?

896
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:06,673
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 21 Main Street.

897
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they can't have this on the 12th.

898
00:55:10,534 --> 00:55:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not day 12.

899
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:16,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what do you mean, Bobby?

900
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:23,360
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean what they put was event where event is taking place on page 221 Main Street.

901
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't think that's correct.

902
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:25,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

903
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I get what you mean.

904
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:29,123
[SPEAKER_06]: 21 Main Street is their establishment.

905
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:32,025
[SPEAKER_06]: They cannot get a 1 day license.

906
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:42,405
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that's correct because this is a city event from PDS, from what I understand.

907
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:44,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a city event?

908
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:44,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

909
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Harvester Energy Fasting Lot.

910
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,427
[SPEAKER_02]: In the parking lot?

911
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:48,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

912
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:49,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just see.

913
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:53,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in the bank parking lot there or something.

914
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:57,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that would be a Riverside address.

915
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:01,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevertheless, we should get to the bottom of the correct address.

916
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:10,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're gonna do it at the, hold on, they're gonna do it at the McGlynn Middle School.

917
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:14,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely not gonna be at that address, yeah.

918
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:15,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even close.

919
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

920
00:56:17,378 --> 00:56:23,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think he made a mistake on something else too, and he was like, oh, sorry.

921
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:31,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it says it right here food vendors deep cuts will be holding pop up beer garden and selling sandwiches, hot dogs and more.

922
00:56:32,495 --> 00:56:39,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and that's going to be 1019 when the next thing the next meeting is 918.

923
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:41,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

924
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:42,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wonder why.

925
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just pull up my calendar.

926
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:49,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I'm thinking we

927
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:53,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We pass on this and revisit it in September at the September meeting.

928
00:56:54,502 --> 00:57:02,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would say we table it till then and you can have them correct all the mistakes on this as well as.

929
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Get us a diagram of the event and because we're going to have it at the school.

930
00:57:10,605 --> 00:57:18,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of like, and we've got to see the lay of the land and and stuff and I'm sure there's not going to be an issue.

931
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:19,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that.

932
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:26,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they can come the day before, but then again, you may need it for.

933
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: You may need it for purchasing the alcohol.

934
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:31,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

935
00:57:31,513 --> 00:57:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jeff knows.

936
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's come before us before for these one-day license requests.

937
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:37,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So he knows the drill.

938
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:39,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

939
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, he will have about a month.

940
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we approve it in September, the event is not until October.

941
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:46,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

942
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's October?

943
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:47,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

944
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:49,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, October.

945
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:51,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I thought, too.

946
00:57:51,357 --> 00:57:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: It threw me off a little bit because I thought the same thing.

947
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:54,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, wait.

948
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:55,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we're good.

949
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:57,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got time, yeah.

950
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:03,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would make a, I agree, let's make a motion to table this to the September 18th meeting.

951
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:04,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

952
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:09,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dary, if you don't mind, just reach out to him and have him make changes or the tweaks.

953
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and include the sketch, and we should be good.

954
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:13,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

955
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:22,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know with his insurance, he'd probably have to get a rider from his insurance company for one day, unless his- Yeah, for one day, yeah.

956
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

957
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:25,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that.

958
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

959
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

960
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,764
[SPEAKER_04]: A design, right?

961
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And insurance.

962
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:33,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

963
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:34,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

964
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds about it.

965
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You made the motion.

966
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:38,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second it out.

967
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

968
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,169
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

969
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll revisit this.

970
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:43,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

971
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:45,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none.

972
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:46,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

973
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:49,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I think.

974
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:53,015
[SPEAKER_06]: We pretty much wrapped it up.

975
00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:57,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a couple of notes.

976
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Gary, it was a nice job on the one day license that you put up on the site.

977
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:12,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be so much easier for people to go online and just streamline everything, which is great.

978
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to discuss tip certs.

979
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:24,230
[SPEAKER_06]: From other violators and stuff, but I don't know why I wrote that note, but it was maybe in the future.

980
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: We can set up a some sort of a.

981
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:34,782
[SPEAKER_06]: rule, if we're going to require people to be TIP certified in all the establishments, or maybe just people that are violating.

982
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:37,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

983
00:59:37,462 --> 00:59:43,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can have Ralph touch on that at the meeting on the 25th, I think it is.

984
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:50,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, at the compliance meeting, just to throw it out there and then kind of get people aware of it.

985
00:59:51,146 --> 00:59:53,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of the compliance meeting,

986
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to probably go through some of last year's stuff.

987
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:01,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can use a lot of it and just kind of edit the dates.

988
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:08,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And you and I can set something up, Daria, that maybe, you know, it's going to be like within another 30 days.

989
01:00:08,894 --> 01:00:10,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get a letter out within a week or two.

990
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:11,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:12,955
[SPEAKER_06]: A week, yeah.

992
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way the Board of Health can get their letter out at the same time.

993
01:00:16,477 --> 01:00:20,379
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think they already did, because we didn't give them the date.

994
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:22,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they did, yeah.

995
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just had local for future.

996
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:30,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it worked out really well.

997
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:35,628
[SPEAKER_06]: You saw as soon as we put in mandatory in red, they just skyrocketed for attendance.

998
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:39,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think to follow Ralph's cue on that was a good idea.

999
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:43,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got a great response.

1000
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:50,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm trying to think of is see if we can do something that's gonna be easier for all of us when they come in.

1001
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:54,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe they'll notice we can have them print it,

1002
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:58,833
[SPEAKER_06]: sign it and hand it to us when they come in.

1003
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:00,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we know who's there.

1004
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of me trying to read this micro little sheet there, checking them off and you know, blah, blah, blah.

1005
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you just collect the sheets as they come in and then we tie them up later.

1006
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:11,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We know who's there.

1007
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:18,440
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we might even be able to get a little, maybe

1008
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:24,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say vital information, but just say current manager on file.

1009
01:01:26,753 --> 01:01:30,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's on the annual license renewal anyways, the form.

1010
01:01:31,174 --> 01:01:34,534
[SPEAKER_06]: But just so that we don't have any issues.

1011
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:41,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that because you're not the person that's the license manager that's on file, that type of thing.

1012
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:44,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets kicked back from the ABCC like it did at the Firefighters Club.

1013
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:52,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, you may want to, uh, we may want to look into that, but I think that's about it.

1014
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:57,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, uh, um, unless you guys got anything else.

1015
01:01:57,638 --> 01:02:04,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one thing, Mr. Chairman, um, July 17th is when we had the hearings for the, um,

1016
01:02:05,345 --> 01:02:09,546
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the people, the merchants that fail to control compliance checks, right?

1017
01:02:10,486 --> 01:02:13,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, October 17th is 90 days.

1018
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:17,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, do we circle back to them?

1019
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:21,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This is commercial circle back to them, or are you going to circle back to them?

1020
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,310
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we.

1021
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,793
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we address those seven?

1022
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:25,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it seven or eight?

1023
01:02:26,314 --> 01:02:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

1024
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:29,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It was six.

1025
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one of them came back, deep cuts.

1026
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to tell him, nice job.

1027
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:36,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he did it real quick, yeah.

1028
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:38,550
[SPEAKER_06]: He got them all done.

1029
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we get any response from the others?

1030
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1031
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:43,323
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just have deep cuts.

1032
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:49,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put it actually in file yesterday because I was trying to plan out how to do it because it was due to violations.

1033
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:54,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that I can send a reminder.

1034
01:02:54,592 --> 01:03:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually wanted to do a letter to begin with and I have it drafted saying this is what's going to happen, that there's going to be a new file, please send it to us within 90 days from this date.

1035
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:14,885
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever this is like your first notice and then I can do in a couple of weeks second notice.

1036
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:17,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they've realized that we're not going to let it go.

1037
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:19,747
[SPEAKER_02]: So they will stay on top of it.

1038
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:20,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1039
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:22,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what I was saying.

1040
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:23,888
[SPEAKER_04]: October 17th will be 90 days.

1041
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just go 17, 17, 17.

1042
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:26,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1043
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:27,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1044
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:34,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if it, you know, if we don't get much of a response, um, I don't know.

1045
01:03:34,712 --> 01:03:37,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you want to throw in something like we did to blue Fuji today?

1046
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:49,573
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're going to hold a one-day suspension for you in abidance if you don't comply with the 90-day rule of the TIP certifications.

1047
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:58,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a bad idea to add some teeth to it so they know we're serious and they understand the seriousness of what happens.

1048
01:03:58,816 --> 01:03:59,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1049
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:01,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can discuss that.

1050
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:02,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1051
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:06,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's nothing that's going to harm them unless they don't do it.

1052
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:07,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless they don't do it.

1053
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1054
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, to be honest with you, it's the honor system.

1055
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:18,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how many people Al-Ahmad Iran has got working in his business that are serving alcohol.

1056
01:04:18,745 --> 01:04:22,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they send us six, that's how many?

1057
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:22,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Six.

1058
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:24,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they send us 19, there's 19.

1059
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:31,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like... But they should live up to what we did, you know, what we asked of them.

1060
01:04:31,752 --> 01:04:34,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So and we're hoping that they're honest enough to do that.

1061
01:04:35,315 --> 01:04:39,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I mean, we're not going to police them and go in and look at their books and how many.

1062
01:04:39,978 --> 01:04:41,059
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1063
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not.

1064
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,380
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1065
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, let's let's just let's be up front and hopefully they do the right thing.

1066
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:48,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And right.

1067
01:04:49,846 --> 01:04:57,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And just kind of fire a shot across the bow, just in case they don't do the right thing, they're not going to say, hey, you know, it's just kind of.

1068
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:58,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1069
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:00,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1070
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:02,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else?

1071
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1072
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it.

1073
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, you've been doing some traveling, I hope?

1074
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:09,121
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1075
01:05:09,562 --> 01:05:11,002
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just back and forth.

1076
01:05:11,302 --> 01:05:11,782
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1077
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:12,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Just back and forth.

1078
01:05:13,463 --> 01:05:14,984
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because the weather's too nice here.

1079
01:05:15,364 --> 01:05:16,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to wait until the cooler weather.

1080
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to visit the little place in Florida there.

1081
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:21,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1082
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

1083
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:23,547
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1084
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,028
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, folks.

1085
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:27,560
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I motion to adjourn.

1086
01:05:28,202 --> 01:05:28,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1087
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm supposed to do that.

1088
01:05:29,828 --> 01:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1089
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:32,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I second.

1090
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,118
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor.

1091
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,663
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1092
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:35,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me follow up.

1093
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:36,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see everybody.

1094
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you guys.
