    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=393.663">Yeah,</a>  according to chapter 138, I don't know the section, but it's either 14 or 10 days, Commissioner, that we have to notify them, and it can't be, it's got to be within <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=409.408">the</a>  14, so it could be a day before, two days before, 10 days before, 14 days before, whatever it's stated in 138. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=418.472">And</a>  we kind of try to follow that rule to give everybody ample time, but apparently there's some kind of an issue with your email and maybe going out of the country or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=428.136">Do</a>  you have a personal email address that you just have here that, you know, if this commission wants to send you something, we can get you immediately?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=442.758">We</a>  have two Gmail addresses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=444.699">They're</a>  both owned by my manager here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=448.921">So</a>  I think I briefed both of them at gmail.com.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=454.363">You</a>  don't have to give it over the air or over the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=457.304">You</a>  can just email it right to Daria from that email, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=460.945">So</a>  that way she'll have that email and we have to notify you in the future.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=465.907">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=467.469">In</a>  case you're wondering, you know, why we're asking questions about this legally, we could have suspended your license but not appearing before the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=477.819">So</a>  we said, well, maybe there's something here that we don't understand, or maybe they didn't get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=484.161">Is</a>  it just something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=485.622">So</a>  we've always prided ourselves on working with the community, the merchants, giving you the benefit of the doubt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=494.646">When</a>  we see things, we don't immediately jump to the letter of the law, so to speak, because there's always two sides to every story. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=502.789">So</a>  that's kind of why we were wondering, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=506.31">you</a>  know, why we didn't see you on the 17th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=510.132">So</a>  just keep that in mind that we need to get, we need to lock down how to get in touch with you if this ever occurs again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=521.577">Because,</a>  you know, maybe next time we won't be as understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=525.639">Put</a>  it that way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=526.719">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=526.899">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=528.41">next</a>  time and we will not be having like this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=531.152">Even</a>  if I go back to China, I will give my email and give it to another manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=540.317">Because</a>  this time I didn't give the password when I go back and I didn't give him password. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=547.862">That's</a>  why we cannot open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=549.623">But</a>  the next time I will, I will give him before I go back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=553.245">But</a>  normally I will not go back to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=556.687">Yeah,</a>  sorry for that.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=557.988">We,</a>  we, we understand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=559.669">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=560.749">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=561.729">Um,</a>  well at this time, what I'm going to do is turn this, um, this hearing, uh, for this particular case over to Lieutenant Lockowitz, Medford Police Department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=571.512">And</a>  he can, um, he can address, um, you folks and, and we'll go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=576.874">We'll</a>  give you an opportunity to respond to Lieutenant Lockowitz and, um, and, uh, Officer Smith as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=584.957">Um,</a>  Lieutenant?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=588.452">Thank</a>  you commissioners and everybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=590.735">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=593.899">This</a>  violation occurred on June 20th as part of one of two days in which we conducted citywide compliance checks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=605.818">Um,</a>  being that there's just this one, we did all the other ones prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=610.72">Um,</a>  I figured I'll, I'll turn it over to officer Smith, um, because the entire report is, is written from him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=617.703">Uh,</a>  if that's okay, I'll just turn it to officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=621.005">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=623.005">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=624.886">On</a>  Thursday, June 20th, myself and Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=627.447">Dhingra,</a>  who is the City of Medford's Prevention and Outreach Manager, conducted compliance checks with two 17-year-old juveniles in the City of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=637.431">At</a>  approximately 6.20 p.m., I parked on Ashland Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=641.252">I</a>  was in an unmarked vehicle with Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=642.693">Dhingra</a>  and the two 17-year-olds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=645.654">The</a>  two 17-year-olds were instructed to enter Blue Fuji and attempt to purchase alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=652.139">They</a>  were instructed to purchase Bud Light if possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=657.083">They</a>  were not trying to deceive anyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=660.105">If</a>  they were asked their age, they were told to say that they were 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=665.649">They</a>  had no form of identification on their person before entering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=670.573">and</a>  the two 17-year-olds entered Blue Fuji. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=674.034">Approximately</a>  five minutes later, Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=675.735">Dingor</a>  received a text from the juveniles and stated that they had been served alcohol, at which time I entered Blue Fuji and observed the two juveniles sitting at a booth in front of them with two Bud Light bottles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=690.38">which</a>  is an alcoholic beverage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=692.202">I</a>  approached the juveniles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=693.723">I</a>  asked them what had transpired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=696.145">They</a>  said that they had ordered Bud Lights and they were not asked for identification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=700.789">They</a>  were not asked how old they were, and they were served the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=705.253">I</a>  asked them who served them alcohol, and they pointed to the server who was later identified as Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=712.539">Ziyi</a>  Ouyang. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=713.96">I'm</a>  not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=715.981">The</a>  gentleman's before the commission today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=719.394">I</a>  did not know that he was the assistant manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=721.341">He</a>  told me that he was a server and he'd only worked there a couple months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=726.469">The</a>  juveniles then returned to Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=728.25">Dhingra,</a>  and I spoke to Mr. Ouyang, and I asked him, you know, I explained that he had served alcohol to two juveniles that was 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=738.455">He</a>  said that he apologized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=740.856">He</a>  said that he thought they were tough students and that he usually does not card anybody if they look over the age of 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=746.96">These</a>  were two 17-year-olds that looked nowhere close to 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=754.083">I</a>  asked for the manager and I learned that the manager was on vacation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=758.804">I</a>  informed Mr. Yang that this would be documented and submitted to this commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=764.545">Those</a>  are essentially the facts.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=768.786">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=769.086">Thank</a>  you, Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=770.866">Thank</a>  you, Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.226">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.606">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.846">Dinger,</a>  would you care to comment?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=778.627">I</a>  have no additional comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=780.108">That</a>  was very accurate as to what happened.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=783.651">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=785.633">Sir,</a>  would you like to say anything in your defense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=793.36">Would</a>  you like to speak about the matter of Blue Fuji?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=796.283">I</a>  did it by mistake.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=804.682">Okay,</a>  so it was a mistake, it was, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=810.543">Mr.</a>  Commissioner Allen, would you like to comment?</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=814.985">Yeah,</a>  you know, these control compliance checks, we take them very seriously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=823.387">I</a>  guess I'll just flip the cards and say, thank goodness, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=829.457">These</a>  two were served, and they were double served and triple served, and then they got in the car and they hit somebody or they were wrapped in the car around a tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=841.221">Because</a>  ultimately, that's the whole purpose of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=848.077">I'm</a>  just glad it was a controlled compliance check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=853.623">As</a>  I read through the report, it sounded like they were the only two there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=856.487">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=858.189">Is</a>  some business better than no business? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=860.411">I'm</a>  not quite sure what Blue Fuji's philosophy is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=867.219">We</a>  are a little disappointed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=869.902">Actually,</a>  to be honest with you, we're disappointed with everybody because in this last round of checks, it seemed like we snagged a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=878.11">So</a>  I don't know if it's a function of everybody's getting too lax or everyone's just damn grateful that people are coming in and spending money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=887.78">I'm</a>  not sure what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=890.703">Nevertheless,</a>  we thank the city for doing these control compliance checks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=897.888">At</a>  some point, we'll get back to zero rather than whatever the last number was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=907.035">Mr.</a>  Chair and Mr. Delfano, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=911.667">I</a>  just, what irks me the most is the phrase about, I thought they were tough students. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=917.21">I'm</a>  not quite sure what that means. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=920.512">Does</a>  that mean that if you're a tough student, you just get a free ticket to come and drink at Blue Fuji? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=926.996">I'm</a>  not quite sure what that sentence means, or maybe I'm reading into it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=933.079">Can</a>  one of the two of you kind of explain what exactly does that mean, we thought they were tough students?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=940.559">Actually,</a>  at the time, I saw they were above 21 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=944.922">That's</a>  what I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=947.064">Sorry</a>  about that, making any confusion.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=952.452">Okay,</a>  so you know that if a tough student comes in and they just show you a student ID, it's not okay to serve them, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=962.016">That's</a>  not acceptable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=963.996">You</a>  need a driver's license or passport or something of that nature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=969.638">So</a>  as long as we're clear on that from this point forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=976.881">Is</a>  anyone else on the call that would like to speak on behalf of this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=985.003">Okay,</a>  well, you know, what we feel as though on the first time, it's like my predecessor Alan said, we give everybody one bite of the apple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1000.426">And</a>  you just had your bite of the apple because you didn't show up last month, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1006.389">And</a>  the people that did show up, they got a year probation and it was put into their file that if there were any incidences, we'd have to go to the next step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1021.355">So</a>  we're going to go right to the next step today, because you didn't show up the first time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1027.339">And</a>  when you didn't show up the first time, I could have ordered Lieutenant Larkowitz to go right to your establishment, take the license off the wall, and you wouldn't have been able to sell any liquor for these 30 days between the two meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1042.782">And</a>  if we didn't have a meeting today, you wouldn't have been able to sell until a scheduled meeting in September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1048.387">That's</a>  how serious this is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1050.448">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1051.75">And</a>  I just want you to understand that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1054.672">And</a>  so the next step is what we're going to do is we're going to give you a one day suspension, but we're going to hold it in abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1063.28">What</a>  that means is if you don't have any issues like this for the next year, you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1074.852">You</a>  don't have to worry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1076.373">If</a>  you do have an issue, then we suspend your license, okay?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1081.178">So,</a>  excuse me, can I say something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1083.919">I</a>  work for Blue Fuji already for almost 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1087.4">Most</a>  of the time, I do all the job by myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1099.763">Because</a>  this month, it's in June, I go back to China. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1105.005">So</a>  I hire this person, Tesla, for I think one and a half months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1110.527">And</a>  I tell them, and a check ID or something, a check ID must do your service at home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1117.13">I</a>  tell them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1118.35">And</a>  so, but maybe, and he is new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1123.973">work</a>  for this position and have experience is not too many. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1131.359">Also,</a>  their day is nearly close, maybe he be busy to closing something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1140.509">don't</a>  check the ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1143.512">He</a>  told me he thinks he's a top student and more than 21. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1148.456">He</a>  thinks about that, so he forgot to check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1152.039">This</a>  is his mistake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1153.961">I</a>  told him he must check, but he didn't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1161.087">Most</a>  of the time, I think in the day, you do, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1164.429">He</a>  stays close to something that we forgot to check it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1170.032">It's</a>  his mistake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1171.392">But</a>  most of the time, I do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1173.414">I'm</a>  not on vacation all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1175.475">I</a>  work every day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1176.475">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1178.336">I</a>  check every time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1180.057">You</a>  can see when I think you not check only one time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1185.099">I</a>  think you check many times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1187.06">But</a>  we didn't make a mistake because I always check ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1191.943">Even</a>  I look at he is a little older. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1194.684">The</a>  one time I check the customer, can I use your ID? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1199.527">He</a>  say, I'm older. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1200.667">I'm</a>  37. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1201.988">I</a>  say, for me, I see you are younger. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1205.069">That's</a>  why I check ID. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1206.79">Really,</a>  I promise you, I check every time, even when he looks a little older. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1212.271">When</a>  I wonder, I must check the ID immediately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1216.092">And</a>  then I show it, and he will give me the key. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1220.233">But</a>  because I hire this person in just a short time, and it's just one and a half months, because I go back to China. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1227.395">Really,</a>  really so sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1228.755">I</a>  hope you give us a chance.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1231.612">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1232.412">Well,</a>  you know, we've got a solution for that because the other part of this is from this point forward, any employees that you hire are going to be required to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1246.557">Do</a>  you know what TIP certified is?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1250.139">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1250.819">It's</a>  called T-I-P-S. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1259.411">I</a>  have it.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1260.631">You</a>  have that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1261.372">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1261.532">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1262.472">From</a>  this point forward, any waiter, waitress, attender, anybody that works in there that's going to handle alcohol will need to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1276.015">Now,</a>  what we're requiring you to do is when you hire a new employee, they have 30 days to get their certification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1286.378">And</a>  when they do, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1288.427">You</a>  take that copy of that certification and you keep it in your file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1293.811">But</a>  your current employees, starting today, are going to need to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1300.535">And</a>  you're going to have 90 days for them to do it, which is three months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1307.34">And</a>  we're going to require you to send those certifications to Daria at the Liquor Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1316.476">to</a>  prove that they're all TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1319.837">You</a>  have three months to do that, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1323.178">From</a>  that point on, anybody that comes in that's hired, you have them TIP certified and you keep it in your own file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1331.841">We</a>  don't need a copy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1333.962">But</a>  just your current employees, we're gonna need a copy, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1338.723">So</a>  that's all part of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1340.444">So</a>  you're gonna have the one day suspension held in abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1344.654">you're</a>  going to require all of your employees to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1351.198">And</a>  we will verify in 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1354.32">And</a>  we'll verify in 90 days that they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1356.481">Does</a>  that sound OK to you, Mr. Commissioner? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1360.323">Because</a>  it's a little more stringent.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1362.965">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1363.805">I</a>  think it's fair because of the severity of the incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1367.147">We</a>  could be a lot <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1371.444">harsher</a>  because if you go by the rules that have been written by our predecessors, they're a little more harsh. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1378.731">So</a>  I think we're fair in working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1381.814">We</a>  understand this was a one-time because Blue Fuji, I was very surprised to see you all on the list, honestly, because you guys have always been good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1391.363">But</a>  I think we're being fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1394.804">So</a>  Daria, if you don't mind, I will second the motion that Chairman Delafano has just laid out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1405.306">So</a>  I do second the motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1518.059">So</a>  it's similar to any of the other performance events that we've had here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1523.001">Basically,</a>  it's a local showcase to some music. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1530.853">It's</a>  a collaboration that we've done with JJ and Cuisine on Locale. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1537.639">Yeah,</a>  beer and wine and then food available for service. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1544.845">Yeah,</a>  just featuring some local musicians.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1549.529">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1551.879">Brian,</a>  you always do a good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1553.661">We</a>  never have any issues with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1555.162">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1556.604">Daria</a>  has your insurance on file and we kind of know the layout there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1562.47">So</a>  this all looks good as usual. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1564.372">I</a>  don't have an issue with any of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1568.997">I</a>  checked it over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1571.359">Alan,</a>  do you?</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1572.385">Yeah,</a>  no, I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1574.386">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I looked at it too, and you're absolutely right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1577.947">Brian</a>  runs a good shop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1580.108">You</a>  must have a huge bouncer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1581.308">Is</a>  that what it is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1582.349">Is</a>  that the secret? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1583.029">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1583.889">You</a>  have a big bouncer? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1585.39">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1587.11">Just</a>  joking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1587.73">But</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1588.211">We</a>  do have the insurance on file, and you could have a great track record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1592.992">So</a>  Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'm just going to make a motion to approve the one-day license <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1600.935">for</a>  event them for Thursday, August 22nd on Salem Street.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1609.262">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1610.303">I</a>  will second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1611.924">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1613.245">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1615.387">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1617.608">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the ayes have it, motion is passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1621.031">You're</a>  all set, pal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1621.632">All</a>  right, Brian, you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1622.933">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1623.733">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1624.494">Take</a>  care now.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1625.455">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1629.038">Okay,</a>  next item on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1633.68">It's</a>  Nick, I believe, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1637.241">Let</a>  me take a look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1638.982">Nick,</a>  yes, you're up next.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1645.184">Sorry,</a>  my apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1645.945">I</a>  might have made a slight error in my application form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1648.445">I</a>  know Daria sent me a new one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1652.467">whinging</a>  in Alan's ear early about traveling a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1655.169">And</a>  I think I said I was a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1657.25">So</a>  I will click and make sure I didn't do that incorrectly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1661.372">And</a>  I'll send this to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1662.953">I</a>  couldn't do it speedily enough to correct my fat finger clicking the wrong thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1668.837">So</a>  my apologies for... Yeah, not a problem.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1672.619">The</a>  other thing I noticed too, Nick, was under the full description, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1678.437">On</a>  page 2, you wrote the alcohol will only be served in and it stopped there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1683.904">I</a>  didn't know where you were going with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1685.867">Or</a>  if you picked that up and maybe corrected it on the new application that you sent the dairy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1691.574">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1692.832">Okay,</a>  I better correct that as well.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1695.493">No,</a>  no, just check it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1698.474">Tell</a>  us a little bit about what's going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1700.155">What</a>  kind of event is it?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1702.335">So</a>  this is basically in West Medford, in the car park behind Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1709.618">It's</a>  in collaboration with the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the West Medford Chapter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1717.375">And</a>  basically, it's a celebration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1719.216">They</a>  used to do a thing, I think, a while back for Halloween. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1723.459">And</a>  then that ended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1725.16">And</a>  I was chatting with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1726.321">They're</a>  trying to revitalize some fun in West Bedford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1730.084">So</a>  I got together with the chamber. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1732.626">And</a>  basically, it's a food tasting, music, and beer event, which will be from 4 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1740.911">Sort</a>  of very family-friendly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1742.072">We've</a>  got two bands playing, all local people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1746.367">And</a>  then the Chamber is in charge of getting various food vendors who are all from all around the world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1753.534">I</a>  think Paul Revere Cafe is going to be doing some stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1756.697">I'm</a>  assuming Simple Fare, Snappy Patty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1760.08">So</a>  again, it's just a very sort of community-ized event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1764.043">And</a>  that's about it.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1767.308">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1767.669">Do</a>  they still have that container out back there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1770.432">It</a>  was like a small container that goes on the back of a tractor trailer that the side was cut out that Nick can make like a little area.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1778.142">Yeah,</a>  I think that's probably Snappy Patty says that.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1782.228">Oh,</a>  is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1782.808">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1783.209">I</a>  didn't know that was theirs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1784.451">I</a>  saw it there.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1785.797">Yeah,</a>  I think it's their sort of outdoor dining experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1792.062">Gotcha.</a> </p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1793.723">I've</a>  always liked that spot for events because it's only three points to get in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1798.807">There's</a>  only three ways you can get in and out of that whole area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1802.33">So</a>  it's very easy to control, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1807.174">Two</a>  of them you can enter by car and then there's that alley in between. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1810.737">We</a>  have Pompeo insurances and I forget the other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1816.247">But</a>  that's a great place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1819.352">Again,</a>  Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1825.542">Nick</a>  is right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1826.623">They</a>  used to do the Halloween one there, and then it kind of stopped. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1829.408">I</a>  don't know if <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1830.478">If</a>  COVID put the kibosh on it, I'm just not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1834.202">But</a>  I'm glad that an outdoor event has been resurrected to be held there in the municipal parking lot, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1841.769">Because</a>  I kept seeing Karpack. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1843.11">I'm</a>  like, he's up the heights? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1844.832">Because</a>  when I see Karpack, I immediately think North Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1849.712">But</a>  let me start my babbling here and let me make a motion to approve the one day license for the event of September 14th in West Medford in the municipal parking lot behind 465 High Street.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1867.632">I'll</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1869.453">If</a>  we could just add to it to make sure that we have the updated application as well beforehand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1876.398">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1880.781">I'll</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1881.682">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1882.823">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1884.224">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1885.805">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the motion passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1888.407">You're</a>  all set, Nick.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1889.646">Great,</a>  thank you very much, and I'll get that off to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1892.788">It's</a>  not going to rain that day, so you're going to be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1894.809">Excellent,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1896.35">Good</a>  luck with the event.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1897.911">Cheers,</a>  have a good one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1899.452">Bye-bye</a>  now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1902.093">OK,</a>  next on the agenda, deep cuts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1906.356">We</a>  have Jeff here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1907.216">I</a>  thought I saw Jeff earlier, didn't I?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1913.92">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1914.46">I</a>  was wondering the same thing, but I sent him the Zoom link, so I don't know.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1919.683">All</a>  right, you know what we can do, Dario? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1921.244">We'll</a>  move him down to the end so we don't tie people up.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1924.706">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1927.927">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1929.668">Yeah,</a>  I'll put him down the back here, and we'll go from there.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1932.369">Maybe</a>  he'll circle back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1933.57">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1934.13">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2443.667">We</a>  could use the help.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2446.12">Uh,</a>  yeah, I wanted to tell us a little about what's going on and what's been happening in a perfect world.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2452.982">We</a>  would be open by now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2455.042">Uh,</a>  but I, I am going to ask Kyle on the call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2458.063">He's</a>  part of our team to give an update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2459.804">He's</a>  got a background in construction and can do a better job than I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2463.184">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2464.105">I</a>  just give an update. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2466.092">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2466.553">My</a>  name is Kyle Harnish. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2467.514">I'm</a>  part of the ownership team of the Great American Beer Hall, and I'm a builder developer by trade, so I have a little bit of experience in this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2474.521">We've</a>  experienced some slight delays here towards the end, and basically we have met with our <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2481.868">general</a>  contractor and have outlined the following dates for our final inspections and getting our CO. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2487.814">Our</a>  biggest concern here is we are just within a few days of receiving our CO, but don't want to have to wait another month to come before you guys if there's some way to work something out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2499.064">I</a>  wanted to lay out those timelines for you more specifically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2503.869">It</a>  starts with tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2505.15">Tomorrow</a>  will be our final plumbing inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2508.238">On</a>  Friday, we will have our final electrical inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2512.641">On</a>  Monday, we will have our final building inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2515.643">And</a>  on Tuesday, we will have our life safety inspection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2519.546">And</a>  we expect the issuance of the full certificate of occupancy by Tuesday afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2526.11">And</a>  we should be able to pick it up Wednesday morning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2529.092">That</a>  is, we're having preliminary tests over the next few days in preparation for those final tests to make sure that we do pass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2537.159">And</a>  that includes having the fire department out as early as tomorrow just to do an initial run test. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2542.484">So</a>  all that being said, I understand that you guys meet, you know, once a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2548.869">So,</a>  you know, assuming that we fulfill all these conditions over the next few days and get all our final sign-offs, we are asking <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2556.655">upon</a>  final occupancy certificate being issued next Wednesday, a full liquor license so that we can operate for the Labor Day weekend.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2567.32">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2569.3">Let</a>  me ask you a couple of questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2571.221">The</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2576.063">We</a>  gave you a list of things, occupancy permit number one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2580.145">And</a>  what I understand that you're saying is you're going to be doing a full occupancy, not a partial, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2586.607">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2587.848">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2589.008">And</a>  with that occupancy, you're going to have the fire safety. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2593.25">You</a>  said they're coming out tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2594.851">You're</a>  going to get, you do have your liability insurance for your insurance company.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2599.993">I</a>  said that to Daria.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2601.922">Okay,</a>  and the common vigil is licensed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2604.864">Did</a>  you obtain that from the city clerk?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2608.345">Not</a>  yet.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2610.006">Okay,</a>  that needs to be done before you can.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2615.329">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2616.168">before</a>  you can serve any alcohol because in the city of Medford, you can't serve alcohol unless there's food. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2620.849">And</a>  you can't have food without your common vigilance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2622.91">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2625.731">That's</a>  a no-brainer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2626.631">Full</a>  license, you've got to serve food. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2629.392">So</a>  just kind of remember it that way.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2631.993">And</a>  what goes with the common vigilance is the Board of Health approval.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2636.914">Yeah,</a>  that's the last thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2639.496">The</a>  last thing we're waiting for, uh, so we actually got the gas turned on today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2643.058">So</a>  the hot water test, um, is all happening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2646.76">And</a>  then, uh, the disease coming out tomorrow from the board of health.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2650.883">So,</a>  okay, great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2653.464">Um,</a>  I mean, as long as you have those, um, items in hand, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2661.311">And</a>  Mr. Commissioner, you can comment as well on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2666.132">But</a>  as long as you have those in hand, you can start serving at that point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2672.014">All</a>  right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2672.374">You</a>  have your license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2674.555">And</a>  what we were concerned about is that you were only able to serve in <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2682.47">Just</a>  certain areas of your building, because you were initially looking for partial occupancy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2687.534">And</a>  if that was the case, it was still okay just to serve in those areas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2692.397">Yeah,</a>  and just in those areas expanded, then it goes out, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2697.785">If</a>  this is it and everything's squared away and say, oh, geez, I don't know, the fire department couldn't get here, there's something wrong with the sprinkler system, we're gonna be delayed another, don't worry about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2713.277">when</a>  you get all of these documents to Daria, our secretary, that's the minute you can start serving.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2722.122">And</a>  Mr. Chairman, it was always, Brian, you remember, John, we always said we'll keep moving forward, but we'll approve this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2733.329">But</a>  it's always conditioned upon the city signing off on everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2737.492">So</a>  we liked what you were doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2740.674">We</a>  knew the state liked what you were doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2743.331">So</a>  the chairman is right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2746.195">Once</a>  you got all the check marks, the green check marks.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2750.862">Let's</a>  go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2751.322">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2754.427">Well,</a>  the only thing I ask, if you don't mind, which I'm sure you won't, is that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2760.577">Obviously,</a>  by our next meeting, which September 19th or something, just please appear before the commission again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2769.205">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2770.226">We</a>  can finalize everything that you, in fact, did have all of this stuff done and we can put the rubber stamp on it, make it efficient.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2779.434">September</a>  18th would be the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2781.857">Meeting</a>  that's when we I'll be there.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2783.578">Yeah,</a>  yeah, and I'm not you guys are kind of new to the game and method. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2787.96">But</a>  with us on the commission, we meet once a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2792.243">Yeah,</a>  and it's kind of like, you know, we, we try to be as accommodating as possible that we can give you a few days like we just did, or if something needs to be corrected, as you've seen in the past couple of licenses pending the corrections that the licenses are granted, we don't like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2809.972">Alan</a>  said, we don't want to harm anybody or tie anybody up, but we just want you to know that no matter what the emergency is, from this point forward, we meet the third Wednesday every month at one o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2824.759">There's</a>  no, hey, Bobby, hey, Alan, I need a meeting tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2827.66">I</a>  need to have the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2829.141">None</a>  of that.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2829.941">Mr.</a>  Chairman, it's a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2832.342">Just</a>  so we all are on the same page, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2836.104">We've</a>  learned from past experience that everyone kind of shuts their brains off in July and August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2843.172">Everyone's</a>  taking vacations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2844.814">Everybody,</a>  all through City Hall, architects, lawyers, everyone wants to enjoy the summer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2850.801">So</a>  we kind of adopted ages ago to be off on <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2855.586">July</a>  and August, because it was very difficult to get anything done because everyone was either North or South. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2862.594">But</a>  Chairman Delafano said, let's have a meeting in August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2869.02">Let's</a>  see if we can tie up some loose ends so we go into the September meeting fast. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2875.047">Thank</a>  you for this.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=2998.588">So</a>  tomorrow we plan on doing a social event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3001.97">It's</a>  going to be a class event for the members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3004.872">It's</a>  a members only club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3006.633">And</a>  then after that, we're going to have a social down in our lobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3010.435">We'll</a>  have a DJ. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3011.596">We'll</a>  have photo booth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3012.696">We'll</a>  have some food like charcuterie board, avocado toast. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3018.299">And</a>  we also wanted to have beer and wine options as well.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3023.706">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3025.087">And</a>  this is a new gym that's coming into the city in that area?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3030.972">We've</a>  been here for two years now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3032.533">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3033.234">Where</a>  were you exactly? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3036.336">You</a>  were where Boston Sports was?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3038.518">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3038.898">We're</a>  in the same building as Boston Sports Club.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3042.321">Where</a>  were you two years ago to kick something like that off? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3047.305">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3048.124">We</a>  are now ready to go and get kicked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3050.304">And</a>  I said, we need to reach out to Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3051.845">We</a>  need to talk to all these people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3053.185">Let's</a>  get it going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3053.885">I</a>  just got into this position. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3054.745">My</a>  name is Darren. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3055.425">I</a>  am the assistant to Kiana when it comes to the classes in the club.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3060.426">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3061.506">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3062.307">And</a>  now this particular event, it's a closed to the public open invitation only to your members, correct?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3070.508">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3071.168">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3071.708">And</a>  there's no charge for the alcohol? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3073.969">Or</a>  is there a charge for the alcohol? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3077.441">It</a>  doesn't make a difference.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3079.942">Yeah,</a>  we were thinking about just doing some drink tickets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3084.905">We</a>  haven't fleshed that one out if we were going to charge or do drink tickets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3088.487">We're</a>  more on the side of handing out drink tickets, maybe two drink tickets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3092.809">They</a>  can get a glass of wine and a glass of beer and call it a day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3096.971">But</a>  we haven't fleshed out if it was going to be for sale or not.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3099.789">Okay,</a>  so that is the reason why you needed to apply for the one-day license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3104.031">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3105.092">You</a>  know, if it was just a private, closed event by invitation only, that you're gonna serve a little food and alcoholic beverages in your own facility, there'd be no need for the one-day, but when it involves possibly selling tickets or whatever, this is the best way for you to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3124.542">And</a>  just do yourself a favor, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3128.044">Check</a>  with your insurance company to make sure you have liability insurance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3132.411">God</a>  forbid one of your patrons leaves there and has an accident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3137.437">kill</a>  somebody, whatever, God forbid, like I said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3141.06">But</a>  you may want to just cover your own butts that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3144.223">And</a>  it's super cheap. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3146.024">You</a>  can get it for one day if they want to put a rider on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3151.088">And</a>  you can call them today and say, how much is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3153.45">Just</a>  put it on for tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3154.871">That's</a>  100% your decision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3157.854">But</a>  it would be a wise thing to do.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3160.576">Yeah,</a>  be safe and sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3161.676">And</a>  your bartender, of course, will be TIP certified, or they'll be certified one way or another? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3167.457">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3167.778">I'm</a>  Lynn, I'm the North Shore leader, and we have 206, well, we have 70 clubs within the US that are certified to serve full liquor, beer, and wine license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3180.14">Here</a>  at North Shore, we have a full license through Massachusetts under my name, so I'm the one who's gonna be serving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3185.261">I'm</a>  TIP certified.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3186.601">Cool,</a>  very good, very good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3189.958">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3190.759">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3192.16">Do</a>  we, did we get a sketch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3194.802">Yes,</a>  we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3195.623">We</a>  got the sketch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3196.503">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3196.964">And</a>  I can see where the alcohol is going to be served. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3201.247">And</a>  yeah, it's food table there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3204.75">Everything</a>  looks good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3207.052">Sounds</a>  like you folks have done this once or twice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3209.194">So</a>  I'm sure.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3210.234">Is</a>  that written on a napkin? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3211.415">Is</a>  that drawn on a napkin?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3216.715">I</a>  worked really hard on that one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3219.096">I</a>  told her I was not doing it, so she had to.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3221.596">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3222.717">It's</a>  perfectly fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3223.897">It</a>  doesn't have to be from an architect or an engineer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3226.678">Just</a>  give us a lay of the land, so to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3229.839">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3230.679">We</a>  got them on pizza boxes before, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3233.1">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3234.721">That</a>  was a classic.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3236.261">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3238.882">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3239.782">I</a>  don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3241.483">Do</a>  you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3242.693">No,</a>  not at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3244.194">Let</a>  me make a motion to accept a one-day license to be held August 22nd at 70 Station Landing.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3626.565">And</a>  I think that it worked out really well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3630.726">You</a>  saw as soon as we put in mandatory in red, they just skyrocketed for attendance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3636.188">So</a>  I think to follow Ralph's cue on that was a good idea. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3639.75">And</a>  we got a great response. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3644.411">And</a>  what I'm trying to think of is see if we can do something that's gonna be easier for all of us when they come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3651.534">I</a>  mean, maybe they'll notice we can have them print it, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3656.232">sign</a>  it and hand it to us when they come in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3659.413">And</a>  now we know who's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3661.574">Instead</a>  of me trying to read this micro little sheet there, checking them off and you know, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3667.296">I</a>  mean, you just collect the sheets as they come in and then we tie them up later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3670.897">We</a>  know who's there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3673.538">You</a>  know, we might even be able to get a little, maybe <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3680.151">I</a>  don't want to say vital information, but just say current manager on file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3686.753">I</a>  think that's on the annual license renewal anyways, the form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3691.174">But</a>  just so that we don't have any issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3694.734">You</a>  can't do that because you're not the person that's the license manager that's on file, that type of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3701.356">It</a>  gets kicked back from the ABCC like it did at the Firefighters Club. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3706.047">So,</a>  um, you know, you may want to, uh, we may want to look into that, but I think that's about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3712.093">I</a>  mean, uh, um, unless you guys got anything else.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3717.638">Um,</a>  one thing, Mr. Chairman, um, July 17th is when we had the hearings for the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3725.345">The,</a>  the people, the merchants that fail to control compliance checks, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3730.486">Yes,</a>  October 17th is 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3734.188">So,</a>  okay, do we circle back to them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3737.208">This</a>  is commercial circle back to them, or are you going to circle back to them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3741.69">How</a>  do we. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3743.05">How</a>  do we address those seven? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3745.153">Was</a>  it seven or eight? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3746.314">I</a>  forgot.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3747.095">It</a>  was six. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3749.799">Yeah,</a>  one of them came back, deep cuts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3751.661">I</a>  was going to tell him, nice job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3754.404">Yeah,</a>  he did it real quick, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3756.847">He</a>  got them all done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3758.57">Did</a>  we get any response from the others? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3760.592">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001210_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3761.782">No,</a>  I just have deep cuts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3764.184">I</a>  just put it actually in file yesterday because I was trying to plan out how to do it because it was due to violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3771.009">I'm</a>  thinking that I can send a reminder. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3774.592">I</a>  actually wanted to do a letter to begin with and I have it drafted saying this is what's going to happen, that there's going to be a new file, please send it to us within 90 days from this date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3789.783">whatever</a>  this is like your first notice and then I can do in a couple of weeks second notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3794.985">Hopefully</a>  they've realized that we're not going to let it go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3797.786">So</a>  they will stay on top of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3799.967">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3800.487">That's</a>  kind of what I was saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3802.467">October</a>  17th will be 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3803.988">If</a>  you just go 17, 17, 17.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3806.169">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3806.869">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3808.29">I</a>  mean, if it, you know, if we don't get much of a response, um, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3814.712">Did</a>  you want to throw in something like we did to blue Fuji today? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3818.87">that</a>  we're going to hold a one-day suspension for you in abidance if you don't comply with the 90-day rule of the TIP certifications.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3830.233">It's</a>  not a bad idea to add some teeth to it so they know we're serious and they understand the seriousness of what happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3838.816">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3840.196">I</a>  guess we can discuss that.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3842.417">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3842.677">I</a>  mean, it's nothing that's going to harm them unless they don't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3846.819">Unless</a>  they don't do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3847.8">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3848.72">And,</a>  you know, to be honest with you, it's the honor system. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3853.323">I</a>  don't know how many people Al-Ahmad Iran has got working in his business that are serving alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3858.745">So</a>  if they send us six, that's how many? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3862.347">Six.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3862.807">And</a>  if they send us 19, there's 19.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3865.069">It's</a>  kind of like... But they should live up to what we did, you know, what we asked of them.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3871.752">So</a>  and we're hoping that they're honest enough to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3875.315">And,</a>  you know, I mean, we're not going to police them and go in and look at their books and how many.</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3879.978">No,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3881.279">That's</a>  not.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3882.24">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3882.4">You</a>  know, let's let's just let's be up front and hopefully they do the right thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3888.365">And</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3889.846">And</a>  just kind of fire a shot across the bow, just in case they don't do the right thing, they're not going to say, hey, you know, it's just kind of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3898.317">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3899.998">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3902.099">Nothing</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3904.439">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3904.58">I</a>  think that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3906.22">Alan,</a>  you've been doing some traveling, I hope?</p>

    <p>[VQ37Ro1sDkM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3908.881">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3909.562">No,</a>  just back and forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3911.302">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3912.003">Just</a>  back and forth.</p>

    <p>[PQNVkYiOrIU_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3913.463">That's</a>  because the weather's too nice here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3915.364">You</a>  got to wait until the cooler weather. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3917.085">Go</a>  to visit the little place in Florida there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3921.466">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3922.167">Good</a>  for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3922.567">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3924.388">All</a>  right, folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3925.935">All</a>  right, I motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3928.202">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3928.925">I'm</a>  supposed to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3929.828">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3931.714">I</a>  second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3932.496">All</a>  in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3933.62">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=3934.724">Let</a>  me follow up.</p>
