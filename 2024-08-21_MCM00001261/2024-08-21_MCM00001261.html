    <p>[Ziye OuYang]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=211.18">I</a>  think in July 17th, we didn't receive the envelope on time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=216.061">That's</a>  why we missed the scheduled meeting.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=353.445">Daria,</a>  if you don't mind, can you kind of explain the procedure when we do want to see some of the merchants come before the commission? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=364.153">How</a>  much leeway do we give them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=365.734">Do</a>  we give them three days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=367.255">Do</a>  we give them two weeks? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=369.437">What's</a>  the procedure to notify the merchants that we'd like to speak with them before the commission when they get caught up in a control compliance check?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=382.58">Yeah,</a>  this went out July 11th, so July 11th.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=387.381">Okay,</a>  and we were asking for them to appear on the 17th, so that's a week.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=393.663">Yeah,</a>  according to chapter 138, I don't know the section, but it's either 14 or 10 days, Commissioner, that we have to notify them, and it can't be, it's got to be within <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=409.408">the</a>  14, so it could be a day before, two days before, 10 days before, 14 days before, whatever it's stated in 138. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=418.472">And</a>  we kind of try to follow that rule to give everybody ample time, but apparently there's some kind of an issue with your email and maybe going out of the country or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=428.136">Do</a>  you have a personal email address that you just have here that, you know, if this commission wants to send you something, we can get you immediately?</p>

    <p>[Ziye OuYang]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=442.758">We</a>  have two Gmail addresses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=444.699">They're</a>  both owned by my manager here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=448.921">So</a>  I think I briefed both of them at gmail.com.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=454.363">You</a>  don't have to give it over the air or over the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=457.304">You</a>  can just email it right to Daria from that email, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=460.945">So</a>  that way she'll have that email and we have to notify you in the future.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=465.907">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=467.469">In</a>  case you're wondering, you know, why we're asking questions about this legally, we could have suspended your license but not appearing before the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=477.819">So</a>  we said, well, maybe there's something here that we don't understand, or maybe they didn't get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=484.161">Is</a>  it just something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=485.622">So</a>  we've always prided ourselves on working with the community, the merchants, giving you the benefit of the doubt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=494.646">When</a>  we see things, we don't immediately jump to the letter of the law, so to speak, because there's always two sides to every story. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=502.789">So</a>  that's kind of why we were wondering, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=506.31">you</a>  know, why we didn't see you on the 17th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=510.132">So</a>  just keep that in mind that we need to get, we need to lock down how to get in touch with you if this ever occurs again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=521.577">Because,</a>  you know, maybe next time we won't be as understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=525.639">Put</a>  it that way.</p>

    <p>[Blue Fuji]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=526.719">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=526.899">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=528.41">next</a>  time and we will not be having like this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=531.152">Even</a>  if I go back to China, I will give my email and give it to another manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=540.317">Because</a>  this time I didn't give the password when I go back and I didn't give him password. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=547.862">That's</a>  why we cannot open. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=549.623">But</a>  the next time I will, I will give him before I go back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=553.245">But</a>  normally I will not go back to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=556.687">Yeah,</a>  sorry for that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=560.749">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=561.729">Um,</a>  well at this time, what I'm going to do is turn this, um, this hearing, uh, for this particular case over to Lieutenant Lockowitz, Medford Police Department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=571.512">And</a>  he can, um, he can address, um, you folks and, and we'll go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=576.874">We'll</a>  give you an opportunity to respond to Lieutenant Lockowitz and, um, and, uh, Officer Smith as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=584.957">Um,</a>  Lieutenant?</p>

    <p>[Rory Lockowitz]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=588.452">Thank</a>  you commissioners and everybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=590.735">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=593.899">This</a>  violation occurred on June 20th as part of one of two days in which we conducted citywide compliance checks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=605.818">Um,</a>  being that there's just this one, we did all the other ones prior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=610.72">Um,</a>  I figured I'll, I'll turn it over to officer Smith, um, because the entire report is, is written from him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=617.703">Uh,</a>  if that's okay, I'll just turn it to officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=621.005">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Patrick Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=623.005">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=624.886">On</a>  Thursday, June 20th, myself and Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=627.447">Dhingra,</a>  who is the City of Medford's Prevention and Outreach Manager, conducted compliance checks with two 17-year-old juveniles in the City of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=637.431">At</a>  approximately 6.20 p.m., I parked on Ashland Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=641.252">I</a>  was in an unmarked vehicle with Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=642.693">Dhingra</a>  and the two 17-year-olds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=645.654">The</a>  two 17-year-olds were instructed to enter Blue Fuji and attempt to purchase alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=652.139">They</a>  were instructed to purchase Bud Light if possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=657.083">They</a>  were not trying to deceive anyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=660.105">If</a>  they were asked their age, they were told to say that they were 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=665.649">They</a>  had no form of identification on their person before entering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=670.573">and</a>  the two 17-year-olds entered Blue Fuji. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=674.034">Approximately</a>  five minutes later, Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=675.735">Dingor</a>  received a text from the juveniles and stated that they had been served alcohol, at which time I entered Blue Fuji and observed the two juveniles sitting at a booth in front of them with two Bud Light bottles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=690.38">which</a>  is an alcoholic beverage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=692.202">I</a>  approached the juveniles. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=693.723">I</a>  asked them what had transpired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=696.145">They</a>  said that they had ordered Bud Lights and they were not asked for identification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=700.789">They</a>  were not asked how old they were, and they were served the alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=705.253">I</a>  asked them who served them alcohol, and they pointed to the server who was later identified as Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=712.539">Ziyi</a>  Ouyang. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=713.96">I'm</a>  not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=715.981">The</a>  gentleman's before the commission today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=719.394">I</a>  did not know that he was the assistant manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=721.341">He</a>  told me that he was a server and he'd only worked there a couple months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=726.469">The</a>  juveniles then returned to Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=728.25">Dhingra,</a>  and I spoke to Mr. Ouyang, and I asked him, you know, I explained that he had served alcohol to two juveniles that was 17 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=738.455">He</a>  said that he apologized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=740.856">He</a>  said that he thought they were tough students and that he usually does not card anybody if they look over the age of 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=746.96">These</a>  were two 17-year-olds that looked nowhere close to 30. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=754.083">I</a>  asked for the manager and I learned that the manager was on vacation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=758.804">I</a>  informed Mr. Yang that this would be documented and submitted to this commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=764.545">Those</a>  are essentially the facts.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=768.786">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=769.086">Thank</a>  you, Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=770.866">Thank</a>  you, Officer Smith. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.226">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.606">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=772.846">Dinger,</a>  would you care to comment?</p>

    <p>[Catherine Dhingra]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=778.627">I</a>  have no additional comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=780.108">That</a>  was very accurate as to what happened.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=783.651">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=785.633">Sir,</a>  would you like to say anything in your defense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=793.36">Would</a>  you like to speak about the matter of Blue Fuji?</p>

    <p>[Ziye OuYang]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=796.283">I</a>  did it by mistake.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=804.682">Okay,</a>  so it was a mistake, it was, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=810.543">Mr.</a>  Commissioner Allen, would you like to comment?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=814.985">Yeah,</a>  you know, these control compliance checks, we take them very seriously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=823.387">I</a>  guess I'll just flip the cards and say, thank goodness, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=829.457">These</a>  two were served, and they were double served and triple served, and then they got in the car and they hit somebody or they were wrapped in the car around a tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=841.221">Because</a>  ultimately, that's the whole purpose of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=848.077">I'm</a>  just glad it was a controlled compliance check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=853.623">As</a>  I read through the report, it sounded like they were the only two there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=856.487">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=858.189">Is</a>  some business better than no business? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=860.411">I'm</a>  not quite sure what Blue Fuji's philosophy is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=867.219">We</a>  are a little disappointed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=869.902">Actually,</a>  to be honest with you, we're disappointed with everybody because in this last round of checks, it seemed like we snagged a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=878.11">So</a>  I don't know if it's a function of everybody's getting too lax or everyone's just damn grateful that people are coming in and spending money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=887.78">I'm</a>  not sure what it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=890.703">Nevertheless,</a>  we thank the city for doing these control compliance checks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=897.888">At</a>  some point, we'll get back to zero rather than whatever the last number was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=907.035">Mr.</a>  Chair and Mr. Delfano, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=911.667">I</a>  just, what irks me the most is the phrase about, I thought they were tough students. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=917.21">I'm</a>  not quite sure what that means. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=920.512">Does</a>  that mean that if you're a tough student, you just get a free ticket to come and drink at Blue Fuji? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=926.996">I'm</a>  not quite sure what that sentence means, or maybe I'm reading into it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=933.079">Can</a>  one of the two of you kind of explain what exactly does that mean, we thought they were tough students?</p>

    <p>[Ziye OuYang]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=940.559">Actually,</a>  at the time, I saw they were above 21 years old. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=944.922">That's</a>  what I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=947.064">Sorry</a>  about that, making any confusion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=952.452">Okay,</a>  so you know that if a tough student comes in and they just show you a student ID, it's not okay to serve them, correct? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=962.016">That's</a>  not acceptable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=963.996">You</a>  need a driver's license or passport or something of that nature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=969.638">So</a>  as long as we're clear on that from this point forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=976.881">Is</a>  anyone else on the call that would like to speak on behalf of this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=985.003">Okay,</a>  well, you know, what we feel as though on the first time, it's like my predecessor Alan said, we give everybody one bite of the apple. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1000.426">And</a>  you just had your bite of the apple because you didn't show up last month, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1006.389">And</a>  the people that did show up, they got a year probation and it was put into their file that if there were any incidences, we'd have to go to the next step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1021.355">So</a>  we're going to go right to the next step today, because you didn't show up the first time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1027.339">And</a>  when you didn't show up the first time, I could have ordered Lieutenant Larkowitz to go right to your establishment, take the license off the wall, and you wouldn't have been able to sell any liquor for these 30 days between the two meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1042.782">And</a>  if we didn't have a meeting today, you wouldn't have been able to sell until a scheduled meeting in September. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1048.387">That's</a>  how serious this is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1050.448">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1051.75">And</a>  I just want you to understand that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1054.672">And</a>  so the next step is what we're going to do is we're going to give you a one day suspension, but we're going to hold it in abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1063.28">What</a>  that means is if you don't have any issues like this for the next year, you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1074.852">You</a>  don't have to worry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1076.373">If</a>  you do have an issue, then we suspend your license, okay?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1231.612">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1232.412">Well,</a>  you know, we've got a solution for that because the other part of this is from this point forward, any employees that you hire are going to be required to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1246.557">Do</a>  you know what TIP certified is?</p>

    <p>[Blue Fuji]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1250.139">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1250.819">It's</a>  called T-I-P-S. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1259.411">I</a>  have it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1260.631">You</a>  have that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1261.372">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1261.532">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1262.472">From</a>  this point forward, any waiter, waitress, attender, anybody that works in there that's going to handle alcohol will need to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1276.015">Now,</a>  what we're requiring you to do is when you hire a new employee, they have 30 days to get their certification. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1286.378">And</a>  when they do, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1288.427">You</a>  take that copy of that certification and you keep it in your file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1293.811">But</a>  your current employees, starting today, are going to need to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1300.535">And</a>  you're going to have 90 days for them to do it, which is three months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1307.34">And</a>  we're going to require you to send those certifications to Daria at the Liquor Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1316.476">to</a>  prove that they're all TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1319.837">You</a>  have three months to do that, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1323.178">From</a>  that point on, anybody that comes in that's hired, you have them TIP certified and you keep it in your own file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1331.841">We</a>  don't need a copy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1333.962">But</a>  just your current employees, we're gonna need a copy, okay? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1338.723">So</a>  that's all part of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1340.444">So</a>  you're gonna have the one day suspension held in abidance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1344.654">you're</a>  going to require all of your employees to be TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1351.198">And</a>  we will verify in 90 days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1354.32">And</a>  we'll verify in 90 days that they are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1356.481">Does</a>  that sound OK to you, Mr. Commissioner? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1360.323">Because</a>  it's a little more stringent.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1362.965">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1363.805">I</a>  think it's fair because of the severity of the incident. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1367.147">We</a>  could be a lot <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1371.444">harsher</a>  because if you go by the rules that have been written by our predecessors, they're a little more harsh. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1378.731">So</a>  I think we're fair in working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1381.814">We</a>  understand this was a one-time because Blue Fuji, I was very surprised to see you all on the list, honestly, because you guys have always been good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1391.363">But</a>  I think we're being fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1394.804">So</a>  Daria, if you don't mind, I will second the motion that Chairman Delafano has just laid out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1405.306">So</a>  I do second the motion.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1572.385">Yeah,</a>  no, I agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1574.386">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I looked at it too, and you're absolutely right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1577.947">Brian</a>  runs a good shop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1580.108">You</a>  must have a huge bouncer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1581.308">Is</a>  that what it is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1582.349">Is</a>  that the secret? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1583.029">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1583.889">You</a>  have a big bouncer? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1585.39">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1587.11">Just</a>  joking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1587.73">But</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1588.211">We</a>  do have the insurance on file, and you could have a great track record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1592.992">So</a>  Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'm just going to make a motion to approve the one-day license <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1600.935">for</a>  event them for Thursday, August 22nd on Salem Street.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1625.455">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1629.038">Okay,</a>  next item on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1633.68">It's</a>  Nick, I believe, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1637.241">Let</a>  me take a look. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1638.982">Nick,</a>  yes, you're up next.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1645.184">Sorry,</a>  my apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1645.945">I</a>  might have made a slight error in my application form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1648.445">I</a>  know Daria sent me a new one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1652.467">whinging</a>  in Alan's ear early about traveling a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1655.169">And</a>  I think I said I was a non-profit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1657.25">So</a>  I will click and make sure I didn't do that incorrectly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1661.372">And</a>  I'll send this to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1662.953">I</a>  couldn't do it speedily enough to correct my fat finger clicking the wrong thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1668.837">So</a>  my apologies for... Yeah, not a problem.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1672.619">The</a>  other thing I noticed too, Nick, was under the full description, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1678.437">On</a>  page 2, you wrote the alcohol will only be served in and it stopped there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1683.904">I</a>  didn't know where you were going with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1685.867">Or</a>  if you picked that up and maybe corrected it on the new application that you sent the dairy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1691.574">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1692.832">Okay,</a>  I better correct that as well.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1695.493">No,</a>  no, just check it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1698.474">Tell</a>  us a little bit about what's going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1700.155">What</a>  kind of event is it?</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1702.335">So</a>  this is basically in West Medford, in the car park behind Snappy Patty's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1709.618">It's</a>  in collaboration with the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the West Medford Chapter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1717.375">And</a>  basically, it's a celebration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1719.216">They</a>  used to do a thing, I think, a while back for Halloween. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1723.459">And</a>  then that ended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1725.16">And</a>  I was chatting with them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1726.321">They're</a>  trying to revitalize some fun in West Bedford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1730.084">So</a>  I got together with the chamber. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1732.626">And</a>  basically, it's a food tasting, music, and beer event, which will be from 4 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1740.911">Sort</a>  of very family-friendly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1742.072">We've</a>  got two bands playing, all local people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1746.367">And</a>  then the Chamber is in charge of getting various food vendors who are all from all around the world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1753.534">I</a>  think Paul Revere Cafe is going to be doing some stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1756.697">I'm</a>  assuming Simple Fare, Snappy Patty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1760.08">So</a>  again, it's just a very sort of community-ized event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1764.043">And</a>  that's about it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1767.308">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1767.669">Do</a>  they still have that container out back there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1770.432">It</a>  was like a small container that goes on the back of a tractor trailer that the side was cut out that Nick can make like a little area.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1778.142">Yeah,</a>  I think that's probably Snappy Patty says that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1782.228">Oh,</a>  is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1782.808">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1783.209">I</a>  didn't know that was theirs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1784.451">I</a>  saw it there.</p>

    <p>[Nick Bolitho]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1785.797">Yeah,</a>  I think it's their sort of outdoor dining experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1792.062">Gotcha.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1793.723">I've</a>  always liked that spot for events because it's only three points to get in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1798.807">There's</a>  only three ways you can get in and out of that whole area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1802.33">So</a>  it's very easy to control, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1807.174">Two</a>  of them you can enter by car and then there's that alley in between. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1810.737">We</a>  have Pompeo insurances and I forget the other. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1816.247">But</a>  that's a great place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1819.352">Again,</a>  Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1825.542">Nick</a>  is right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1826.623">They</a>  used to do the Halloween one there, and then it kind of stopped. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1829.408">I</a>  don't know if <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1830.478">If</a>  COVID put the kibosh on it, I'm just not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1834.202">But</a>  I'm glad that an outdoor event has been resurrected to be held there in the municipal parking lot, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1841.769">Because</a>  I kept seeing Karpack. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1843.11">I'm</a>  like, he's up the heights? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1844.832">Because</a>  when I see Karpack, I immediately think North Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1849.712">But</a>  let me start my babbling here and let me make a motion to approve the one day license for the event of September 14th in West Medford in the municipal parking lot behind 465 High Street.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1867.632">I'll</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1869.453">If</a>  we could just add to it to make sure that we have the updated application as well beforehand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1876.398">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1880.781">I'll</a>  second the motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1881.682">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1882.823">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1884.224">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1885.805">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the motion passes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1888.407">You're</a>  all set, Nick.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1889.646">Great,</a>  thank you very much, and I'll get that off to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1892.788">It's</a>  not going to rain that day, so you're going to be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1894.809">Excellent,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1896.35">Good</a>  luck with the event.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1897.911">Cheers,</a>  have a good one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1899.452">Bye-bye</a>  now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1902.093">OK,</a>  next on the agenda, deep cuts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1906.356">We</a>  have Jeff here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-08-21-24&start=1907.216">I</a>  thought I saw Jeff earlier, didn't I?</p>
