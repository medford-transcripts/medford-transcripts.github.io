1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,172
I guess we're all set to get started.

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:14,815
Public meeting of the City of Medford License Commission for August 21st, which was originally an unscheduled meeting, will come to order.

3
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,215
We do have an agenda for this meeting.

4
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:26,190
I believe the minutes were held up.

5
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,312
So we weren't able to review them.

6
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:30,072
That's the 1st item on the agenda.

7
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:34,515
Um, is this, um, is this correct?

8
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:39,637
If so, uh, I can make a motion to, um, waive the minutes until the next meeting.

9
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:40,298
Yes.

10
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:41,659
Okay.

11
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:49,903
Um, I'll make a motion to waive the minutes of the unscheduled July meeting, um, for,

12
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:53,183
until the September meeting.

13
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,123
Alan, you want to second that?

14
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:10,386
I second the motion to waive the minutes of the July 17, and we'll review them in September when we meet.

15
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:14,127
Sounds good.

16
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,568
All those in favor?

17
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:16,408
Now when we come back.

18
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:20,138
and our normal meetings.

19
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,598
Sure, I'll second the motion.

20
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:22,819
Okay.

21
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,000
All those in favor?

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,380
Aye.

23
00:01:29,783 --> 00:01:30,303
All those opposed?

24
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:30,463
Aye.

25
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:31,203
Yep.

26
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:32,664
All those opposed?

27
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:36,566
Hearing and seeing none, the motion passes.

28
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,007
Helen, you're coming up broken up again.

29
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:43,469
I don't know if it's the same issue we might've had last month.

30
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,191
You're freezing, or freezing up.

31
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:48,572
But just so you're aware.

32
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,453
Okay, let's see what the next item.

33
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:53,973
Okay, thank you.

34
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:55,114
You're welcome.

35
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,617
We'll see what the next item on the agenda is.

36
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:02,380
Blue Fuji.

37
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,503
Do we have a representative from Blue Fuji?

38
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:06,783
Yes.

39
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:08,884
Okay.

40
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:13,368
Could you kindly state your name and address for the record, please?

41
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,109
My name is Ziyi Ouyang.

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,912
I'm the assistant manager in Blue Fuji, Manfred.

43
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:21,603
Okay.

44
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:26,587
All righty.

45
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:33,612
Um, what we're here for today, sir, is the, uh, an issue of compliance issue.

46
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:40,938
Um, there was a, um, a compliance check done at your establishment.

47
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,161
Um, let me just open up my file.

48
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:44,741
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:45,482
Yeah.

50
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:48,484
Okay.

51
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,039
on June 20th of 2024.

52
00:02:52,199 --> 00:03:01,462
And you folks attempted to, or did sell alcohol to a minor.

53
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:16,426
The city of Medford, with the police department, the Board of Health, was doing a compliance check that evening as part of all of the restaurants and package stores in the city.

54
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:25,578
You were sent an original notice to appear before this board in July.

55
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,699
Is there a reason why you didn't attend, sir?

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,981
I think in July 17th, we didn't receive the envelope on time.

57
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:38,382
That's why we missed the scheduled meeting.

58
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,523
It was a scheduled meeting.

59
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:43,543
Is there a reason why you didn't attend?

60
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,264
Yeah, we didn't receive the envelope.

61
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:45,764
That's why.

62
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:47,845
You didn't receive the information?

63
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:58,591
Okay, would you be able to I heard that you didn't receive the information because we sent it regular mail and email.

64
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:03,513
So, would you kindly just email a secretary area.

65
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,594
Your current information, your email address.

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:18,583
Postal address any the managerial license the owner would just send her so we know that we're reaching the right person when we send you a notice.

67
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:19,725
No problem.

68
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:24,405
Yeah, can I say something?

69
00:04:24,425 --> 00:04:25,986
Absolutely.

70
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:38,515
Yeah, I'm in China and the blue email and I cannot open in China, so I didn't see any messages from, you know, cannot see any, you know, email.

71
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,358
And the letter you mailed to us, we didn't get it.

72
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:44,719
That's why we missed the first meeting.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,062
And the email I cannot open in China, so I don't know.

74
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:53,027
Okay, okay, so the mail, I'm sorry, Mr chair.

75
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:57,050
So, what it's my understanding that you didn't get the mail.

76
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,452
So we sent it by mail, which you didn't get.

77
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:05,758
And then you didn't open the email address that we sent from the city of Medford.

78
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,970
Yeah, email is because I'm in vacation.

79
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,070
I'm in China.

80
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:15,212
In China, I cannot go and open the Google.

81
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:21,575
So also my email address is bluefujibosney at gmail.com.

82
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,036
So I cannot open.

83
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,497
I also didn't check.

84
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:52,745
uh didn't China cannot open so that's why I cannot check when I go back to China when I go back to here and I see the email so I open the mailbox but it's already go because that's why and I we call the city hall immediately and ask and request can we give another choice to and have another meeting that's why I say

85
00:05:53,445 --> 00:06:03,653
Daria, if you don't mind, can you kind of explain the procedure when we do want to see some of the merchants come before the commission?

86
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:05,674
How much leeway do we give them?

87
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,235
Do we give them three days?

88
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:08,396
Do we give them two weeks?

89
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:20,945
What's the procedure to notify the merchants that we'd like to speak with them before the commission when they get caught up in a control compliance check?

90
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,621
Yeah, this went out July 11th, so July 11th.

91
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:32,423
Okay, and we were asking for them to appear on the 17th, so that's a week.

92
00:06:33,663 --> 00:06:48,487
Yeah, according to chapter 138, I don't know the section, but it's either 14 or 10 days, Commissioner, that we have to notify them, and it can't be, it's got to be within

93
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:57,231
the 14, so it could be a day before, two days before, 10 days before, 14 days before, whatever it's stated in 138.

94
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:08,116
And we kind of try to follow that rule to give everybody ample time, but apparently there's some kind of an issue with your email and maybe going out of the country or something.

95
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:17,180
Do you have a personal email address that you just have here that, you know, if this commission wants to send you something, we can get you immediately?

96
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,339
We have two Gmail addresses.

97
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,280
They're both owned by my manager here.

98
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:34,303
So I think I briefed both of them at gmail.com.

99
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:37,264
You don't have to give it over the air or over the meeting.

100
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:40,785
You can just email it right to Daria from that email, okay?

101
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:45,347
So that way she'll have that email and we have to notify you in the future.

102
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:46,908
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:56,720
In case you're wondering, you know, why we're asking questions about this legally, we could have suspended your license but not appearing before the commission.

104
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:04,141
So we said, well, maybe there's something here that we don't understand, or maybe they didn't get it.

105
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:05,082
Is it just something?

106
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:13,505
So we've always prided ourselves on working with the community, the merchants, giving you the benefit of the doubt.

107
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:22,749
When we see things, we don't immediately jump to the letter of the law, so to speak, because there's always two sides to every story.

108
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,889
So that's kind of why we were wondering,

109
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,712
you know, why we didn't see you on the 17th.

110
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:39,996
So just keep that in mind that we need to get, we need to lock down how to get in touch with you if this ever occurs again.

111
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:44,939
Because, you know, maybe next time we won't be as understanding.

112
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,299
Put it that way.

113
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:46,879
Okay.

114
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah.

115
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,052
next time and we will not be having like this one.

116
00:08:51,152 --> 00:09:00,077
Even if I go back to China, I will give my email and give it to another manager.

117
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:07,842
Because this time I didn't give the password when I go back and I didn't give him password.

118
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,163
That's why we cannot open.

119
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:13,105
But the next time I will, I will give him before I go back.

120
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,167
But normally I will not go back to them.

121
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:17,508
Yeah, sorry for that.

122
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,188
We, we, we understand.

123
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:19,949
Okay.

124
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,009
Okay.

125
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:30,632
Um, well at this time, what I'm going to do is turn this, um, this hearing, uh, for this particular case over to Lieutenant Lockowitz, Medford Police Department.

126
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:36,674
And he can, um, he can address, um, you folks and, and we'll go from there.

127
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:44,216
We'll give you an opportunity to respond to Lieutenant Lockowitz and, um, and, uh, Officer Smith as well.

128
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:46,277
Um, Lieutenant?

129
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,695
Thank you commissioners and everybody else.

130
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:51,336
Good afternoon.

131
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:04,393
This violation occurred on June 20th as part of one of two days in which we conducted citywide compliance checks.

132
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,940
Um, being that there's just this one, we did all the other ones prior.

133
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,623
Um, I figured I'll, I'll turn it over to officer Smith, um, because the entire report is, is written from him.

134
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,744
Uh, if that's okay, I'll just turn it to officer Smith.

135
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:21,285
Sure.

136
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:23,625
Hello, everyone.

137
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:27,427
On Thursday, June 20th, myself and Ms.

138
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:36,090
Dhingra, who is the City of Medford's Prevention and Outreach Manager, conducted compliance checks with two 17-year-old juveniles in the City of Medford.

139
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:41,212
At approximately 6.20 p.m., I parked on Ashland Street.

140
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,673
I was in an unmarked vehicle with Ms.

141
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,033
Dhingra and the two 17-year-olds.

142
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:51,839
The two 17-year-olds were instructed to enter Blue Fuji and attempt to purchase alcohol.

143
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,902
They were instructed to purchase Bud Light if possible.

144
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,784
They were not trying to deceive anyone.

145
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:04,949
If they were asked their age, they were told to say that they were 17 years old.

146
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,712
They had no form of identification on their person before entering.

147
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,294
and the two 17-year-olds entered Blue Fuji.

148
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,715
Approximately five minutes later, Ms.

149
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:29,180
Dingor received a text from the juveniles and stated that they had been served alcohol, at which time I entered Blue Fuji and observed the two juveniles sitting at a booth in front of them with two Bud Light bottles.

150
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,621
which is an alcoholic beverage.

151
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,403
I approached the juveniles.

152
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,665
I asked them what had transpired.

153
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:40,749
They said that they had ordered Bud Lights and they were not asked for identification.

154
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:44,372
They were not asked how old they were, and they were served the alcohol.

155
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:52,298
I asked them who served them alcohol, and they pointed to the server who was later identified as Ms.

156
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:53,740
Ziyi Ouyang.

157
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,681
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

158
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,483
The gentleman's before the commission today.

159
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,261
I did not know that he was the assistant manager.

160
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:03,890
He told me that he was a server and he'd only worked there a couple months.

161
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:08,030
The juveniles then returned to Ms.

162
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:17,715
Dhingra, and I spoke to Mr. Ouyang, and I asked him, you know, I explained that he had served alcohol to two juveniles that was 17 years old.

163
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,096
He said that he apologized.

164
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:26,860
He said that he thought they were tough students and that he usually does not card anybody if they look over the age of 30.

165
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,942
These were two 17-year-olds that looked nowhere close to 30.

166
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:38,264
I asked for the manager and I learned that the manager was on vacation.

167
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:43,805
I informed Mr. Yang that this would be documented and submitted to this commission.

168
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,765
Those are essentially the facts.

169
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:49,046
Okay.

170
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:50,846
Thank you, Officer Smith.

171
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:51,726
Thank you, Officer Smith.

172
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:52,466
Yeah.

173
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:52,826
Ms.

174
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,547
Dinger, would you care to comment?

175
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,007
I have no additional comments.

176
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:02,588
That was very accurate as to what happened.

177
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:04,272
Okay, great.

178
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,216
Sir, would you like to say anything in your defense?

179
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,263
Would you like to speak about the matter of Blue Fuji?

180
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,266
I did it by mistake.

181
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:27,643
Okay, so it was a mistake, it was, okay.

182
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,464
Mr. Commissioner Allen, would you like to comment?

183
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:42,766
Yeah, you know, these control compliance checks, we take them very seriously.

184
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:48,328
I guess I'll just flip the cards and say, thank goodness,

185
00:13:49,457 --> 00:14:00,761
These two were served, and they were double served and triple served, and then they got in the car and they hit somebody or they were wrapped in the car around a tree.

186
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:04,342
Because ultimately, that's the whole purpose of this.

187
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:12,042
I'm just glad it was a controlled compliance check.

188
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:16,467
As I read through the report, it sounded like they were the only two there.

189
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,588
I don't know.

190
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,211
Is some business better than no business?

191
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:24,977
I'm not quite sure what Blue Fuji's philosophy is.

192
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,961
We are a little disappointed.

193
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:38,050
Actually, to be honest with you, we're disappointed with everybody because in this last round of checks, it seemed like we snagged a lot.

194
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:47,600
So I don't know if it's a function of everybody's getting too lax or everyone's just damn grateful that people are coming in and spending money.

195
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,921
I'm not sure what it is.

196
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:57,508
Nevertheless, we thank the city for doing these control compliance checks.

197
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:03,192
At some point, we'll get back to zero rather than whatever the last number was.

198
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:09,317
Mr. Chair and Mr. Delfano,

199
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:17,130
I just, what irks me the most is the phrase about, I thought they were tough students.

200
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,172
I'm not quite sure what that means.

201
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:26,976
Does that mean that if you're a tough student, you just get a free ticket to come and drink at Blue Fuji?

202
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:32,399
I'm not quite sure what that sentence means, or maybe I'm reading into it.

203
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,242
Can one of the two of you kind of explain what exactly does that mean, we thought they were tough students?

204
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,462
Actually, at the time, I saw they were above 21 years old.

205
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:45,643
That's what I mean.

206
00:15:47,064 --> 00:15:49,286
Sorry about that, making any confusion.

207
00:15:52,452 --> 00:16:01,796
Okay, so you know that if a tough student comes in and they just show you a student ID, it's not okay to serve them, correct?

208
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:03,036
That's not acceptable.

209
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:09,578
You need a driver's license or passport or something of that nature.

210
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:14,180
So as long as we're clear on that from this point forward.

211
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,703
Is anyone else on the call that would like to speak on behalf of this?

212
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:39,222
Okay, well, you know, what we feel as though on the first time, it's like my predecessor Alan said, we give everybody one bite of the apple.

213
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:45,328
And you just had your bite of the apple because you didn't show up last month, okay?

214
00:16:46,389 --> 00:17:00,075
And the people that did show up, they got a year probation and it was put into their file that if there were any incidences, we'd have to go to the next step.

215
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:07,219
So we're going to go right to the next step today, because you didn't show up the first time.

216
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:21,609
And when you didn't show up the first time, I could have ordered Lieutenant Larkowitz to go right to your establishment, take the license off the wall, and you wouldn't have been able to sell any liquor for these 30 days between the two meetings.

217
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:27,986
And if we didn't have a meeting today, you wouldn't have been able to sell until a scheduled meeting in September.

218
00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:29,988
That's how serious this is.

219
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:30,789
Okay.

220
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,711
And I just want you to understand that.

221
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:42,398
And so the next step is what we're going to do is we're going to give you a one day suspension, but we're going to hold it in abidance.

222
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:53,971
What that means is if you don't have any issues like this for the next year, you're all set.

223
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,693
You don't have to worry.

224
00:17:56,373 --> 00:18:00,558
If you do have an issue, then we suspend your license, okay?

225
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,779
So, excuse me, can I say something?

226
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
I work for Blue Fuji already for almost 10 years.

227
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,421
Most of the time, I do all the job by myself.

228
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:24,565
Because this month, it's in June, I go back to China.

229
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:29,947
So I hire this person, Tesla, for I think one and a half months.

230
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,569
And I tell them, and a check ID or something, a check ID must do your service at home.

231
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,810
I tell them.

232
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,452
And so, but maybe, and he is new.

233
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:49,997
work for this position and have experience is not too many.

234
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:58,244
Also, their day is nearly close, maybe he be busy to closing something.

235
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,472
don't check the ID.

236
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:08,376
He told me he thinks he's a top student and more than 21.

237
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,559
He thinks about that, so he forgot to check.

238
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,941
This is his mistake.

239
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:19,546
I told him he must check, but he didn't do it.

240
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:24,329
Most of the time, I think in the day, you do, right?

241
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,572
He stays close to something that we forgot to check it.

242
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:30,952
It's his mistake.

243
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:33,273
But most of the time, I do.

244
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,094
I'm not on vacation all the time.

245
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,455
I work every day.

246
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,015
Okay.

247
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:39,597
I check every time.

248
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:45,079
You can see when I think you not check only one time.

249
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:46,660
I think you check many times.

250
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,723
But we didn't make a mistake because I always check ID.

251
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:54,664
Even I look at he is a little older.

252
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:59,206
The one time I check the customer, can I use your ID?

253
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,567
He say, I'm older.

254
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,628
I'm 37.

255
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:05,049
I say, for me, I see you are younger.

256
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,070
That's why I check ID.

257
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:12,211
Really, I promise you, I check every time, even when he looks a little older.

258
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,792
When I wonder, I must check the ID immediately.

259
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:19,773
And then I show it, and he will give me the key.

260
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:26,995
But because I hire this person in just a short time, and it's just one and a half months, because I go back to China.

261
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:28,495
Really, really so sorry.

262
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,676
I hope you give us a chance.

263
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:31,932
Okay.

264
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:46,497
Well, you know, we've got a solution for that because the other part of this is from this point forward, any employees that you hire are going to be required to be TIP certified.

265
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,098
Do you know what TIP certified is?

266
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:50,659
Yeah.

267
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,300
It's called T-I-P-S.

268
00:20:59,411 --> 00:20:59,971
I have it.

269
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:01,211
You have that?

270
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:01,512
Yeah.

271
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:01,872
Okay.

272
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:14,895
From this point forward, any waiter, waitress, attender, anybody that works in there that's going to handle alcohol will need to be TIP certified.

273
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:25,317
Now, what we're requiring you to do is when you hire a new employee, they have 30 days to get their certification.

274
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:26,998
And when they do,

275
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:31,809
You take that copy of that certification and you keep it in your file.

276
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:39,935
But your current employees, starting today, are going to need to be TIP certified.

277
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:45,058
And you're going to have 90 days for them to do it, which is three months.

278
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:55,325
And we're going to require you to send those certifications to Daria at the Liquor Commission.

279
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:59,597
to prove that they're all TIP certified.

280
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:02,258
You have three months to do that, okay?

281
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:11,521
From that point on, anybody that comes in that's hired, you have them TIP certified and you keep it in your own file.

282
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,961
We don't need a copy.

283
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:17,183
But just your current employees, we're gonna need a copy, okay?

284
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:20,344
So that's all part of this.

285
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:23,745
So you're gonna have the one day suspension held in abidance.

286
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:30,417
you're going to require all of your employees to be TIP certified.

287
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,539
And we will verify in 90 days.

288
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,461
And we'll verify in 90 days that they are.

289
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,303
Does that sound OK to you, Mr. Commissioner?

290
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,384
Because it's a little more stringent.

291
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:43,325
No, no.

292
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,127
I think it's fair because of the severity of the incident.

293
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:48,228
We could be a lot

294
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:58,471
harsher because if you go by the rules that have been written by our predecessors, they're a little more harsh.

295
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,774
So I think we're fair in working.

296
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:10,823
We understand this was a one-time because Blue Fuji, I was very surprised to see you all on the list, honestly, because you guys have always been good.

297
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:14,344
But I think we're being fair.

298
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:23,446
So Daria, if you don't mind, I will second the motion that Chairman Delafano has just laid out.

299
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:26,906
So I do second the motion.

300
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:27,927
Okay.

301
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:29,827
All those in favor, aye.

302
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:31,347
Aye.

303
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:33,328
All those opposed?

304
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,649
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

305
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:37,789
Motion passed.

306
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,101
Okay, so you folks, you have any questions?

307
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:41,782
You're all set?

308
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,802
Okay, very good.

309
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:45,582
All right.

310
00:23:45,622 --> 00:23:46,223
Good luck.

311
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:47,323
Thank you for coming.

312
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,124
Thank you for attending.

313
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:52,304
Bye-bye.

314
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,464
Thank you.

315
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:55,864
Okay.

316
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:58,745
We are next on the agenda.

317
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:05,686
Cuisine and local at 344 Salem Street.

318
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,587
Are you guys still on the call?

319
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,033
Yeah, did I see Brian?

320
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:11,694
I thought I saw Brian earlier.

321
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:16,155
Is that his dapper picture on the right corner there?

322
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:17,416
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

323
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:18,396
Okay.

324
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:19,957
Brian, you here?

325
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:22,057
I am.

326
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:23,158
This is muting.

327
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:23,938
Can you hear me now?

328
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,298
I can hear you now.

329
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,879
Gosh, what is going on here?

330
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,760
Zoom is not... Hang on one second.

331
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,001
Hang on one second, Brian.

332
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,025
Lieutenant Lockowitz, I'm sorry.

333
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:36,706
We're all set.

334
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:42,867
If you and Officer Smith would like to leave, you can.

335
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,927
If you're not, you're more than welcome to stay on.

336
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:51,528
We've got a few things going on today, as you can see, and trying to keep you in the loop at the same time, but totally up to you, sir.

337
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,069
Very good.

338
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:53,689
Thank you.

339
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:55,109
Thank you.

340
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,569
Thank you, General.

341
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:59,190
And same with you, Mr. Griffin, as well.

342
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,270
Okay.

343
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,010
Thank you.

344
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:04,936
OK, so Brian, you're up next.

345
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,557
Good afternoon, everybody.

346
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:09,558
Good afternoon.

347
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:16,859
So I guess, Brian, tell us a little about the event.

348
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,981
So it's similar to any of the other performance events that we've had here.

349
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:27,902
Basically, it's a local showcase to some music.

350
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:33,656
It's a collaboration that we've done with JJ and Cuisine on Locale.

351
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:44,464
Yeah, beer and wine and then food available for service.

352
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,786
Yeah, just featuring some local musicians.

353
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:49,769
Okay.

354
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:53,180
Brian, you always do a good job.

355
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,062
We never have any issues with you.

356
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:56,003
Yeah.

357
00:25:56,604 --> 00:26:01,990
Daria has your insurance on file and we kind of know the layout there.

358
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,352
So this all looks good as usual.

359
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:08,957
I don't have an issue with any of it.

360
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,378
I checked it over.

361
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:11,840
Alan, do you?

362
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,126
Yeah, no, I agree.

363
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:17,927
Mr. Chairman, I looked at it too, and you're absolutely right.

364
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:20,088
Brian runs a good shop.

365
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:21,268
You must have a huge bouncer.

366
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:21,948
Is that what it is?

367
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,009
Is that the secret?

368
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,829
Not yet.

369
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,370
You have a big bouncer?

370
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:25,850
Not yet.

371
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,670
Just joking.

372
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,191
But you're right.

373
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:32,912
We do have the insurance on file, and you could have a great track record.

374
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:39,795
So Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'm just going to make a motion to approve the one-day license

375
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:47,781
for event them for Thursday, August 22nd on Salem Street.

376
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:49,662
Very good.

377
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:51,684
I will second that motion.

378
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:52,725
All those in favor?

379
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:53,385
Aye.

380
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:56,227
All those opposed?

381
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:00,471
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, motion is passed.

382
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:01,612
You're all set, pal.

383
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:02,873
All right, Brian, you're all set.

384
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:03,233
Good luck.

385
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:04,474
Thank you, everyone.

386
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:05,014
Take care now.

387
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:05,975
You're welcome.

388
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,139
Okay, next item on the agenda.

389
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,501
It's Nick, I believe, right?

390
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,882
Let me take a look.

391
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:24,324
Nick, yes, you're up next.

392
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:25,885
Sorry, my apologies.

393
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,425
I might have made a slight error in my application form.

394
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:30,106
I know Daria sent me a new one.

395
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,768
whinging in Alan's ear early about traveling a lot.

396
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:36,790
And I think I said I was a non-profit.

397
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,052
So I will click and make sure I didn't do that incorrectly.

398
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,673
And I'll send this to Daria.

399
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:48,436
I couldn't do it speedily enough to correct my fat finger clicking the wrong thing.

400
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:52,039
So my apologies for... Yeah, not a problem.

401
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:57,402
The other thing I noticed too, Nick, was under the full description,

402
00:27:58,437 --> 00:28:03,644
On page 2, you wrote the alcohol will only be served in and it stopped there.

403
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,767
I didn't know where you were going with that.

404
00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:11,554
Or if you picked that up and maybe corrected it on the new application that you sent the dairy.

405
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:11,975
I don't know.

406
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:15,213
Okay, I better correct that as well.

407
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,933
No, no, just check it out.

408
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,135
Tell us a little bit about what's going on.

409
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:21,475
What kind of event is it?

410
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:28,157
So this is basically in West Medford, in the car park behind Snappy Patty's.

411
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:35,800
It's in collaboration with the Medford Chamber of Commerce and the West Medford Chapter.

412
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,196
And basically, it's a celebration.

413
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:42,899
They used to do a thing, I think, a while back for Halloween.

414
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:44,440
And then that ended.

415
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,301
And I was chatting with them.

416
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,504
They're trying to revitalize some fun in West Bedford.

417
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,185
So I got together with the chamber.

418
00:28:52,626 --> 00:29:00,451
And basically, it's a food tasting, music, and beer event, which will be from 4 to 8 p.m.

419
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,052
Sort of very family-friendly.

420
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:05,214
We've got two bands playing, all local people.

421
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:13,514
And then the Chamber is in charge of getting various food vendors who are all from all around the world.

422
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:16,096
I think Paul Revere Cafe is going to be doing some stuff.

423
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:19,960
I'm assuming Simple Fare, Snappy Patty.

424
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,082
So again, it's just a very sort of community-ized event.

425
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:26,646
And that's about it.

426
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:27,528
Yeah.

427
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,932
Do they still have that container out back there?

428
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:37,742
It was like a small container that goes on the back of a tractor trailer that the side was cut out that Nick can make like a little area.

429
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:41,727
Yeah, I think that's probably Snappy Patty says that.

430
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:42,628
Oh, is it?

431
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:43,109
Okay.

432
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,230
I didn't know that was theirs.

433
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,171
I saw it there.

434
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:51,241
Yeah, I think it's their sort of outdoor dining experience.

435
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:53,423
Gotcha.

436
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:58,787
I've always liked that spot for events because it's only three points to get in.

437
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:02,290
There's only three ways you can get in and out of that whole area.

438
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,314
So it's very easy to control, you know.

439
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,717
Two of them you can enter by car and then there's that alley in between.

440
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:14,200
We have Pompeo insurances and I forget the other.

441
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,549
But that's a great place.

442
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:24,160
Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions.

443
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,583
Nick is right.

444
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:29,368
They used to do the Halloween one there, and then it kind of stopped.

445
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:29,808
I don't know if

446
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:33,681
If COVID put the kibosh on it, I'm just not sure.

447
00:30:34,202 --> 00:30:41,348
But I'm glad that an outdoor event has been resurrected to be held there in the municipal parking lot, right?

448
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:43,090
Because I kept seeing Karpack.

449
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,631
I'm like, he's up the heights?

450
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:48,535
Because when I see Karpack, I immediately think North Medford.

451
00:30:49,712 --> 00:31:03,110
But let me start my babbling here and let me make a motion to approve the one day license for the event of September 14th in West Medford in the municipal parking lot behind 465 High Street.

452
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,353
I'll second that motion.

453
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:16,378
If we could just add to it to make sure that we have the updated application as well beforehand.

454
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,160
Good point.

455
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:21,642
I'll second the motion.

456
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:22,263
All in favor?

457
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:23,283
Aye.

458
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:24,845
All opposed?

459
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:27,947
Hearing and seeing none, the motion passes.

460
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:29,188
You're all set, Nick.

461
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,728
Great, thank you very much, and I'll get that off to you.

462
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,789
It's not going to rain that day, so you're going to be good.

463
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,330
Excellent, thank you.

464
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,391
Good luck with the event.

465
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,432
Cheers, have a good one.

466
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:40,853
Bye-bye now.

467
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:46,076
OK, next on the agenda, deep cuts.

468
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,196
We have Jeff here.

469
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:52,159
I thought I saw Jeff earlier, didn't I?

470
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,380
I don't know.

471
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,663
I was wondering the same thing, but I sent him the Zoom link, so I don't know.

472
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:01,084
All right, you know what we can do, Dario?

473
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:04,185
We'll move him down to the end so we don't tie people up.

474
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:07,327
Yeah.

475
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:08,227
OK.

476
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:12,349
Yeah, I'll put him down the back here, and we'll go from there.

477
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,270
Maybe he'll circle back.

478
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:13,810
Yeah.

479
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,330
Yeah.

480
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:16,351
OK.

481
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,733
Next on the agenda is D1 Soccer.

482
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:22,895
I see Mr. Georges here.

483
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:24,776
Good afternoon, Mrs. Georges.

484
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:25,376
How are you?

485
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:26,416
Good afternoon.

486
00:32:26,617 --> 00:32:27,017
I'm well.

487
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:31,087
Good, good.

488
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,950
We have a couple of applications for one day licenses.

489
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,793
I'm going to let you tell us about the event in a minute, if you don't mind.

490
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:46,018
I'm assuming it's the same as the other ones you brought before the commission.

491
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:50,161
What I just did notice is that I see

492
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:58,054
One day license for the 24th of August and another one for the 25th of August.

493
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:00,897
Are you having two events or just one of the days?

494
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:05,142
Yeah, so I had to resubmit the application.

495
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:09,247
So it's the 25th that I need, not the 24th.

496
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:11,850
So it is the 25th.

497
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,871
Yes.

498
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:13,391
Okay.

499
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:13,772
Okay.

500
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:15,313
Yeah, that's okay.

501
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:17,915
So that's the 1 that just came over to us.

502
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:18,836
That was corrected.

503
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:19,636
Okay.

504
00:33:19,656 --> 00:33:23,900
So the 2nd, 1 of September 15th, that's the 2nd, 1, right?

505
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,680
Exactly.

506
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,061
Yeah.

507
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:33,773
OK, you can go ahead and tell us a little bit about what's going on with it and give us a little insight, and we should be good.

508
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:34,433
Sure.

509
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:37,574
So it's a lot of the same from last time.

510
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,855
I think it's the same people that are here.

511
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:44,376
So we're a semi-pro soccer league.

512
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:48,738
We try to create an atmosphere for semi-pro players to play.

513
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:54,200
Well, we bring the fans over and have a little festivity.

514
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:03,388
We like the fans to have an opportunity to enjoy the game, and sometimes a beer and wine helps.

515
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:13,538
We are requesting a DJ because we were told we can't do DJs, and we try to respect the city, the people living in the area.

516
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:18,683
So on certain days, especially like the playoffs, it would be nice to be able to entertain the fans.

517
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,012
Great.

518
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:21,294
That's awesome.

519
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:21,914
Good for you.

520
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:28,821
And you put the, on the new applications that you were in, in fact, having a entertainment, correct?

521
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:29,401
Yes.

522
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,662
So the applications.

523
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:33,085
Yep.

524
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:35,987
Yeah.

525
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,748
DJ's music.

526
00:34:36,848 --> 00:34:37,509
Okay, great.

527
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,693
Mr. Commissioner, you have any questions?

528
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,254
No, I do not.

529
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:43,795
Um,

530
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:47,875
I've reviewed it.

531
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,096
I understand what's going on, what he's asking for.

532
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,518
So no, I don't.

533
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,600
Other than the bigger question, how are you doing with your

534
00:34:59,823 --> 00:35:01,805
Fans, how's all that going?

535
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:03,086
Any incidents, anything?

536
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:06,748
Because I know you're very smart, Mr. Georges.

537
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:12,553
I know you know that you got to do the balance.

538
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,655
You got to make everybody happy, including the city.

539
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:17,757
So how are you doing with that?

540
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:19,878
So that's gone well.

541
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:27,141
So we've, we've seen, we've had more police activity in terms of calling for the police detail that showed up.

542
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:31,043
We've managed to get the fans out in a decent amount of time.

543
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:38,059
I mean, we have open communication with Kevin and the other staff with the city.

544
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,549
Whenever there's something that they don't, that happened that they might have some issue with, they contact us right away and we find ways to correct it.

545
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,052
We kind of give them, okay, thank you for letting us know.

546
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:49,333
Here's an update of what we're doing.

547
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:52,157
This is what we can do to manage the situation.

548
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:53,842
Perfect.

549
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,063
Good.

550
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,784
We want you to be successful.

551
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,505
The city wants you to be successful.

552
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:04,107
We love it that you chose the Metfit venue.

553
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,088
Let's just keep evolving and growing.

554
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,791
Whatever bugs there are, we'll get through them so we can have a lot of great years going forward.

555
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:15,352
Yes.

556
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:20,092
Um, Mr Chairman, I don't I don't have any other questions or concerns.

557
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,095
Okay, great.

558
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:28,183
Um, well, if is there anybody else here that would like to speak on behalf of these dis license being issued?

559
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:30,634
Okay.

560
00:36:30,874 --> 00:36:44,785
Hearing and seeing none, I'll make a motion to grant two one-day licenses to D1 Soccer for events being held from 5 to 9 p.m.

561
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:49,569
at Hormel Stadium, one on August 25th of 2024 and one on September 15th of 2024.

562
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:56,775
Very good.

563
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:57,775
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

564
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:05,858
I second that motion to grant both licenses on the August 25th and September 15th.

565
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,419
Okay, all those in favor.

566
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:08,819
Aye.

567
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:09,839
Aye.

568
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,040
All those opposed.

569
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,809
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

570
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,891
Mr. George is both your license granted.

571
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:19,712
Thank you.

572
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:20,012
Good luck.

573
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,595
I have one more question.

574
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:27,618
So we were approved on the, for the 31st.

575
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:32,482
Is it possible to change the dates around or is that in stone?

576
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,352
It's up to the secretary, Terry.

577
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:38,932
I don't think there's a problem with that, right?

578
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:40,132
The one on the 31st.

579
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:44,713
Because I know you're trying to do this like in playoffs or something, right?

580
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:45,233
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,254
We're juggling a couple of things around.

582
00:37:47,274 --> 00:38:03,377
So we're looking to move the 31st into September 8th to do more like a fan appreciation type of day and not do the DJs instead of the live band, which would be less noise.

583
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,298
Okay.

584
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:07,100
Mr. Chairman, let me make a motion.

585
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:16,127
I motion that we extend the license for August and move it to September 8th for an appreciation day.

586
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:17,529
Okay.

587
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,390
Thank you.

588
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,611
I'll second that motion.

589
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:22,693
All those in favor, aye.

590
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:24,334
All those opposed.

591
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:26,616
Hearing and seeing none.

592
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:27,537
The ayes have it.

593
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:28,818
Motion passed.

594
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:29,939
You're all set.

595
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,160
Thank you very much.

596
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,741
I appreciate it.

597
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:32,759
All right, cool.

598
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,560
Before you go away, Daria, is that OK?

599
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,300
You got it all, Daria?

600
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:37,941
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

601
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,581
It's up to you guys, not up to me.

602
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:45,463
No, no, Alan had to take the lead on that one, because that was a new one for me.

603
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:47,304
Thank you, Mr. Georges.

604
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,404
Good luck with your events.

605
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:49,184
Thank you.

606
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:50,145
Have a good day.

607
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,045
OK, bye-bye.

608
00:38:53,318 --> 00:39:01,565
I'm kind of thinking possibly just go a little out of order if Cordova is here.

609
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:03,266
It's just a license surrender.

610
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:07,009
That would be real quick, and we won't have to tie them up.

611
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,251
Is there any representatives from Cordova?

612
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,995
No, we told them, Bobby, we just told them that, yeah, they need to appear.

613
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:15,436
Yeah, no.

614
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,677
Because we received the license.

615
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,179
We don't have to do anything.

616
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,419
We have to do a surrender.

617
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,395
I would have asked why, you know.

618
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:27,957
I had the email, but pretty much they just had to surrender.

619
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:34,880
We were going to time record it, and then once it gets approved by you guys, I just send it us to the state that it was surrendered.

620
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:35,901
That's all.

621
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:38,903
So we should make a motion to approve the surrender?

622
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,263
Yeah.

623
00:39:41,104 --> 00:39:41,564
Okay.

624
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,185
I'll make a motion.

625
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:50,409
I motion to accept the surrender of the Q Dahlberg liquor license that we have in our possession.

626
00:39:52,072 --> 00:40:02,960
Okay, I'll second that motion all those in favor I. Liquor and entertainment sorry guys entertainment, yes, just modify.

627
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,362
All those in favor I yeah.

628
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:18,352
All those opposed Aaron and saying none guys have it and the motion passes Okay, so we got that now we can go on to.

629
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:19,313
Brian.

630
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:24,180
I believe, at Great American Bale Hall.

631
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:27,981
Hey, Alan.

632
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:28,121
Hey.

633
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:29,282
How are you?

634
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,422
Bob, how are you?

635
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:30,622
Nice.

636
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:30,902
Good.

637
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:31,443
Good.

638
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:31,823
Good.

639
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,284
Driven by recently, but- Oh, yes.

640
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:37,205
I go by real slow and look and look and go.

641
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:42,327
I'm even tempted to put my hot helmet on and go wander around and see how far I can get.

642
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:44,368
We could use the help.

643
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,902
Uh, yeah, I wanted to tell us a little about what's going on and what's been happening in a perfect world.

644
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:54,502
We would be open by now.

645
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,983
Uh, but I, I am going to ask Kyle on the call.

646
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,784
He's part of our team to give an update.

647
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:03,104
He's got a background in construction and can do a better job than I can.

648
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:03,404
So.

649
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,165
I just give an update.

650
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:06,372
Sure.

651
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,494
My name is Kyle Harnish.

652
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:14,140
I'm part of the ownership team of the Great American Beer Hall, and I'm a builder developer by trade, so I have a little bit of experience in this.

653
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:21,028
We've experienced some slight delays here towards the end, and basically we have met with our

654
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:27,353
general contractor and have outlined the following dates for our final inspections and getting our CO.

655
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:39,024
Our biggest concern here is we are just within a few days of receiving our CO, but don't want to have to wait another month to come before you guys if there's some way to work something out.

656
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,347
I wanted to lay out those timelines for you more specifically.

657
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,070
It starts with tomorrow.

658
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,272
Tomorrow will be our final plumbing inspection.

659
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:51,560
On Friday, we will have our final electrical inspection.

660
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,483
On Monday, we will have our final building inspection.

661
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:58,825
And on Tuesday, we will have our life safety inspection.

662
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:05,210
And we expect the issuance of the full certificate of occupancy by Tuesday afternoon.

663
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,412
And we should be able to pick it up Wednesday morning.

664
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:16,238
That is, we're having preliminary tests over the next few days in preparation for those final tests to make sure that we do pass.

665
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:22,384
And that includes having the fire department out as early as tomorrow just to do an initial run test.

666
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:28,329
So all that being said, I understand that you guys meet, you know, once a month.

667
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:35,455
So, you know, assuming that we fulfill all these conditions over the next few days and get all our final sign-offs, we are asking

668
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:44,779
upon final occupancy certificate being issued next Wednesday, a full liquor license so that we can operate for the Labor Day weekend.

669
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,600
Okay.

670
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,201
Let me ask you a couple of questions.

671
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,081
The

672
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:59,244
We gave you a list of things, occupancy permit number one.

673
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:06,107
And what I understand that you're saying is you're going to be doing a full occupancy, not a partial, correct?

674
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:07,188
That is correct.

675
00:43:07,848 --> 00:43:08,168
Okay.

676
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:12,850
And with that occupancy, you're going to have the fire safety.

677
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,730
You said they're coming out tomorrow.

678
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:19,712
You're going to get, you do have your liability insurance for your insurance company.

679
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:20,773
I said that to Daria.

680
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:24,823
Okay, and the common vigil is licensed.

681
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:26,604
Did you obtain that from the city clerk?

682
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:28,745
Not yet.

683
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:34,888
Okay, that needs to be done before you can.

684
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:35,549
Yeah.

685
00:43:36,168 --> 00:43:40,449
before you can serve any alcohol because in the city of Medford, you can't serve alcohol unless there's food.

686
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,770
And you can't have food without your common vigilance.

687
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,371
That's right.

688
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:46,611
That's a no-brainer.

689
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:48,932
Full license, you've got to serve food.

690
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:50,933
So just kind of remember it that way.

691
00:43:51,993 --> 00:43:56,654
And what goes with the common vigilance is the Board of Health approval.

692
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:58,635
Yeah, that's the last thing.

693
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:02,958
The last thing we're waiting for, uh, so we actually got the gas turned on today.

694
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,340
So the hot water test, um, is all happening.

695
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,663
And then, uh, the disease coming out tomorrow from the board of health.

696
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:12,444
So, okay, great.

697
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:19,508
Um, I mean, as long as you have those, um, items in hand,

698
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:25,412
And Mr. Commissioner, you can comment as well on this.

699
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:31,554
But as long as you have those in hand, you can start serving at that point.

700
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:32,334
All right?

701
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:33,355
You have your license.

702
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:40,557
And what we were concerned about is that you were only able to serve in

703
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,833
Just certain areas of your building, because you were initially looking for partial occupancy.

704
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:52,357
And if that was the case, it was still okay just to serve in those areas.

705
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:56,320
Yeah, and just in those areas expanded, then it goes out, but.

706
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:12,136
If this is it and everything's squared away and say, oh, geez, I don't know, the fire department couldn't get here, there's something wrong with the sprinkler system, we're gonna be delayed another, don't worry about it.

707
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:20,582
when you get all of these documents to Daria, our secretary, that's the minute you can start serving.

708
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:33,289
And Mr. Chairman, it was always, Brian, you remember, John, we always said we'll keep moving forward, but we'll approve this.

709
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:37,232
But it's always conditioned upon the city signing off on everything.

710
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:40,614
So we liked what you were doing.

711
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,335
We knew the state liked what you were doing.

712
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,673
So the chairman is right.

713
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:49,280
Once you got all the check marks, the green check marks.

714
00:45:50,862 --> 00:45:51,302
Let's go.

715
00:45:51,322 --> 00:45:51,382
Yes.

716
00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:59,474
Well, the only thing I ask, if you don't mind, which I'm sure you won't, is that.

717
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:09,185
Obviously, by our next meeting, which September 19th or something, just please appear before the commission again.

718
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:09,805
Absolutely.

719
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:19,214
We can finalize everything that you, in fact, did have all of this stuff done and we can put the rubber stamp on it, make it efficient.

720
00:46:19,434 --> 00:46:20,896
September 18th would be the next.

721
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:23,178
Meeting that's when we I'll be there.

722
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:27,540
Yeah, yeah, and I'm not you guys are kind of new to the game and method.

723
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,742
But with us on the commission, we meet once a month.

724
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:49,492
Yeah, and it's kind of like, you know, we, we try to be as accommodating as possible that we can give you a few days like we just did, or if something needs to be corrected, as you've seen in the past couple of licenses pending the corrections that the licenses are granted, we don't like.

725
00:46:49,972 --> 00:47:04,219
Alan said, we don't want to harm anybody or tie anybody up, but we just want you to know that no matter what the emergency is, from this point forward, we meet the third Wednesday every month at one o'clock.

726
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:07,640
There's no, hey, Bobby, hey, Alan, I need a meeting tomorrow.

727
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,421
I need to have the time.

728
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:09,601
None of that.

729
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:11,362
Mr. Chairman, it's a good point.

730
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:15,044
Just so we all are on the same page,

731
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:23,032
We've learned from past experience that everyone kind of shuts their brains off in July and August.

732
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,734
Everyone's taking vacations.

733
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:30,180
Everybody, all through City Hall, architects, lawyers, everyone wants to enjoy the summer.

734
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:34,886
So we kind of adopted ages ago to be off on

735
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:42,334
July and August, because it was very difficult to get anything done because everyone was either North or South.

736
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:49,000
But Chairman Delafano said, let's have a meeting in August.

737
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,686
Let's see if we can tie up some loose ends so we go into the September meeting fast.

738
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:56,789
Thank you for this.

739
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,151
No, not a problem.

740
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:07,475
Is there anyone else on the call that would like to speak in favor or against this particular license?

741
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:14,438
I see the building commissioner and Green Lifetime and Lins S23 Ultra.

742
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,761
I don't see anybody that wants to speak.

743
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:23,168
I'm good with all of it.

744
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:25,509
Alan, do you want to make a motion?

745
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:28,289
Or would you like me to make a motion?

746
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:39,811
I make a motion that we allow GAB to go forward, providing they meet the city checkmarks and they meet all the compliance rules.

747
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:40,811
Awesome.

748
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:42,191
Perfect.

749
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:42,732
Thank you.

750
00:48:43,132 --> 00:48:43,492
Thank you.

751
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:44,392
Thank you, Commissioner.

752
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:44,972
Thank you.

753
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,172
I second that motion.

754
00:48:47,772 --> 00:48:48,433
All in favor?

755
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:49,073
Aye.

756
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:50,693
All opposed?

757
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:55,424
And seeing none, the ayes have it, motion is passed.

758
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:57,345
Best of luck with your new business, guys.

759
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:57,885
Thank you.

760
00:48:58,425 --> 00:48:59,125
Good luck.

761
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,006
Thank you.

762
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,907
Okay, what do we got next?

763
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:14,170
I think it's just... What do we have left?

764
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,310
Just deep cuts, right?

765
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:18,151
No, it's the gym application too.

766
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:18,832
Oh, I'm sorry.

767
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:19,472
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,301
Yes, Jim.

769
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:27,024
Do we have somebody from the gym present?

770
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:29,345
There you go.

771
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:31,286
Sorry about that.

772
00:49:33,768 --> 00:49:37,670
Please state your name and the gym's name for the record.

773
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:39,631
I'm Kiana Green.

774
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:43,994
I am the studio leader for Lifetime Medford at Station Landing.

775
00:49:44,994 --> 00:49:49,497
We also have Lynn here from Lifetime, the North Shore location.

776
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,607
Hi, how you doing?

777
00:49:52,647 --> 00:49:57,513
Tell us a little bit about what's going on, why you're coming before us today and what the plan is.

778
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,890
So tomorrow we plan on doing a social event.

779
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,832
It's going to be a class event for the members.

780
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:06,152
It's a members only club.

781
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:10,055
And then after that, we're going to have a social down in our lobby.

782
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:11,556
We'll have a DJ.

783
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:12,676
We'll have photo booth.

784
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:17,879
We'll have some food like charcuterie board, avocado toast.

785
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:22,562
And we also wanted to have beer and wine options as well.

786
00:50:23,706 --> 00:50:24,066
OK.

787
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:30,611
And this is a new gym that's coming into the city in that area?

788
00:50:30,972 --> 00:50:32,513
We've been here for two years now.

789
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:33,133
OK.

790
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:36,276
Where were you exactly?

791
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,077
You were where Boston Sports was?

792
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:38,778
Yes.

793
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:40,739
We're in the same building as Boston Sports Club.

794
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:41,920
I got you.

795
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:42,301
OK.

796
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:46,224
Where were you two years ago to kick something like that off?

797
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:47,545
Yeah.

798
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:50,264
We are now ready to go and get kicked.

799
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:51,825
And I said, we need to reach out to Medford.

800
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:53,145
We need to talk to all these people.

801
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:53,845
Let's get it going.

802
00:50:53,885 --> 00:50:54,725
I just got into this position.

803
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:55,405
My name is Darren.

804
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:59,666
I am the assistant to Kiana when it comes to the classes in the club.

805
00:51:00,426 --> 00:51:01,146
OK, great.

806
00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:01,726
Great.

807
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:09,968
And now this particular event, it's a closed to the public open invitation only to your members, correct?

808
00:51:10,508 --> 00:51:10,688
Yes.

809
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:11,508
OK.

810
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:13,528
And there's no charge for the alcohol?

811
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,969
Or is there a charge for the alcohol?

812
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,442
It doesn't make a difference.

813
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:23,664
Yeah, we were thinking about just doing some drink tickets.

814
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:28,467
We haven't fleshed that one out if we were going to charge or do drink tickets.

815
00:51:28,487 --> 00:51:32,769
We're more on the side of handing out drink tickets, maybe two drink tickets.

816
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:36,671
They can get a glass of wine and a glass of beer and call it a day.

817
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,172
But we haven't fleshed out if it was going to be for sale or not.

818
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:43,611
Okay, so that is the reason why you needed to apply for the one-day license.

819
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:44,652
Yes.

820
00:51:45,092 --> 00:52:04,522
You know, if it was just a private, closed event by invitation only, that you're gonna serve a little food and alcoholic beverages in your own facility, there'd be no need for the one-day, but when it involves possibly selling tickets or whatever, this is the best way for you to go.

821
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:07,504
And just do yourself a favor,

822
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:11,810
Check with your insurance company to make sure you have liability insurance.

823
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:16,397
God forbid one of your patrons leaves there and has an accident.

824
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:20,359
kill somebody, whatever, God forbid, like I said.

825
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,082
But you may want to just cover your own butts that way.

826
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:25,844
And it's super cheap.

827
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:30,608
You can get it for one day if they want to put a rider on it.

828
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:33,430
And you can call them today and say, how much is it?

829
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,711
Just put it on for tomorrow.

830
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,233
That's 100% your decision.

831
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,456
But it would be a wise thing to do.

832
00:52:40,576 --> 00:52:41,656
Yeah, be safe and sorry.

833
00:52:41,676 --> 00:52:47,097
And your bartender, of course, will be TIP certified, or they'll be certified one way or another?

834
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:47,758
Okay.

835
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:59,760
I'm Lynn, I'm the North Shore leader, and we have 206, well, we have 70 clubs within the US that are certified to serve full liquor, beer, and wine license.

836
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,221
Here at North Shore, we have a full license through Massachusetts under my name, so I'm the one who's gonna be serving.

837
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:05,981
I'm TIP certified.

838
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,242
Cool, very good, very good.

839
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:10,238
Awesome.

840
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:11,479
Okay.

841
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,722
Do we, did we get a sketch?

842
00:53:14,802 --> 00:53:15,402
Yes, we did.

843
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:16,383
We got the sketch.

844
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:16,683
Yep.

845
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:20,146
And I can see where the alcohol is going to be served.

846
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:24,390
And yeah, it's food table there.

847
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,731
Everything looks good.

848
00:53:27,052 --> 00:53:29,173
Sounds like you folks have done this once or twice.

849
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:30,134
So I'm sure.

850
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:31,355
Is that written on a napkin?

851
00:53:31,415 --> 00:53:33,117
Is that drawn on a napkin?

852
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,836
I worked really hard on that one.

853
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:41,116
I told her I was not doing it, so she had to.

854
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:41,977
No, no.

855
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:43,817
It's perfectly fine.

856
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:46,638
It doesn't have to be from an architect or an engineer.

857
00:53:46,678 --> 00:53:49,519
Just give us a lay of the land, so to speak.

858
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:50,639
Yeah.

859
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,680
We got them on pizza boxes before, too.

860
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,481
Yeah.

861
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:55,901
That was a classic.

862
00:53:56,261 --> 00:53:58,542
That was great.

863
00:53:58,882 --> 00:53:59,382
You know what?

864
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:01,463
I don't have any other questions, Mr. Chairman.

865
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:01,703
Do you?

866
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:03,373
No, not at all.

867
00:54:04,194 --> 00:54:14,698
Let me make a motion to accept a one-day license to be held August 22nd at 70 Station Landing.

868
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:16,319
I will second that motion.

869
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,359
All those in favor?

870
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,080
Aye.

871
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,360
Aye.

872
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,321
All those opposed?

873
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:23,241
Hearing and seeing none.

874
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:24,102
Ayes have it.

875
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:25,822
You guys are good to go.

876
00:54:25,882 --> 00:54:26,203
Good luck.

877
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:26,603
Very good.

878
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:28,423
Thank you.

879
00:54:28,443 --> 00:54:29,044
Good luck.

880
00:54:30,324 --> 00:54:31,105
Thank you, Donald.

881
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:31,725
Ciao.

882
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:32,105
Bye-bye.

883
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:37,986
Okay, so I guess the only one left is deep cuts, right?

884
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:39,406
We haven't heard from him, Dara.

885
00:54:39,967 --> 00:54:40,747
No, I haven't.

886
00:54:41,047 --> 00:54:41,947
I called them too.

887
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:45,268
I'm not sure.

888
00:54:45,288 --> 00:54:46,548
Can I ask you a question?

889
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,309
I just noticed the address.

890
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:50,650
It's 21 Main Street.

891
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,590
That's not deep cuts premise, right?

892
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:54,311
No.

893
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:01,810
What do you mean?

894
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,891
That is their address.

895
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:04,311
With an 810 Main?

896
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:06,673
No, 21 Main Street.

897
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:10,454
Yeah, because they can't have this on the 12th.

898
00:55:10,534 --> 00:55:10,995
It's not day 12.

899
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:16,616
Uh, what do you mean, Bobby?

900
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:23,360
You mean what they put was event where event is taking place on page 221 Main Street.

901
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,961
Oh, I don't think that's correct.

902
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:25,461
Yeah.

903
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,642
I get what you mean.

904
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:29,123
21 Main Street is their establishment.

905
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:32,025
They cannot get a 1 day license.

906
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:42,405
No, I don't think that's correct because this is a city event from PDS, from what I understand.

907
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:44,526
It's a city event?

908
00:55:44,646 --> 00:55:44,806
Okay.

909
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:46,667
Yeah, it's Harvester Energy Fasting Lot.

910
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,427
In the parking lot?

911
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:48,607
Yeah.

912
00:55:48,828 --> 00:55:49,808
Let me just see.

913
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:53,069
Maybe in the bank parking lot there or something.

914
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:57,551
I thought that would be a Riverside address.

915
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:01,153
Nevertheless, we should get to the bottom of the correct address.

916
00:56:02,774 --> 00:56:10,936
Yeah, they're gonna do it at the, hold on, they're gonna do it at the McGlynn Middle School.

917
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:14,197
So it's definitely not gonna be at that address, yeah.

918
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:15,658
Not even close.

919
00:56:16,078 --> 00:56:17,358
No, no.

920
00:56:17,378 --> 00:56:23,440
But I think he made a mistake on something else too, and he was like, oh, sorry.

921
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:31,675
Yeah, it says it right here food vendors deep cuts will be holding pop up beer garden and selling sandwiches, hot dogs and more.

922
00:56:32,495 --> 00:56:39,838
Okay, and that's going to be 1019 when the next thing the next meeting is 918.

923
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:41,359
Oh, that's right.

924
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:42,579
Yeah, I wonder why.

925
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,220
Let me just pull up my calendar.

926
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:49,402
Yeah, you know, I'm thinking we

927
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:53,781
We pass on this and revisit it in September at the September meeting.

928
00:56:54,502 --> 00:57:02,395
Yeah, I would say we table it till then and you can have them correct all the mistakes on this as well as.

929
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:10,484
Get us a diagram of the event and because we're going to have it at the school.

930
00:57:10,605 --> 00:57:18,230
It kind of like, and we've got to see the lay of the land and and stuff and I'm sure there's not going to be an issue.

931
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:19,491
It's just that.

932
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:26,417
You know, they can come the day before, but then again, you may need it for.

933
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,352
You may need it for purchasing the alcohol.

934
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:31,153
Yeah.

935
00:57:31,513 --> 00:57:32,553
But Jeff knows.

936
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:36,174
I mean, he's come before us before for these one-day license requests.

937
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:37,774
So he knows the drill.

938
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:39,194
Yeah.

939
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,235
Plus, he will have about a month.

940
00:57:42,735 --> 00:57:45,796
Because if we approve it in September, the event is not until October.

941
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:46,816
That's right.

942
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:47,356
Oh, it's October?

943
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:47,816
Yeah.

944
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:49,577
Yeah, October.

945
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:51,297
That's what I thought, too.

946
00:57:51,357 --> 00:57:53,818
It threw me off a little bit because I thought the same thing.

947
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:54,438
I'm like, wait.

948
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:55,819
Yeah, no, we're good.

949
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:57,180
So they got time, yeah.

950
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:03,204
So I would make a, I agree, let's make a motion to table this to the September 18th meeting.

951
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:04,265
Right.

952
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:09,249
And Dary, if you don't mind, just reach out to him and have him make changes or the tweaks.

953
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,492
Yeah, and include the sketch, and we should be good.

954
00:58:12,892 --> 00:58:13,452
Yeah.

955
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:22,259
And I don't know with his insurance, he'd probably have to get a rider from his insurance company for one day, unless his- Yeah, for one day, yeah.

956
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,300
Yeah.

957
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:25,841
Other than that.

958
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:28,403
Yeah.

959
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:28,503
Yeah.

960
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,764
A design, right?

961
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,345
And insurance.

962
00:58:33,566 --> 00:58:33,746
Yeah.

963
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:34,506
Okay.

964
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:36,367
Sounds about it.

965
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,048
You made the motion.

966
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:38,048
I'll second it out.

967
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:38,608
Okay.

968
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,169
All those in favor.

969
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,811
So we'll revisit this.

970
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:43,351
Yeah.

971
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:45,472
Hearing and seeing none.

972
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:46,493
Motion passes.

973
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:49,835
Hey, I think.

974
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:53,015
We pretty much wrapped it up.

975
00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:57,558
I made a couple of notes.

976
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,863
Gary, it was a nice job on the one day license that you put up on the site.

977
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:12,008
It's going to be so much easier for people to go online and just streamline everything, which is great.

978
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:15,311
We were going to discuss tip certs.

979
00:59:17,324 --> 00:59:24,230
From other violators and stuff, but I don't know why I wrote that note, but it was maybe in the future.

980
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,392
We can set up a some sort of a.

981
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:34,782
rule, if we're going to require people to be TIP certified in all the establishments, or maybe just people that are violating.

982
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:37,002
I'm not sure.

983
00:59:37,462 --> 00:59:43,564
Maybe we can have Ralph touch on that at the meeting on the 25th, I think it is.

984
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:50,166
Yeah, at the compliance meeting, just to throw it out there and then kind of get people aware of it.

985
00:59:51,146 --> 00:59:53,727
And speaking of the compliance meeting,

986
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,969
I'm going to probably go through some of last year's stuff.

987
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:01,690
Maybe we can use a lot of it and just kind of edit the dates.

988
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:08,854
And you and I can set something up, Daria, that maybe, you know, it's going to be like within another 30 days.

989
01:00:08,894 --> 01:00:10,995
So we'll get a letter out within a week or two.

990
01:00:11,035 --> 01:00:11,495
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:12,955
A week, yeah.

992
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,457
And that way the Board of Health can get their letter out at the same time.

993
01:00:16,477 --> 01:00:20,379
No, I think they already did, because we didn't give them the date.

994
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:22,799
I think they did, yeah.

995
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,047
I think we just had local for future.

996
01:00:26,565 --> 01:00:30,686
And I think that it worked out really well.

997
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:35,628
You saw as soon as we put in mandatory in red, they just skyrocketed for attendance.

998
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:39,730
So I think to follow Ralph's cue on that was a good idea.

999
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:43,971
And we got a great response.

1000
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:50,853
And what I'm trying to think of is see if we can do something that's gonna be easier for all of us when they come in.

1001
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:54,895
I mean, maybe they'll notice we can have them print it,

1002
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:58,833
sign it and hand it to us when they come in.

1003
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:00,614
And now we know who's there.

1004
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:07,276
Instead of me trying to read this micro little sheet there, checking them off and you know, blah, blah, blah.

1005
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,877
I mean, you just collect the sheets as they come in and then we tie them up later.

1006
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:11,818
We know who's there.

1007
01:01:13,538 --> 01:01:18,440
You know, we might even be able to get a little, maybe

1008
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:24,732
I don't want to say vital information, but just say current manager on file.

1009
01:01:26,753 --> 01:01:30,513
I think that's on the annual license renewal anyways, the form.

1010
01:01:31,174 --> 01:01:34,534
But just so that we don't have any issues.

1011
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:41,316
You can't do that because you're not the person that's the license manager that's on file, that type of thing.

1012
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:44,817
It gets kicked back from the ABCC like it did at the Firefighters Club.

1013
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:52,033
So, um, you know, you may want to, uh, we may want to look into that, but I think that's about it.

1014
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:57,058
I mean, uh, um, unless you guys got anything else.

1015
01:01:57,638 --> 01:02:04,285
Um, one thing, Mr Chairman, um, July 17th is when we had the hearings for the, um,

1016
01:02:05,345 --> 01:02:09,546
The, the people, the merchants that fail to control compliance checks, right?

1017
01:02:10,486 --> 01:02:13,147
Yes, October 17th is 90 days.

1018
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:17,168
So, okay, do we circle back to them?

1019
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:21,650
This is commercial circle back to them, or are you going to circle back to them?

1020
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,310
How do we.

1021
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,793
How do we address those seven?

1022
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:25,934
Was it seven or eight?

1023
01:02:26,314 --> 01:02:26,975
I forgot.

1024
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:29,378
It was six.

1025
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,581
Yeah, one of them came back, deep cuts.

1026
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,964
I was going to tell him, nice job.

1027
01:02:34,404 --> 01:02:36,087
Yeah, he did it real quick, yeah.

1028
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:38,550
He got them all done.

1029
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,572
Did we get any response from the others?

1030
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:40,912
I don't know.

1031
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:43,323
No, I just have deep cuts.

1032
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:49,688
I just put it actually in file yesterday because I was trying to plan out how to do it because it was due to violations.

1033
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:54,572
I'm thinking that I can send a reminder.

1034
01:02:54,592 --> 01:03:08,902
I actually wanted to do a letter to begin with and I have it drafted saying this is what's going to happen, that there's going to be a new file, please send it to us within 90 days from this date.

1035
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:14,885
whatever this is like your first notice and then I can do in a couple of weeks second notice.

1036
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:17,766
Hopefully they've realized that we're not going to let it go.

1037
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:19,747
So they will stay on top of it.

1038
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:20,427
Right.

1039
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:22,447
That's kind of what I was saying.

1040
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:23,888
October 17th will be 90 days.

1041
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:24,628
If you just go 17, 17, 17.

1042
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:26,809
Yeah.

1043
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:27,129
Yeah.

1044
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:34,532
I mean, if it, you know, if we don't get much of a response, um, I don't know.

1045
01:03:34,712 --> 01:03:37,953
Did you want to throw in something like we did to blue Fuji today?

1046
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:49,573
that we're going to hold a one-day suspension for you in abidance if you don't comply with the 90-day rule of the TIP certifications.

1047
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:58,036
It's not a bad idea to add some teeth to it so they know we're serious and they understand the seriousness of what happens.

1048
01:03:58,816 --> 01:03:59,476
Yeah.

1049
01:04:00,196 --> 01:04:01,817
I guess we can discuss that.

1050
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:02,617
Yeah.

1051
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:06,519
I mean, it's nothing that's going to harm them unless they don't do it.

1052
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:07,660
Unless they don't do it.

1053
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,040
Right.

1054
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,522
And, you know, to be honest with you, it's the honor system.

1055
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:18,365
I don't know how many people Al-Ahmad Iran has got working in his business that are serving alcohol.

1056
01:04:18,745 --> 01:04:22,267
So if they send us six, that's how many?

1057
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:22,667
Six.

1058
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:24,809
And if they send us 19, there's 19.

1059
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:31,432
It's kind of like... But they should live up to what we did, you know, what we asked of them.

1060
01:04:31,752 --> 01:04:34,874
So and we're hoping that they're honest enough to do that.

1061
01:04:35,315 --> 01:04:39,938
And, you know, I mean, we're not going to police them and go in and look at their books and how many.

1062
01:04:39,978 --> 01:04:41,059
No, no, no, no.

1063
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:41,760
That's not.

1064
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,380
No.

1065
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,305
You know, let's let's just let's be up front and hopefully they do the right thing.

1066
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:48,885
And right.

1067
01:04:49,846 --> 01:04:57,352
And just kind of fire a shot across the bow, just in case they don't do the right thing, they're not going to say, hey, you know, it's just kind of.

1068
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:58,777
Whatever.

1069
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:00,338
Okay.

1070
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:02,579
Nothing else?

1071
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:04,560
No.

1072
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,160
I think that's it.

1073
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,801
Alan, you've been doing some traveling, I hope?

1074
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:09,121
No.

1075
01:05:09,562 --> 01:05:11,002
No, just back and forth.

1076
01:05:11,302 --> 01:05:11,782
That's all.

1077
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:12,883
Just back and forth.

1078
01:05:13,463 --> 01:05:14,984
That's because the weather's too nice here.

1079
01:05:15,364 --> 01:05:16,904
You got to wait until the cooler weather.

1080
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,766
Go to visit the little place in Florida there.

1081
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:21,967
Nice.

1082
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:22,487
Good for you.

1083
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:23,547
All right.

1084
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,028
All right, folks.

1085
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:27,560
All right, I motion to adjourn.

1086
01:05:28,202 --> 01:05:28,885
Oh, I'm sorry.

1087
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,808
I'm supposed to do that.

1088
01:05:29,828 --> 01:05:30,008
Yep.

1089
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:32,216
I second.

1090
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,118
All in favor.

1091
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,663
All right.

1092
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:35,446
Let me follow up.

1093
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:36,349
Good to see everybody.

1094
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:37,392
Good to see you guys.
