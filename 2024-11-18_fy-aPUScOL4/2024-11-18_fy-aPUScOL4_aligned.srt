24
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:48,268
Thank you, Madam President.

25
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,969
And thank you for Ms.

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,551
Nigro being here this evening.

27
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,674
For my colleagues, I see everything in order.

28
00:01:56,915 --> 00:02:00,798
I know that I'll move approval after you give us a brief description.

29
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:08,804
I know we're excited about this business venture and can't wait to get it started, but if you can.

30
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,307
Thank you for having us here tonight.

31
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:13,788
We're finally here.

32
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:29,676
Chapters Coffee Carts, I think most of you know, is a nonprofit company that we've been two years creating specifically to be located in the new Medford Library.

33
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:36,177
Our mission is to set up supported work sites for people with disabilities.

34
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:42,599
We'll provide them with a paycheck, the supports they need to have success.

35
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:48,137
job skills and training that they need to move further out into the community.

36
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:54,359
Also on our cart, everything we serve is from other Medford businesses.

37
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,580
Our coffee is from Mr. Coffee Roasters.

38
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,641
We have bagels from Goldilocks.

39
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,142
We have sandwiches from Stop and Shop.

40
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:08,464
We have our canned soda and snacks is from BJ's.

41
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:10,405
We have pastries from Wegmans.

42
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:20,381
Our menus were created by two seniors from Medford High School Graphic Arts Department.

43
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:26,063
They did a really nice job designing those menus.

44
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:34,006
Our snack bags, we've had children from most of the schools in Medford designing them for us.

45
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:39,788
We've had kids from preschool all the way up through high school decorating them.

46
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,810
So we've involved much of the community as we can.

47
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:52,596
And I have to say the response that we've gotten from this community has been overwhelming.

48
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:57,379
We're happy to do this in Medford to start here.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,043
And we hope that other cities and towns will look at us as an example.

50
00:04:03,063 --> 00:04:09,287
Excuse me.

51
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,432
all the hard work.

52
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:29,006
This is a great venture that you put forth and we're so lucky to have have you here in Medford, and I think it'll be a great example and a shining star to, to really push off into other communities and show them what a great opportunity this can be.

53
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:34,070
So I, I see everything in order, Madam President, after my colleagues speak, I move approve.

54
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,371
So, thank you.

55
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,566
came to my Kiwanis club and did a presentation.

56
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:46,927
And that's when we first met.

57
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:55,471
And since then I've done my best to spread the word about what they do and how they do it.

58
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,552
And yeah, it's a good idea.

59
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:02,034
Especially when you're helping people with disabilities.

60
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,756
Earn a living, get a paycheck every week and give them dignity.

61
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:11,078
Not just getting money for doing nothing.

62
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:17,750
I'm sure I know they'll work hard to make this successful.

63
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:22,154
And I can't wait to hopefully see you on Saturday, get this up and going.

64
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,675
So again, congratulations.

65
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:29,500
I know it's been a long journey for you, but you're here and good luck going forward.

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,761
Thank you for your support.

67
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:31,322
Thank you.

68
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:32,462
Thank you, Councilor Cabrera.

69
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:33,303
Any further discussion?

70
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,664
Vice President Behrs.

71
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,027
Thanks for doing this, Carol.

72
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,308
And I just wanted to thank you.

73
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:39,829
I know you've been

74
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,136
long time residents of the community.

75
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:45,337
I was lucky enough to be in the band with your son, Patrick.

76
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:56,120
And I think it's just amazing how much you've done already and finding the synergy with the library to expand your program to the whole community.

77
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,001
I've seen so many people going through the library already, and I know that they're gonna benefit greatly from your business.

78
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,381
I did have one question.

79
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:08,783
I know it's already in here, but just for the benefit of the public, you guys are gonna be open from nine to three at the library.

80
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:10,203
And is that Monday through Friday?

81
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,772
Yes, we'd like to start nine to three, that's Monday through Saturday.

82
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:15,172
Great.

83
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:22,617
And eventually we'd like to start opening when the library has special evening events.

84
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:23,858
Fantastic.

85
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:27,920
Thank you so much for doing this and we're all excited to approve it.

86
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:29,921
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

87
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:30,942
Any further discussion?

88
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:36,165
So on a motion to approve from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Naik.

89
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,346
All those in favor?

90
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:37,906

91
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:38,747

101
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,332
Records.

102
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:04,255
The records of the meeting of May 24th, 2022 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,556
Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find them?

104
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:12,064
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

105
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:12,904
All those in favor?

106
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:13,224

All those opposed?

108
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,045
Motion passes.

109
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,248
Reports of committees, 22-354, May 24th, 2022, Committee of the Whole report.

110
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,108
I'll jot my memory on this.

111
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:38,817
Oh, this was our yes this was our pre budget meetings where the council set a number of priorities which we would like to see included in this year's budget as well as additional recommendations that we individual counselors made and those were delivered to the administration.

112
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:45,660
On the motion of Council night to approve the committee report second my counselor saying all those in favor.

113
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:47,161
All those opposed.

114
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:48,362
Motion passes.

115
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:54,887
Moving on to motions, orders and resolutions.

116
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,288
22-361 offered by Councilor Carviel.

117
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:05,533
This is a resolution, I'm gonna read it through, but this is a resolution I had the clerk put on again from last week in hopes that we could have a presentation by those requested.

118
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,554
They're unable to be here tonight.

119
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,936
Hopefully this is something we can have a presentation on the future.

120
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:11,997
I'm just gonna read it briefly.

121
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:15,559
So be it resolved that the Medford City Council have a representative from Eversource

122
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,101
attend the next city council meeting to give the council an update on their ongoing project on Mystic Avenue and Winthrop Street.

123
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:26,603
Be it further resolved that the DPW commissioner, city engineer, and transportation director attend the next meeting.

124
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:30,484
Unfortunately, none of these representatives could make it tonight.

125
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,345
So if we want to table this paper, Councilor Carvalho.

126
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,926
Thank you, Madam President, for putting this back on again.

127
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:44,710
Madam President, probably 10 minutes ago, I received a call from a resident of the area informing me of a meeting tomorrow night.

128
00:08:45,625 --> 00:09:06,969
have been nice if the people who asked for the meeting were told to be about the meeting and we asked for a meeting to be here not held on zoom on a night that again one night before we even even knew about it so quite frankly uh i'd like to have a meeting here because obviously you know we're already scheduled for things tomorrow night and

129
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:18,983
Again, this is an important meeting just to find out the day before the meeting and to neighbors without even being notified.

130
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,564
Transparency at the worst.

131
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,345
Thank you, Councilor Carville.

132
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:29,046
Do I have a motion, Vice President Behrs?

133
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:33,147
On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by

134
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,401
Councilor Seng, all those in favor?

135
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,962
All those opposed?

136
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:37,862
The motion passes.

137
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:43,526
And I will continue to work to see if we can get those representatives to attend the next meeting or the next meeting.

138
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,008
And again, there is, but there is a meeting for folks watching.

139
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:54,894
There is a meeting with some updates, a number of which we have been requesting as a council for months at this point, but there is a meeting about the Eversource project tomorrow night on Zoom at 6 p.m.

140
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,614
22-368 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

141
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:04,678
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the Mayor clean and landscape the bump outs and center islands within the city.

142
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:05,739
Councilor Carvalho.

143
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,080
Thank you, Madam President.

144
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:14,665
We went around and we made these, we put in these islands and these bump outs, and now they're becoming weed cities.

145
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:20,590
If you go to Winter Street, the bump out there is just a bunch of weeds.

146
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:27,318
You drive down to the other parts, all we're getting is weeds and all these bump outs in these islands.

147
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:33,870
So instead of making them look nice by putting some landscaping on them, all they are is just weeds growing at them.

148
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:45,978
In the interest of some curb appeal, if we could at least get them cleaned up and the grass mowed out of them, because they say they're just, they're not appealing looking.

149
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:50,299
And I say, there's just hunks of concrete in the middle of the street with dirt and weeds growing around them.

150
00:10:50,319 --> 00:11:01,222
So, you know, if they come up with a plan, maybe put some plantings on them or something to make them look a little better, but at least clean up the ones that are just overgrown and just look filthy.

151
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:01,582
So.

152
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:03,483
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

153
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,483
Councilor Collins.

154
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:16,129
Thank you, President, we're all thank you Councilor Carvial for putting this on the agenda I just wanted to note I saw maybe it was last week or two weeks ago, some looked like planting flower planting work being done in some of the bump outs or center islands.

155
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,091
Off of made a mystic and South Medford and just to your point it really is an issue of a little goes a long way.

156
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:27,773
So I think it'd be great to get an update on is that going to be done throughout the city where can we expect for it to be done next.

157
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:33,515
You know, towards your point, you know, really helps a lot to improve the appearance of our main streets.

158
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,243
Is that the air system?

159
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:39,764
Yes.

160
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,625
I assume.

161
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:43,106
Councilor Knight.

162
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:50,230
If I could just amend the paper or offer a B paper, Madam President, requesting that the mayor provide us with a report on the status of the Adopt-A-Site program.

163
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,192
Under the McGlynn administration, the Adopt-A-Site program was relatively successful.

164
00:11:55,873 --> 00:12:05,278
It was a program where local businesses could adopt an island or a rotary or a site in the city, and then perform the upkeep and maintenance on it in exchange for a small advertising billboard on that parcel.

165
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,460
and that was something that seemed to work out pretty well.

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,882
So I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with a report back on the status of that program.

167
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:12,483
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

168
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,264
Any further discussion?

169
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,607
So we'll take the B paper first.

170
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:22,750
Do I have, we have the motion from Councilor Carvillo on the main paper.

171
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,630
Do I have a second for that?

172
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,514
And then the B paper, do we have a second for the Councilor Sang?

173
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,056
So Mr. Clerk, we'll take the B paper first.

174
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,677
Do you have the wording for the B paper?

175
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,378
Were you able to hear that?

176
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:38,884
Councilor Newton.

177
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:39,285
Thank you, Mr Mayor.

178
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,865
Hang on.

179
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,486
Councilor Knight requested an update.

180
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:50,249
From the mayor on the, uh on the adopt, uh On the adopt a site program.

181
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,671
Yes Okay, I didn't get the

182
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:04,190
Councilor Knight on the B paper, seconded by Vice-President Behrs.

183
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,090
All those in favor?

184
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,831
All those opposed?

185
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:08,372
The motion passes.

186
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:13,035
On the main paper from Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Sang.

187
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,135
All those in favor?

188
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,916
All those opposed?

189
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:16,777
The motion passes.

190
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:23,260
22-369 offered by Councilor Carviello.

191
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:30,104
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have mass stop, mow the grass at the rotary and off and on ramps to route 93.

192
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:31,045
Councilor Carviello.

193
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,132
The grass on Webster Street is three feet tall.

194
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:45,124
I think they mowed the rotary today, but all the off-ramps and on-ramps coming off 93, I don't know which is worse, the DOT or the DCR.

195
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:49,889
They just let stuff grow forever.

196
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:53,369
But the grass is four feet tall in some places.

197
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,191
At the Roosevelt Circle Rotary, there's been bags of rubbish there for four weeks, just piled up there.

198
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:04,492
And those off-ramps, weeds and everything, the grass is just growing ridiculous.

199
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:09,113
I mean, I don't know what we have to do to get either one of these organizations to actually do their job.

200
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,996
So do we have to call, I mean, if you want to contact the state delegation again, that's fine.

201
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,718
But again, no one seems to be doing anything here.

202
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:21,441
And all we're doing is we're looking down like a rundown city.

203
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,302
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

204
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,003
Vice Mayor Behrs.

205
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,404
Thank you, Madam President.

206
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:37,593
In this specific case only, I can say that DCR is doing a slightly better job because they were down with the mower across the street from me doing their jurisdiction of the Roosevelt Circle area.

207
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:39,534
But it's truly a mess.

208
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,172
You went through it very well.

209
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:47,514
In addition to that, we still have a broken bridge with no timeline for repair.

210
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:54,775
There's actually a bunch of rusted iron now sitting on Roosevelt Circle behind a Jersey barrier.

211
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,636
So, I mean, it's deteriorated significantly.

212
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:59,056
It looks horrible.

213
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:03,977
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

214
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,018
Any further discussion?

215
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:05,978
Councilor Knight.

216
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:09,020
Well, it's good to see that DCR has been out there.

217
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,641
I didn't know if they were participating in No Mo' May or not.

218
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:28,209
But I would like to ask the sponsor if I could, if you'd be willing for me to amend the schedule, just to request, amend the resolution rather to request the maintenance schedule for Medford-Holme parcels from the DCR and the DOT.

219
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:32,602
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

220
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,483
Any further discussion?

221
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,665
Mr. Clerk, do you have the language for that amendment?

222
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:39,225
I do.

223
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,547
It's a request for the maintenance schedule from DCR and DOT for those properties.

224
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:45,608
Thank you.

225
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:51,391
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

226
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:51,491
Aye.

227
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:52,991
All those opposed?

228
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:54,032
The motion passes.

229
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:56,817
Councilor Newton.

230
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,438
22-370 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

231
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,842
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the safety concerns dealing with dogs off leash at Tufts Park.

232
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,123
Councilor Scarpelli.

233
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,564
Thank you, Madam President.

234
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,507
This is a concern that I know we had.

235
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:14,590
We talked, um, yeah, a few years back about some concerns about, um.

236
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:19,854
not having a dog park in the South Method area.

237
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:34,802
And I think that there were some concerns and there were some questions asked if we could possibly use the small park area where the old South Method pool was and we could erect a fence.

238
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:55,964
where we could have it's a wide open space and we talked about possibly putting in a fence there and having dogs run off the leash in that area and there was some banter back and forth and we really didn't get get far with that and we really haven't heard much because of the pandemic and and to be honest the lack of

239
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:02,195
activity down there for from different youth organizations.

240
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:12,820
Well, I know that this past season, they've been some concerns with dogs off their leash, while kids are playing, especially girls softball.

241
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,581
That's the phone call I a few phone calls I received.

242
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:20,463
And I did call the mayor's office.

243
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,625
And I know that they

244
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,262
They talked to the animal control officer.

245
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:31,285
They supposedly sent someone out, but nothing has been resolved.

246
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:40,411
The parents of the youth softball program had some concerns and I wanted to bring this forward so we can shed some light.

247
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:44,834
I understand I'm a dog lover, but I think that the safety of our

248
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:52,498
residents, especially in a park, especially children, I think have to be first and foremost.

249
00:17:52,678 --> 00:18:13,187
And I know if there's, there could be a way that we can meet with, you know, I know there's, they're very organized organization for the dog walkers and group in South Medford at Tufts Park, maybe that we can work with meeting with them and the city administration to see if we can find a way that

250
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:24,816
maybe putting in even if it's a temporary fence and the gate that that people really want to leave, take the dogs off the leash that there is an area there that's enclosed.

251
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:33,003
I know that they're very respectful dog owners and they clean up after the dogs and that's not an issue there and but it

252
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:49,630
is a concern that even though the dogs are playful, it's left some negative marks in a few children's eyes and dogs are off leash that, you know, see a child that's playing with the ball and the dog runs up and

253
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:57,476
thinks that it's playtime and they take the glove away from the child, it leaves a negative mark and it's frightening.

254
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,639
So these are things that are concerning.

255
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:14,209
I know, you know, it might have been one or a few issues, but as this happened and the word cut out, I got a few phone calls from parents that the children play in the playground area and they

256
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:30,618
They, they shared some concerns about the dogs around the other side of the fence and, you know, having the child run outside of the playground area onto the into the park they had some concerns so there are some valid issues there and I think that this is something we need to revisit as a council before.

257
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:32,427
something serious happens.

258
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:48,431
And again, if it's an isolated incident, that's fine, but still, now that we know this is happening, I don't want the next isolated issue being something where a child gets bit and we could have done something about it.

259
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:56,813
So I know that, I know the police, we've tried to, I've asked for patrol, I've asked for the animal patrol officer to go out

260
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:12,831
patrol the area, but from what I've gathered from the parents, there hasn't been enough visibility from the city's departments that are protecting the children in that area.

261
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,113
So if we could just

262
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:28,744
maybe make a motion to ask the report from the city administration and what they've done and that we can share with the community and then to see if the city can reach out.

263
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:43,491
I know that the city administration told me that there's actually a person that organizes a lot of the dog activity there that we can maybe work together and try to see if there's something we can do that can accommodate all the parties and make sure that we can put maybe

264
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:54,754
even if it's a temporary safe, at least during the sports seasons, that they have that area on the side that we can fence in that would separate them.

265
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:55,974
So, thank you.

266
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,595
Thanks, Councilor Carviello.

267
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,856
Thank you, Madam President.

268
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,016
Again, you know, this is something that

269
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:04,318
There's a problem a few years ago and it kind of quieted down.

270
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,959
And now that the kids are back in the parking and it seemed to read it, read it said again.

271
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,199
Council cut Scott plays right.

272
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,300
We have that area where that you'll touch pool was.

273
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,123
I don't think it's that big of a deal to fence it in during for the summer so when the kids aren't out there, at least gives the dog somewhere to go in.

274
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:29,444
and keeps them away from the kids during their time of their death.

275
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:48,789
So again, I'd like to amend the motion that the site of the old Tufts pool be temporarily fenced in to allow the dogs to at least go there and roam around with a safe, this way they won't be a danger to the children that are playing there.

276
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:50,690
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

277
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,750
Councilor Knight.

278
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:59,008
Madam President, if I recall correctly, I think one of the biggest issues when this issue first came up was the fact that they didn't want fences, they wanted to be free range.

279
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:06,976
And the issue was that when the dog is off leash, but in a fenced in or caged in area, they may feel cornered and become aggressive.

280
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,557
And that's why they don't want any fence there.

281
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,060
I think that that's what the sticking point was last time.

282
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,343
That coupled with the fact that I believe we were stuck

283
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:30,993
uh, in a situation where the pox department and the pox commission has a policy that's in place and they weren't willing to make a ruling on it until, uh, some further information was provided to the city of industry, uh, administration relative to, uh, bathroom facilities and the like down to that box.

284
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:31,694
Thank you.

285
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:35,658
Councillor Knight, any further discussion?

286
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:57,419
If I can, Madam President, I recall that strictly I know there were a couple issues that they, I think it's a big enough area that that dogs can run free and I think that another question that was brought up by that organization is that there wasn't enough separation from small dogs and big dogs so I don't.

287
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:02,933
To be honest with you, I think my first priority is the safety of the children in that playground.

288
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:17,297
So let's see if we can move forward, see if we can find some sort of even just, even make it a pilot program for the rest of the summer, just to see how that works and then go from there.

289
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,318
But right now, I think that's something that has to be imminent.

290
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,139
I don't want to be sitting here in a week and there was no action and a child was bit by a dog.

291
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,280
I just, I feel terrible.

292
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,220
So thank you, Madam President.

293
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:30,274
further discussion.

294
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:32,874
I want to thank you Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

295
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,155
I know we've all been getting the phone calls in the email.

296
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:45,459
So I really thank you for bringing this forward to have this discussion because I think we've all been talking to the administration kind of individually and understandably a lot of folks in the situation aren't really satisfied with the answers they're getting.

297
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,941
So I think this really pushes us to do more and see if we can get some transparency around this issue and some different ideas.

298
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:58,623
So we have the motion from Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Carvalho.

299
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:00,066
Second.

300
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,772
And seconded by Councilor Carville.

301
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,136
All those in favor?

302
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:03,898
Aye.

303
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:04,821
All those opposed?

304
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:05,985
Motion passes.

305
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:21,815
22 dash 371 offered by Councilor saying be resolved at the Medford City Council request the city administration update the city's website city websites text on COVID-19 information and frequently asked questions, Councilor saying, Thank you, President moral.

306
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,917
Um, you know, our city website is in need of updates and repair.

307
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:31,219
Um, I think that's evident, evident to everyone using the city website.

308
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,701
I think this is this is a way for us to start chipping away at the at the at the

309
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:44,766
outdated information on there, and if we chip away, hopefully we can fix the most glaring problems on the city website.

310
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:55,153
Right now, I was helping someone do some research into our COVID-19 policies, and in the FAQ section, it's just completely outdated.

311
00:24:55,293 --> 00:25:00,997
I think the information is from probably October of 2020, which is almost two years ago.

312
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:15,385
And there's, as I said at the budget meeting, there's a lot of outdated information about where masks should be worn, a lot of outdated information about what's open for visitor entry, what's closed, what the city's policies are, the case count, everything.

313
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:29,674
And so I think it would, in the interest of transparency and open communication, if the city can prepare an update to the COVID-19 information section and FAQ section, that would be very helpful.

314
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:32,705
Any further discussion?

315
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:33,465
Councillor Knight.

316
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:58,072
Madam President, just on that note, I do believe, oh geez, maybe it was three months ago, four months ago, there was an administrative issue, a personnel issue related to our director of IT and the city administration made some personnel moves related to questionable activity or surrounding union involvement.

317
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:05,665
At the time, they said that the gentleman was removed from his position due to significant security issues surrounding our network.

318
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,287
And this council has asked for an update now two times on that.

319
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:15,911
And I'm hoping we can get that information back as well, because this might be a reason why our website's not getting updated, because there's some security issue.

320
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:17,271
And we don't know about it.

321
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:18,272
We've asked, but we don't know.

322
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:22,174
And that could be a potential reason as to why we're not seeing our website get updated so frequently.

323
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:29,458
So I just ask of the city administration, once again, for a third time, to report back to the council on what exactly the security threat or issue was.

324
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,173
Would you like to make that an amendment?

325
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:31,913
Sure.

326
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:34,814
Any further discussion?

327
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:38,135
I do want to thank Councilor Sanchez for bringing this forward.

328
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:50,517
I know, and again, I'm sure all of us get phone calls as far as parking, other issues, saying I went to the website and the information wasn't updated or street cleaning, the information wasn't updated and it needs to be updated.

329
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:52,038
This is where people are going for information.

330
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:52,578
Councilor Carvajal.

331
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:59,159
Madam President, if we could amend that to ask the administration if we have an update on the hiring of an IT person?

332
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:12,836
All right, so on the motion of Councilor Svang as amended by Councilors Knight and Carvalho, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

333
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:13,596
All those in favor?

334
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:15,217
All those opposed?

335
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,178
Motion passes.

336
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:23,022
Vice-President Behrs.

337
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:28,426
For public participation, is there anyone in person or on Zoom who would like to speak for public participation?

338
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,307
Please raise your hand or come to the podium.

339
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:39,844
not seeing any moving on.

340
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:40,704
Sure.

341
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:46,069
Name and address for the record, please have Medford.

342
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,911
Um, comes to Carve yellow.

343
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:52,174
Thanks for taking the time this morning to address the city.

344
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,117
I did reach out to somebody waiting for a return call back.

345
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:57,779
Okay, well, you asked you do sure.

346
00:27:58,099 --> 00:27:59,120
Um, so for the rest of you, um,

347
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:02,172
The parks that we have in this city are awesome.

348
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:14,899
So I just wanted to start with that really appreciate now they have a small child, especially when it's warm out, you know, we have things like a splash pad that's available to the public as well as a dog park actually exists, you know, behind the Andrews and McGlynn schools.

349
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,962
If I recall, those though, weren't paid for with city funds.

350
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:24,405
Councilor night you might actually remember how that was funded.

351
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,430
the city definitely participated in some of our money for design.

352
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,672
Sure, but it wasn't solely done.

353
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,693
It was like you said, a public partnership.

354
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:45,098
It might be something you want to look into with the Tufts Park area as well, instead of just maybe temporary fencing, because the dog parks that we have behind there are actually pretty nice.

355
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:48,240
They were segregated for like large dogs versus small dogs.

356
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:57,425
It's my understanding that at one point in time, there was some discussion with the local college to do a public-private partnership with Tufts Park and do the whole entire field with AstroTurf and

357
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,856
a clubhouse and everything, but it's out of administration testing.

358
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:09,118
So a general theme, I think that I'm starting to see though, and it sounds apparent that it may be it's happening at Tufts Park as well.

359
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:19,920
As you know, the McGlynn schools is, there's kind of some neglect happening in some of our parks, and you know, to the good counselors point about just in the city, right?

360
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,841
If we take care of the city, the city will take care of it.

361
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:31,880
In a sense, right, the townspeople in the city folk will get into it, right, and wanna keep things nice, but if you let it get junky, then people just don't care.

362
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:47,228
So this Saturday morning, I went with my child to go play on the swings in the park at McGlynn, and there were cases of beer left over, there was a bunch of trash everywhere, there was clothing left over from the middle of the night, so I don't know what was happening with that, but it was adult clothing.

363
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:51,590
These aren't the things that we should be having, especially at our elementary schools.

364
00:29:52,685 --> 00:30:06,495
I think the administration needs to do something in terms of personnel to start paying attention to your city, because the city cannot afford to keep doing overrides and debt exclusions and so on and so forth.

365
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,097
Gas is expensive for everyone.

366
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,638
Most of us have to drive to get to work.

367
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:11,899
Everyone's feeling the pinch.

368
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,821
Let's take care of what we have.

369
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:22,167
And if that means maybe spending a little more on personnel to help monitor these places, that might be cheaper in the end, net net,

370
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:29,295
right, with all the benefits, everything else that person would be paid versus constantly repairing the good things we have already.

371
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:34,922
So if that is a person who drives around and looks, you know, throughout the day.

372
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:37,340
looks at the parks.

373
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,842
During school, it's one thing, right?

374
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:39,803
I mean, there's teachers there.

375
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:44,026
It's the after school hours at those parks, but maybe a Tufts driver.

376
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:53,155
And that way, if someone does have their dog off their leash, and they're not supposed to, there's someone with some authority to say, hello, would you please put your dog back on your leash?

377
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:55,477
Because I don't want my children to be eaten, right?

378
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,579
Which I know it's an exaggeration.

379
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,943
However, these are problems that can be reasonably solved with, I think, a person.

380
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:11,535
So, but it's more than just the dogs, it's making sure that we're not trashing the city, that we've worked so hard to build some nice things for the city.

381
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:18,720
So I'd appreciate if, I don't know if that's something that can be made an extra motion or whatnot, you know, to the administration.

382
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,002
The budget is coming up, so it's absolutely conversations that can be had during budget time.

383
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:30,026
You know, ideally the administration watches the meetings, I'll let my fellow councilors speak, Vice-President Behrs, Carriello and then Knight.

384
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:34,794
Thank you, Madam President, thanks Nate for coming up completely agree with you.

385
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:50,106
And, you know, we've talked about it in about three different contexts tonight already about curb appeal whether it's roads and sidewalks park parks some of it obviously a state jurisdiction but there's a lot that we can do in our own in this budget we had a meeting last week.

386
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:55,108
Um, sending our key priorities to the mayor's office for what we'd like to see in the budget.

387
00:31:55,448 --> 00:32:00,970
Um, one of them was an additional code enforcement officer, which is, those are the folks who go around and enforce the civil code.

388
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:09,313
So maintenance of stuff, uh, you know, are your, you know, are you throwing nips on the side of the street?

389
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:11,014
Are you, you know, that kind of thing.

390
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:11,534
Um, uh,

391
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:24,710
We've also asked for additional staffing at our DPW those are the folks who go around and both maintain parks, as well as can kind of say to somebody Hey, you can't throw that their code enforcement obviously could work on that as well.

392
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,791
We've been pretty, at least we've had some preliminary discussions.

393
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:33,552
The city has one animal control officer for the entire city.

394
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:47,070
parks as well as the Brooks estate which is a large area, and anything that goes on on city streets and sidewalks, and even private property, you know as folks know, in certain cases.

395
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:54,474
And, you know, those are all certainly areas where we've we put an advocacy to the mayor's office to make those priorities.

396
00:32:55,894 --> 00:33:03,502
To your point around overrides and debt exclusions Medford's one of the communities that's never done one in 45 years since proposition two and a half was passed in 1980.

397
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:07,986
And I think one of the things that I'm concerned.

398
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:18,577
about, and I'm concerned we're gonna hear when the budget is presented to us hopefully soon, is that it's another do more with less situation.

399
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:24,338
They're gonna come in and say inflation's 8%, healthcare costs are up this much, the union contracts are up this much.

400
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:29,679
We can add one person across, not in each department, across the whole city.

401
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,139
That's what I am expecting we're gonna hear from the administration.

402
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,500
We're in a very tight situation.

403
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,170
I certainly agree with you on the priorities.

404
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:52,514
And I certainly agree with my fellow counselors as well there are a lot of opportunities around us with development and bringing in new growth to the city that can provide some of those additional revenues to the to the city budget to hire these positions.

405
00:33:53,354 --> 00:34:00,996
But at the end of the day, and I know this is not something that certainly not something I want to say and it's certainly not something you want to hear.

406
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:10,291
We've been kind of screaming into the void a little bit on a lot of these issues for the past several months and I think some of my counselors would even say for the past several years.

407
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:20,938
So we're going to fight hard I think we're going to fight maybe maybe harder than we even have before around the budget and getting those priorities that we agree on funded, but at the end of the day.

408
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:29,055
They're just decisions that are out of our hands that really are tying the entire city up on a whole host of issues.

409
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:36,081
And it all trickles back down to the basic quality of life residents, and why isn't the sidewalk patched.

410
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:37,602
Why is there a crack.

411
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:40,609
you know, that someone's tripping over and hurting themselves.

412
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:45,272
Why is there, you know, hooliganism or whatever else you may want to call it.

413
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:50,076
I knew it was graduation weekend, so that would be where I would put my bet on the beer cans.

414
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,858
Not to say it's right, but just my guess.

415
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:58,602
And, you know, do we even have enough money to send someone out on overtime on Saturday, right?

416
00:34:58,642 --> 00:34:59,703
Saturday morning to clean up.

417
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:00,583
I don't know.

418
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:04,206
That's the situation we're in right now.

419
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,595
So I'm hoping for a better outcome.

420
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:24,185
I know we're gonna be fighting for a better outcome, but I just wanna be realistic with you and any resident who comes before this council that we are to a great extent at the mercy of the city administration when it comes to the budget and that we're gonna try to do our best and fight as hard as we can.

421
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:32,130
But there are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made and they need to start being made or we're gonna keep having the same conversation over and over again.

422
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:37,207
And you're going to call Rick and he's going to say he called somebody and then we're going to get the beer cleaned up three days later and then.

423
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:42,090
next year that's going to be out there again, because we didn't add that code enforcement officer.

424
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,250
We didn't add that DPW parks person.

425
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,631
So I'll leave it at that.

426
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:51,233
There's a little bit of a rant, but it's just, I share your frustration and we're doing what we can.

427
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:53,134
I certainly appreciate it.

428
00:35:53,754 --> 00:36:04,238
I guess the only other thing I would add is that if we can at least make sure that those decisions are made consciously, then they can also be held accountable later for those same decisions.

429
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:06,819
and lack of decisions.

430
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,521
So I'd urge you to push for that.

431
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:15,266
And the other thing is that, I mean, there was COVID money that was given to this city that is still trying to be figured out how to be spent.

432
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:23,272
And if I recall infrastructure of various types was, you know, is a category that that could be spent on.

433
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:30,158
Now hiring a person to figure out, and their sole job of getting paid is trying to figure out how to spend money and salary.

434
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:31,439
I'll do that for you for free.

435
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:49,065
There's plenty of things to spend money on in this, you know, like I said, I hope improve our city that we don't need to wait six months or a year seven different committees to act now, or not necessarily act now but at least be judicious, and maybe we can be pound wise, instead of penny wise and pound foolish.

436
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:53,849
So, but, but I do appreciate you.

437
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,151
You looking in that and helping fight for so thank you.

438
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:02,938
I spoke with the gentleman earlier this morning, and he showed me the pictures.

439
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:09,421
And, you know, again, you know, like Councilor Behr said, you know, half our agenda tonight was talking about career appeal and the cleanliness of the city.

440
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:14,764
And, you know, both of those schools over there have custodians.

441
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:19,086
And I don't know why they don't do like a walk around in the morning before they go in.

442
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,447
Those things just didn't appear there.

443
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,248
They must've been there for a couple of days.

444
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,609
I don't know what day he took those pictures.

445
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:29,677
That actually, in this particular case, that was a Saturday morning.

446
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:30,437
Okay, Saturday morning.

447
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:35,880
So by Monday morning, those should have been, you know, the custodians should have been out there, picked all of them, cleaned all of them.

448
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:43,385
I don't know, I don't know if that's their daily routine, to do a walk around the property and pick up the glaring, the glaring rubbish.

449
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:53,391
But, you know, again, we talk about all the time, something I've been talking about since I've been on the council is curb appeal in the city.

450
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,864
We got so much low-hanging fruit that could be cleaned up.

451
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:58,125
It's just not funny.

452
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:01,548
In fact, I was talking to the president before meeting tonight.

453
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:05,891
So tomorrow we're having this grand opening of a brand new library.

454
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:08,252
And you drive down High Street.

455
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,154
And what's all over High Street?

456
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:13,136
Rubbish bags, trash bags, barrels.

457
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:17,139
People coming in from all over, taking pictures and everything.

458
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:23,684
And this is what they're going to have to drive through is barrels of rubbish that shouldn't even be there.

459
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:28,639
Again, I agree with you.

460
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:37,602
We all look for a solution to this, but I don't know where, and it's not just this administration, it's been prior administrations too.

461
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:43,163
So we don't want to put the fault on one group, but it's been an ongoing problem for many years.

462
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,544
Thank you, Councillor Karygiannis.

463
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:46,004
Councillor Knight.

464
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,935
Anything else like that?

465
00:38:54,536 --> 00:39:07,699
I guess one last piece to that is that, you know, maybe if we can stop some of this at the source, I know maybe I'm sounding old school, but I know that if I was like caught littering and whatnot, my parents would drag me out and make me clean it up instead of paying someone else overtime to do.

466
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,540
I see you later.

467
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:23,054
Likewise, but in all seriousness, maybe it is just a patrol, you know, of someone, I understand the police are busy and whatnot, but if they- It's called taking a little pride in your community.

468
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:30,295
You know, take a lap around and if you see people trashing, you know, if they happen to see people trashing up the place, well then there you go.

469
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:40,057
However many people there are trashing the place, that's, you know, 12 more volunteers that can be voluntold to, you know, clean up their area that they made a pigsty.

470
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:45,394
So not everything has to be, we pay to fix other people's problems.

471
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:46,335
So.

472
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:47,217
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

473
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:47,838
Councilor Collins.

474
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:49,659
Thank you, President Morrell.

475
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,942
And yeah, I appreciate this topic being brought up and much of what my fellow counselors have already said on the topic.

476
00:39:53,962 --> 00:40:10,392
And I just think it, not to be repetitive, but I think it really bears emphasizing and repeating that there's not a, I don't think there's a single department head I've spoken to in the six months I've been in office that hasn't said directly or insinuated that they're operating with less staff than they can use.

477
00:40:10,412 --> 00:40:18,617
And I think that very much includes our code enforcement officer, singular, you know, for all of the issues, pretty much all of the topics that we've talked about.

478
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,419
tonight.

479
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:22,700
And so I think, you know, I think President bears hit the nail on the head.

480
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,022
I think that, you know, obviously, every every budget season, we're talking about the upcoming fiscal year.

481
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:44,089
But if we don't make and save time for these broader longitudinal priorities, then, you know, every year, we're going to keep fighting over individual traffic islands, individual parks patrol, you know, we're going to every low hanging fruit is going to be a fight.

482
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,310
And so we, we need to tackle that, or we're going to be

483
00:40:50,048 --> 00:41:01,253
fighting over the smallest issues, and we should be figuring out how to increase our constituent services to give people the experience that they really deserve.

484
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:02,074
Thank you.

485
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:03,454
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

486
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:06,616
Anyone else who'd like to speak for public participation?

487
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,380
Seeing none, Vice President Behrs, you had something?

488
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:22,395
Papers 21-631 and 22-023.

489
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:35,118
On the motion of vices and bears received and placed on file papers 21-631 and 22-023 unfinished business.

490
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:38,438
And that would be both of the 21-631s?

491
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:38,778
Yes.

492
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,760
So on the motion by vices and bears second by- Legal opinion on that, Madam President.

493
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,320
I believe we are.

494
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,141
I'll leave it on.

495
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,762
Did we get a legal opinion on that?

496
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:57,102
It seems pretty dead to me.

497
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:57,702
We never did.

498
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:01,783
No, because last time Ms.

499
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:09,244
Nazarian came up and said, you know, I'm very confident, and so is KP Law, that we've complied with the provisions and chapters outlined in the question.

500
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,144
And I said, well, when are we going to get the response?

501
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,564
And she said, it's going to be coming.

502
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,025
Yeah, I didn't think we had, but do you guys think we have?

503
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:18,038
Okay.

504
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:19,739
I don't think we have.

505
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:20,840
I don't believe we have.

506
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,403
I would then, I'll withdraw my motion.

507
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,265
Okay, Councilor Behrs has withdrawn his motion.

508
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,349
That is the end of our agenda.

509
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:38,154
On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang.

510
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:38,955
All those in favor?

511
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,375
Aye.

512
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:40,376
All those opposed?

513
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:41,857
Meeting is adjourned.
