    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=606.379s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=607.82s">We</a>  went around and we made these, we put in these islands and these bump outs, and now they're becoming weed cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=616.006s">If</a>  you go to Winter Street, the bump out there is just a bunch of weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=621.628s">You</a>  drive down to the other parts, all we're getting is weeds and all these bump outs in these islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=627.739s">So</a>  instead of making them look nice by putting some landscaping on them, all they are is just weeds growing at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=635.955s">In</a>  the interest of some curb appeal, if we could at least get them cleaned up and the grass mowed out of them, because they say they're just, they're not appealing looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=646.378s">And</a>  I say, there's just hunks of concrete in the middle of the street with dirt and weeds growing around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=650.319s">So,</a>  you know, if they come up with a plan, maybe put some plantings on them or something to make them look a little better, but at least clean up the ones that are just overgrown and just look filthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=661.402s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=662.822s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=663.863s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=665.466s">Thank</a>  you, President, we're all thank you Councilor Carvial for putting this on the agenda I just wanted to note I saw maybe it was last week or two weeks ago, some looked like planting flower planting work being done in some of the bump outs or center islands. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=677.51s">Off</a>  of made a mystic and South Medford and just to your point it really is an issue of a little goes a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=682.451s">So</a>  I think it'd be great to get an update on is that going to be done throughout the city where can we expect for it to be done next. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=688.593s">You</a>  know, towards your point, you know, really helps a lot to improve the appearance of our main streets.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=698.423s">Is</a>  that the air system?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=699.584s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=701.445s">I</a>  assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=702.665s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=703.406s">If</a>  I could just amend the paper or offer a B paper, Madam President, requesting that the mayor provide us with a report on the status of the Adopt-A-Site program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=711.13s">Under</a>  the McGlynn administration, the Adopt-A-Site program was relatively successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=715.873s">It</a>  was a program where local businesses could adopt an island or a rotary or a site in the city, and then perform the upkeep and maintenance on it in exchange for a small advertising billboard on that parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=725.739s">and</a>  that was something that seemed to work out pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=727.5s">So</a>  I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with a report back on the status of that program.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=731.803s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=733.304s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=737.186s">So</a>  we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=739.128s">Do</a>  I have, we have the motion from Councilor Caraviello on the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=742.77s">Do</a>  I have a second for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=745.812s">And</a>  then the B paper, do we have a second for the Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=750.535s">So</a>  Mr. Clerk, we'll take the B paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=753.357s">Do</a>  you have the wording for the B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=754.697s">Were</a>  you able to hear that?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=814.829s">The</a>  grass on Webster Street is three feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=818.394s">I</a>  think they mowed the rotary today, but all the off-ramps and on-ramps coming off 93, I don't know which is worse, the DOT or the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=826.428s">They</a>  just let stuff grow forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=830.189s">But</a>  the grass is four feet tall in some places. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=834.15s">At</a>  the Roosevelt Circle Rotary, there's been bags of rubbish there for four weeks, just piled up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=840.231s">And</a>  those off-ramps, weeds and everything, the grass is just growing ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=844.952s">I</a>  mean, I don't know what we have to do to get either one of these organizations to actually do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=850.433s">So</a>  do we have to call, I mean, if you want to contact the state delegation again, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=855.437s">But</a>  again, no one seems to be doing anything here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=858.239s">And</a>  all we're doing is we're looking down like a rundown city.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=862.442s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=863.322s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=864.163s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=865.484s">In</a>  this specific case only, I can say that DCR is doing a slightly better job because they were down with the mower across the street from me doing their jurisdiction of the Roosevelt Circle area. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=878.414s">But</a>  it's truly a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=881.092s">You</a>  went through it very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=882.592s">In</a>  addition to that, we still have a broken bridge with no timeline for repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=887.534s">There's</a>  actually a bunch of rusted iron now sitting on Roosevelt Circle behind a Jersey barrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=894.895s">So,</a>  I mean, it's deteriorated significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=897.656s">It</a>  looks horrible.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=906.479s">Well,</a>  it's good to see that DCR has been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=909.06s">I</a>  didn't know if they were participating in No Mo' May or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=913.642s">But</a>  I would like to ask the sponsor if I could, if you'd be willing for me to amend the schedule, just to request, amend the resolution rather to request the maintenance schedule for Medford-Holme parcels from the DCR and the DOT.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=965.644s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=966.624s">This</a>  is a concern that I know we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=969.747s">We</a>  talked, um, yeah, a few years back about some concerns about, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=975.431s">not</a>  having a dog park in the South Method area. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=979.894s">And</a>  I think that there were some concerns and there were some questions asked if we could possibly use the small park area where the old South Method pool was and we could erect a fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=995.422s">where</a>  we could have it's a wide open space and we talked about possibly putting in a fence there and having dogs run off the leash in that area and there was some banter back and forth and we really didn't get get far with that and we really haven't heard much because of the pandemic and and to be honest the lack of <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1018.273s">activity</a>  down there for from different youth organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1022.235s">Well,</a>  I know that this past season, they've been some concerns with dogs off their leash, while kids are playing, especially girls softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1033.14s">That's</a>  the phone call I a few phone calls I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1036.382s">And</a>  I did call the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1041.244s">And</a>  I know that they <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1045.281s">They</a>  talked to the animal control officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1047.322s">They</a>  supposedly sent someone out, but nothing has been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1053.647s">The</a>  parents of the youth softball program had some concerns and I wanted to bring this forward so we can shed some light. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1060.912s">I</a>  understand I'm a dog lover, but I think that the safety of our <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1066.815s">residents,</a>  especially in a park, especially children, I think have to be first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1072.678s">And</a>  I know if there's, there could be a way that we can meet with, you know, I know there's, they're very organized organization for the dog walkers and group in South Medford at Tufts Park, maybe that we can work with meeting with them and the city administration to see if we can find a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1093.847s">maybe</a>  putting in even if it's a temporary fence and the gate that that people really want to leave, take the dogs off the leash that there is an area there that's enclosed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1105.817s">I</a>  know that they're very respectful dog owners and they clean up after the dogs and that's not an issue there and but it <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1114.137s">is</a>  a concern that even though the dogs are playful, it's left some negative marks in a few children's eyes and dogs are off leash that, you know, see a child that's playing with the ball and the dog runs up and <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1130.351s">thinks</a>  that it's playtime and they take the glove away from the child, it leaves a negative mark and it's frightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1137.556s">So</a>  these are things that are concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1140.659s">I</a>  know, you know, it might have been one or a few issues, but as this happened and the word cut out, I got a few phone calls from parents that the children play in the playground area and they <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1154.749s">They,</a>  they shared some concerns about the dogs around the other side of the fence and, you know, having the child run outside of the playground area onto the into the park they had some concerns so there are some valid issues there and I think that this is something we need to revisit as a council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1171.327s">something</a>  serious happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1172.447s">And</a>  again, if it's an isolated incident, that's fine, but still, now that we know this is happening, I don't want the next isolated issue being something where a child gets bit and we could have done something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1188.491s">So</a>  I know that, I know the police, we've tried to, I've asked for patrol, I've asked for the animal patrol officer to go out <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1197.993s">patrol</a>  the area, but from what I've gathered from the parents, there hasn't been enough visibility from the city's departments that are protecting the children in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1212.871s">So</a>  if we could just <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1215.777s">maybe</a>  make a motion to ask the report from the city administration and what they've done and that we can share with the community and then to see if the city can reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1228.784s">I</a>  know that the city administration told me that there's actually a person that organizes a lot of the dog activity there that we can maybe work together and try to see if there's something we can do that can accommodate all the parties and make sure that we can put maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1244.488s">even</a>  if it's a temporary safe, at least during the sports seasons, that they have that area on the side that we can fence in that would separate them.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1254.774s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1256.014s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1257.735s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1258.896s">Again,</a>  you know, this is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1261.117s">There's</a>  a problem a few years ago and it kind of quieted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1264.858s">And</a>  now that the kids are back in the parking and it seemed to read it, read it said again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1268.559s">Council</a>  cut Scott plays right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1270.859s">We</a>  have that area where that you'll touch pool was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1274.68s">I</a>  don't think it's that big of a deal to fence it in during for the summer so when the kids aren't out there, at least gives the dog somewhere to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1285.763s">and</a>  keeps them away from the kids during their time of their death. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1289.664s">So</a>  again, I'd like to amend the motion that the site of the old Tufts pool be temporarily fenced in to allow the dogs to at least go there and roam around with a safe, this way they won't be a danger to the children that are playing there.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1309.889s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1311.33s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1312.301s">Madam</a>  President, if I recall correctly, I think one of the biggest issues when this issue first came up was the fact that they didn't want fences, they wanted to be free range. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1320.029s">And</a>  the issue was that when the dog is off leash, but in a fenced in or caged in area, they may feel cornered and become aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1327.016s">And</a>  that's why they don't want any fence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1328.577s">I</a>  think that that's what the sticking point was last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1331.64s">That</a>  coupled with the fact that I believe we were stuck <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1335.377s">uh,</a>  in a situation where the pox department and the pox commission has a policy that's in place and they weren't willing to make a ruling on it until, uh, some further information was provided to the city of industry, uh, administration relative to, uh, bathroom facilities and the like down to that box. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1351.354s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1351.914s">Councilor</a>  Knight, any further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1356.622s">If</a>  I can, Madam President, I recall that strictly I know there were a couple issues that they, I think it's a big enough area that that dogs can run free and I think that another question that was brought up by that organization is that there wasn't enough separation from small dogs and big dogs so I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1378.472s">To</a>  be honest with you, I think my first priority is the safety of the children in that playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1383.013s">So</a>  let's see if we can move forward, see if we can find some sort of even just, even make it a pilot program for the rest of the summer, just to see how that works and then go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1397.417s">But</a>  right now, I think that's something that has to be imminent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1400.558s">I</a>  don't want to be sitting here in a week and there was no action and a child was bit by a dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1406.179s">I</a>  just, I feel terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1407.3s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1409.553s">further</a>  discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1410.294s">I</a>  want to thank you Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1412.914s">I</a>  know we've all been getting the phone calls in the email. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1415.175s">So</a>  I really thank you for bringing this forward to have this discussion because I think we've all been talking to the administration kind of individually and understandably a lot of folks in the situation aren't really satisfied with the answers they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1425.519s">So</a>  I think this really pushes us to do more and see if we can get some transparency around this issue and some different ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1432.061s">So</a>  we have the motion from Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1439.765s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1440.508s">And</a>  seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1442.313s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1443.758s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1444.099s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1445.343s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1448.53s">22-371</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng be resolved at the Medford City Council request the city administration update the city's website city websites text on COVID-19 information and frequently asked questions, Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President moral.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1462.335s">Um,</a>  you know, our city website is in need of updates and repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1467.337s">Um,</a>  I think that's evident, evident to everyone using the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1471.359s">I</a>  think this is this is a way for us to start chipping away at the at the at the <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1477.561s">outdated</a>  information on there, and if we chip away, hopefully we can fix the most glaring problems on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1485.186s">Right</a>  now, I was helping someone do some research into our COVID-19 policies, and in the FAQ section, it's just completely outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1495.293s">I</a>  think the information is from probably October of 2020, which is almost two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1501.897s">And</a>  there's, as I said at the budget meeting, there's a lot of outdated information about where masks should be worn, a lot of outdated information about what's open for visitor entry, what's closed, what the city's policies are, the case count, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1515.846s">And</a>  so I think it would, in the interest of transparency and open communication, if the city can prepare an update to the COVID-19 information section and FAQ section, that would be very helpful.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1531.945s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1533.025s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1533.846s">Madam</a>  President, just on that note, I do believe, oh geez, maybe it was three months ago, four months ago, there was an administrative issue, a personnel issue related to our director of IT and the city administration made some personnel moves related to questionable activity or surrounding union involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1560.222s">At</a>  the time, they said that the gentleman was removed from his position due to significant security issues surrounding our network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1566.465s">And</a>  this council has asked for an update now two times on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1569.747s">And</a>  I'm hoping we can get that information back as well, because this might be a reason why our website's not getting updated, because there's some security issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1576.571s">And</a>  we don't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1577.371s">We've</a>  asked, but we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1578.692s">And</a>  that could be a potential reason as to why we're not seeing our website get updated so frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1582.914s">So</a>  I just ask of the city administration, once again, for a third time, to report back to the council on what exactly the security threat or issue was.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1590.013s">Would</a>  you like to make that an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1591.653s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1594.054s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1596.374s">I</a>  do want to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1598.175s">I</a>  know, and again, I'm sure all of us get phone calls as far as parking, other issues, saying I went to the website and the information wasn't updated or street cleaning, the information wasn't updated and it needs to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1610.537s">This</a>  is where people are going for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1612.118s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1612.598s">Madam</a>  President, if we could amend that to ask the administration if we have an update on the hiring of an IT person?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1623.17s">All</a>  right, so on the motion of Councilor Svang as amended by Councilors Knight and Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1632.856s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1634.377s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1635.398s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1638.059s">Vice-President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1643.062s">For</a>  public participation, is there anyone in person or on Zoom who would like to speak for public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1648.546s">Please</a>  raise your hand or come to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1657.942s">not</a>  seeing any moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1660.524s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1661.545s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please have Medford.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1666.629s">Um,</a>  comes to Carve yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1668.951s">Thanks</a>  for taking the time this morning to address the city.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1672.254s">I</a>  did reach out to somebody waiting for a return call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1675.577s">Okay,</a>  well, you asked you do sure.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1678.099s">Um,</a>  so for the rest of you, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1680.551s">The</a>  parks that we have in this city are awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1682.492s">So</a>  I just wanted to start with that really appreciate now they have a small child, especially when it's warm out, you know, we have things like a splash pad that's available to the public as well as a dog park actually exists, you know, behind the Andrews and McGlynn schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1695.72s">If</a>  I recall, those though, weren't paid for with city funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1700.843s">Councilor</a>  Knight you might actually remember how that was funded.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1709.489s">the</a>  city definitely participated in some of our money for design.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1712.77s">Sure,</a>  but it wasn't solely done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1714.732s">It</a>  was like you said, a public partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1716.713s">It</a>  might be something you want to look into with the Tufts Park area as well, instead of just maybe temporary fencing, because the dog parks that we have behind there are actually pretty nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1725.118s">They</a>  were segregated for like large dogs versus small dogs.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1728.3s">It's</a>  my understanding that at one point in time, there was some discussion with the local college to do a public-private partnership with Tufts Park and do the whole entire field with AstroTurf and <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1737.935s">a</a>  clubhouse and everything, but it's out of administration testing.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1742.916s">So</a>  a general theme, I think that I'm starting to see though, and it sounds apparent that it may be it's happening at Tufts Park as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1749.718s">As</a>  you know, the McGlynn schools is, there's kind of some neglect happening in some of our parks, and you know, to the good Councilors point about just in the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1760.72s">If</a>  we take care of the city, the city will take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1763.796s">In</a>  a sense, right, the townspeople in the city folk will get into it, right, and wanna keep things nice, but if you let it get junky, then people just don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1772.34s">So</a>  this Saturday morning, I went with my child to go play on the swings in the park at McGlynn, and there were cases of beer left over, there was a bunch of trash everywhere, there was clothing left over from the middle of the night, so I don't know what was happening with that, but it was adult clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1788.849s">These</a>  aren't the things that we should be having, especially at our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1792.685s">I</a>  think the administration needs to do something in terms of personnel to start paying attention to your city, because the city cannot afford to keep doing overrides and debt exclusions and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1807.896s">Gas</a>  is expensive for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1809.297s">Most</a>  of us have to drive to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1811.099s">Everyone's</a>  feeling the pinch. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1812.58s">Let's</a>  take care of what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1814.261s">And</a>  if that means maybe spending a little more on personnel to help monitor these places, that might be cheaper in the end, net net, <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1822.487s">right,</a>  with all the benefits, everything else that person would be paid versus constantly repairing the good things we have already. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1830.016s">So</a>  if that is a person who drives around and looks, you know, throughout the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1835.899s">looks</a>  at the parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1837.38s">During</a>  school, it's one thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1838.882s">I</a>  mean, there's teachers there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1840.103s">It's</a>  the after school hours at those parks, but maybe a Tufts driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1844.367s">And</a>  that way, if someone does have their dog off their leash, and they're not supposed to, there's someone with some authority to say, hello, would you please put your dog back on your leash? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1853.175s">Because</a>  I don't want my children to be eaten, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1855.697s">Which</a>  I know it's an exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1857.679s">However,</a>  these are problems that can be reasonably solved with, I think, a person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1863.631s">So,</a>  but it's more than just the dogs, it's making sure that we're not trashing the city, that we've worked so hard to build some nice things for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1872.136s">So</a>  I'd appreciate if, I don't know if that's something that can be made an extra motion or whatnot, you know, to the administration.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1879.5s">The</a>  budget is coming up, so it's absolutely conversations that can be had during budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1884.883s">You</a>  know, ideally the administration watches the meetings, I'll let my fellow councilors speak, Vice-President Bears, Caraviello and then Knight.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1891.131s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, thanks Nate for coming up completely agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1895.875s">And,</a>  you know, we've talked about it in about three different contexts tonight already about curb appeal whether it's roads and sidewalks park parks some of it obviously a state jurisdiction but there's a lot that we can do in our own in this budget we had a meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1910.986s">Um,</a>  sending our key priorities to the mayor's office for what we'd like to see in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1915.448s">Um,</a>  one of them was an additional code enforcement officer, which is, those are the folks who go around and enforce the civil code. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1921.61s">So</a>  maintenance of stuff, uh, you know, are your, you know, are you throwing nips on the side of the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1929.353s">Are</a>  you, you know, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1931.094s">Um,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1932.087s">We've</a>  also asked for additional staffing at our DPW those are the folks who go around and both maintain parks, as well as can kind of say to somebody Hey, you can't throw that their code enforcement obviously could work on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1945.57s">We've</a>  been pretty, at least we've had some preliminary discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1950.611s">The</a>  city has one animal control officer for the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1955.644s">parks</a>  as well as the Brooks estate which is a large area, and anything that goes on on city streets and sidewalks, and even private property, you know as folks know, in certain cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1968.651s">And,</a>  you know, those are all certainly areas where we've we put an advocacy to the mayor's office to make those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1975.894s">To</a>  your point around overrides and debt exclusions Medford's one of the communities that's never done one in 45 years since proposition two and a half was passed in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1983.622s">And</a>  I think one of the things that I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1989.235s">about,</a>  and I'm concerned we're gonna hear when the budget is presented to us hopefully soon, is that it's another do more with less situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1998.597s">They're</a>  gonna come in and say inflation's 8%, healthcare costs are up this much, the union contracts are up this much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2005.538s">We</a>  can add one person across, not in each department, across the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2010.259s">That's</a>  what I am expecting we're gonna hear from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2014.459s">We're</a>  in a very tight situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2018.51s">I</a>  certainly agree with you on the priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2021.131s">And</a>  I certainly agree with my fellow Councilors as well there are a lot of opportunities around us with development and bringing in new growth to the city that can provide some of those additional revenues to the to the city budget to hire these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2033.354s">But</a>  at the end of the day, and I know this is not something that certainly not something I want to say and it's certainly not something you want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2042.466s">We've</a>  been kind of screaming into the void a little bit on a lot of these issues for the past several months and I think some of my Councilors would even say for the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2051.872s">So</a>  we're going to fight hard I think we're going to fight maybe maybe harder than we even have before around the budget and getting those priorities that we agree on funded, but at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2061.889s">They're</a>  just decisions that are out of our hands that really are tying the entire city up on a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2070.256s">And</a>  it all trickles back down to the basic quality of life residents, and why isn't the sidewalk patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2076.781s">Why</a>  is there a crack. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2078.227s">you</a>  know, that someone's tripping over and hurting themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2080.689s">Why</a>  is there, you know, hooliganism or whatever else you may want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2085.352s">I</a>  knew it was graduation weekend, so that would be where I would put my bet on the beer cans. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2091.176s">Not</a>  to say it's right, but just my guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2093.778s">And,</a>  you know, do we even have enough money to send someone out on overtime on Saturday, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2098.642s">Saturday</a>  morning to clean up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2100.223s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2102.424s">That's</a>  the situation we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2105.114s">So</a>  I'm hoping for a better outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2106.635s">I</a>  know we're gonna be fighting for a better outcome, but I just wanna be realistic with you and any resident who comes before this council that we are to a great extent at the mercy of the city administration when it comes to the budget and that we're gonna try to do our best and fight as hard as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2124.846s">But</a>  there are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made and they need to start being made or we're gonna keep having the same conversation over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2132.592s">And</a>  you're going to call Rick and he's going to say he called somebody and then we're going to get the beer cleaned up three days later and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2137.988s">next</a>  year that's going to be out there again, because we didn't add that code enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2142.19s">We</a>  didn't add that DPW parks person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2145.651s">So</a>  I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2146.651s">There's</a>  a little bit of a rant, but it's just, I share your frustration and we're doing what we can.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2152.113s">I</a>  certainly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2153.754s">I</a>  guess the only other thing I would add is that if we can at least make sure that those decisions are made consciously, then they can also be held accountable later for those same decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2165.077s">and</a>  lack of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2167.799s">So</a>  I'd urge you to push for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2169.801s">And</a>  the other thing is that, I mean, there was COVID money that was given to this city that is still trying to be figured out how to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2175.886s">And</a>  if I recall infrastructure of various types was, you know, is a category that that could be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2184.053s">Now</a>  hiring a person to figure out, and their sole job of getting paid is trying to figure out how to spend money and salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2190.578s">I'll</a>  do that for you for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2193.232s">There's</a>  plenty of things to spend money on in this, you know, like I said, I hope improve our city that we don't need to wait six months or a year seven different committees to act now, or not necessarily act now but at least be judicious, and maybe we can be pound wise, instead of penny wise and pound foolish. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2211.447s">So,</a>  but, but I do appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2214.27s">You</a>  looking in that and helping fight for so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2219.977s">I</a>  spoke with the gentleman earlier this morning, and he showed me the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2223.459s">And,</a>  you know, again, you know, like Councilor Behr said, you know, half our agenda tonight was talking about career appeal and the cleanliness of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2230.222s">And,</a>  you know, both of those schools over there have custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2234.824s">And</a>  I don't know why they don't do like a walk around in the morning before they go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2239.426s">Those</a>  things just didn't appear there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2241.907s">They</a>  must've been there for a couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2243.328s">I</a>  don't know what day he took those pictures.</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2247.175s">That</a>  actually, in this particular case, that was a Saturday morning.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2249.837s">Okay,</a>  Saturday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2250.737s">So</a>  by Monday morning, those should have been, you know, the custodians should have been out there, picked all of them, cleaned all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2256.601s">I</a>  don't know, I don't know if that's their daily routine, to do a walk around the property and pick up the glaring, the glaring rubbish. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2263.925s">But,</a>  you know, again, we talk about all the time, something I've been talking about since I've been on the council is curb appeal in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2274.222s">We</a>  got so much low-hanging fruit that could be cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2276.924s">It's</a>  just not funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2278.585s">In</a>  fact, I was talking to the president before meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2282.008s">So</a>  tomorrow we're having this grand opening of a brand new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2286.972s">And</a>  you drive down High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2289.213s">And</a>  what's all over High Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2290.614s">Rubbish</a>  bags, trash bags, barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2295.057s">People</a>  coming in from all over, taking pictures and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2297.499s">And</a>  this is what they're going to have to drive through is barrels of rubbish that shouldn't even be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2304.798s">Again,</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2308.679s">We</a>  all look for a solution to this, but I don't know where, and it's not just this administration, it's been prior administrations too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2317.982s">So</a>  we don't want to put the fault on one group, but it's been an ongoing problem for many years.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2323.183s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Karygiannis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2325.564s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2330.955s">Anything</a>  else like that?</p>

    <p>[Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2334.536s">I</a>  guess one last piece to that is that, you know, maybe if we can stop some of this at the source, I know maybe I'm sounding old school, but I know that if I was like caught littering and whatnot, my parents would drag me out and make me clean it up instead of paying someone else overtime to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2347.719s">I</a>  see you later. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2352.412s">Likewise,</a>  but in all seriousness, maybe it is just a patrol, you know, of someone, I understand the police are busy and whatnot, but if they- It's called taking a little pride in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2363.794s">You</a>  know, take a lap around and if you see people trashing, you know, if they happen to see people trashing up the place, well then there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2370.415s">However</a>  many people there are trashing the place, that's, you know, 12 more volunteers that can be voluntold to, you know, clean up their area that they made a pigsty. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2381.808s">So</a>  not everything has to be, we pay to fix other people's problems.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2386.556s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2387.237s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2388.859s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2389.7s">And</a>  yeah, I appreciate this topic being brought up and much of what my fellow Councilors have already said on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2393.962s">And</a>  I just think it, not to be repetitive, but I think it really bears emphasizing and repeating that there's not a, I don't think there's a single department head I've spoken to in the six months I've been in office that hasn't said directly or insinuated that they're operating with less staff than they can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2410.412s">And</a>  I think that very much includes our code enforcement officer, singular, you know, for all of the issues, pretty much all of the topics that we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2419.119s">tonight.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2419.499s">And</a>  so I think, you know, I think President Bears hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2422.74s">I</a>  think that, you know, obviously, every every budget season, we're talking about the upcoming fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2428.102s">But</a>  if we don't make and save time for these broader longitudinal priorities, then, you know, every year, we're going to keep fighting over individual traffic islands, individual parks patrol, you know, we're going to every low hanging fruit is going to be a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2444.209s">And</a>  so we, we need to tackle that, or we're going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2450.048s">fighting</a>  over the smallest issues, and we should be figuring out how to increase our constituent services to give people the experience that they really deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2461.754s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2462.614s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2464.475s">Anyone</a>  else who'd like to speak for public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2471.978s">Seeing</a>  none, Vice President Bears, you had something?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2478.634s">Papers</a>  21-631 and 22-023.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2482.535s">On</a>  the motion of vices and bears received and placed on file papers 21-631 and 22-023 unfinished business. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2495.198s">And</a>  that would be both of the 21-631s?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2498.538s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2500.619s">So</a>  on the motion by vices and bears second by- Legal opinion on that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2508.1s">I</a>  believe we are.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2513.561s">I'll</a>  leave it on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2514.181s">Did</a>  we get a legal opinion on that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2515.822s">It</a>  seems pretty dead to me.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2517.182s">We</a>  never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2517.742s">No,</a>  because last time Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2521.803s">Nazarian</a>  came up and said, you know, I'm very confident, and so is KP Law, that we've complied with the provisions and chapters outlined in the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2529.804s">And</a>  I said, well, when are we going to get the response? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2531.184s">And</a>  she said, it's going to be coming.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2533.064s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't think we had, but do you guys think we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2537.197s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2539.079s">I</a>  don't think we have.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2540.039s">I</a>  don't believe we have.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2540.86s">I</a>  would then, I'll withdraw my motion.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2544.943s">Okay,</a>  Councilor Bears has withdrawn his motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2550.148s">That</a>  is the end of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2554.591s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2558.194s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2558.975s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2559.635s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2561.256s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned.</p>
