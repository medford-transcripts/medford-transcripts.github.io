[SPEAKER_01]: have been nice if the people who asked for the meeting were told to be about the meeting and we asked for a meeting to be here not held on zoom on a night that again one night before we even even knew about it so quite frankly uh i'd like to have a meeting here because obviously you know we're already scheduled for things tomorrow night and

129
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:18,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is an important meeting just to find out the day before the meeting and to neighbors without even being notified.

130
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Transparency at the worst.

131
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,345

138
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,008

145
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:20,590
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Winter Street, the bump out there is just a bunch of weeds.

146
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:27,318
[SPEAKER_01]: You drive down to the other parts, all we're getting is weeds and all these bump outs in these islands.

147
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:33,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of making them look nice by putting some landscaping on them, all they are is just weeds growing at them.

148
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:45,978
[SPEAKER_01]: In the interest of some curb appeal, if we could at least get them cleaned up and the grass mowed out of them, because they say they're just, they're not appealing looking.

149
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:50,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, there's just hunks of concrete in the middle of the street with dirt and weeds growing around them.

150
00:10:50,319 --> 00:11:01,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if they come up with a plan, maybe put some plantings on them or something to make them look a little better, but at least clean up the ones that are just overgrown and just look filthy.

151
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:01,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

152
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:03,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

153
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

154
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:16,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President, we're all thank you Councilor Carvial for putting this on the agenda I just wanted to note I saw maybe it was last week or two weeks ago, some looked like planting flower planting work being done in some of the bump outs or center islands.

155
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Off of made a mystic and South Medford and just to your point it really is an issue of a little goes a long way.

156
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:27,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it'd be great to get an update on is that going to be done throughout the city where can we expect for it to be done next.

157
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, towards your point, you know, really helps a lot to improve the appearance of our main streets.

158
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the air system?

159
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:39,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

160
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume.

161
00:11:42,665 --> 00:11:43,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

162
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:50,230
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just amend the paper or offer a B paper, Madam President, requesting that the mayor provide us with a report on the status of the Adopt-A-Site program.

163
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the McGlynn administration, the Adopt-A-Site program was relatively successful.

164
00:11:55,873 --> 00:12:05,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a program where local businesses could adopt an island or a rotary or a site in the city, and then perform the upkeep and maintenance on it in exchange for a small advertising billboard on that parcel.

165
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,460
[SPEAKER_10]: and that was something that seemed to work out pretty well.

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,882
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with a report back on the status of that program.

167
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

168
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

169
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll take the B paper first.

170
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:22,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have, we have the motion from Councilor Caraviello on the main paper.

171
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second for that?

172
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the B paper, do we have a second for the Councilor Tseng?

173
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. Clerk, we'll take the B paper first.

174
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:34,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have the wording for the B paper?

175
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you able to hear that?

176
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Newton.

177
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:39,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

178
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on.

179
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight requested an update.

180
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:50,249
[SPEAKER_02]: From the mayor on the, uh on the adopt, uh On the adopt a site program.

181
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Okay, I didn't get the

182
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:04,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight on the B paper, seconded by Vice-President Bears.

183
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

184
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,831
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

185
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:08,372
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

186
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:13,035
[SPEAKER_05]: On the main paper from Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

187
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,135
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

188
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

189
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:16,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

190
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:23,260
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-369 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

191
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:30,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have mass stop, mow the grass at the rotary and off and on ramps to route 93.

192
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:31,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

193
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,132
[SPEAKER_01]: The grass on Webster Street is three feet tall.

194
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:45,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they mowed the rotary today, but all the off-ramps and on-ramps coming off 93, I don't know which is worse, the DOT or the DCR.

195
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:49,889
[SPEAKER_01]: They just let stuff grow forever.

196
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:53,369
[SPEAKER_01]: But the grass is four feet tall in some places.

197
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,191
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Roosevelt Circle Rotary, there's been bags of rubbish there for four weeks, just piled up there.

198
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:04,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And those off-ramps, weeds and everything, the grass is just growing ridiculous.

199
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:09,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what we have to do to get either one of these organizations to actually do their job.

200
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:14,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we have to call, I mean, if you want to contact the state delegation again, that's fine.

201
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, no one seems to be doing anything here.

202
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:21,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we're doing is we're looking down like a rundown city.

203
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

204
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice Mayor Bears.

205
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

206
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:37,593
[SPEAKER_08]: In this specific case only, I can say that DCR is doing a slightly better job because they were down with the mower across the street from me doing their jurisdiction of the Roosevelt Circle area.

207
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:39,534
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's truly a mess.

208
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,172
[SPEAKER_08]: You went through it very well.

209
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:47,514
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to that, we still have a broken bridge with no timeline for repair.

210
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:54,775
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually a bunch of rusted iron now sitting on Roosevelt Circle behind a Jersey barrier.

211
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's deteriorated significantly.

212
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:59,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks horrible.

213
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:03,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

214
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

215
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:05,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

216
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:09,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's good to see that DCR has been out there.

217
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know if they were participating in No Mo' May or not.

218
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:28,209
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would like to ask the sponsor if I could, if you'd be willing for me to amend the schedule, just to request, amend the resolution rather to request the maintenance schedule for Medford-Holme parcels from the DCR and the DOT.

219
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

220
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

221
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, do you have the language for that amendment?

222
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:39,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

223
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a request for the maintenance schedule from DCR and DOT for those properties.

224
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:45,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

225
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:51,391
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

226
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:51,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

227
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:52,991
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

228
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:54,032
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

229
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:56,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Newton.

230
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,438
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-370 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

231
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the safety concerns dealing with dogs off leash at Tufts Park.

232
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

233
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

234
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,507
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a concern that I know we had.

235
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:14,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked, um, yeah, a few years back about some concerns about, um.

236
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:19,854
[SPEAKER_06]: not having a dog park in the South Method area.

237
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:34,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there were some concerns and there were some questions asked if we could possibly use the small park area where the old South Method pool was and we could erect a fence.

238
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:55,964
[SPEAKER_06]: where we could have it's a wide open space and we talked about possibly putting in a fence there and having dogs run off the leash in that area and there was some banter back and forth and we really didn't get get far with that and we really haven't heard much because of the pandemic and and to be honest the lack of

239
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:02,195
[SPEAKER_06]: activity down there for from different youth organizations.

240
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:12,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that this past season, they've been some concerns with dogs off their leash, while kids are playing, especially girls softball.

241
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the phone call I a few phone calls I received.

242
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:20,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did call the mayor's office.

243
00:17:21,244 --> 00:17:23,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that they

244
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,262
[SPEAKER_06]: They talked to the animal control officer.

245
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:31,285
[SPEAKER_06]: They supposedly sent someone out, but nothing has been resolved.

246
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:40,411
[SPEAKER_06]: The parents of the youth softball program had some concerns and I wanted to bring this forward so we can shed some light.

247
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:44,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand I'm a dog lover, but I think that the safety of our

248
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:52,498
[SPEAKER_06]: residents, especially in a park, especially children, I think have to be first and foremost.

249
00:17:52,678 --> 00:18:13,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know if there's, there could be a way that we can meet with, you know, I know there's, they're very organized organization for the dog walkers and group in South Medford at Tufts Park, maybe that we can work with meeting with them and the city administration to see if we can find a way that

250
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:24,816
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe putting in even if it's a temporary fence and the gate that that people really want to leave, take the dogs off the leash that there is an area there that's enclosed.

251
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they're very respectful dog owners and they clean up after the dogs and that's not an issue there and but it

252
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:49,630
[SPEAKER_06]: is a concern that even though the dogs are playful, it's left some negative marks in a few children's eyes and dogs are off leash that, you know, see a child that's playing with the ball and the dog runs up and

253
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:57,476
[SPEAKER_06]: thinks that it's playtime and they take the glove away from the child, it leaves a negative mark and it's frightening.

254
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are things that are concerning.

255
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:14,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you know, it might have been one or a few issues, but as this happened and the word cut out, I got a few phone calls from parents that the children play in the playground area and they

256
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:30,618
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they shared some concerns about the dogs around the other side of the fence and, you know, having the child run outside of the playground area onto the into the park they had some concerns so there are some valid issues there and I think that this is something we need to revisit as a council before.

257
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: something serious happens.

258
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, if it's an isolated incident, that's fine, but still, now that we know this is happening, I don't want the next isolated issue being something where a child gets bit and we could have done something about it.

259
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:56,813
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that, I know the police, we've tried to, I've asked for patrol, I've asked for the animal patrol officer to go out

260
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:12,831
[SPEAKER_06]: patrol the area, but from what I've gathered from the parents, there hasn't been enough visibility from the city's departments that are protecting the children in that area.

261
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could just

262
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:28,744
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe make a motion to ask the report from the city administration and what they've done and that we can share with the community and then to see if the city can reach out.

263
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:43,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the city administration told me that there's actually a person that organizes a lot of the dog activity there that we can maybe work together and try to see if there's something we can do that can accommodate all the parties and make sure that we can put maybe

264
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:54,754
[SPEAKER_06]: even if it's a temporary safe, at least during the sports seasons, that they have that area on the side that we can fence in that would separate them.

265
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:55,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you.

266
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Councilor Caraviello.

267
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

268
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, this is something that

269
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:04,318
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a problem a few years ago and it kind of quieted down.

270
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that the kids are back in the parking and it seemed to read it, read it said again.

271
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Council cut Scott plays right.

272
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,300
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that area where that you'll touch pool was.

273
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's that big of a deal to fence it in during for the summer so when the kids aren't out there, at least gives the dog somewhere to go in.

274
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:29,444
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeps them away from the kids during their time of their death.

275
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:48,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'd like to amend the motion that the site of the old Tufts pool be temporarily fenced in to allow the dogs to at least go there and roam around with a safe, this way they won't be a danger to the children that are playing there.

276
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:50,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

277
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

278
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:59,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, if I recall correctly, I think one of the biggest issues when this issue first came up was the fact that they didn't want fences, they wanted to be free range.

279
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:06,976
[SPEAKER_10]: And the issue was that when the dog is off leash, but in a fenced in or caged in area, they may feel cornered and become aggressive.

280
00:22:07,016 --> 00:22:08,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why they don't want any fence there.

281
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that's what the sticking point was last time.

282
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,343
[SPEAKER_10]: That coupled with the fact that I believe we were stuck

283
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:30,993
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, in a situation where the pox department and the pox commission has a policy that's in place and they weren't willing to make a ruling on it until, uh, some further information was provided to the city of industry, uh, administration relative to, uh, bathroom facilities and the like down to that box.

284
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:31,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

285
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:35,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, any further discussion?

286
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:57,419
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, Madam President, I recall that strictly I know there were a couple issues that they, I think it's a big enough area that that dogs can run free and I think that another question that was brought up by that organization is that there wasn't enough separation from small dogs and big dogs so I don't.

287
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:02,933
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest with you, I think my first priority is the safety of the children in that playground.

288
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:17,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see if we can move forward, see if we can find some sort of even just, even make it a pilot program for the rest of the summer, just to see how that works and then go from there.

289
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:20,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I think that's something that has to be imminent.

290
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to be sitting here in a week and there was no action and a child was bit by a dog.

291
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I feel terrible.

292
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

293
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:30,274
[SPEAKER_05]: further discussion.

294
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:32,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

295
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've all been getting the phone calls in the email.

296
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:45,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really thank you for bringing this forward to have this discussion because I think we've all been talking to the administration kind of individually and understandably a lot of folks in the situation aren't really satisfied with the answers they're getting.

297
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this really pushes us to do more and see if we can get some transparency around this issue and some different ideas.

298
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:58,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the motion from Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello.

299
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:00,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

300
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:01,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

301
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,136
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

302
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:03,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

303
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:04,821
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

304
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

305
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:21,815
[SPEAKER_05]: 22-371 offered by Councilor Tseng be resolved at the Medford City Council request the city administration update the city's website city websites text on COVID-19 information and frequently asked questions, Councilor Tseng, Thank you, President moral.

306
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, our city website is in need of updates and repair.

307
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:31,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's evident, evident to everyone using the city website.

308
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is this is a way for us to start chipping away at the at the at the

309
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:44,766
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated information on there, and if we chip away, hopefully we can fix the most glaring problems on the city website.

310
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:55,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I was helping someone do some research into our COVID-19 policies, and in the FAQ section, it's just completely outdated.

311
00:24:55,293 --> 00:25:00,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the information is from probably October of 2020, which is almost two years ago.

312
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:15,385
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, as I said at the budget meeting, there's a lot of outdated information about where masks should be worn, a lot of outdated information about what's open for visitor entry, what's closed, what the city's policies are, the case count, everything.

313
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:29,674
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it would, in the interest of transparency and open communication, if the city can prepare an update to the COVID-19 information section and FAQ section, that would be very helpful.

314
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:32,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

315
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:33,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

316
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:58,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam President, just on that note, I do believe, oh geez, maybe it was three months ago, four months ago, there was an administrative issue, a personnel issue related to our director of IT and the city administration made some personnel moves related to questionable activity or surrounding union involvement.

317
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:05,665
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time, they said that the gentleman was removed from his position due to significant security issues surrounding our network.

318
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And this council has asked for an update now two times on that.

319
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:15,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping we can get that information back as well, because this might be a reason why our website's not getting updated, because there's some security issue.

320
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:17,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't know about it.

321
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:18,272
[SPEAKER_10]: We've asked, but we don't know.

322
00:26:18,692 --> 00:26:22,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And that could be a potential reason as to why we're not seeing our website get updated so frequently.

323
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:29,458
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just ask of the city administration, once again, for a third time, to report back to the council on what exactly the security threat or issue was.

324
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to make that an amendment?

325
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

326
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:34,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

327
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:38,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward.

328
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:50,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and again, I'm sure all of us get phone calls as far as parking, other issues, saying I went to the website and the information wasn't updated or street cleaning, the information wasn't updated and it needs to be updated.

329
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where people are going for information.

330
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:52,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

331
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:59,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, if we could amend that to ask the administration if we have an update on the hiring of an IT person?

332
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:12,836
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so on the motion of Councilor Svang as amended by Councilors Knight and Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

333
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:13,596
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

334
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:15,217
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

335
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

336
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:23,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice-President Bears.

337
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:28,426
[SPEAKER_05]: For public participation, is there anyone in person or on Zoom who would like to speak for public participation?

338
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Please raise your hand or come to the podium.

339
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:39,844
[SPEAKER_05]: not seeing any moving on.

340
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

341
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:46,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please have Medford.

342
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:48,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, comes to Carve yellow.

343
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:52,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for taking the time this morning to address the city.

344
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I did reach out to somebody waiting for a return call back.

345
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:57,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, you asked you do sure.

346
00:27:58,099 --> 00:27:59,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so for the rest of you, um,

347
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:02,172
[SPEAKER_09]: The parks that we have in this city are awesome.

348
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:14,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to start with that really appreciate now they have a small child, especially when it's warm out, you know, we have things like a splash pad that's available to the public as well as a dog park actually exists, you know, behind the Andrews and McGlynn schools.

349
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: If I recall, those though, weren't paid for with city funds.

350
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:24,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight you might actually remember how that was funded.

351
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,430
[SPEAKER_10]: the city definitely participated in some of our money for design.

352
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, but it wasn't solely done.

353
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,693
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like you said, a public partnership.

354
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:45,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be something you want to look into with the Tufts Park area as well, instead of just maybe temporary fencing, because the dog parks that we have behind there are actually pretty nice.

355
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:48,240
[SPEAKER_09]: They were segregated for like large dogs versus small dogs.

356
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:57,425
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding that at one point in time, there was some discussion with the local college to do a public-private partnership with Tufts Park and do the whole entire field with AstroTurf and

357
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,856
[SPEAKER_10]: a clubhouse and everything, but it's out of administration testing.

358
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:09,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So a general theme, I think that I'm starting to see though, and it sounds apparent that it may be it's happening at Tufts Park as well.

359
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:19,920
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, the McGlynn schools is, there's kind of some neglect happening in some of our parks, and you know, to the good Councilors point about just in the city, right?

360
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,841
[SPEAKER_09]: If we take care of the city, the city will take care of it.

361
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:31,880
[SPEAKER_09]: In a sense, right, the townspeople in the city folk will get into it, right, and wanna keep things nice, but if you let it get junky, then people just don't care.

362
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:47,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So this Saturday morning, I went with my child to go play on the swings in the park at McGlynn, and there were cases of beer left over, there was a bunch of trash everywhere, there was clothing left over from the middle of the night, so I don't know what was happening with that, but it was adult clothing.

363
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: These aren't the things that we should be having, especially at our elementary schools.

364
00:29:52,685 --> 00:30:06,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the administration needs to do something in terms of personnel to start paying attention to your city, because the city cannot afford to keep doing overrides and debt exclusions and so on and so forth.

365
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Gas is expensive for everyone.

366
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:10,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of us have to drive to get to work.

367
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:11,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's feeling the pinch.

368
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take care of what we have.

369
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:22,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that means maybe spending a little more on personnel to help monitor these places, that might be cheaper in the end, net net,

370
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:29,295
[SPEAKER_09]: right, with all the benefits, everything else that person would be paid versus constantly repairing the good things we have already.

371
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:34,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So if that is a person who drives around and looks, you know, throughout the day.

372
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:37,340
[SPEAKER_09]: looks at the parks.

373
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,842
[SPEAKER_09]: During school, it's one thing, right?

374
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:39,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's teachers there.

375
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:44,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the after school hours at those parks, but maybe a Tufts driver.

376
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:53,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way, if someone does have their dog off their leash, and they're not supposed to, there's someone with some authority to say, hello, would you please put your dog back on your leash?

377
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:55,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't want my children to be eaten, right?

378
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I know it's an exaggeration.

379
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,943
[SPEAKER_09]: However, these are problems that can be reasonably solved with, I think, a person.

380
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:11,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it's more than just the dogs, it's making sure that we're not trashing the city, that we've worked so hard to build some nice things for the city.

381
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:18,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd appreciate if, I don't know if that's something that can be made an extra motion or whatnot, you know, to the administration.

382
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,002
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget is coming up, so it's absolutely conversations that can be had during budget time.

383
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:30,026
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, ideally the administration watches the meetings, I'll let my fellow councilors speak, Vice-President Bears, Caraviello and then Knight.

384
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:34,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President, thanks Nate for coming up completely agree with you.

385
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:50,106
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we've talked about it in about three different contexts tonight already about curb appeal whether it's roads and sidewalks park parks some of it obviously a state jurisdiction but there's a lot that we can do in our own in this budget we had a meeting last week.

386
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:55,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, sending our key priorities to the mayor's office for what we'd like to see in the budget.

387
00:31:55,448 --> 00:32:00,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, one of them was an additional code enforcement officer, which is, those are the folks who go around and enforce the civil code.

388
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:09,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So maintenance of stuff, uh, you know, are your, you know, are you throwing nips on the side of the street?

389
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:11,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you, you know, that kind of thing.

390
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:11,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh,

391
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:24,710
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also asked for additional staffing at our DPW those are the folks who go around and both maintain parks, as well as can kind of say to somebody Hey, you can't throw that their code enforcement obviously could work on that as well.

392
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been pretty, at least we've had some preliminary discussions.

393
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:33,552
[SPEAKER_08]: The city has one animal control officer for the entire city.

394
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:47,070
[SPEAKER_08]: parks as well as the Brooks estate which is a large area, and anything that goes on on city streets and sidewalks, and even private property, you know as folks know, in certain cases.

395
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:54,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, those are all certainly areas where we've we put an advocacy to the mayor's office to make those priorities.

396
00:32:55,894 --> 00:33:03,502
[SPEAKER_08]: To your point around overrides and debt exclusions Medford's one of the communities that's never done one in 45 years since proposition two and a half was passed in 1980.

397
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:07,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think one of the things that I'm concerned.

398
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:18,577
[SPEAKER_08]: about, and I'm concerned we're gonna hear when the budget is presented to us hopefully soon, is that it's another do more with less situation.

399
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:24,338
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna come in and say inflation's 8%, healthcare costs are up this much, the union contracts are up this much.

400
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:29,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We can add one person across, not in each department, across the whole city.

401
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I am expecting we're gonna hear from the administration.

402
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,500
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a very tight situation.

403
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly agree with you on the priorities.

404
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:52,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly agree with my fellow Councilors as well there are a lot of opportunities around us with development and bringing in new growth to the city that can provide some of those additional revenues to the to the city budget to hire these positions.

405
00:33:53,354 --> 00:34:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, and I know this is not something that certainly not something I want to say and it's certainly not something you want to hear.

406
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:10,291
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been kind of screaming into the void a little bit on a lot of these issues for the past several months and I think some of my Councilors would even say for the past several years.

407
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:20,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to fight hard I think we're going to fight maybe maybe harder than we even have before around the budget and getting those priorities that we agree on funded, but at the end of the day.

408
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:29,055
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just decisions that are out of our hands that really are tying the entire city up on a whole host of issues.

409
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:36,081
[SPEAKER_08]: And it all trickles back down to the basic quality of life residents, and why isn't the sidewalk patched.

410
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:37,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is there a crack.

411
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:40,609
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, that someone's tripping over and hurting themselves.

412
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:45,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is there, you know, hooliganism or whatever else you may want to call it.

413
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:50,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was graduation weekend, so that would be where I would put my bet on the beer cans.

414
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to say it's right, but just my guess.

415
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:58,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, do we even have enough money to send someone out on overtime on Saturday, right?

416
00:34:58,642 --> 00:34:59,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturday morning to clean up.

417
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:00,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

418
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:04,206
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the situation we're in right now.

419
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:06,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping for a better outcome.

420
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:24,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're gonna be fighting for a better outcome, but I just wanna be realistic with you and any resident who comes before this council that we are to a great extent at the mercy of the city administration when it comes to the budget and that we're gonna try to do our best and fight as hard as we can.

421
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:32,130
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made and they need to start being made or we're gonna keep having the same conversation over and over again.

422
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:37,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to call Rick and he's going to say he called somebody and then we're going to get the beer cleaned up three days later and then.

423
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:42,090
[SPEAKER_08]: next year that's going to be out there again, because we didn't add that code enforcement officer.

424
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,250
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't add that DPW parks person.

425
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll leave it at that.

426
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:51,233
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of a rant, but it's just, I share your frustration and we're doing what we can.

427
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:53,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly appreciate it.

428
00:35:53,754 --> 00:36:04,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess the only other thing I would add is that if we can at least make sure that those decisions are made consciously, then they can also be held accountable later for those same decisions.

429
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:06,819
[SPEAKER_09]: and lack of decisions.

430
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd urge you to push for that.

431
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:15,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other thing is that, I mean, there was COVID money that was given to this city that is still trying to be figured out how to be spent.

432
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:23,272
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I recall infrastructure of various types was, you know, is a category that that could be spent on.

433
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:30,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Now hiring a person to figure out, and their sole job of getting paid is trying to figure out how to spend money and salary.

434
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:31,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do that for you for free.

435
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: There's plenty of things to spend money on in this, you know, like I said, I hope improve our city that we don't need to wait six months or a year seven different committees to act now, or not necessarily act now but at least be judicious, and maybe we can be pound wise, instead of penny wise and pound foolish.

436
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:53,849
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but, but I do appreciate you.

437
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,151
[SPEAKER_09]: You looking in that and helping fight for so thank you.

438
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:02,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke with the gentleman earlier this morning, and he showed me the pictures.

439
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:09,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, again, you know, like Councilor Behr said, you know, half our agenda tonight was talking about career appeal and the cleanliness of the city.

440
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:14,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, both of those schools over there have custodians.

441
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:19,086
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why they don't do like a walk around in the morning before they go in.

442
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things just didn't appear there.

443
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,248
[SPEAKER_01]: They must've been there for a couple of days.

444
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what day he took those pictures.

445
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:29,677
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually, in this particular case, that was a Saturday morning.

446
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:30,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Saturday morning.

447
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:35,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So by Monday morning, those should have been, you know, the custodians should have been out there, picked all of them, cleaned all of them.

448
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:43,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I don't know if that's their daily routine, to do a walk around the property and pick up the glaring, the glaring rubbish.

449
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:53,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, we talk about all the time, something I've been talking about since I've been on the council is curb appeal in the city.

450
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,864
[SPEAKER_01]: We got so much low-hanging fruit that could be cleaned up.

451
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:58,125
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not funny.

452
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:01,548
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was talking to the president before meeting tonight.

453
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:05,891
[SPEAKER_01]: So tomorrow we're having this grand opening of a brand new library.

454
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:08,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And you drive down High Street.

455
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's all over High Street?

456
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:13,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbish bags, trash bags, barrels.

457
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:17,139
[SPEAKER_01]: People coming in from all over, taking pictures and everything.

458
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:23,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what they're going to have to drive through is barrels of rubbish that shouldn't even be there.

459
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:28,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I agree with you.

460
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:37,602
[SPEAKER_01]: We all look for a solution to this, but I don't know where, and it's not just this administration, it's been prior administrations too.

461
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:43,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to put the fault on one group, but it's been an ongoing problem for many years.

462
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:45,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Karygiannis.

463
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:46,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

464
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else like that?

465
00:38:54,536 --> 00:39:07,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess one last piece to that is that, you know, maybe if we can stop some of this at the source, I know maybe I'm sounding old school, but I know that if I was like caught littering and whatnot, my parents would drag me out and make me clean it up instead of paying someone else overtime to do.

466
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you later.

467
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:23,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Likewise, but in all seriousness, maybe it is just a patrol, you know, of someone, I understand the police are busy and whatnot, but if they- It's called taking a little pride in your community.

468
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:30,295
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, take a lap around and if you see people trashing, you know, if they happen to see people trashing up the place, well then there you go.

469
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:40,057
[SPEAKER_09]: However many people there are trashing the place, that's, you know, 12 more volunteers that can be voluntold to, you know, clean up their area that they made a pigsty.

470
00:39:41,808 --> 00:39:45,394
[SPEAKER_09]: So not everything has to be, we pay to fix other people's problems.

471
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:46,335
So.

472
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

473
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:47,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

474
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:49,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Morell.

475
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I appreciate this topic being brought up and much of what my fellow Councilors have already said on the topic.

476
00:39:53,962 --> 00:40:10,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think it, not to be repetitive, but I think it really bears emphasizing and repeating that there's not a, I don't think there's a single department head I've spoken to in the six months I've been in office that hasn't said directly or insinuated that they're operating with less staff than they can use.

477
00:40:10,412 --> 00:40:18,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that very much includes our code enforcement officer, singular, you know, for all of the issues, pretty much all of the topics that we've talked about.

478
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,419
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight.

479
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:22,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think, you know, I think President Bears hit the nail on the head.

480
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, obviously, every every budget season, we're talking about the upcoming fiscal year.

481
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:44,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we don't make and save time for these broader longitudinal priorities, then, you know, every year, we're going to keep fighting over individual traffic islands, individual parks patrol, you know, we're going to every low hanging fruit is going to be a fight.

482
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we, we need to tackle that, or we're going to be

483
00:40:50,048 --> 00:41:01,253
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting over the smallest issues, and we should be figuring out how to increase our constituent services to give people the experience that they really deserve.

484
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:02,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

485
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:03,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

486
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:06,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else who'd like to speak for public participation?

487
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, Vice President Bears, you had something?

488
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:22,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Papers 21-631 and 22-023.

489
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:35,118
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of vices and bears received and placed on file papers 21-631 and 22-023 unfinished business.

490
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:38,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be both of the 21-631s?

491
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:38,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

492
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion by vices and bears second by- Legal opinion on that, Madam President.

493
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we are.

494
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll leave it on.

495
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we get a legal opinion on that?

496
00:41:55,822 --> 00:41:57,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems pretty dead to me.

497
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:57,702
[SPEAKER_10]: We never did.

498
00:41:57,742 --> 00:42:01,783
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because last time Ms.

499
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:09,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Nazarian came up and said, you know, I'm very confident, and so is KP Law, that we've complied with the provisions and chapters outlined in the question.

500
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,144
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, well, when are we going to get the response?

501
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, it's going to be coming.

502
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't think we had, but do you guys think we have?

503
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:18,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

504
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:19,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we have.

505
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:20,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we have.

506
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I would then, I'll withdraw my motion.

507
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Councilor Bears has withdrawn his motion.

508
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,349
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the end of our agenda.

509
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:38,154
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

510
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:38,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

511
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

512
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:40,376
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

513
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:41,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting is adjourned.
