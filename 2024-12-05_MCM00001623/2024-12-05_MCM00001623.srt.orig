[SPEAKER_03]: So three present, zero absent.

17
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:27,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I mentioned, this is a continuation of our first subcommittee meeting that we held back on 10-15.

18
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:33,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goal of these two meetings is to sort of put together and formalize

19
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:43,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a view of our capital plan for the schools and think about, um, what kind of recommendations we want to make to the broader school committee.

20
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

21
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:48,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will happen at a meeting in December, I think it's the 11th.

22
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that we have a couple of guests joining us.

23
00:01:52,662 --> 00:02:00,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Alicia Hunt from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and we have Paul Riggi from the City's Facility Team.

24
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome.

25
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:02,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us.

26
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:16,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually hopeful this meeting will not take an hour and a half, but this is the first time we've done this process, so we tried to make sure that we had enough space in the schedule to do all the things that we needed to do.

27
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:33,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to bring up the capital plan that we worked through last time and just provide a little bit of context for those of you who are newer to the conversation, just as soon as I can find the plan.

28
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

29
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:44,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And this capital plan, the way that we created this is we started with

30
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:54,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, last year's capital plan, which was created in a meeting, um, as like a starting point back in, like, May or June.

31
00:02:55,432 --> 00:03:14,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, um, from there, um, Peter, uh, did solicit input from the building principals to say, um, what other capital needs exist in the district that we may or may not sort of have on our radar in terms of, like, things that we see.

32
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's sort of how this list has come to pass.

33
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:33,499
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things we talked a lot about in the last meeting was sort of this intersection of a whole bunch of work happening at McGlynn and Andrews that this committee is aware of and apprised of.

34
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of how does that play into the overall capital plan.

35
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually met yesterday with Director Hunt and Dr. Cushing and the OPM for the project to try to get some clarity around.

36
00:03:53,624 --> 00:04:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the work that's going on and just sort of having some discussion and we, we sort of did this when we met last time there was some question about, like, what's included in that project and what is excluded from that project.

37
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:15,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of that has come into focus a little bit more, or at least we have sort of a directional focus that can help.

38
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:24,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that we talked about with the OPM was sort of the timeline to prepare to keep the project on track.

39
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:37,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And we asked the OPM also to be available to join us at our committee of the whole meeting, which actually will become a special school committee meeting.

40
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:53,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to give us an update on the project itself, but I can I'm happy to relay sort of what we talked about yesterday in terms of, like, you know, sort of things that are lumped into this and things that are excluded from this so that we can revise this capital plan.

41
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:59,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's, like, the biggest block of things that are in process right now.

42
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in scope is the.

43
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: the piece that we think about as HVAC, right, for both schools, McGlynn and Andrews.

44
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:10,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's in scope.

45
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,860
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not been a question about that.

46
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:30,749
[SPEAKER_03]: But a couple of other things that we talked about and confirmed yesterday as directionally sort of where we're going to include includes

47
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:49,560
[SPEAKER_03]: both the roof rebuild in some fashion at the McGlynn and the network splits and the mini splits that are in the network closets in those two buildings.

48
00:05:50,820 --> 00:06:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what these two rows are and I'm just going to move them up here because this is up here is stuff that we're saying is in progress and funded and all of these things

49
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:08,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, all of these things sort of are bundled into the.

50
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:11,146
[SPEAKER_03]: project at this time.

51
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:21,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that is going to allow is for the OPM to actually, because we have sort of like a chicken and egg situation going on, right, where we say, like, how are we going to pay for this?

52
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on how much it costs.

53
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on what's included.

54
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on how much it costs, right?

55
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:32,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So which is sort of very typical at this point in these kinds of projects.

56
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:34,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we talked about yesterday was that

57
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We are proceeding as though a bond will need to be issued by the city for this project and that it will include these components and solar for the roof.

58
00:06:51,648 --> 00:07:07,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will enable the OPM to actually go put that package together with pricing so that then we can look at that comprehensively and say, OK, yes, that is the go forward plan.

59
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that is the funding mechanism.

60
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing we talked a little bit about as a group was in order to keep this project on track so that it can be completed before the next school year, there is a tiny window that we've got to get exactly right between now and February.

61
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:40,152
[SPEAKER_03]: If you all recall, at the last school committee meeting, we took a vote to authorize the mayor to enter into a CM at risk contract.

62
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:53,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul and Alicia, feel free to jump in if I get this wrong, but what that allows us to do is bring the construction manager into the project sooner than we might otherwise do.

63
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:56,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows them to do things like.

64
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the equipment purchased that we are going to need that has long wait times while we wait for, like, the final design to be completed.

65
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:14,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So the timeline that we talked about yesterday was that really in order to keep on track, we need to be in a position to fund.

66
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:35,939
[SPEAKER_03]: the CM contract startup cost and the equipment cost in the month of January, which does mean that all of this question about funding and bonding has to make its way through the process between now and then, which does include an appearance at the council meeting, then an advertisement, and then a second appearance.

67
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right, Alicia?

68
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

69
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:41,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

70
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:43,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

71
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:48,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's many more steps than that.

72
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,024
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a grossly simplified version of what's happening.

73
00:08:53,104 --> 00:09:12,339
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we did ask the OPM to do was to be prepared to come to our special meeting on the 11th to give us an update on the project, and particularly that timeline of what needs to happen, what do they need from us, do they need from the city side, et cetera, to make sure that the project stays on track.

74
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:26,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the McGlynn project in a nutshell.

75
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:44,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions about that one erica yep just to refresh the funding source for that some of it is allocate where's that coming from how much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed.

76
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:48,555
[SPEAKER_12]: The final number until recently.

77
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:53,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the is under contract and being paid for.

78
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:57,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that is coming out of money.

79
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:58,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?

80
00:09:58,805 --> 00:09:59,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

81
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of the rest of the costs, we have to bond in order to have the money to do that.

82
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the bonding process is so.

83
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Important timeline wise, because.

84
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:16,705
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can't get those things in place in January, it's going to push the whole project.

85
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:23,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Right back and then we're going to be back at, you know, in impeding on the start of school.

86
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, because I know we had designated some things for each back, but it's all bonded.

87
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:28,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

88
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also includes move.

89
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar to the end network.

90
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,033
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

91
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:10,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of in progress process activities, those are that's sort of one big block of activity.

92
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:10,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

93
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:14,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would consider all those together.

94
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm putting that above the funding line, although obviously there's still a lot of work to do to secure all the right approvals, et cetera, for the bond.

95
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's sort of where we're at with that.

96
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make sense so far?

97
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:32,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee.

98
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:37,965
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.

99
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:47,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the school committee, actually, we won't vote on the funding piece of it because it is bonded.

100
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:51,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city is the only authority that can take out the bond.

101
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:52,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

102
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:56,613
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.

103
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

104
00:11:59,555 --> 00:11:59,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

105
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:01,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

106
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other.

107
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:18,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we did talk about that I think is really important is we talked with the OPM about these recommissioning assessments.

108
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:30,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another place where, broadly speaking, the OPM is on board to do those things, but funding has been such that

109
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:38,927
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not clarity about when we wanted to do that because we didn't tell them and we didn't tell them because we didn't have money.

110
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:46,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 1 thing that I think we can sort of start to clear up what.

111
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about yesterday in addition is that is opening up an accelerated repair window, like, usually between usually, like, between January and.

112
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe April, March, April, and that accelerated repairs for things like roofs, boilers.

113
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: HVAC, et cetera, MSP has adopted a new process where they'll open up a window this coming year.

114
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:19,977
[SPEAKER_03]: January to June or January to April, and then they will do it every other year.

115
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:26,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you hop into the window this year in January, you would learn if you.

116
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:33,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We're able to be funded sometime around now.

117
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a long process to get the notification to start.

118
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:49,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we are interested in doing that, we have to either get in this year or it's

119
00:13:50,330 --> 00:14:01,155
[SPEAKER_03]: two more years so it would be January 2027 before we would have another go at it.

120
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:13,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I did talk to MSBA last week and they did confirm that yes districts who are in the core program can apply for accelerated repair projects

121
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:20,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think what probably makes sense is for this.

122
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:25,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, re, commissioning assessment line to sort of split into.

123
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:31,044
[SPEAKER_03]: To maybe 2 lines 1 is a mini assessment that would enable us to.

124
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:50,206
[SPEAKER_03]: If we need to take advantage of that accelerated repair program so that assessment could get us ready to submit for Brooks, Roberts, and Mississauga if we find that the needs there are pressing and urgent when we talk about roofs and HVAC.

125
00:14:51,369 --> 00:15:06,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what we may want to consider recommending to the committee is that we pursue a mini assessment that looks at those pieces that are eligible for accelerated repair in an effort to put forward, um.

126
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:11,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, an application in that program this year, um.

127
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,492
[SPEAKER_03]: If we qualify, but we don't know yet.

128
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:20,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the thought the thought that we batted around yesterday was, let's.

129
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:26,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to, um, do some sort of mini assessment.

130
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the is going to figure out what the cost of that is.

131
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on that mini assessment, it will inform our ability to go into this accelerated repair program.

132
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:48,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we have clarity on that, then we can circle back around to the sort of like regular routine recommissioning projects into the future.

133
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:52,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would get us sort of on track.

134
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:53,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

135
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions about that?

136
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:24,996
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to give us the price, so once I get that, I will fill that in.

137
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:35,361
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think one thing we may want to do is identify this as a thing that we are recommending that we take up urgently.

138
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:43,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the project status, there may be some things where we say, we're recommending that we do this in FY25.

139
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can have that discussion with the committee and make sure that they agree with us.

140
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you all think about that.

141
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:01,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good to me.

142
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:09,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming.

143
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And are those, do you know, are those typically.

144
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:33,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Funded at the full cost, is it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?

145
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's usually a portion.

146
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:39,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't think it's full funding, but it is a piece of it.

147
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then.

148
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:51,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The other idea that I had is that we.

149
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point talk about with the OPM this idea of a district wide electrification enablement assessment and where that might fit and whether that is in the scope of their work.

150
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:13,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not do that yesterday because we had terrible full plate, but I don't.

151
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:20,086
[SPEAKER_03]: think we necessarily need to recommend that we proceed with that in FY 25.

152
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: But that could be something that we circle back to with the OPM who obviously is getting to know our buildings intimately and would be in probably a decent position to be able to do that.

153
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:39,655
[SPEAKER_12]: This was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with

154
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:44,530
[SPEAKER_12]: similar efforts, parallel efforts in other city buildings?

155
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.

156
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:51,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia?

157
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, good evening.

158
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, there will be.

159
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:04,888
[SPEAKER_05]: We are applying, we're basically doing the certification to be a particular

160
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:09,163
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of green communities, a green communities leadership program.

161
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:16,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And through that program, there's going to be technical assistance to help with some of this evaluation of buildings.

162
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:26,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always include our school buildings in that so that that would be in what we say we own for something like that.

163
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:34,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Brenda Pike in my office is working through that process and is keeping an eye out for those timelines and she

164
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't anticipating that question this evening, but I could easily get her to give you guys some information on that so that we could look at the technical assistance, because there's a lot of incentives from the state to move forward with electrification.

165
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:59,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So the whole make a plan, figure it out, and then help with the actual doing is stuff they're looking to do.

166
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're putting ourselves into that program.

167
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would love to that timeline.

168
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:05,610
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fantastic.

169
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:11,694
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?

170
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll shoot her a note asking her if she could put something together.

171
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:22,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I suspected if she was sitting here right now, she could have just given it to you off the top of her head.

172
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't.

173
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have good staff.

174
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:27,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

175
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

176
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:45,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other question is around, let me just move this down here.

177
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of these other projects that we are suggesting,

178
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:07,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That we are recommending like, proceeding with an F. Y.

179
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:07,577
25.

180
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:12,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And we last last time we met, we talked about.

181
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,322
[SPEAKER_03]: The 5 pump control in the McGlynn.

182
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:27,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The failed flashing behind the Brook facade, the brick facade and the freight motor elevator is being like, and the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation being.

183
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:42,263
[SPEAKER_03]: urgent types of projects that we should consider recommending that the school committee look for funding for?

184
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:48,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you all have any thoughts about that in terms of which ones we should be recommending.

185
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:57,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many years we've been talking about bike racks.

186
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of tired of talking about bike racks.

187
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:08,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, it's not a lot compared to a lot of the other things.

188
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:11,143
[SPEAKER_10]: It still surprises me how much bike racks will cost us.

189
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Christiane, did we lose you?

190
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,362
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I apologize.

191
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a baby in the background, so I do apologize for that as well.

192
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:39,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not apologize for the baby, but she's a little distraught.

193
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,487
[SPEAKER_09]: The bike racks are in the process of being ordered.

194
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:56,176
[SPEAKER_09]: We received $20,000 from Community Preservation to install modern up-to-date bike racks and bike repair stations for the McGlynn, Andrews, and the high school.

195
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are in the process of being ordered.

196
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprisingly, there are delays in that supply chain.

197
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I also, I apologize, can you hear me?

198
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but so there's two pieces.

199
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:16,700
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one that is above the line and it says it's grant funded by the CPC.

200
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:21,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one that's below the line that's for Brooks, Mr. Tuck and Roberts.

201
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the one Paul is referring to.

202
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:24,546
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're.

203
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:38,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, I mean, we could definitely do that or wait until the next round of CPC funding in the summertime to request of that and demonstrate the project that's completed.

204
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,898
[SPEAKER_09]: or just take it out of the local capital budget?

205
00:23:48,780 --> 00:24:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: If the CPC has been amenable to that project, and we think that that's a good thing to at least try to leverage the CPC funding for, maybe that's what we recommend to the school committee.

206
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:08,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions, thoughts, Erica?

207
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:10,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I agree.

208
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:13,475
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, cool.

209
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I also remember Graham.

210
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:26,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I also it appears I updated the wrong capital planning spreadsheet with numbers for McGlynn and Andrews parking.

211
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in the neighborhood of $1.3 million to do.

212
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:31,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Granite curbs is $125 per linear foot.

213
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,358
[SPEAKER_09]: comes out to about $600,000.

214
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:50,163
[SPEAKER_09]: The pavement is about $400,000 to do the bus loops and the parking lots at those two schools.

215
00:24:51,164 --> 00:25:01,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in speaking to the city engineer, Owen Wartella, he suggested because of the price fluctuations in asphalt to do a 30% contingency, which is $300,000.

216
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:03,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be $1.3 million on that.

217
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:13,236
[SPEAKER_09]: The the re the plaza, the ADA compliance of that.

218
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:20,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe I forwarded it this email on on October 22nd, but that is a ballpark.

219
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:22,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, it's it's 1 of those things.

220
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:24,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Another chicken and an egg.

221
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know it until you're necessarily into it.

222
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:37,422
[SPEAKER_09]: in the neighborhood of $300,000 to $600,000 to fix that plaza, the entry plazas for the McGlynn and the Andrews.

223
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:42,367
[SPEAKER_09]: The drainage at the Brooks to do the curbing is about $7,500.

224
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,428
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also two, there are two

225
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:53,796
[SPEAKER_09]: French drains that, number one, seem a bit undersized.

226
00:25:54,597 --> 00:26:03,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And number two, and once again, I apologize, definitely need to be cleaned out, but they seem undersized for the water that they might be required to handle.

227
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would probably be in the neighborhood of an additional $15,000 for 22,500 in that ballpark.

228
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will go on mute and I'm here if you need me.

229
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just ask you a question about that one?

230
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:27,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that assuming DPW has the capacity to do the work or that somebody else is doing it?

231
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:29,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be somebody else doing it.

232
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:36,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I think DPW has a lot on their plate.

233
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:41,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we want to get the project done, we may have to get the project done.

234
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:46,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the front plaza, we had

235
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere between 300,000 and 550,000 between design and construction, is that correct?

236
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:00,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

237
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:04,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the higher number came in at 600.

238
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:12,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

239
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:16,164
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC?

240
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we get an answer on that?

241
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:25,188
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.

242
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,950
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no real connection.

243
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

244
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:48,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt, while we have you here, the issue is both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, the front plaza is settling and causing an ADA issue.

245
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there

246
00:27:53,878 --> 00:28:07,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Other funding sources besides just city cash that we should be considering here from a grant perspective or particularly because of the ADA aspects of that.

247
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen any.

248
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:18,724
[SPEAKER_05]: good funding sources for ADA compliance.

249
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: There tends to be an attitude of it's your responsibility, and so you should fund it.

250
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,712
[SPEAKER_05]: When we've seen things, they've been so small that, you know, a couple of thousand dollars here or there.

251
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:31,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

252
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The paperwork usually.

253
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:35,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

254
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:40,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And former member McLaughlin had mentioned

255
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:47,795
[SPEAKER_12]: a grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for.

256
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:52,458
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it.

257
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:54,819
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's something that we can revisit.

258
00:28:54,859 --> 00:29:00,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje.

259
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing, are you there?

260
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:08,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

261
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you quickly restate the question?

262
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:15,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned.

263
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:21,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we couldn't get the application in one year and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.

264
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:23,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering so.

265
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:29,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so director Nuala Jay worked on that this past year.

266
00:29:30,023 --> 00:29:37,627
[SPEAKER_09]: She encountered the same frustrations and issues with that online submission.

267
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:53,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, uh, like, uh, frustration to the point of not being able, uh, in similar to what we went through, um, of, um, it, it is the most archaic submission system I've ever seen.

268
00:29:54,254 --> 00:30:03,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, it has caused, uh, you know, we're going to have to work at it this year, but to figure it out, but that was taken on the city side this year.

269
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:10,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was taken on the city side, but ultimately not successful.

270
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:11,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

271
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:12,418
[SPEAKER_03]: In submission.

272
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:13,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

273
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you say we're gonna have to do it again this year, who do you mean is going to do it?

274
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:30,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're gonna have to figure out, we're gonna reach out to the state partners on it to try to figure out how the best way to actually submit this is because we have proven in two years unsuccessful.

275
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:32,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's we?

276
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:37,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to submit it twice in.

277
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but who's reaching out, I think, is my question.

278
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this something Francis is doing?

279
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something we are doing?

280
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, who's doing this reaching out part?

281
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:54,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll either be myself or Francis to do that work, to reach out to them and to figure it out.

282
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:07,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's fall crashing my house.

283
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure what it is.

284
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:16,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Then let me ask a clarifying question about these items.

285
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:21,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we out of compliance or are we in danger of being out of compliance?

286
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that

287
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:43,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now the buildings are not accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act for entry into the buildings by the main entrance and the doors affected.

288
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:55,155
[SPEAKER_12]: And are the fixes that are costed out here, I know the range is big,

289
00:31:56,563 --> 00:32:04,606
[SPEAKER_12]: will those have sufficient longevity that we won't need to be looking at this again in the immediate future?

290
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:07,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this a bad fix or is this a real fix?

291
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:21,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in speaking to the people at Weston and Sampson, they're gonna, if I remember correctly from the October 22nd email, they think that this will be a permanent fix because they think that the settling has occurred.

292
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:28,660
[SPEAKER_09]: But once they get into it, they'll be able to test and to see, to make sure.

293
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,521
[SPEAKER_09]: But the idea is that we're not doing this once every 20 years.

294
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:39,883
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea is to fix it, to maintain it, and to make sure that it is still accessible.

295
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:46,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Cushing, when you say we need to work with the state partners, who are they?

296
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:51,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm forgetting the exact name of the office that runs that grant.

297
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:56,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a Commonwealth office, or is it a private?

298
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is a common.

299
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,071
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a Commonwealth office.

300
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it would be helpful to reach out to our state delegation to ask for their assistance?

301
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:17,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Alicia, do you have thoughts on how to navigate this?

302
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we haven't given you really any information.

303
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:35,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to get a clarifying if you don't mind was is the problem that you're talking about is the system combines and is it literally the application or is the problem getting the right materials together to qualify?

304
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:44,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, we've had all the materials to go to qualify we've had all the appropriate plans requirements, all those types of things.

305
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:51,927
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a form that times out in an exceptionally short amount of time it does not save.

306
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:59,111
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, on numerous occasions, entered and re-entered and tried.

307
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:21,383
[SPEAKER_09]: We were told, not this past year, but the previous year when I did the submissions, that, you know, they would accept it, that it was in, but then, you know, I don't think we qualified, but it is the tool itself to go online and to enter it is an exceedingly archaic submission tool

308
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,703
[SPEAKER_09]: to work with.

309
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:31,868
[SPEAKER_09]: On the school side, we've moved to a system called GEMS.

310
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:42,379
[SPEAKER_09]: It is unlike any other grant submission software or program that I've seen in having done this now with both state and federal agencies.

311
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:59,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I ask because we've run into technical problems with grant applications in the past, and usually when we reach out to the granting agency, they are aware that their system is a problem and they have a workaround.

312
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:06,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's surprising to me that they haven't just said to you, just email us the forms.

313
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that has not been said, and there have been no workarounds offered.

314
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:12,300
[SPEAKER_09]: At least when I did it.

315
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:19,920
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can interject, it's the Massachusetts Office on Disability that is providing these grants.

316
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:22,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

317
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:25,226
[SPEAKER_02]: The Disability Commission?

318
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:31,154
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the Massachusetts Office on Disability, unless they've renamed themselves.

319
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:47,709
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have renamed themselves to this, but I know I spoke this week to Frances about this, and she said she submitted it, and then the application disappeared from the system.

320
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't understand why.

321
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,492
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a problematic system.

322
00:35:55,822 --> 00:36:01,886
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you actually, when you start the application, you have to complete it.

323
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:11,032
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing it, there's no way on their site to save it and then come back later if they ask you for information.

324
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:18,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very cumbersome and doesn't operate like any other website that's out there.

325
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:36,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And just so the subcommittee is aware, 18 months ago or so, or 13 months ago, whenever it was that I was working on it, we were looking to do curb cuts at Medford High School.

326
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:41,958
[SPEAKER_09]: We were looking to do wayfinding signs within Medford High School and in other places in the district.

327
00:36:42,838 --> 00:36:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: for accessibility as those were the two primary fixes that we were looking for.

328
00:36:49,302 --> 00:37:02,650
[SPEAKER_09]: We were looking for 19 curb cuts, I believe it was, at Medford High School, as well as to do the parking improvements for ADA accessible spaces.

329
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:11,215
[SPEAKER_09]: That work has been completed on the local budget, but we did that work at the end of last year, April of last year.

330
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:41,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to suggest that our recommendation to the committee is that we successfully, for the first time, submit this grant and that meanwhile, I'm going to send a note to our state delegation asking for their assistance in how they can help get this moving in the right direction.

331
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:45,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Rapunzel?

332
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:57,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, at the time when we encountered all of the technical difficulties, I was in communication with Representative Sean Garberly.

333
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,426
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was aware.

334
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:04,229
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point in time, everything had been lost.

335
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,631
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it was in there and it got lost.

336
00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:11,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was aware of all of the technical difficulty that we had.

337
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:15,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So he may be a good starting point when we

338
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,784
[SPEAKER_01]: stop the process again to keep him looped in from the beginning.

339
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

340
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Um I will send a note to reach out to him if the if this group and then ultimately the committee is agreeable that the recommendation is we should submit but grant the share.

341
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:42,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should I also think we can't be dependent on this grant coming through to get in compliance for accessibility.

342
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,671
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this has to be a priority.

343
00:38:45,612 --> 00:38:46,633
[SPEAKER_12]: With or without the grant.

344
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see if we can't move that along.

345
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:01,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Grant wise, and if not, that may need to be a request.

346
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:16,566
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you asked what else here in the shaded portion is a priority.

347
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:20,348
[SPEAKER_12]: When you say the flashing failed, the word failed is always worrisome.

348
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:23,550
[SPEAKER_12]: What does that mean for those of us who are not stonemasons?

349
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:29,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It means it rains inside the kindergarten when there's a driving sideways wind.

350
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:29,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

351
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:33,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're fixing that for the roofs on other buildings.

352
00:39:33,657 --> 00:39:37,540
[SPEAKER_12]: That also feels like a... Mend.

353
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:44,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and so my question, I am sorry to interrupt my question on this is all right.

354
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:50,848
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we could move this project forward now with, you know, with.

355
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:58,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Funds that are becoming available, or, you know, like, I mean, this is a long standing problem, so I'd like to get it fixed.

356
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:07,511
[SPEAKER_09]: But I could also see a realm where it's rolled into the roof replacement slash roof repair restoration.

357
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,653
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also don't necessarily want to wait on it.

358
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:16,338
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the flashing on the brick related to the roof?

359
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:26,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all where that section of the building connects back in.

360
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:38,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, while that work is done on the roof and building envelope, I would make sure that it is written into the scope that that has to be addressed.

361
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,414
[SPEAKER_03]: The flashing issue behind the brick is not at the roof line, is it?

362
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to be.

363
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:57,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to be.

364
00:40:57,946 --> 00:41:02,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, have you all talked about that piece of that at all?

365
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:10,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should we ask Tom about potential integration of that into the bigger project?

366
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know there are some flashing issues on the roof.

367
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:22,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I hadn't heard that there was a problem down the side, like behind the bricks and all.

368
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:36,511
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is in fact that the water's getting in at the roof level, that makes sense as opposed to, you know, coming really straight through the wall, which sounds odd to me, but I don't know, it could be.

369
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:39,833
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get a full quote

370
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,553
[SPEAKER_05]: an assessment for the roof.

371
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:52,540
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that if we mentioned this problem to the people looking at that, they could tell us if they believe that it's a problem.

372
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:53,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

373
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:54,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We already know that.

374
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,861
[SPEAKER_09]: We did a water infiltration test.

375
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:04,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we did a water infiltration test that I've circulated around.

376
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:08,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, I apologize that I didn't circulate it to you.

377
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's, again, once again, the topic of the night, chicken and egg.

378
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:25,692
[SPEAKER_09]: In order to repair this and build a scope of work, we needed a scope of work to build the scope of work in another circular issue.

379
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:38,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if it's in any way related to the flashing on the roof, then it clearly makes sense that it should be at least.

380
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:49,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I wonder, I don't know, maybe Peter knows, is there work that needs to be done literally on the bricks and behind the bricks, or if it's just roof-level work?

381
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:55,431
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's roof-level work, then do it with rebuilding the roof or even the roof wall connection.

382
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:09,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It appears that it may be the roof wall connection as well as removing three courses of bricks along a section of the rear of the building.

383
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Will that come out in this mini recommissioning assessment that we've just split off?

384
00:43:18,122 --> 00:43:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we already have done that for this problem.

385
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:24,945
[SPEAKER_03]: We just haven't funded it to actually fix it.

386
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:30,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's a known problem that requires funding.

387
00:43:30,947 --> 00:43:31,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about $80,000.

388
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:39,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I spoke with a community member who has extensive construction background about this because he was surprised at how much it would cost.

389
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:45,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we looked at what was in the high level assessment.

390
00:43:45,283 --> 00:43:46,325
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, oh, well.

391
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:49,569
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems actually appropriate.

392
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:57,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it would generally speaking be about $20,000 in construction management costs to manage the project and make sure it's done right.

393
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And then $80,000 in actual equipment time materials.

394
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:15,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so one thing is that I see is that if we already have people mobilized to be doing work on the building and to oversee construction, etc.

395
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's some cost savings, right?

396
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there is this idea of mobilization, getting the contractors and stuff out to the site.

397
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:28,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every time you do that, that's an added cost because of all their overheads.

398
00:44:29,317 --> 00:44:34,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it is an option to do it together, then there is some

399
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:44,199
[SPEAKER_05]: economies of savings, there is, you know, it's certainly that's, and I do question, can you actually fix it without doing the roof?

400
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:54,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, are those two integrally, like, if you were to fix the area behind the bricks, but not the part on the roof, which is the flashing?

401
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:58,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that defeat the purpose and the problem reoccurs?

402
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually need to do them together.

403
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:18,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And then another idea would be to just replace this section of the roof now and, you know, the course of bricks and all that.

404
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:25,903
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know what that would do to increase that $100,000 cost when adding in the roof or roof reconditioning.

405
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:35,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but this is one we definitely get called on every time it happens, because it's not like a little water streaming down.

406
00:45:35,906 --> 00:45:36,586
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot.

407
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,040
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still talking about the McGlynn, right?

408
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

409
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:52,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any sense to do part of the roof and not the whole, like if you're going to do the whole roof within the next six months.

410
00:45:54,197 --> 00:46:00,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Director Hunt, this roof is a lower portion of the building that juts out.

411
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:06,200
[SPEAKER_09]: The classrooms in that area jut out probably about 30 or 40 feet.

412
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they have their own separate lower roof.

413
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,022
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a one-story roof.

414
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:22,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would normally agree with you 100%, however, it is almost a separate roof from the main larger roof.

415
00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:23,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Not almost, it is.

416
00:46:24,936 --> 00:46:31,519
[SPEAKER_05]: My apologies, I'm looking at the overview and I never realized that that existed as a separate little roof.

417
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:35,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, it's a fun architectural thing that I wish didn't exist.

418
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:40,564
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, member Russo is 100% right.

419
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we get called on it.

420
00:46:42,445 --> 00:46:48,727
[SPEAKER_09]: It is definitely something that was brought to the committee's attention, I believe, in November or October of 2021.

421
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:59,312
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another thing I was going to add, but hopefully it'll come back to me.

422
00:46:59,332 --> 00:47:00,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

423
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I can get a note to the, we can get a note to the about.

424
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:19,617
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece, so that there's at least an opportunity to talk about whether inclusion in the project is an economy of scale or not.

425
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But also.

426
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk to them about.

427
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:36,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether there's an opportunity to advance this work ahead of the rest of the work, because it is its own separate little roof.

428
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:39,895
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not the same as, like.

429
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:49,099
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger roof project, so we can get that information and integrate it before the special meeting that we have.

430
00:47:50,501 --> 00:48:01,099
[SPEAKER_09]: And member Graham I do have one other number that I I think I forgot to mention earlier are our roofing inspector conducted an infrared scan of the roof.

431
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:16,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe, and Director Riggi can jump onto this, the initial thoughts on a visual inspection of the roof a few weeks ago, the thought was that it was about maybe 10% wet, that that could be fixed.

432
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:18,798
[SPEAKER_09]: The infrared scan revealed 20 to 25%.

433
00:48:22,763 --> 00:48:26,486
[SPEAKER_09]: water saturation, water infiltration, the right terms.

434
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:35,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not doing right now, but he then changed his recommendation and said that it should either be a reconditioning

435
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:46,584
[SPEAKER_09]: which would be similar to what was done at the Andrews, or a roof replacement which would increase the insulation.

436
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:54,807
[SPEAKER_09]: The number I'm recollecting on the roof reconditioning slash restoration is $1.4 to $1.6 million.

437
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:10,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the roof replacement, which includes all new insulation, but both products are guaranteed or are listed at a 20 year roof.

438
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:16,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, the white night slash film that goes over the roof.

439
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:20,531
[SPEAKER_09]: similar to the Andrews is 20 years, a new roof, 20 years.

440
00:49:21,331 --> 00:49:28,999
[SPEAKER_09]: The price on the second option for full roof replacement with the added insulation is at $2.8 to $3.0 million.

441
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:29,059
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

442
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

443
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:48,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you did you also get a price for the dump the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation.

444
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:56,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So the door sweeps are are nowhere near as expensive as we thought that can be covered in the local budget and will be the dumpsters.

445
00:49:56,596 --> 00:50:04,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm awaiting emails back from waste management on what the cost would be to move from.

446
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:10,242
[SPEAKER_09]: We currently own our dumpsters and own our equipment to move towards a lease option on those.

447
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:12,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not have that number at this time.

448
00:50:15,836 --> 00:50:20,039
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get those numbers, can you let me know and I'll update this?

449
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

450
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:24,363
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

451
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:30,908
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we have some items here.

452
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:35,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The network closet mini splits for Ms.

453
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:37,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck Roberts in Medford High.

454
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:50,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing, you were in the process of parsing out that estimate of McGlynn-Andrews versus everybody else, is that right?

455
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:51,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

456
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:55,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not finished that and we'll get that to you as well.

457
00:50:55,705 --> 00:51:05,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you help us understand how urgent is this need at Brooks-Roberts, Mississauga, Medford High?

458
00:51:06,622 --> 00:51:09,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's beyond urgent.

459
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,673
[SPEAKER_09]: The systems have essentially, the systems have failed.

460
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:23,204
[SPEAKER_09]: They're 20 years old, many of them original to the building, and they have either all failed or in their last stages of failing.

461
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:32,573
[SPEAKER_09]: As member Rousseau can definitely back me up and attest, network infrastructure requires climate controlled.

462
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:37,999
[SPEAKER_09]: They generate a tremendous amount of heat, and especially in those small closets,

463
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:44,348
[SPEAKER_09]: they need to be climate controlled or quite literally they will cook themselves as we are seeing.

464
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:50,718
[SPEAKER_09]: One other project that I'm working on is rebuilding our network infrastructure.

465
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:53,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a significant amount of E-rate funding available to us.

466
00:51:55,473 --> 00:52:00,158
[SPEAKER_09]: that we have not accessed, the lion's share of it.

467
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:09,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But in order to access those funds, we would have to put up in the neighborhood of $150,000 to $200,000 because basically the government does a 60% match.

468
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:19,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're right now building a proposal with our E-rate consultant on this.

469
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:26,534
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the E-rate money does not, it only supports networking and direct network infrastructure.

470
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:34,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not consider these mini splits and cooling systems as part of that infrastructure.

471
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It is ancillary to, although really required.

472
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:42,283
[SPEAKER_09]: So those systems have failed.

473
00:52:42,303 --> 00:52:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a report.

474
00:52:44,732 --> 00:53:13,288
[SPEAKER_09]: on that that i can share with everybody from royal air met with them and went through every single system in the district and what would be needed to replace them and then b2q has done the designing of it which you know it's basically figuring out the system of the mini splits to put in there are a few various options but they are

475
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:21,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, the refrigeration and HVAC world seems to be going through a lot of shifts with various refrigerants.

476
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:28,944
[SPEAKER_09]: The equipment we'd need to replace them really would not be available until Q2 of next year.

477
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:33,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So that April, May, June timeframe.

478
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you

479
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:47,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you suggesting that we need to prioritize this in FY 25 or that we should prioritize this for FY 26?

480
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:55,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it needs to be prioritized across the district as an urgent need.

481
00:53:56,452 --> 00:54:04,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be unwise to replace the network infrastructure in an environment that is simply going to cause it to fail.

482
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're quickly 25.

483
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So 25 does that recommend proceeding in FY 25 is the recommendation.

484
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:15,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

485
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:15,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

486
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:16,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

487
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:16,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

488
00:54:16,866 --> 00:54:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

489
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:31,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we have, um, the fire pump control at the McGlynn elementary, uh, that can be removed that has been replaced last night.

490
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:33,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say it's complete then.

491
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

492
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

493
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we even have a section for complete?

494
00:54:47,887 --> 00:54:48,808
[SPEAKER_10]: First time for everything.

495
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

496
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We put it at the top.

497
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing in a new tab is what that is.

498
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, project status complete instead of in progress.

499
00:55:10,462 --> 00:55:10,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

500
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:13,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, okay.

501
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:16,664
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the freight elevator motor at Medford High.

502
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:21,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, just got an update on this today.

503
00:55:21,406 --> 00:55:23,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Director Reggie was with me when we got it.

504
00:55:24,347 --> 00:55:27,748
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to figure out, um, the actual pricing

505
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:45,836
[SPEAKER_09]: But it has been recommended that when this motor is either rebuilt or replaced, that the controls for the freight elevator already should be replaced because they will need to be replaced shortly thereafter if we don't do it at the same time.

506
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:54,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to get some clarity on pricing to make sure that it was fully inclusive of everything I need.

507
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,127
[SPEAKER_09]: But Paul, if you have anything to add on that, please feel free.

508
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:06,745
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Dr. Cushing, you're exactly right.

509
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:31,398
[SPEAKER_00]: The elevator company that I used, when they looked at it, said based on the age of not only the motor, but the controls for the motor, that it would not be in our best interest to do one without the other, because then we're guaranteed that they would work properly going forward.

510
00:56:34,611 --> 00:56:40,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And is this member and member so a recommendation for 25.

511
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:47,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I think so.

512
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,514
[SPEAKER_12]: This isn't on the verge of failing or this isn't already failed.

513
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:55,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It failed due to the flood last year.

514
00:56:55,316 --> 00:56:59,079
[SPEAKER_00]: The motor is not even in the building anymore.

515
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,561
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with one of the elevator companies.

516
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:05,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it has failed.

517
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:07,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

518
00:57:12,236 --> 00:57:22,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And the door sweeps and dumpster mitigation, are we putting that in a recommend proceeding in 25 category?

519
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:30,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if I can offer a suggestion, I think both of those should be.

520
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:38,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get not just cost, but a real understanding of the dumpsters.

521
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:45,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe, yep, so I would like to make sure I get a comprehensive understanding of the dumpsters and what needs to be done.

522
00:57:47,327 --> 00:57:52,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you remind us what the dumpster situation is?

523
00:57:56,091 --> 00:58:01,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they're, they're essentially they appear to be, they've been all the dumpsters have been previously repaired.

524
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,334
[SPEAKER_09]: They've rusted previously.

525
00:58:04,834 --> 00:58:06,534
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been sent back to waste management.

526
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:15,657
[SPEAKER_09]: We've paid for repairs and what director McLaughlin has told me is that, you know, there's, there's no more opportunity to really repair them.

527
00:58:17,346 --> 00:58:20,668
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't see why we would want to purchase dumpsters again.

528
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:24,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Seems like if we have a problem with a dumpster in the future, we're leasing it.

529
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:34,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Waste management, please come take the dumpster and replace it with something that's going to be preventing rodents and leaking trash and things like that.

530
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:44,306
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that we've talked a little bit with waste management about as part of our new waste program for the city.

531
00:58:44,446 --> 00:58:47,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have some pricing with them.

532
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:49,089
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a direct contact with them.

533
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:55,532
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be clear, what you have at all the schools are compactors with dumpsters in them that have rotted out.

534
00:58:58,294 --> 00:59:17,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to have a consultant, a waste consultant, just come and take a look because it might be that the, and we have somebody who I believe who could do that for free, who might, it might make sense to have regular dumpsters that are emptied weekly might be cheaper than replacing the compactors.

535
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:26,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little unclear to me if you can just, like if you rent a dumpster from waste management that you put inside the compactor that actually

536
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: is possible.

537
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:37,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we may be looking at replacing the compactors with dumpsters emptied weekly, and that might be cheaper than purchasing new compactors.

538
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something that, let me hook you up if Director Cushing is the right, sorry,

539
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: is the right contact to get you in touch with the people at waste management who we've been talking with a little bit about this.

540
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:01,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It fell off my radar, but we were thinking about it about a year ago.

541
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and that's, I emailed those individuals that we were speaking with a year ago.

542
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just awaiting a reply.

543
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:17,167
[SPEAKER_12]: I was gonna ask what the timeline for the assessment is, but it sounds like we don't have that number either.

544
01:00:19,568 --> 01:00:36,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I also don't know if that would necessarily need to fall under capital if it becomes part of the annual, if we're not making a large purchase of dumpsters and instead we're moving to a lease option, whatever it may be, whatever it may be, but.

545
01:00:37,939 --> 01:00:41,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what I wrote was recommend proceeding in FY 26 potential

546
01:00:48,257 --> 01:00:53,919
[SPEAKER_03]: From the operating budget, because I think realistically.

547
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:58,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the end of the year and 25 ends in June.

548
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going to boil the ocean between now and then, like.

549
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Realistically, we're not going to get to doing a replacement of something like this until summer, which is already FY26.

550
01:01:11,828 --> 01:01:22,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the goal is between now and then, we figure out what the right go-forward plan is.

551
01:01:22,332 --> 01:01:29,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether that's capital or budget or whatever, I think what I'm hearing is it's FY26.

552
01:01:30,175 --> 01:01:31,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys agree with that?

553
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:32,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

554
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:33,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

555
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:33,916
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

556
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

557
01:01:37,064 --> 01:01:41,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And then drainage at the fields for the Brooks.

558
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:43,851
[SPEAKER_06]: This year.

559
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:47,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

560
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:51,578
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very long time coming.

561
01:01:51,618 --> 01:01:53,680
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids are going to graduate before it gets fixed.

562
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:58,584
[SPEAKER_12]: And it happened in elementary school when we started this conversation.

563
01:01:58,604 --> 01:02:01,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have what we need to do that?

564
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:04,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't get that.

565
01:02:05,197 --> 01:02:07,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it sounds like we have a quote.

566
01:02:09,379 --> 01:02:10,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a funding issue.

567
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And is it going to affect?

568
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:14,643
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how long it takes.

569
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:14,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it?

570
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Are people using the field now?

571
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:21,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so is.

572
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:24,449
[SPEAKER_12]: How long does it take?

573
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:31,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when the Roberts playground drainage issue was happening and kids couldn't play on the playground and I won't mention that.

574
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:34,518
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be able to.

575
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:37,139
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't under the field, it's.

576
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:44,462
[SPEAKER_03]: On the hill, OK, that's like essentially dumps run off onto the field.

577
01:02:46,143 --> 01:02:50,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's because the the hill is not properly drained, so the field.

578
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't be impacted by the work.

579
01:02:52,925 --> 01:02:53,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't think.

580
01:02:54,406 --> 01:02:58,767
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so this isn't going to disrupt essential recess activities.

581
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:02,409
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think so, right, Peter?

582
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:07,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if anything, maybe a few days, but not nowhere near.

583
01:03:07,523 --> 01:03:10,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Any type of a lengthy disruption.

584
01:03:10,344 --> 01:03:13,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm in then.

585
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:13,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

586
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:17,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, got it.

587
01:03:18,147 --> 01:03:23,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these items, the other things on the list here.

588
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:30,667
[SPEAKER_03]: are all this whole group, I think I would suggest that we leave them as not committed.

589
01:03:30,747 --> 01:03:41,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are things we have to plan for in the future, but the mini assessment is going to tell us what that means.

590
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:53,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So many to support taking any like urgent immediate action in terms of funding, but we should leave them on the plan because they are upcoming needs that we know we're going to need to think about.

591
01:03:55,716 --> 01:03:59,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the other remaining items on the list.

592
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: With district wide security upgrades.

593
01:04:04,324 --> 01:04:08,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have playground renovations also that are.

594
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:10,750
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess.

595
01:04:12,198 --> 01:04:20,850
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like urgent things are falling apart, but they were also noted in our last meeting as things we could possibly talk to the CPC about.

596
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:25,497
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing is the parking lot paving.

597
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:29,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So can I answer directly on the playground?

598
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:30,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

599
01:04:30,573 --> 01:04:31,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, sir.

600
01:04:31,574 --> 01:04:33,295
[SPEAKER_09]: But happy member.

601
01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:33,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So go ahead.

602
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:34,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

603
01:04:34,215 --> 01:04:34,756
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.

604
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:35,296
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no.

605
01:04:35,336 --> 01:04:39,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to talk about the district wide security upgrades.

606
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there can we parse that a bit?

607
01:04:43,502 --> 01:04:46,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's a portion of that that I think we should do.

608
01:04:48,326 --> 01:04:53,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Sooner or consider doing sooner, and that's the.

609
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:01,345
[SPEAKER_10]: the key lists, the IDs to get in, the FOBs or whatever they're called, Peter, you have to fill me in on that.

610
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:23,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Key FOBs, and I actually have reached out to the first of the three companies I've worked with previously to update the quotes on that, but to also include, well, our telephone project has been great in all honesty, and I would consider it very successful deployment.

611
01:05:24,367 --> 01:05:28,211
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the problems that we're facing is with the door phones.

612
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:43,104
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you walk up to any of the five schools, all right, not the high school, but any of the other five schools and not the Curtis Tufts, what you're actually pushing is a telephone that is set to ring someplace.

613
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:45,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are 20 years old.

614
01:05:45,787 --> 01:05:49,330
[SPEAKER_09]: And just we didn't have the money to put in the scope to do that work.

615
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're having issues, some of them, not all of them.

616
01:05:54,984 --> 01:06:07,536
[SPEAKER_09]: But what would be nice is to also have an integrated doorbell that has a camera so that security or secretarial or building leadership can see who is at the door clearly.

617
01:06:08,573 --> 01:06:20,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I've had them price out, um, putting those in at, um, the elementary schools, which is two because they basically all have two entrances, um, and then the loading dock.

618
01:06:21,003 --> 01:06:27,128
[SPEAKER_09]: So three at those schools, um, two at the Andrews and I think

619
01:06:28,132 --> 01:06:29,812
[SPEAKER_09]: either two or three at the McGlynn.

620
01:06:30,012 --> 01:06:39,495
[SPEAKER_09]: The McGlynn, while a bigger campus, has an interesting setup that there's really no need for one on the back door if we go to Key Fobs, but one on the main door and one on the loading dock.

621
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:42,695
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe we just went with two there for the quote.

622
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,476
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do have those quotes updated.

623
01:06:44,496 --> 01:06:52,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe that that, I would highly recommend it as work that we should do.

624
01:06:54,342 --> 01:07:04,149
[SPEAKER_09]: because it gives you a clear and accurate record of who's entering your building when and provides you with really enhanced security.

625
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:15,158
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I will say that I realize my limitations and I would recommend that as part of this we either use the house doctors of

626
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:26,410
[SPEAKER_09]: that the city has set up for architectural firms or some other security management firm to manage the deployment so that it's successful.

627
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:34,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a number on that if you so desire.

628
01:07:40,628 --> 01:07:46,252
[SPEAKER_03]: So number so are there three parts, keyless locks, intercom.

629
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:48,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And the doors.

630
01:07:50,635 --> 01:07:51,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Peter?

631
01:07:52,617 --> 01:07:54,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, one of them was very expensive.

632
01:07:54,979 --> 01:08:03,125
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's is that the doors that are the well, no, it's it's it's the camera is the camera upgrading the cameras across the district.

633
01:08:03,752 --> 01:08:05,693
[SPEAKER_09]: was going to be the more expensive.

634
01:08:06,894 --> 01:08:29,387
[SPEAKER_09]: To do key fob access at the schools, which is between three and five, between three and five doors at each school, a few more at Medford High School, and the integrated, like the cameras on the doorbells is, you know,

635
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:31,754
[SPEAKER_09]: approximately $260,000.

636
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:41,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it's $260,000 for three to five doors and employee fobs, or it's $260,000 for all of that plus the camera intercom buzzer system.

637
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that at every school, by the way, just so you know, at every school, I apologize, I'm breaking up.

638
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: At every school, three to five doors, a few more at Medford High School, key fobs and the integrated camera doorbells at the schools, yes, 260.

639
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:12,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Total for all of them.

640
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:13,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Total for all of them.

641
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make sure I have this right.

642
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:22,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyless locks and employee bobs, three to five doors at most schools.

643
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:28,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the camera intercom system.

644
01:09:33,563 --> 01:09:35,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Included in that for the neighborhood.

645
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:39,447
[SPEAKER_03]: For select entry points.

646
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:46,617
[SPEAKER_03]: including three at the Brooks, three at the Roberts, three at the Mistituck, three at the McGlynn, two at the Andrews.

647
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Two at the McGlynn, two at the McGlynn.

648
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:56,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, three at Andrews, two at McGlynn?

649
01:09:57,186 --> 01:10:06,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Two at Andrews, two at McGlynn, three at Brooks, Roberts, Mistituck, and three at Medford High School.

650
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Loading dock, main door, door 31.

651
01:10:20,568 --> 01:10:27,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And member Graham, if it were a new school, I would do more there, but I am trying to be responsible fiscally.

652
01:10:29,676 --> 01:10:29,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

653
01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:32,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of that is 260.

654
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:36,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, which is electrification of doors,

655
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:49,623
[SPEAKER_09]: network, wiring, cabling, hardware, and all on the same system that we have field tested with our vape sensors.

656
01:10:51,505 --> 01:10:54,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're starting to move towards an integrated approach.

657
01:10:56,027 --> 01:10:58,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is the remainder of the 1.9?

658
01:11:01,777 --> 01:11:14,222
[SPEAKER_09]: That is either upgrading or adding cameras so that essentially every square inch of the Medford Public Schools is covered.

659
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:20,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not gonna go into the details publicly right now, but so that every square inch is covered.

660
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:28,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And also that vape sensors are deployed in all middle school bathrooms.

661
01:11:30,362 --> 01:11:38,687
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as some added, I'll term them added security enhancements at points of entry.

662
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:44,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one, really 1.7.

663
01:11:45,611 --> 01:11:52,115
[SPEAKER_09]: In that, well, let's call that 1.9, the high first quote.

664
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:55,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get a quote in the neighborhood of 1.3, 1.4 for all that was just mentioned.

665
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:09,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that was in this before was network phone availability in Medford High classrooms.

666
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:12,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

667
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We can definitely.

668
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:17,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Where does that fall?

669
01:12:17,273 --> 01:12:25,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we can move forward with that in the coming months with existing resources and infrastructure.

670
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:36,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So that goes into in progress?

671
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:38,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say yes.

672
01:12:40,592 --> 01:12:44,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no capital dollars needed?

673
01:12:50,837 --> 01:12:54,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe we can do it with existing infrastructure and resources.

674
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

675
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:00,261
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

676
01:13:01,082 --> 01:13:02,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hold on.

677
01:13:02,322 --> 01:13:03,663
[SPEAKER_09]: When it's done, it'll be amazing.

678
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:10,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair, okay.

679
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:32,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But the district security updates, if I leave that at 1.7 and then the key lock, the locks and the fobs and the camera buzzer systems as a separate line item for 260, does that sound right?

680
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:34,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it does.

681
01:13:34,876 --> 01:13:41,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, though, I'd say the 1.7, you could pull that down more in the 1.4 range.

682
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:46,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to get those quotes updated, but.

683
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:50,440
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think more in the 1.4 range.

684
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: By separating out that 260 ish.

685
01:13:55,081 --> 01:13:56,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so.

686
01:13:57,741 --> 01:13:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, remember, so thank you.

687
01:14:00,422 --> 01:14:01,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So the.

688
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:10,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it is already just about December, but the, and I always have to remember July one is the new fiscal year.

689
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:11,775
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't really do anything in June.

690
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:14,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we do a lot, but.

691
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:25,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So do we want the Keyless Bob stuff to be next year or is this year, is it just too late for that?

692
01:14:26,727 --> 01:14:29,910
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think my recommendation would be that

693
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:55,780
[SPEAKER_09]: uh this might be a good use of available now i should say now available funding um but again um yeah i defer to the group but i i believe this is something we might be able to do this year i do want to say though um it's one of those things that i would need assistance with

694
01:14:56,548 --> 01:15:02,211
[SPEAKER_09]: recognizing my own limitations and the amount of projects that I'm currently managing.

695
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:06,352
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just need to look at that piece of the deployment.

696
01:15:08,854 --> 01:15:09,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

697
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:11,775
[SPEAKER_10]: It does seem like a good summer project.

698
01:15:12,035 --> 01:15:18,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I just from a spending money kind of question, I wasn't sure if I should do it sooner.

699
01:15:18,318 --> 01:15:23,400
[SPEAKER_09]: But well, and I think that's I think that's like I would agree it is a great summer project.

700
01:15:24,028 --> 01:15:40,677
[SPEAKER_09]: However, in order to spend down perhaps resources and get high value, I think this is a high value project that allows us to very visibly show security enhancements.

701
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:50,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I, I guess what I'm thinking about when I say recommend proceeding and 25.

702
01:15:51,932 --> 01:15:56,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what I am thinking about as we are talking is that.

703
01:15:58,298 --> 01:16:02,602
[SPEAKER_03]: In December, when we take a vote, the vote is really for.

704
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:14,735
[SPEAKER_03]: The administration to consider these projects as part of the budget for the supplemental budget request they're going to bring forward in January.

705
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:15,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, if.

706
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:31,735
[SPEAKER_03]: there is something that can't be funded that we said due in 25 and it can't be funded through the supplemental budget, then that has to go before the council for additional funding.

707
01:16:32,896 --> 01:16:46,283
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the first step is like this should give some clarity to our budget director to say these are the projects that we are thinking are very important and we want to see you weigh in on when you bring the supplemental budget forward.

708
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:47,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense to everybody?

709
01:16:49,123 --> 01:16:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense to me.

710
01:16:50,104 --> 01:16:55,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think that's a very high value project, the FOB stuff.

711
01:16:56,808 --> 01:16:58,829
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also going into negotiations.

712
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:06,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And frankly, I don't want to talk about keys in our negotiations.

713
01:17:07,575 --> 01:17:12,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that it would be good to just get this over with.

714
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:23,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, from a what's the supplemental going to look like, this can wait.

715
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:31,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if there ends up being room in the supplemental, then, you know, this number here is already too big, isn't it?

716
01:17:32,307 --> 01:17:32,808
Yeah.

717
01:17:33,508 --> 01:17:33,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

718
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:33,688
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

719
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:47,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the things that we still have as not committed are the district wide security updates for 1.5.

720
01:17:50,897 --> 01:17:52,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have those, like, in FY, 26, but that's.

721
01:17:58,182 --> 01:18:01,543
[SPEAKER_03]: saying anything more than that just yet about that.

722
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:05,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's a good conversation for the school committee.

723
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:10,606
[SPEAKER_03]: The other question I had was around playground renovation.

724
01:18:10,726 --> 01:18:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are mostly done with the playground renovation at the McGlynn.

725
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:20,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's stunning and spectacular and gorgeous.

726
01:18:23,171 --> 01:18:25,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a very long process.

727
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:31,963
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the design work to make it such a special project in the end.

728
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:41,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'm curious, like we sort of have on the radar that all of our playgrounds are going to need to be replaced at some point in time.

729
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:50,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a timing of like when we might seek CPC funding for another playground?

730
01:18:52,306 --> 01:18:55,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that

731
01:18:56,437 --> 01:19:02,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the reason we are having this conversation right now is because the CPC window opens.

732
01:19:04,842 --> 01:19:11,225
[SPEAKER_03]: After this, so if we were going to recommend that we put forward a project.

733
01:19:12,366 --> 01:19:15,588
[SPEAKER_03]: For this upcoming cycle, it would have to.

734
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:18,890
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have to identify which project that would be.

735
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:24,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and the 2 that I would say in.

736
01:19:26,245 --> 01:19:31,727
[SPEAKER_09]: The two that are probably most pressing equally are the Misatuck and the Roberts.

737
01:19:33,808 --> 01:19:46,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, after discussing with Shanine, our playground specialist, we actually came to the conclusion that based on population served,

738
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:50,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That the miss attack might be the better option.

739
01:19:51,075 --> 01:20:00,729
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we also know that the Roberts is a very full school and could use playground options as well.

740
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:02,071
[SPEAKER_09]: But.

741
01:20:02,812 --> 01:20:13,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Funding really won't allow and I don't believe that these projects would be anywhere near the cost that the McGlynn was in the neighborhood of 2.9Million, including the about 140 or 150,000 we spent on the design study with the design work with Copley Wolf.

742
01:20:20,471 --> 01:20:23,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I don't believe that it would cost that much.

743
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:25,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe the design would cost that much.

744
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:29,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, our community member donated time previously.

745
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:33,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we need to really think about that.

746
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:40,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I'm definitely willing and able to apply for, um, CPC funds.

747
01:20:41,347 --> 01:20:41,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

748
01:20:42,668 --> 01:20:49,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that window is more in the summer, but it would give us time to make sure that we're ready to go.

749
01:20:50,776 --> 01:21:08,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the committee could say, we want to fund the design, not go to CPC for funding the design, which would mean that we start the design process as part of the supplemental budget in February instead of waiting until, say, September or October.

750
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:18,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to weigh in between the two schools.

751
01:21:18,643 --> 01:21:29,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely advocate more strongly for the Roberts because the Roberts is our only elementary school that is really landlocked.

752
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one major distinction between the Missituck and the Roberts is that the Missituck does have the benefit of the Columbus Field Park that is, you know, it's, they use both spaces.

753
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:57,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So the students actually, although the playgrounds do need to be renovated, the students at the Missituck are able to go up the stairs and use the additional field space.

754
01:21:58,244 --> 01:22:19,591
[SPEAKER_01]: at the mistletoe location whereas the Roberts they really you know it's so crammed over there their landlocked the students don't have that same option to have a park a green space which abuts their campus immediately abuts their campus that they could use on a daily basis and so that that

755
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:31,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be one of the things that I would just say if a decision had to be made between the two schools, I do feel the Roberts has gotten the short end of the stick.

756
01:22:31,454 --> 01:22:42,557
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using practically part of the parking lot for space because it's just so crammed and they have slightly over 600 students.

757
01:22:44,017 --> 01:22:53,683
[SPEAKER_01]: So being the largest elementary school with the smallest footprint, I would prioritize the Roberts that that that's all I wanted to share.

758
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:57,765
[SPEAKER_01]: If it came down to those two schools.

759
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:04,630
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

760
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:06,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

761
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:07,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

762
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:12,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think that, you know, there's

763
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:39,187
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an uncomfortable conversation that has to be had about the Roberts playground and the situation there, whether that conversation involves finding an alternative space to park, whether that involves taking of land, you're having a domain, there is no solution to that area.

764
01:23:40,839 --> 01:23:46,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether we do their park, whether we do their playground first, and then we do the others.

765
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:52,789
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end, when all of these are beautiful playgrounds, one is going to be very distinct.

766
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:59,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to be the Roberts for being utterly incomparable to the others.

767
01:24:00,876 --> 01:24:01,697
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean,

768
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:09,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I think it's important, you know, I don't think that the staff should have to park a half a mile away.

769
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:19,413
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if a piece of property comes available, a street over by it and turn it into a parking lot.

770
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:26,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And then make the whole parking lot into an actual playground that's the appropriate size for that size student population.

771
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:28,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just spitballing.

772
01:24:28,894 --> 01:24:37,184
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, I don't even know that area very well other than having, you know, been to the school a number of times, but my point is just, I don't.

773
01:24:39,095 --> 01:24:49,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to go small on the Roberts playground, and we can always get fancier, but the truth is there's just, as everybody literally here knows, there isn't enough room.

774
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,165
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an understatement.

775
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:53,046
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just such an understatement.

776
01:24:55,548 --> 01:25:09,118
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, my, my, my children went to the mistook and I have like all these fantasies about, you know, how we can make all that area dramatically better and I'm sure design study would come up with some great ways to change that area.

777
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:13,882
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, the truth is, as, as Dr Robinson said, like.

778
01:25:14,522 --> 01:25:15,423
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the field.

779
01:25:15,503 --> 01:25:22,970
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's really kind of an ideal situation, very similar to the McGlynn situation in that there's a lot more space.

780
01:25:24,512 --> 01:25:37,384
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm OK with us putting the Roberts first, but I also want us to not put it first and not have the hard conversation about we can't make it work if the footprint is the same.

781
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,850
[SPEAKER_10]: that it's just not one of our options.

782
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:50,893
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't want to spend a million and a half dollars to make a playground where the kids can't even all be out at recess at the same time because there isn't physically the space.

783
01:25:51,393 --> 01:25:52,073
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absurd.

784
01:25:53,434 --> 01:26:06,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it's not, if the Roberts ends up being a dramatically more expensive endeavor because we have to buy another piece of land or whatever, I'm all in.

785
01:26:08,817 --> 01:26:10,018
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just my thoughts on that.

786
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:24,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just jump in and say, I do spend a lot of time at the Roberts, given that, well, I only have one kid there now, but there have been residential properties that have now been converted.

787
01:26:25,304 --> 01:26:34,688
[SPEAKER_12]: The available land, whether that was even an option to take for the schools, to purchase for the schools is a question to me.

788
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:52,802
[SPEAKER_12]: There aren't a lot of properties it's it's very residential it's houses and we put up the, there's a new, there are new condos and then there's an ambiguous construction going on on Park Street and Hickey Park is the closest park and that ends up being.

789
01:26:54,263 --> 01:27:01,987
[SPEAKER_12]: It shouldn't be a 10-minute walk, but it is, and it's a 15-minute walk with kindergartners, and they have to do field trip forms to go to the park.

790
01:27:02,147 --> 01:27:03,148
[SPEAKER_12]: They do field day there.

791
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:08,291
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be nice to get some kind of connection with Hickey, but it is a few blocks away.

792
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,452
[SPEAKER_12]: So I do think space is at a premium.

793
01:27:13,113 --> 01:27:25,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, since you're here, have there been discussions about this that this group is not privy to or aware of on the city side?

794
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I go there, I'm like, what is that building across the street?

795
01:27:30,789 --> 01:27:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

796
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:35,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't know what it is, but I wonder about it all the time.

797
01:27:36,253 --> 01:27:41,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for many reasons, I dream about an after school center and a parking lot mostly.

798
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:45,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I have no, I have no sense of what happens in that building or.

799
01:27:45,759 --> 01:27:54,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who owns it, but I just didn't know if there had been any conversations about what a space problem we do have at at that building.

800
01:27:57,005 --> 01:28:02,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That building is busting at the seams and, like, we cannot go on like, we, we have so that's.

801
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: a separate but related problem.

802
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:14,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But the signs are that there's continued high demand for elementary school students in that space.

803
01:28:15,142 --> 01:28:22,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would agree that I think the Roberts does need to be first on the list.

804
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:29,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need a double-decker playground or something.

805
01:28:29,452 --> 01:28:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Something has to give there.

806
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:36,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not exactly sure what it is or where to put that in the conversation.

807
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:47,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I assume you mean the existing building across the street, which it I've looked it up before and it is this.

808
01:28:50,071 --> 01:29:03,554
[SPEAKER_05]: a construction company, component assembly systems, but we don't really, we've never really had any contact with them or what they do in that facility.

809
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very, really fly under the radar, but it's, I mean, if you look at it from Google, they even got solar on the roof.

810
01:29:14,076 --> 01:29:17,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's an active, it's well-maintained, it's not abandoned.

811
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:31,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I just looked at their website and it looks like they were involved in the Apple project, you know, the giant round thing and National Museum of African American history and culture.

812
01:29:31,515 --> 01:29:32,576
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're.

813
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:39,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems to me that they do some serious stuff reach out.

814
01:29:39,532 --> 01:29:46,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I did just I hadn't looked before, but I just found a contact for that location off of their website.

815
01:29:47,878 --> 01:29:54,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that it wouldn't be inappropriate for somebody from the school system school committee.

816
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:56,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know to contact them.

817
01:29:58,063 --> 01:30:01,305
[SPEAKER_05]: and just have a conversation about like, we're here, what do you do?

818
01:30:01,365 --> 01:30:03,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really curious across the street.

819
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:08,089
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, I don't know that it'll pan out the way you want.

820
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:16,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume you meant that as opposed to the hole in the ground, which I can tell you has gone through the city's

821
01:30:18,597 --> 01:30:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Permissions process, they don't have a building permit yet.

822
01:30:22,642 --> 01:30:30,351
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually they do they've been through the full building permit process to do a building that would have ground floor commercial probably a coffee shop.

823
01:30:31,132 --> 01:30:34,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't remember if it's seven or nine units of housing above.

824
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:40,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That property is actually on the market with all its permits.

825
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:46,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So the person who permitted it and owns it is looking to now sell all those permits and everything.

826
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:51,823
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's very expensive because it's a whole permitted project.

827
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think the city would be the.

828
01:30:55,882 --> 01:31:03,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I myself have dreamed of, like, could we purchase or put how would we indicate that there are properties the city would be interested in buying.

829
01:31:05,389 --> 01:31:07,811
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of houses and stuff for various.

830
01:31:08,752 --> 01:31:13,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Locations, I think it's something we should look into.

831
01:31:14,296 --> 01:31:14,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to.

832
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:28,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm gonna ask the economic development director, like how would we make a list of properties the city would like to acquire and then keep an eye on them because we would like to expand some of our footprints?

833
01:31:29,508 --> 01:31:31,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't the only one, but.

834
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:35,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, you said it's for sale.

835
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:44,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there an easy way to, I mean, it's not gonna be on Zillow, I'm sure, but is there an easy way to find out what that actually sale price is?

836
01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:49,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask Sal, our economic development director.

837
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: He has access to a commercial listing system, which is where I have confirmed.

838
01:31:55,775 --> 01:32:01,356
[SPEAKER_05]: We had heard that it was for sale because people were confirming its permit status.

839
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:04,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we looked it up, but I'll ask him for the pricing.

840
01:32:04,918 --> 01:32:06,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

841
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:08,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

842
01:32:09,756 --> 01:32:16,638
[SPEAKER_12]: So the question on the table is, are we prioritizing any of these schools for a CPC application this year?

843
01:32:16,658 --> 01:32:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

844
01:32:20,059 --> 01:32:29,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I yeah, that is the question, since I. If it's an age thing or just too much going in, but when we do the application,

845
01:32:32,942 --> 01:32:34,303
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do we have to say?

846
01:32:34,323 --> 01:32:41,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess is my question, because to say we want to do the playground over is one thing.

847
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,452
[SPEAKER_10]: To say we want to do the playground over and

848
01:32:45,394 --> 01:33:14,798
[SPEAKER_10]: we plan to buy a property and we are going to move to like those aren't even things we can say at this point because we I mean we're just spitballing in this meeting not that many of us haven't already thought about these things a number of times but that's not a plan so how much do we have to tell the cpc to actually do an application we have to ask for a specific amount of money what's the limit well so

849
01:33:15,872 --> 01:33:20,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say the limit is contingent on a couple of things.

850
01:33:20,113 --> 01:33:22,614
[SPEAKER_09]: What other projects do they have in the pipeline?

851
01:33:24,494 --> 01:33:26,315
[SPEAKER_09]: What are their projects?

852
01:33:27,215 --> 01:33:33,016
[SPEAKER_09]: We've received a significant amount of funding with that way into their decision as to trying to spread the money around.

853
01:33:33,537 --> 01:33:38,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we've shown with the McLeod playground that we provide

854
01:33:39,024 --> 01:33:44,088
[SPEAKER_07]: we've been able to provide significant value to the overall community, as well as the metropolitan schools.

855
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:51,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if we can replicate that, and I guess I would consider the Roberts and Alicia, you know, better than better than I do.

856
01:33:51,915 --> 01:34:04,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I would consider the Roberts to be a significantly more landlocked area, um, and more dense, um, even though he is down the street, but it is a significantly dense area.

857
01:34:04,826 --> 01:34:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you know,

858
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:24,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we would need to understand the long term plans of both the school committee and the municipality on what we can do to expand the footprint of that school, because there is there's no other way around.

859
01:34:24,276 --> 01:34:29,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that footprint for the number of students there is not adequate.

860
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:41,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And the hard conversations that have been initiated here tonight need to be had for the greater benefit of those 605 or 600 plus students.

861
01:34:42,836 --> 01:34:55,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we are gonna have those conversations, that'll help inform what type of a playground or what type of parking or what is done to make it a better environment for our students.

862
01:34:58,779 --> 01:35:03,328
[SPEAKER_08]: There really is no limit to the funding except annually how much they bring in.

863
01:35:04,276 --> 01:35:07,517
[SPEAKER_08]: They funded us $900,000 in one fiscal year.

864
01:35:07,557 --> 01:35:12,539
[SPEAKER_08]: They funded us $900,000 in another fiscal year for a total of $1.8 million in that ask.

865
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they had given us a memogram.

866
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it ended up being like an initial $40,000 for the design study.

867
01:35:19,442 --> 01:35:21,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we found out that that was pretty inadequate.

868
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:25,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it went up to in the neighborhood of $150,000, $160,000.

869
01:35:26,684 --> 01:35:30,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just forgetting those numbers as they've kind of blurred together.

870
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:58,971
[SPEAKER_12]: The other hard conversation, which is not the scope of this meeting, but is how are we managing the unevenness in population in schools across the district, whether that's looking at reorganizing the grade levels, whether it's just redistricting, whether it's somebody come up to me and say, say, we should just open a new school, which I suppose that's on the table too.

871
01:36:01,648 --> 01:36:05,931
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's another hard conversation that informs what type of playground we need.

872
01:36:06,031 --> 01:36:11,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if we move to a different model, we may have a different student population in that building.

873
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:23,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what I'm hearing is what we would recommend is that we prioritize a solution at the Roberts.

874
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:37,478
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not ready necessarily to ask the CPC for money because we don't actually know the solution could possibly be at this moment.

875
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But that what we do recommend is that there are some continuing conversations about what those possibilities are.

876
01:36:47,606 --> 01:36:54,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know, do we like, every time I go there, I'm shocked that the staff park each other in.

877
01:36:55,675 --> 01:36:59,979
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a choice, but they park each other and it's super unsafe, right?

878
01:37:01,361 --> 01:37:02,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a necessity.

879
01:37:02,382 --> 01:37:04,364
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing else to do.

880
01:37:05,825 --> 01:37:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's not enough parking for the number of staff that have to work in that building.

881
01:37:11,811 --> 01:37:13,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not enough playground space.

882
01:37:16,222 --> 01:37:24,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need literally a parking deck or something that would double the parking capacity and create some space?

883
01:37:24,429 --> 01:37:25,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

884
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:35,678
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's a question we'd need to talk to some people about in terms of what even the options are and maybe have a conversation with the folks across the street.

885
01:37:39,442 --> 01:37:58,906
[SPEAKER_03]: before we could proceed with the CPC application, but perhaps the recommendation from this group to the committee is that is our short range priority is like figuring something out for that building that leads to our ability to address the playground.

886
01:38:01,207 --> 01:38:02,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I would agree with that recommendation.

887
01:38:05,898 --> 01:38:21,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I also was remembering it when we were visiting high schools, Watertown, at least Suffolk University, and I can't remember where else, has done something that I would never have thought made any sense until I saw it, but they put the

888
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:44,824
[SPEAKER_10]: well, they're not playgrounds, they're fields there, but they put fields above parking so that there's so much parking, they don't even need to assign spots or care, because essentially the entire ground level becomes parking, and then elevated above it is what would become a very large amount of playground space.

889
01:38:45,764 --> 01:38:49,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The difference, of course, for those places and this is that

890
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,381
[SPEAKER_10]: this is in a neighborhood.

891
01:38:53,162 --> 01:39:00,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But while it ends up sort of becoming two stories, it's barely higher than a roof on a one story.

892
01:39:00,588 --> 01:39:01,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know.

893
01:39:02,009 --> 01:39:04,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this isn't the time for the solutions.

894
01:39:04,551 --> 01:39:14,738
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it's $2 million to buy a lot that would, in many regards, not be enough to fully solve the problem,

895
01:39:18,225 --> 01:39:25,890
[SPEAKER_10]: do we have to consider something much, I mean, no concept of what those elevated fields actually cost.

896
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:30,213
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I think we should definitely make this a priority though.

897
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:37,578
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the elementary schools in my hometown did that, but they actually had the whole school underground as well.

898
01:39:39,586 --> 01:39:40,126
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very cool.

899
01:39:40,146 --> 01:39:41,467
[SPEAKER_12]: They had it elevated.

900
01:39:41,507 --> 01:39:42,127
[SPEAKER_12]: It was very cool.

901
01:39:42,567 --> 01:39:46,969
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was the 60s and 70s that that happened.

902
01:39:48,029 --> 01:39:50,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Weird architectural world.

903
01:39:58,052 --> 01:39:58,192
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

904
01:39:58,212 --> 01:40:01,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently, I lied about how long this meeting was going to take.

905
01:40:03,154 --> 01:40:04,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry for that.

906
01:40:05,555 --> 01:40:06,935
[SPEAKER_12]: We ended the last one early.

907
01:40:07,035 --> 01:40:07,936
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was due.

908
01:40:29,476 --> 01:40:29,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot.

909
01:40:31,498 --> 01:40:33,499
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we've landed.

910
01:40:36,441 --> 01:40:37,662
[SPEAKER_03]: For recommendations in 25,

911
01:40:40,815 --> 01:41:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: The mini reconditioning assessment, the network closets, the freight elevator, the drainage at the Brooksfield, the key fobs, the dumpster mitigation potentially in 26, and getting this grant addressed for the ADA issue at McGlynn and Andrews.

912
01:41:05,105 --> 01:41:08,166
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying district-wide security updates of 1.5,

913
01:41:11,969 --> 01:41:16,751
[SPEAKER_03]: are not committed at this time, but from a planning perspective, we should be looking at it for FY 26.

914
01:41:19,493 --> 01:41:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roberts is our priority playground or recommended priority playground.

915
01:41:29,798 --> 01:41:32,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Parking lot paving also not committed.

916
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:39,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Then these items are all contingent on the mini-commissioning study and what might come from there.

917
01:41:42,068 --> 01:41:47,291
[SPEAKER_12]: You might want to picky details flip miss a tuck in Brooks, because it sounds like that's the priority order.

918
01:42:06,983 --> 01:42:09,665
[SPEAKER_03]: There is many students at the Brooks, but.

919
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:17,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the conversation for after we've solved all the rest.

920
01:42:21,706 --> 01:42:24,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was just going off the conversation that happened before, but you're right.

921
01:42:24,747 --> 01:42:26,048
[SPEAKER_12]: We didn't have that conversation.

922
01:42:26,588 --> 01:42:28,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm fine.

923
01:42:28,269 --> 01:42:35,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's lots of change to this before we get to that place on the list.

924
01:42:35,212 --> 01:42:40,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything else that you think we should change?

925
01:42:43,834 --> 01:42:52,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Have we identified all of the, right, this meeting was timed so that we could say this is, I see the potential open space CPC.

926
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see any of that for the current projects.

927
01:42:56,444 --> 01:42:58,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, some things had been committed up at the top.

928
01:42:58,905 --> 01:43:02,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then we have an application pending for Curtis Tufts, yep.

929
01:43:06,511 --> 01:43:08,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're recommending this one, so.

930
01:43:09,493 --> 01:43:10,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I see that.

931
01:43:15,224 --> 01:43:40,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think the question is, is what we're asking school committee to, I guess, is this the work of the district to say what if this is going into a supplemental budget request, what is coming out of funds that have already been allocated and what is a new request to city council or from capital stabilization, right?

932
01:43:40,829 --> 01:43:43,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the mitigation is potentially a stabilization

933
01:43:46,403 --> 01:43:46,703
[SPEAKER_12]: fund.

934
01:44:02,206 --> 01:44:13,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also trying to do the math on what the grand total here is, but I don't know that a grand total is what's important so much as the total for each of these buckets.

935
01:44:16,737 --> 01:44:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm just going to put a little legend at the top.

936
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it means.

937
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:24,783
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we're saying if we say recommend proceeding in FY26.

938
01:44:29,287 --> 01:44:44,779
[SPEAKER_04]: If we say recommend CPC funding request, MPS directs the administration to apply for CPC funding.

939
01:44:53,336 --> 01:44:54,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Not committed.

940
01:44:54,778 --> 01:45:09,489
[SPEAKER_04]: No immediate action required.

941
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:22,703
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got this one.

942
01:45:47,467 --> 01:45:54,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other element of this process was net school spending, but that's covered under the recommend proceeding in fiscal year 25.

943
01:45:54,712 --> 01:46:05,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did talk to to Jerry about that and he gave me the dollar thresholds.

944
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:09,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been filling that in as we've been talking hit.

945
01:46:17,755 --> 01:46:19,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to jail somewhere.

946
01:46:30,846 --> 01:46:31,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was $150,000.

947
01:46:32,588 --> 01:46:34,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's $150,000.

948
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:38,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it's under $150,000, it can be included in that school spending.

949
01:46:38,613 --> 01:46:40,074
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's over, it cannot be.

950
01:46:40,094 --> 01:46:46,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And what does that mean for something like LED lighting replacement, which ends up being $180,000 across the three schools?

951
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:48,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Each school, $150,000 per each school.

952
01:46:48,881 --> 01:46:49,102
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

953
01:46:49,122 --> 01:46:49,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Or per project, not.

954
01:46:55,153 --> 01:46:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It's per year.

955
01:46:56,654 --> 01:46:59,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It's per project, I believe.

956
01:46:59,435 --> 01:47:00,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

957
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:03,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these would be a no.

958
01:47:03,076 --> 01:47:11,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because it's one project.

959
01:47:26,016 --> 01:47:27,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yep, there's that column.

960
01:47:28,437 --> 01:47:30,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I've zoomed in and I'm scrolling back and forth.

961
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So apologies for that.

962
01:47:49,507 --> 01:47:54,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the other we had that we need to describe and then

963
01:48:09,272 --> 01:48:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

964
01:48:37,708 --> 01:48:42,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like a little key for us for like what those project status.

965
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:57,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have that we need to.

966
01:49:07,143 --> 01:49:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that covers all of our.

967
01:49:09,344 --> 01:49:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're done.

968
01:49:34,797 --> 01:49:37,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions, thoughts, things we missed.

969
01:49:41,281 --> 01:49:46,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to put it in progress for the bike rack modernization line 28?

970
01:49:49,065 --> 01:49:49,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

971
01:49:53,168 --> 01:49:55,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't have to answer that question, which will come up.

972
01:50:01,612 --> 01:50:02,053
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

973
01:50:03,157 --> 01:50:04,478
[SPEAKER_10]: First year is the hardest doing this.

974
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:13,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have a couple of costs to include between now and the meeting.

975
01:50:13,626 --> 01:50:23,995
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will probably put together a slide that says, here's what we did, and here's how we did it, and this is the result.

976
01:50:29,142 --> 01:50:30,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we need a deadline?

977
01:50:30,483 --> 01:50:35,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a couple people took action items to confirm quotes or points of contact.

978
01:50:35,885 --> 01:50:41,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there, do you, in preparing that slide, do you need, is there a deadline you want that information by?

979
01:50:41,488 --> 01:50:47,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we want it as soon as we can get it, but reasonable demands on people's time.

980
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, by December 6th would be great.

981
01:50:53,433 --> 01:50:54,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Till end of next week.

982
01:50:58,645 --> 01:51:02,368
[SPEAKER_03]: In my mind, it's two weeks away, but it's not.

983
01:51:02,648 --> 01:51:04,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, nobody's working Thursday, Friday.

984
01:51:07,072 --> 01:51:10,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

985
01:51:10,595 --> 01:51:21,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what we need tonight is just a recommendation to send this to the full committee for their review.

986
01:51:23,863 --> 01:51:28,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that we will need to do as a full committee is.

987
01:51:29,566 --> 01:51:35,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, make a recommendation to approve this or prove it as amended, which will happen at the special meeting.

988
01:51:38,511 --> 01:51:43,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we have a motion to.

989
01:51:45,672 --> 01:51:52,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Approve approve this recommendation to send to the entire school committee by members so seconded by member Rheinfeld.

990
01:51:53,075 --> 01:51:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'll do a roll call member.

991
01:51:54,135 --> 01:51:55,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes.

992
01:51:56,216 --> 01:51:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brian felled as member Graham.

993
01:51:58,577 --> 01:52:00,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 3 affirmatives here on the negative.

994
01:52:01,858 --> 01:52:03,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is there a motion to adjourn?

995
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:05,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.

996
01:52:13,095 --> 01:52:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Rousseau?

997
01:52:14,235 --> 01:52:14,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

998
01:52:15,136 --> 01:52:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham?

999
01:52:15,756 --> 01:52:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1000
01:52:16,136 --> 01:52:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1001
01:52:18,417 --> 01:52:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

1002
01:52:21,898 --> 01:52:26,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Paul Riggi, for joining us.

1003
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul, I don't know your title, or I would have called you by your proper title.

1004
01:52:29,561 --> 01:52:31,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you both.

1005
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:32,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul is fine.

1009
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:48,650
