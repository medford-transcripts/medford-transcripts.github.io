Councilor Zaro.

42
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:55,425

00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:57,407
Councilor Lemming.

44
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:58,687

45
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:59,468

46
00:10:59,488 --> 00:10:59,568

47
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:01,429
Councilor Seng.

48
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:01,509
Yes.

49
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,150
President Pierce.

50
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,371
Yes.

51
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,692
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

52
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:07,833
The motion passes.

53
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,495
Records of the meeting of September 9th were passed to Councilor Callahan.

54
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,917
Councilor Callahan, I do find those records.

55
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:21,511
I found them a bit sparse, actually, and if I may ask, I know that we are short-staffed currently in the clerk's department.

56
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:34,726
The notes used to be a little bit more fuller with some information in them, but I found that they not only did they, I think the thing that really got to me was

57
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:40,491
it would say five in the affirmative and two in the negative, and it never even said who voted which way.

58
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:50,176
Normally, those notes and records had even said things like what statements city councilors had made for the reasons that they had voted in certain ways.

59
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:54,439
That's usually for committee meetings, not for regular meetings for the verbatim transcript.

60
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,661
I do think that the who voted which way is part of the regular.

61
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,462
Yeah.

62
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:04,344
Just if we can add, there was at least one where it was not unanimous, and I do think that that's important information.

63
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:05,045
Okay.

64
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,639
Do you want to table them?

65
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:07,959
Sure.

66
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:08,500
Let's table.

67
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,882
And if that bit of information could be added, that would be great.

68
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:12,282
OK.

69
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:18,807
On the motion to table by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

70
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,309
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

71
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,011
Councilor Callahan?

72
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,171
Yes.

73
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,493
Vice President Collins?

74
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:28,113
Yes.

75
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:30,575
Councilor Lazaro?

76
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:30,655
Yes.

77
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:32,496
Councilor Lemming?

78
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:32,577
Yes.

79
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:34,418
Councilor Scarpelli?

80
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,656
Council it's saying, President bears.

81
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,477
Yes, 70 affirmative and negative.

82
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:45,039
That is tabled until the next regular meeting.

83
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:51,362
25126 petition for a common pictures license T bar nails and lashes to we have T bar nails and lashes here tonight.

84
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:51,642
Great.

85
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:57,785
I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then we'll come to you, Councilor Scarpelli.

86
00:12:58,025 --> 00:12:59,185
Thank you, Mr. President.

87
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:00,286
Welcome.

88
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:08,915
I know we're, before I get going, if you could just, it was an interesting read because it's such a interesting concept.

89
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:15,038
So if you could just give us a little synopsis of what the business is and then I'll jump in.

90
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:26,065
Oh, we are, we are, I've been doing this for so long time, over 30 years in business.

91
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:32,908
And I have so many nail salons around the country.

92
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:48,593
And we are now serving bubble tea drink for our customer and civilian around the neighborhood.

93
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:52,775
So I want to add in that in my business.

94
00:13:53,797 --> 00:14:00,799
But we have separate space for my bubble tea business.

95
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:09,622
You get to do your nails and lashes, and you have your bubble tea.

96
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:12,623
So I think that it's going to be great for that neighborhood.

97
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:15,344
And I see everything in order, Mr. President.

98
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:16,705
I would move forward for approval.

99
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,654
At least my fellow councils if they have any questions.

100
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:22,414
Thank you.

101
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,115
Motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli.

102
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,176
Do we have any questions from any other members of the council?

103
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,042
Seeing none on the motion to approve seconded by seconded by Councilor Lemming.

104
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,243
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

105
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:39,745
Councilor Callahan?

106
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:39,825
Yes.

107
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,227
Vice President Collins?

108
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:42,747
Yes.

109
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:44,869
Councilor Lazaro?

110
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:45,009
Yes.

111
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:46,930
Councilor Lemming?

112
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,074
Councilor Scott Kelly.

113
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:49,554
Yes.

114
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,617
Councilor saying, President beers.

115
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,320
Yes, 70 affirmative, then the negative emotion passes.

116
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,001
Congratulations.

117
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:57,022
Thank you so much.

118
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:57,662
Good luck.

119
00:14:57,803 --> 00:14:58,163
Thank you.

120
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,466
motions orders.

121
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:02,968
You're good.

122
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,750
You're good.

123
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,076
motions orders and resolutions.

124
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:19,659
25127, just a reminder, 61 Locust Street, that's where you can find the T-bar and nails.

125
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:25,584
Motions, orders and resolutions, 25147 offered by Councilor Lemming and President Behrs.

126
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:38,993
Whereas workers at Medford Rehabilitation and Nursing Center are the lowest paid workers in 1199 SEIU with the average CNA making only $17 per hour with employees with more than 35 years of experience in the facility making no more than 2289 per hour.

127
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:51,146
And whereas the housekeeping and dietary department makes only 1637 per hour with no pay scale, and where bargaining has been going ongoing since June with the workers fighting for adequate pay raises.

128
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:56,111
Whereas Medford rehab and nursing has listed over 64 CNAs who have been hired.

129
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,253
and then left into under one year.

130
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:07,560
And whereas a significant portion of the workers are Haitian refugees working under TPS who send what little they can back to their struggling families in Haiti, leaving even less for themselves.

131
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,904
And whereas the workers at Medford Rehab and Nursing Center are holding a picket on Thursday, October 2nd, from two to 4 p.m.

132
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:25,412
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we stand with the union workers at Medford Rehab and Nursing Center and offer our full support to their efforts to win a fair contract with strong compensation and benefits for the essential work that they do.

133
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,173
Councilor Lemming.

134
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:30,133
Thank you, Council President Behrs.

135
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:43,937
So I remember I visited Medford Rehab and Nursing a few months ago with Councilor Callahan to celebrate a woman's 104th birthday.

136
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,198
Very, very pleasant event.

137
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,138
There was someone playing a harp there.

138
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,761
The woman asked me to give her my tie and I gave her my tie.

139
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:00,876
and had a very nice interaction.

140
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:10,140
She asked Councillor Callaghan for her jacket and well, it was a nice event.

141
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,042
So it's a good facility, but it's also very hard work.

142
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:22,204
I remember years and years ago, my mom, she

143
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:30,709
went back into the working world for a little bit and she took up a job as a CNA.

144
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:44,237
She worked at a nursing home and she quit after a couple of months because the conditions were so difficult and so nerve wracking to deal with.

145
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:47,239
And right now we have

146
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:59,710
a lot of the workers at Medford Rehab and Nursing who are in, have been going through negotiations for months to get fair compensation.

147
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,752
A lot of these folks would have a difficult time finding work elsewhere.

148
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:11,434
A lot of them are supporting families who are abroad and just trying to make a better life for themselves here.

149
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,595
And like any

150
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:17,905
union contract negotiation process.

151
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:18,826
It's a struggle.

152
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,087
It's a back and forth.

153
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:36,475
And so I'm bringing this resolution just to offer my support and offer the support of this body to their struggle and hoping that some of my colleagues can join at the picket on October 2nd.

154
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:42,659
So thank you very much for listening and we stand with you.

155
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:49,672
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

156
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,474
Any further discussion?

157
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:55,238
Councilor Callahan.

158
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,120
Thank you.

159
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,743
I do wish there was more that we could do.

160
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:08,674
It truly saddens me that nurses are paid so little in this country, in the state, in the city.

161
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,456
The work that they do is absolutely essential.

162
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:20,261
And, you know, I was so impressed with the workers that we met when we were there, incredibly caring despite being paid very little.

163
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:26,725
So again, I wish that there was more we could do, but I certainly am in support.

164
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,763
Thank you, Councilor Callahan, any further discussion, Councilor Sang.

165
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,065
Thank you Councilor Lemming for bringing this up.

166
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:43,548
Um, as the resolution says you can look at the dollar amounts they make per hour and it's ridiculous.

167
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:49,632
It's not a livable wage in Middlesex County, it's, and we you know,

168
00:19:50,398 --> 00:20:02,733
Not only do we want to stand up for union workers and immigrant workers, we want to make sure that people working in Medford can be close to our community, can live in the close to our community, can thrive close to our community as well.

169
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:19,517
You know, I believe this, this paying rate is also lower than not not only our nurses generally underpaid in our country, this rate is lower than what is standard and appropriate in Middlesex County here.

170
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,099
And I want to make that really clear as well.

171
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:32,844
With the immigrant part, I think we've talked a lot on this council about how difficult life is nowadays for immigrants, especially those under temporary protected status.

172
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:34,165
And

173
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,570
No, this is a little, this is a lifeline for them.

174
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,774
Their pay is a lifeline and we need to be supporting them through these very difficult moments of uncertainty as well.

175
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:46,235
Thank you.

176
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,438
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

177
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,359
Any further discussion?

178
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:55,902
On the motion of Councilor Lemming to approve, seconded by.

179
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,463
Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

180
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,185
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

181
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,228
Councilor Callahan.

182
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:09,002
Vice President Collins?

183
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:09,642
Yes.

184
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,663
Councilor Zaro?

185
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:11,803
Yes.

186
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:13,763
Councilor Lemming?

187
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:14,904
Yes.

188
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:15,744
Councilor Scarpelli?

189
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:15,844
Yes.

190
00:21:16,824 --> 00:21:17,464
Councilor Singh?

191
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:17,544
Yes.

192
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:19,385
President Beers?

193
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:22,206
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

194
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:35,489
25148 offered by Councilor Lemming, whereas the city of Medford entered into a new waste removal contract last year, and whereas this new contract created a policy that condominium complexes over a certain size would not receive city-provided waste removal services,

195
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:42,211
and whereas certain townhouse condominium complexes in Medford are more similar to homes with fewer than four units and large residential buildings.

196
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:55,717
Now therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we request an update from the city administration regarding the waste removal contract, and the possibility of continuing city provided waste removal services for residential condominium properties that are laid out as townhouses.

197
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:56,477
Councilor Lemming.

198
00:21:57,904 --> 00:21:58,264
Thank you.

199
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:10,390
So this is in response to a resident who's recently learned that they'll have to be paying out of pocket for waste removal services.

200
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:23,256
Basically, the city recently signed a contract that would sort of lop big apartment complexes and condominiums in with townhouses that are

201
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:28,978
laid out much like single family homes and just basically put them all in the same category.

202
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:39,202
So people who live, basically in the same neighborhood in the same layout as many of their neighbors who are in single family homes, just are

203
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:46,564
learning that they'll now have to pay for their own waste removal.

204
00:22:47,565 --> 00:23:09,690
So this is just a resolution to get an update from the city on this issue and put some pressure on them to reconsider that waste removal contract so that it makes a little bit more sense to the day-to-day realities of these residents.

205
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,940
Let me go to Councilor Lazaro.

206
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:18,901
Thank you.

207
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:33,410
I communicated with the residents who expressed concern about the contract and asked to look over the contract myself, which I did.

208
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:41,816
My understanding from, and other members of this body and

209
00:23:42,563 --> 00:24:01,262
The mayor's administration and DPW have understand the contract, much more intimately, because they worked on reviewing it and getting it signed and everything, but that the contract is a 10 year contract, and it's been signed by us already.

210
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:06,395
And then I'm not sure there's anything that can be done to amend it.

211
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:17,479
I'm fine with asking somebody to tell us that more explicitly, but my understanding from talking with Commissioner McIvern was that there may not be anything that we can do about that.

212
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:30,705
And that it's a standard thing to just not include condos as a cost-saving measure.

213
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:41,773
we did not have access to much funding and we were signing a 10-year contract and we needed to make some cuts somewhere.

214
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:44,575
That's one of the places that they did it because it's a standard place to do it.

215
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:59,226
I don't know that I would have necessarily agreed with that were one of the people negotiating the contract, but if we have a 10-year contract and it's been two years, I'm not sure how much we can do about it.

216
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,408
That was my understanding, I would be happy to be corrected on any of that.

217
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:19,946
But, and also I'm, I remain confused about why single family white people who live in single family homes would be granted a service that people living in smaller

218
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:26,573
more densely populated homes that cost less money would not be granted that service.

219
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:36,976
Because I think that would mean that probably the people in the single family homes have more money and could afford to pay for a service additionally by some kind of logic.

220
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:50,000
So I'm curious to hear more information on it, which is to say, I would support a resolution that asks for more information that we can know and then we can share with the public to clear up confusion.

221
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,685
So I appreciate Councilor Lemming bringing this forward.

222
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:54,466
Thank you.

223
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,232
Thank you Councilor Lazzaro.

224
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,314
Councilor Scarpelli.

225
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:00,917
President, thank you Council.

226
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:01,638
I'm bringing this forward.

227
00:26:01,678 --> 00:26:03,181
I know that I've talked to those residents and

228
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,359
There's some misconceptions, that's why I'm happy that we're bringing this forward.

229
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:15,863
I know that I think the public has to understand there was talk that the council was the voting party that made that decision.

230
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:17,464
That's not true.

231
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:19,985
The mayor's office negotiates all the contracts.

232
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:28,910
I believe this council gave the mayor authority to do the best she could with the contract extending, giving her the authority to go past five years.

233
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:30,371
Other than that,

234
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:43,101
You know, I be nice to look into it I know that we know that it's a million dollar increase and we know that budgetary wise we're struggling in that sense.

235
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:53,969
And we had to make some decisions but again this is where the lack of communications to our residents and even understanding maybe.

236
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:58,454
maybe looking at different variables where it's phased in from year to year.

237
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,496
So people are prepared for that.

238
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:07,982
Right now, asking residents to go from A to Z right away, especially when you're talking about

239
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:29,459
people that live in five family homes aren't, you know, they're mostly the ones I've talked to are hard working, lower middle class, middle class families that when you when you all of a sudden throw a fee like this on their lap, it really, really puts them in a bad light financially.

240
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:29,659
So

241
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:49,314
I would love to hear it and I understand the limitations, but at the same time, these are the concerns that I have that we need to really start looking at our residents and when we do have to make tough decisions, make them part of the process so at least they understand.

242
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:58,421
Because unfortunately, being an elected official, whether you're the mayor, city council, school committee,

243
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:03,856
you have to look people in the eye and agree to disagree.

244
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:09,877
And you have to stand strong in some of the decisions you have to make, whether they're favorable or unfavorable.

245
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:15,439
So in this situation, I understand the process.

246
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,239
I understand the financial ramifications.

247
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,780
But at the same time, what I would really like to see is how we got there.

248
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,701
And did we look into a phase-out project?

249
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:28,182
Did we look at how other

250
00:28:29,656 --> 00:28:37,321
neighborhoods or other classes could assist in that mechanism of payment.

251
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:40,083
So I know how difficult it is.

252
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:50,730
I met with my colleagues in the city that I work in, and in that community, the DPW director is given full autonomy to negotiate

253
00:28:51,374 --> 00:29:03,064
the trash contract and it's a little bit more in depth and a little bit more resident friendly in the sense that everybody knows what's happening.

254
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:08,729
So again, I look forward to seeing what the administration presents to us.

255
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:10,050
I know that unfortunately

256
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:24,950
This is, this is, these are one of the things that we have no control over so we can't say, let's not let's vote this down, it's disappears and, but it's, it is, it's out of our hands but at the same time, I think we should start.

257
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:42,284
holding entities to task when it comes to preparing, especially our most vulnerable members of our community, which mostly are senior citizens and veterans and residents with disabilities, that we're preparing them for any financial shifts.

258
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:54,490
Now, you know, you look at those residents, they're looking at, you know, if they own the homes and you're looking at a shift in assessment, you're looking at an override addition, now you're looking at a trash fee.

259
00:29:55,453 --> 00:29:59,434
That could destroy your homeowner, that could destroy renters, and that's just not fair.

260
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:01,695
So, thank you, Mr. President.

261
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:03,676
Thank you.

262
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:07,177
Thanks for bringing this forward.

263
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,938
I don't think those are the only residents or even the only.

264
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:16,179
like set of units that are surprised by this and asking about this.

265
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:32,290
I, I am unhappy that our city cannot do the basic schools roads trash that seems very basic to me and the equity of just deciding what we'll just cut out some people and those people who, again, living in smaller

266
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,936
places or perhaps, nobody knows exactly, but perhaps lower income are the ones that now have to pay more.

267
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,597
I'm not happy with that decision.

268
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:43,299
So thank you very much for bringing this up.

269
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:50,846
I think having it looked into and seeing if there are better solutions that are more equitable, I would like to see that from our administration.

270
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:51,186
Thank you.

271
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:52,767
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

272
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:53,468
Councilor Sang.

273
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:54,504
Thank you.

274
00:30:55,104 --> 00:31:02,787
I largely agree, if not almost completely agree, besides the political points with all the, you know, comments that have been made already.

275
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:09,489
I think it's too easy is it to just cut some people out and call that a solution.

276
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,790
And I think everyone behind the rail.

277
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:25,353
would agree, all of our Councillors would agree that we need, at the very least, a thorough explanation of why certain choices are made, and for that to be transparent and open to the public as well.

278
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:27,134
So I support this resolution.

279
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:38,297
I support it because I want to help the residents, and I know Councillors Leming and Lazaro have been communicating with them a lot as well.

280
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:45,303
And I support it because we want the answers on the City Council as well.

281
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:55,113
Because we, you know, we have a perspective on these issues, we talk to residents that might not get through to the administration that's doing the negotiating as well.

282
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:58,437
And so we need that perspective in the room too.

283
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:02,335
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

284
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:06,457
We have some residents here, I believe, who want to speak on this issue around trash removal.

285
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:07,558
I have a hand on Zoom.

286
00:32:07,578 --> 00:32:09,118
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak?

287
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:09,498
Great.

288
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,520
If you're in the room, you can line up behind the podium.

289
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,622
The Zoom hand was up first, so I will take Robert Carney on Zoom.

290
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:19,423
Give me one second.

291
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,505
Robert, name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

292
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:31,045
Yep.

293
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:33,606
Robert Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6.

294
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:38,227
I'm one of the two trustees in our 23 unit townhouse complex.

295
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:43,529
We've been lobbying all the city council members and candidates on this topic.

296
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,470
So I just want to start with some prepared notes here.

297
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:54,253
So 29 residents from this complex wrote a letter to the mayor expressing our concerns with this.

298
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,352
And really what we want to be getting at here is a couple things.

299
00:32:59,072 --> 00:33:03,973
So like you said, our units are single family style row houses.

300
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:08,514
We have our own back decks, front steps, garden areas.

301
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:12,735
We were given 60 days to comply with this mandate.

302
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,296
I just want to echo previous comments.

303
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,516
My wife and I are new to Medford.

304
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:23,398
We bought in 2024, but I've heard from longtime residents that they felt blindsided

305
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:25,199
by this change.

306
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:38,350
Tim McGivern said the goal was to create a system that is fair and does not selectively provide some service to condominium properties and others, but I would say there is still selective service.

307
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,091
And I want to give an example.

308
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:50,860
There's a 10-unit townhouse complex in our neighborhood with five two-unit buildings, nearly identical in architectural style to us, that is still receiving services.

309
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,882
You can ask the realtor who listed 18 Hancock Ave and he will verify it for you.

310
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,303
Why do they receive services you ask?

311
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:07,167
It appears they are still receiving trash services based on the fact that each unit has a different street number.

312
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:10,568
For example, the unit next to 18 Hancock Ave is 16 Hancock Ave.

313
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:29,465
But Tim said our two-unit building, units 22 and 23, and the four-unit building, units 13 through 16, are ineligible for services because they are part of a 23-unit address, a.k.a.

314
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,485
50 Hicks Ave.

315
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:39,692
So a question I'd like answered by the mayor and by Tim is, would we still get trash services if each of these buildings had a separate address?

316
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:45,496
One building is 50 Hicks Ave, the other smaller building is 52 Hicks Ave, et cetera.

317
00:34:46,157 --> 00:34:48,539
Ask yourself, is this really a fair system?

318
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,663
I also want to echo the previous points about tax bills, our unit owners pay.

319
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:59,127
They're comparable and actually sometimes higher than some single family homes.

320
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:03,336
2024 property tax bills for units in our complex range from just under $5,000 to $6,300.

321
00:35:03,376 --> 00:35:08,500
A small home behind our complex, 260 Willis Avenue, has a property tax bill of $4,223 and will still receive services.

322
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:29,455
I ask you, why should residents who pay more than their neighbor on Willis Ave receive less in services?

323
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:39,137
Echoing the point about increased costs, many residents supported an override that promised enhanced DPW services.

324
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:44,978
The median assessed value of a townhouse in our complex is less than a single family home.

325
00:35:45,735 --> 00:35:57,880
Is an override tax increase for reduced city services at Fountainhead Estates the way our city wants to thank the owners in this complex who voted yes on this override?

326
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,262
So those are some points there.

327
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,823
And if I still have time, I also want to mention, okay.

328
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:09,125
Robert, your time has expired, but we'll come back to you after we've heard from the other residents for another minute, if that's okay.

329
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:09,546
Thank you.

330
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:12,327
All right, we'll go to the podium.

331
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,048
Name and address for the record, please.

332
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:14,688
You have three minutes.

333
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:20,206
Good evening Nick Julio 40 Robinson Road.

334
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:25,648
I am in favor of this resolution and I thank Mr Carney for bringing this issue to my attention.

335
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:33,412
I think it very much being the public interest to get some sort of update on why we're seeing this unequal treatment here doesn't really seem fair to me.

336
00:36:33,932 --> 00:36:44,337
And I think regardless of whether or not there's a contract in place I think everyone would benefit, just at least from a little more information to kind of understand the rationale behind this so I think.

337
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:48,324
Councilor Lemming for bringing this very local issue to the council's attention.

338
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:48,705
Thank you.

339
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:51,070
Thank you.

340
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:53,095
We'll stay at the podium.

341
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:54,999
Name and address for the record, please.

342
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:55,701
And you'll have three minutes.

343
00:36:56,552 --> 00:37:00,794
Laura Lafferty, 50 Hicks Avenue, Unit 18, part of the Fountainhead Estates.

344
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:06,196
I have two points that I wanted to make on this in support of the resolution.

345
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:07,657
Thank you for raising it on our behalf.

346
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,978
One is that the city is not following its own policy.

347
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:18,222
On the other side of the fence from Fountainhead Estates is the Willis Avenue development, which is owned and operated by the Medford Housing Authority.

348
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,443
Those are townhouse style units.

349
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,086
They are some that are even larger than what we have at Fountainhead Estates.

350
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:27,949
And yet, from what I can see looking over the fence, they're still receiving city services.

351
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,931
Now, it shouldn't matter who owns the property.

352
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:42,319
And so in my mind, this is creating a do as we say, not as we do double standard by providing services to those residents when we, in the exact same type of structure, are not eligible for those services.

353
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:50,493
Second point I'd like to make is that in all of this, it would have been nice if the precedent that was set by the Commonwealth would have been considered.

354
00:37:51,154 --> 00:38:00,483
Many of us in the development have taken advantage of mass saves, and I'm sure everyone's familiar with mass saves, they actually have a what's called a townhouse loophole.

355
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:17,455
And so where there are structures where there is a single resident or a single group of residents, if you will, who live in a basement to roof structure, they define that as a single family home and we are eligible for single family home rebates and services through mass saves.

356
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:24,880
And so it seems to me if the Commonwealth can define our type of structures as a single family home, why can't the city of Medford?

357
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:25,841
Thank you.

358
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:27,242
Thank you.

359
00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:31,103
name and address the record, please.

360
00:38:31,123 --> 00:38:31,583
You have three minutes.

361
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,104
David Plishevich, 50 Hicks Ave.

362
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:49,167
I understand how this new waste management contract didn't make sense for some of these massive complexes owned by corporations and to your point, I was informed by Tim that the mayor has the ability to make exceptions to this this contract or this policy.

363
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:54,588
So, potentially, that's ultimately what we're seeking is an exception from the mayor here.

364
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:55,268
So,

365
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:58,769
I live in a row of attached single family homes.

366
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:00,590
We're not a large complex.

367
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,252
Most of us chose the style of home because it's more affordable than a detached single family house.

368
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:14,736
Yet we remain full fledged homeowners were paying the same property taxes, as others have stated, as other homeowners in Medford.

369
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:24,820
responded to our emails and explained that we've been receiving waste services because quote, someone within knew the prior administration.

370
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
So it was very unfair, end quote.

371
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:38,063
What's truly unfair is despite paying the same tax rates, we are being penalized because we share walls with our neighbors and a shared wall is an arbitrary distinction.

372
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,323
It's an arbitrary boundary.

373
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:43,804
It shouldn't make a difference if there's a space or a wall between you and your neighbor.

374
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:56,107
And again, Medford just raised the taxes to increase municipal services, and here we are, higher taxes for increased services, and we're being stripped of these services.

375
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:06,309
So kind of to some of your points, targeting these smaller, less affluent areas is quite an egregious inequity.

376
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:13,530
Some of my neighbors are on fixed incomes, and this is another financial burden being placed on them.

377
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:24,711
We're all owner occupied, we are healthcare workers, we are veterans, we are teachers, we're all involved members of the community.

378
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:32,315
And I understand our city faces budget pressures, but depriving a segment of our homeowners isn't a way to help bridge that gap.

379
00:40:32,795 --> 00:40:36,738
We are single family homes and we deserve to be treated as such.

380
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,438
That's what's fair, I think.

381
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:39,579
Thank you.

382
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,180
Thank you.

383
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:45,919
Name and address record you have three minutes.

384
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:55,132
Patrick clerking 14 Bennett place, step back the camera go up.

385
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:09,098
So, to Councilor Lazaro's point this doesn't, this, this doesn't quite make sense and to Councilor Scarpelli's point there were a lot of people who are part of the decision process.

386
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:16,604
I just wanted to bring up so I also received an email from probably the same person that you all received the email from.

387
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,105
And I'm in that neighborhood now.

388
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:32,913
And to me, as we try to figure out as a city where higher density makes sense and where it doesn't make sense, this seems like an adverse incentive for people to increase their density or be willing to get on board with increased density.

389
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:35,755
So I just want to make sure that we get the incentives in line.

390
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:43,680
And I think it's really important that we figure this out early on, because it certainly, even though it seems like a relatively minor thing in the scheme of things,

391
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:52,567
it largely impacts people's views on density and views on changes to the city with zoning and development and whatnot.

392
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:54,409
So just wanted to say that.

393
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:54,769
Thank you.

394
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:56,571
Thank you.

395
00:41:56,591 --> 00:42:00,014
Anyone else would like to speak on this matter?

396
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,698
Robert, do you want to speak again?

397
00:42:04,718 --> 00:42:06,059
Are you going to put your hand down?

398
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,761
Yes, please.

399
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:16,986
Really, I think the other thing I want to encourage the mayor to be thinking about and the city council to is sustainability.

400
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:22,772
I understand that's you know a big initiative in the city of Medford free compost services for example.

401
00:42:23,253 --> 00:42:25,055
That's another thing we're not eligible for.

402
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:31,302
I just want to you know underscore that as a trustee I can tell you firsthand it has been very difficult

403
00:42:32,122 --> 00:42:36,365
To, you know, research providers and try to piece all the options together.

404
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:46,570
And so I fear with this policy that we're going to see lower composting rates, you know, in the, in the multi unit buildings, so I feel like that goes against the principles.

405
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,291
of our city government with respect to sustainability.

406
00:42:50,711 --> 00:43:09,716
And also too, within your master plan, you've talked about precincts 5-1 and 5-2, which 50 Hicks Ave falls within as being areas that need more attention, you know, due to the demographics of underprivileged people who are more likely to live there than some more affluent areas of the city.

407
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:15,698
So again, just, you know, want to encourage the mayor to take leadership here and look into this as well.

408
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:19,675
Thank you, appreciate your comment.

409
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:24,498
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this matter?

410
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,020
Seeing none, do we have any further comments from the council?

411
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,881
Councilor Lemming.

412
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:39,545
I'd just like to thank the residents who came out to talk about this.

413
00:43:39,565 --> 00:43:41,786
I think that even if we

414
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:57,885
Even if, as some of my colleagues are saying, we may not have the ability to change the contract, I'd still like to get some... Oh wait, I see that Tim McGivern has just raised his hand on Zoom, so.

415
00:43:57,906 --> 00:44:03,390
All right, I'll go to Councillor Seng and then Commissioner McGivern, Councillor Seng.

416
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:12,658
Well, I was just going to say something similar in that, in thanking the residents for speaking up and for bringing up the points that

417
00:44:13,873 --> 00:44:25,017
increased service, especially here, aligns closely with the goals of our city, with equity, with our equity plan, and with our sustainability plans as well.

418
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:31,360
And that's something that I think is important to reiterate to city administration.

419
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:34,601
Great.

420
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,162
Council Member Ayuda as well.

421
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:46,691
No, I'd like to, I mean, I would, I was going to give concluding remarks but I would like to hear what BBW director McGovern says.

422
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:49,034
Recognize Commissioner McGovern, Commissioner McGovern.

423
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,233
Hello, thank you very much for allowing me to speak.

424
00:44:56,473 --> 00:44:59,936
I noticed this was on the agenda and I listened to some folks talking.

425
00:45:00,516 --> 00:45:04,740
I'm sorry, I'm Tim McGivern, I'm the Commissioner of Public Works.

426
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,124
So I just want to make a point to respond to a couple of things.

427
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:17,170
We did have a solid waste task force that was quite involved in putting this together, and that was the first thing.

428
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,411
It wasn't done in a vacuum.

429
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:20,447
preparing the whole contract.

430
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:30,870
I believe this council was briefed on it multiple times as well, as well as someone on the council was on the task force to help create this contract.

431
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:42,393
One of the things that I haven't heard come up is the condo properties in Medford that have been paying for their own service for quite a long time.

432
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:51,697
Um, the, the, one of the points here was to try to, um, get everybody or all the properties on equal footing.

433
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:59,361
Again, um, we have, we have properties that are condo townhouse style properties in the city that already pay for their trash service.

434
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:04,263
Uh, and some like 50 X Avenue don't, they're somehow on city service.

435
00:46:04,884 --> 00:46:07,185
Uh, the norm out there in the world is for.

436
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:11,836
condo facilities, condo properties to have their own services.

437
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:20,685
The municipalities surrounding us have a cutoff as far as how many units they will service on the municipal contract.

438
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:25,470
So a lot of thought was put into this, a lot of planning.

439
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:30,244
And I just wanted to make sure that those two points were clear.

440
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:33,947
We weren't trying to cut service for folks.

441
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:46,496
We were trying to equalize service or put all condominiums on, all eligible residents on equal terms in the contract, which didn't exist prior.

442
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:50,799
In the prior contract, some properties received service, others did not.

443
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,983
So, and I could go on with examples, but I don't think we need to do that.

444
00:46:56,503 --> 00:47:00,105
So I just wanted to get those few points across.

445
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:03,047
I'm happy to answer some questions if I'm able to as well.

446
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:06,889
Councilor Scarpelli.

447
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:09,571
Thank you to Commissioner McGiven.

448
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:21,878
I appreciate what you're saying and I know that this council, some people were on the committee that negotiated or designed the contract, but my point specifically,

449
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:45,651
was that when we make changes where the where the residents that were going to be affected by these changes were they prepared because again we've heard it over and over again they were given a 60-day notice that they were going to be they were going to be dropped from from this process and then find a way to then shift their financial responsibilities to now

450
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:48,693
have to collect robbers.

451
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:51,015
So I think that that's one of my major points.

452
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:52,337
I didn't hear that.

453
00:47:53,197 --> 00:48:08,232
I want to make sure you understand that as we move forward, I think what we're seeing is a lack of information gathering and then sharing to our residents when we're making these decisions because small amounts of increase in finances

454
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:11,674
can really affect our most vulnerable members of the community.

455
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:15,036
I don't want that to be lost in the translation for what I just heard.

456
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:16,817
So I think that's very important.

457
00:48:16,837 --> 00:48:33,407
I understand that there's some limitations that what we have and if there's a way that we can revisit this and look at a more equitable process, you wish that could be the answer, but I don't want, I want to make sure as we move forward that we as a community, we as a leadership team,

458
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:41,296
look at really sending the message so our neighbors and residents are protected and they are prepared.

459
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:49,563
And I think that we're seeing it over and over again when it comes to, well, let's pass this on to the residents.

460
00:48:49,703 --> 00:48:50,524
We have an issue here.

461
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:52,946
Let's pass this fee on to the residents.

462
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:54,687
And it's hurting our residents.

463
00:48:55,127 --> 00:48:56,909
Again, our most vulnerable residents.

464
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:00,792
So I'm not being confrontational in any way.

465
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,494
I just want to make sure that these points are

466
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:08,597
brought across so as we move forward, I know that where we are with this situation, I hope we can revisit it.

467
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:12,098
Maybe after this meeting, the mayor will look at it.

468
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:19,522
And if you've discussed this with residents and told them that the mayor has an option where she can give special dispensation, great.

469
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:29,627
But with this situation, I wanna make sure as we move forward that we really take ownership and understanding that when we make these decisions again,

470
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:34,615
that people are informed and they're there.

471
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:41,921
They are protected in the process, especially when it comes to financial, uh, risks.

472
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:56,513
And, um, and again, some of the calls I did receive from senior citizens that the smallest fee affects them, and we're adding a few fees month after month.

473
00:49:56,613 --> 00:49:58,194
So again, I appreciate it.

474
00:49:58,535 --> 00:49:59,956
And thank you, Mr President.

475
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:05,808
Thank you, Councilors Carvalho, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Lemming, Mr. McIvern, your hand is still up as well.

476
00:50:07,586 --> 00:50:09,267
No, I can, I can lower it.

477
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:12,210
I think, I believe I've said what I need to say.

478
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:28,462
And Neil, I guess just in response to Councilor Scarpelli, the letters that went out did give 60 days, but I've been very direct and have reached out to everybody who received the letters at this point, I believe, or at least all the properties.

479
00:50:29,303 --> 00:50:36,168
I have the ability to grant extensions to that 60 days, which I have in multiple occasions, including 50 Hicks Avenue.

480
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:42,210
So I'm more than happy to work with folks to also help arrange service.

481
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:45,811
There have been scenarios where I have helped arrange service.

482
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:55,934
So we're trying our best not to leave people in the lurch and to provide a transitional period as well as grace periods, because we are aware it is a change.

483
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:59,015
So I'm more than willing to help out.

484
00:50:59,235 --> 00:50:59,495
Thank you.

485
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:04,017
All right, I'm gonna go to Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Lemming, then Councilor Scarpelli.

486
00:51:04,157 --> 00:51:05,057
Councilor Lazaro.

487
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:06,166
Thank you.

488
00:51:06,426 --> 00:51:14,349
I have so much respect for the people that are doing work across the city that I may not even be aware of.

489
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:24,373
I know about the Solid Waste Task Force and the work that went into getting ready to do a new contract for trash collection.

490
00:51:24,753 --> 00:51:26,694
And I think a lot of good was done there.

491
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:33,296
I think that the breakdown in my understanding of this is that there is

492
00:51:36,571 --> 00:52:06,221
No, there seems to be nothing in the contract that differentiates between an apartment building that may be managed by a large corporation and a six unit building with individual owners or small landlords where the tenants or individuals have to drive their recycling to James Street and have it compacted like every time they fill up a paper bag

493
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,121
or pay for their own garbage.

494
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:22,208
We are all paying for garbage pickup actually, which is not, I mean, it's a technicality, but when Commissioner McIvern said you have to pay for your garbage, like we are all paying for our garbage and all of our residents are paying for our garbage to be picked up and taken to Saugus.

495
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:23,469
That's what's happening now.

496
00:52:23,529 --> 00:52:28,172
It's just that some of our residents are also paying for their own garbage individually.

497
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:35,456
So I think that the logic is breaking down in that we might be asking some people to,

498
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:41,215
pay more, which I did not, again, I didn't negotiate this contract.

499
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:46,800
It just doesn't make sense to me that somebody that may have less money is paying more for the same service or paying twice.

500
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:51,704
We can't renegotiate a contract that was made for 10 years.

501
00:52:54,986 --> 00:52:58,769
And we cannot necessarily give special deals to certain

502
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:01,774
PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she-her, hers.

503
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,910
going forward when we're negotiating things like this.

504
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,212
We again, city council does not negotiate anything.

505
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:45,063
We just hear from our residents about what things are working or not working, but the mayor's office negotiates contracts and we should not be prioritizing people living in single family homes for more services because they're in single family homes.

506
00:53:45,763 --> 00:53:46,704
That doesn't make sense to me.

507
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:48,841
as a person living in a single family home.

508
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:53,369
I don't deserve more than somebody else who's living in a condo or an apartment in the city.

509
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:59,940
People should have the services that everybody has equally.

510
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,543
Thank you.

511
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:06,991
Thanks, I'll go to Council I mean then Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan Councilor let me.

512
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:08,172
Yep.

513
00:54:08,473 --> 00:54:14,758
So I just have a point that I want to make and then I have some specific questions for for Tim.

514
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:24,567
So, this, a lot of this actually relates back to goes goes back to proposition 2.5 and I'm pretty in some pretty weird ways so like.

515
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:40,056
Proposition 2.5 you know we had the first ever override for that this this past November, which went towards the school system as well as the, as well as the DPW but basically it means that the amount.

516
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:55,039
Barring new growth, the amount of money you're allowed to take in from property taxes can only go up 2.5% every year, unless either you have new growth or you have an override, which the residents vote on.

517
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:57,379
Now, inflation is usually about 3.1%.

518
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,541
So that means that over time, the value of the budget gets smaller and smaller.

519
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:09,024
It and it compounds it compounds exponentially.

520
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:16,250
And so when the budget gets smaller and smaller, that means you have weird situations like this where it doesn't actually end up saving residents money.

521
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,692
It just ends up distributing.

522
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:24,857
It just ends up redistributing these fees in in in different ways.

523
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:29,981
In this case, the point that Councilor Lazaro was making was that everybody is paying for everybody's trash.

524
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:34,705
But the folks in condos and townhouses are

525
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:37,726
also paying for their own trash on top of them.

526
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:47,628
So this is a systemic issue like so many things that we experience in City Hall.

527
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:52,009
And I don't want anybody to make any mistake that this is systemic.

528
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:56,330
I don't think that there's like one party that you can blame.

529
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:59,531
It's the current system that we have in Massachusetts that's causing these

530
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:05,496
unequal offsets on to on to certain residents and that is that is unfortunate.

531
00:56:06,017 --> 00:56:14,206
But the questions that I had for DBW Commissioner McGivern were first, if you'd be so kind to answer them.

532
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:21,954
Just to clarify because one resident brought that up is, is there a legal means in

533
00:56:22,775 --> 00:56:32,028
a contract from to distinguish between a townhouse, like the residents were talking about and a condo I just want to, I just want that to be very clear.

534
00:56:32,048 --> 00:56:36,073
And was, was that a, was that an option.

535
00:56:38,850 --> 00:57:02,433
when the contract is being negotiated and what and the second question if you have this number off the top of your head is what approximately is the ratio between townhouse like the number of townhouses in Medford and the number of condos and I don't I don't expect you to have that number off the top of your head but if you did it would be it would be helpful for the for the conversation so if if Tim is still on.

536
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:06,006
Yep, I'm here.

537
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:10,927
So the 1st question, I'm sure there is a way to do it.

538
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:21,431
You know, contract is just an agreement the way this current eligibility is written is, I believe I don't have in front of me, but it's something like condo facility or condo property.

539
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:23,511
And.

540
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:31,474
Sure, I suppose the type of building is distinguishes townhouse style condominium property.

541
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:36,509
to a high-rise building, condominium building property.

542
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:47,252
Those are two different types of buildings, but they're both condominium properties with a master deed and individual deeds for each condominium.

543
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:54,594
So I believe the legal arrangement are the same between the townhouse condominium property

544
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:58,017
one building high-rise property.

545
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:02,878
So I guess that's the answer to that question.

546
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:10,100
When we were discussing it, we were discussing them as condominium properties.

547
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,961
We have different types of condominium properties in Medford.

548
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:21,382
We have a townhouse style, like 50 Hicks Avenue and Amaranth Place is another one that the people are familiar with.

549
00:58:22,023 --> 00:58:26,187
Uh, and then you have condominium buildings that are, you know, many stories high.

550
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:30,851
And then you have condominium buildings that are four or five or six units.

551
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:32,973
Um, some that are two units.

552
00:58:33,493 --> 00:58:38,057
So there's a wide variety of condominium, um, condominiums in Medford.

553
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:40,959
And, uh, what was your, what was your second question again?

554
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:41,340
I'm sorry.

555
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:49,587
Um, what approximately is the ratio between, um, town townhouses and

556
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,481
uh, condos in Medford.

557
00:58:52,521 --> 00:59:07,448
And I don't, I don't expect you to have those numbers off the top of their head, your head, but like how many, about how many of our, uh, 26,000 plus units are townhouses like the ones that residents are describing and about how many of them are condos.

558
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:09,469
I don't know.

559
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:14,111
Um, I don't know the answer off the top of my head and I'm not even sure I have the answer in my office.

560
00:59:14,511 --> 00:59:14,611
Um,

561
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:29,620
We did try to look at the assessor's data to see if there was an easy way to distinguish between the different styles of condominiums, but there really isn't.

562
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:39,408
It's just a condominium property with the different units listed and the square footages, not whether or not it's a, what type of building it is.

563
00:59:41,465 --> 00:59:43,366
The information I'm sure does exist.

564
00:59:43,826 --> 00:59:45,566
We just don't have it or I don't have it.

565
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:56,450
It could probably be determined maybe through the building department information on whether or not a condominium property is one type of a building or a different type of a building.

566
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:00,612
So I know we have lots of condominiums in the city though.

567
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:02,532
Thank you.

568
01:00:05,413 --> 01:00:06,714
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

569
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:12,647
Thank you, President Behrs.

570
01:00:13,168 --> 01:00:16,049
I appreciate Councilor Lemming for bringing this up today.

571
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:23,254
And I also want to thank the residents for communicating their concerns to us.

572
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:27,796
And thank you to Commissioner McGivern for being on the line to talk about this with us this evening.

573
01:00:29,478 --> 01:00:35,987
I just want to say at the outset, you know, if I were in the position of these residents who are having their long standing waste removal service revoked.

574
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:37,589
I feel your pain.

575
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:43,638
If I was used to getting service for no additional cost and now there's an additional cost I'd be extremely frustrated.

576
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:49,545
So I feel for you and I'm glad that we're having this conversation.

577
01:00:49,565 --> 01:01:01,479
At the same time, I was also the counselor that served on the solid waste task force that Commissioner McGibbon referenced, where we were talking about the principles that we wanted to go into this new contract.

578
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,743
As we prepared for a contract that would hopefully last us a long time and be as efficient as economical as possible.

579
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:23,971
It's in this environment where there's ever fiercer competition for limited city resources and trash specifically is getting really, really expensive year over year, which I know we we've seen in every operating budget for the past several years.

580
01:01:27,332 --> 01:01:48,953
As I remember from our conversations on the Solid Waste Task Force and when the output of the Solid Waste Task Force was brought to this council, if I'm remembering correctly, and the task force was two long years ago, but I'm sure that Commissioner McEvern can correct me, if I'm mischaracterizing anything, there are some logistical reasons that multi-unit buildings like condos, it doesn't make as much sense for them to be in the same trash system as the rest of the city.

581
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:50,574
For example, sometimes,

582
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:54,779
Properties that are set up like this don't use barrels at all.

583
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:55,620
They use dumpsters.

584
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,641
It's a separate system.

585
01:01:57,382 --> 01:02:00,266
But I think we all agree here that we need parity in who's getting what.

586
01:02:01,007 --> 01:02:04,672
And we don't want some condo dwellers getting service and others getting not.

587
01:02:04,732 --> 01:02:10,759
It seems to me that the operative issue here is the communication and that sense of a lack of fairness.

588
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:25,183
some residents observing that they're having their service revoked while they're looking across the street and saying there's a unit that seems really similar to mine that gets to keep its service and it's really not clear what that algorithm is that's making the distinction.

589
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:35,105
So you know I really appreciate Commissioner McGibbon's perspective on this and I think that you know this is a

590
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:59,873
unglamorous issue with a lot of growing pains but we all want to get to a place where as a city we can afford our extremely expensive waste contract and as individual households everybody is getting what they need and not paying through the nose and I think a really important place to start is getting some better communication from the administration to this council with clearer broken down information on why

591
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:05,656
Some units are seeing their service revoked, while others that seem really similar are not.

592
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:25,367
And if there are cases of unfairness where this, I think, a policy that was conceived with the best of intentions is hitting some snags, then I think we should move that conversation forward and see how can we make some targeted tweaks so that people who deserve equal levels of service are not inadvertently getting left out.

593
01:03:25,948 --> 01:03:26,188
Thank you.

594
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:29,496
Thank you.

595
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:30,558
Councillor Callahan.

596
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:32,640
Thanks.

597
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,823
I know that this contract is already signed in the next few years.

598
01:03:36,424 --> 01:03:42,391
I always like to look at what other cities have done and what creative solutions they have come up with.

599
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:48,698
And I hope the administration can think in that way as we look toward future contracts.

600
01:03:49,578 --> 01:03:55,680
I'm just going to mention some that I literally looked up right now that we, you know, perhaps could have been more equitable.

601
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:02,242
There are ways to determine between corporate-owned multifamily and owner-occupied smaller condos and townhouses.

602
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:12,465
There are also ways to serve these multifamily units that are cheaper, having curbside service

603
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:21,451
allowing them to pay for city curbside service instead of then having to use a private hauler that makes it cheaper for them.

604
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:28,897
Another idea is using shared roll carts or dumpsters for these multi-unit dwellings.

605
01:04:29,637 --> 01:04:34,721
They are provided by the city but they're shared and so it makes it a lot cheaper for the city to be able to provide that service.

606
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:43,546
And then there are pay as you throw programs, which means you get a certain amount of trash volume either in bags or in bins.

607
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:46,787
And above that amount, that's when you have to pay.

608
01:04:47,027 --> 01:04:51,730
And that can be applied either to only the multi-unit dwellings, or it can be applied across the city.

609
01:04:52,650 --> 01:05:00,254
So there are a number of ways that I think as our trash services grow in cost, that we might be able to limit those costs.

610
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:07,027
while also being equitable across the city and making sure that we're serving all residents equally.

611
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,548
Thanks.

612
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:09,928
Thank you.

613
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,609
I do see one person who'd like to speak, who hasn't spoken yet.

614
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:20,111
And Robert, I do see your hand on Zoom, but every resident has three minutes and then one minute of follow-up.

615
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:22,852
So you've already spoken on this issue.

616
01:05:23,032 --> 01:05:26,873
You can speak again during the public participation section of the meeting for another three minutes.

617
01:05:27,613 --> 01:05:29,494
And I do see a hand for someone who hasn't spoken yet.

618
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:33,395
So we'll start at the podium, then we'll go to Zoom, then we'll come back to the podium.

619
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:35,316
Name and address for the record, please.

620
01:05:36,656 --> 01:05:37,616
One second, yes, Joan.

621
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:39,117
You'll have three minutes.

622
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,876
Thank you very much, President Villareal.

623
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:43,817
I think this is a very unfortunate situation.

624
01:05:43,877 --> 01:05:55,103
I just wanted to clarify something related to the misinformation that I keep hearing since last year repeatedly about the Proposition 2.5 on inflation.

625
01:05:55,704 --> 01:06:02,888
So as I said, it is a complete misinformation that Proposition 2.5 implies that cities cannot increase revenue fast enough to account for inflation.

626
01:06:03,588 --> 01:06:19,916
So proceeding two and a half excludes from the limitation tax level increases new growth and I have the data from last year since I already talked I don't have the updated data but I'm going to mention it in fiscal year 25 the amount of property taxes collected for new growth was estimated to be 2.5 million dollars

627
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:28,523
Together with the statutory 2.5% increase, the total fiscal year appropriate tax revenue increase is approximately, or was, 4.3%.

628
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:38,892
The August PCE, which was the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, was 2.2% annual change in last August.

629
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:47,041
So as a result, the city is increasing or was increasing property tax revenue by more than 2% above inflation.

630
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:51,145
It is a complete myth that cities cannot keep up with the rate of inflation.

631
01:06:51,666 --> 01:06:54,489
And Councilor Lemming mentioned that the average rate of inflation was about 3.1%.

632
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,491
That is also misinformation.

633
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:00,094
The average annual rate of inflation in the United States, for example, between the year 2000 and 2019 was 2.1%.

634
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:08,524
I believe 3.1% might have been the latest monthly for this August.

635
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:13,409
But as you can tell, for example, between 2000 and 2019, it was 2.1%.

636
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:23,280
So without even considering any new growth for 20 years, just by increasing the statutory 2.5%, we would have beaten inflation.

637
01:07:23,981 --> 01:07:31,027
So I don't know why it keeps being mentioned that we cannot raise revenue faster than inflation.

638
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,308
That is not true at all.

639
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,391
We just need to grow and that should be a priority.

640
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:40,696
And even in some years that we don't grow, it's not necessarily true that we will be below inflation.

641
01:07:40,776 --> 01:07:41,316
Thank you so much.

642
01:07:42,898 --> 01:07:43,258
Thank you.

643
01:07:43,298 --> 01:07:44,259
We'll go to Zoom.

644
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,623
Emily Schwartz, name and address for the record of three minutes.

645
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:52,257
Hi, Emily Carney, 50 Hicks Ave.

646
01:07:53,458 --> 01:08:00,464
I want to respond to the point made by Tim that this contract made Medford more fair, which I see how that was the goal.

647
01:08:00,484 --> 01:08:05,209
I agree that it was a problem if services were distributed unfairly.

648
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:09,513
What I disagree with is that this contract landed on a more fair solution.

649
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:10,694
I actually think it made

650
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:17,440
inequalities worse rather than better by drawing a arbitrary line to decide who receives services.

651
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,345
So I just ask how is a five-family house any less deserving than a four-family house?

652
01:08:23,086 --> 01:08:28,891
Thank you Councilor Callahan for mentioning some examples of potential solutions modeled by other towns.

653
01:08:29,032 --> 01:08:30,633
I want to mention a few that I know of.

654
01:08:31,654 --> 01:08:48,848
Neighboring towns that do not service condominiums such as Everett Malden Somerville in Boston all offer residential tax owner occupied exemptions that are structured in a progressive manner where those with lower property tax bill receive a higher percentage discount on their taxes.

655
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:56,853
And so I would just say that it is an oversimplification to say that Medford is simply doing what most other towns are already doing.

656
01:08:57,574 --> 01:09:02,557
And then, lastly, regardless of your opinion about how condominiums should or should not be serviced.

657
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:06,379
I just want to reiterate an earlier point by Laura Lafferty that.

658
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:10,999
Townhouse style homes are defined by some as single family homes.

659
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:22,264
So regardless of how you feel, we at 50 Hicks Ave are not able to put a dumpster on our property like a large condo building is, and in many ways don't resemble a condo building like some of the larger ones.

660
01:09:22,464 --> 01:09:27,146
We should not be treated as one, nor should any other townhouse style residences in the city.

661
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:27,587
Thank you.

662
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:30,268
Thank you.

663
01:09:30,348 --> 01:09:31,769
We'll go back to the podium.

664
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:33,689
Name and address for the record, please.

665
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:34,670
And you'll have three minutes.

666
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:37,074
State Mayor 373 Riverside Ave.

667
01:09:37,735 --> 01:09:47,332
I do want to thank Robert Carney for reaching out to me as well about this, you know, brought some awareness and obviously he's done that for the rest of you so thank you to him.

668
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,922
So a couple of questions through the chair, cause I'm confused in this.

669
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:58,206
Do we have any idea of the magnitude of the cost quote unquote savings by the change?

670
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:08,653
If you look at 50 Hicks Ave, I'm spitballing here, but it's probably on the order of $40 a month, which is, you know, just up just shy of $500 a year per building.

671
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:12,936
So when you net that up 50 Hicks Ave comes out to roughly, you know, $11,000, give or take.

672
01:10:15,565 --> 01:10:23,992
What is the magnitude of this change I think that's an important question in terms of dollars, where all the time energy pain.

673
01:10:24,913 --> 01:10:28,276
If you're saving only 20 grand is it worth the 20 grand to pick this fight.

674
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:29,057
Right.

675
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:32,400
So I think that's something that hopefully you guys can get answered.

676
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:39,538
as well as I keep hearing single family home versus condominium.

677
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:48,766
So would this policy apply to a two family, would a two family condominiumized home?

678
01:10:49,466 --> 01:10:51,768
So it's only a single structure and that happens a lot, right?

679
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:55,652
Where someone buys it up and they sell each unit as a separate condo for a million bucks a piece.

680
01:10:56,913 --> 01:11:00,876
Will they now not have city trash services as a result of this?

681
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:03,318
Excuse me?

682
01:11:04,988 --> 01:11:07,290
I think it's any building over four units.

683
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:14,856
Okay, so, but that's technically not a single family home so when the comparison is well single family home can have this versus a condo.

684
01:11:15,497 --> 01:11:28,127
I think maybe condo is the wrong metric, comparing to single family, it really has to do with, I think the way it was worded was the number of units holding the same address, whether that's right or wrong.

685
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:48,860
just when you're asking for your data, I don't think just finding the total number of condominiums is the right metric to go for either, because if you include all the two or three family homes that are condominiumized that still have individual trash services and pay property tax, right, and get those services, it's gonna screw up your math.

686
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:56,363
So maybe I suggest being a little clearer when you're asking the mayor and Director McGibbon for the data that you're seeking.

687
01:11:56,863 --> 01:11:57,083
Thank you.

688
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:58,968
Thank you.

689
01:11:58,988 --> 01:12:05,434
Go ahead, name and address record, please.

690
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:06,254
You have three minutes.

691
01:12:06,675 --> 01:12:08,957
Yeah, 4-9, Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

692
01:12:08,977 --> 01:12:11,659
I just wanted to point out one thing here because it was mentioned a few times.

693
01:12:12,973 --> 01:12:20,995
This contract may have been settled and signed and executed, but you can amend contracts.

694
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:23,075
You can negotiate an amendment to the contract.

695
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:28,516
It's not like this is set in stone and everyone's screwed for the next 10 years.

696
01:12:29,796 --> 01:12:36,977
It is the mayor's office and you have to have a competent mayor and staff to do it, but yeah, they can negotiate an amendment to fix this.

697
01:12:37,697 --> 01:12:38,418
Just keep that in mind.

698
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:39,638
I just want to make sure that that was clear.

699
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,801
said a few times that this is kind of dead in the water because it's signed.

700
01:12:47,861 --> 01:12:48,341
Thank you.

701
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:57,183
On the motion by Councillor Lemming, seconded by Councillor Callaghan to approve and request the update from the administration.

702
01:12:57,203 --> 01:12:59,463
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

703
01:13:02,264 --> 01:13:03,104
Councillor Callaghan.

704
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:05,524
Vice President Collins.

705
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:06,164
Yes.

706
01:13:07,504 --> 01:13:08,345
Councillor Zara.

707
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:08,905
Yes.

708
01:13:09,965 --> 01:13:10,565
Councillor Lemming.

709
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:13,059
Council Scott belly.

710
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:16,744
Council saying President beers.

711
01:13:16,904 --> 01:13:25,955
Yes, seven affirmative no negative the motion passes to 5149 offered by President bears resolution to establish recruitment hiring process to the city clerk.

712
01:13:26,637 --> 01:13:32,321
Whereas City Clerk Curtabese has informed the City Council that he will resign his position as City Clerk effective December 31st, 2025.

713
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:40,426
And whereas the City Council thanks Clerk Curtabese for his years of dedicated service to the residents of the City of Medford and to the City Council.

714
01:13:41,027 --> 01:13:49,853
And whereas the City Council President has worked with the City Solicitor and Director of Human Resources to outline a recruitment and hiring process for the appointment of a City Clerk for the City of Medford.

715
01:13:50,413 --> 01:13:55,837
Now therefore be it resolved by the City, Medford City Council that we adopt the following process for recruitment and hiring of a City Clerk.

716
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:59,632
Step one, human resources requisition form.

717
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:05,837
A job description will be created for review and approval of the city council.

718
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:09,781
We have a job description attached tonight and a vote on it.

719
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,643
If we vote on this thing, on this item.

720
01:14:13,764 --> 01:14:15,886
Step two, advertisement of position.

721
01:14:16,006 --> 01:14:18,268
The position will be posted for at least two weeks.

722
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,531
interview process.

723
01:14:21,572 --> 01:14:29,600
City Council President and Director of HR will review all applications, finalize a list of candidates to interview who meet minimum requirements.

724
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,881
Interviews will be scheduled.

725
01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:37,388
Initial interviews will be conducted by the Chief of Staff, Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Elections Manager, and a City Council designee.

726
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,632
Candidates will be asked the same standard questions.

727
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:50,423
There will be a second interview, which would also include a city council designate the building commissioner and the city solicitor along with the director of HR.

728
01:14:52,107 --> 01:14:54,508
Once that process is complete, there would be rankings.

729
01:14:54,788 --> 01:14:57,549
The top ranking three candidates will be notified of their selection.

730
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:02,710
And after a reference check, their names would be made public and submitted to the city council for action.

731
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:09,272
So once the city council, once the final candidates are selected, HR will schedule final interviews.

732
01:15:09,852 --> 01:15:15,274
The city council, before the city council, and then the city council would appoint one of those candidates by a majority vote.

733
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:19,275
So that is the process that has been outlined.

734
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:24,620
There are two city council designees for the two sets of interviews.

735
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:36,344
And I am wondering what folks think on the council if they want to designate folks here, if they want me to designate them after we approve this resolution.

736
01:15:36,364 --> 01:15:42,666
But other than that, I think the documents in our agenda are relatively self-explanatory.

737
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:47,308
And with that, I will recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Lazar.

738
01:15:47,568 --> 01:15:48,308
Councilor Scarpelli.

739
01:15:48,755 --> 01:15:50,096
Thank you, Mr. President.

740
01:15:51,117 --> 01:16:09,092
I can appreciate most of this, but I really think that as the only position that this council is responsible for overseeing and hiring, I think it's important that there should be, I think, a first phase where that all the counselors

741
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:19,331
are involved in reviewing what resumes and applications that are sent to HR.

742
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:28,773
And then I would respectfully move to have a representative speak in our stead.

743
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:35,175
But I think that it's important that as we go through the first step, I think it's important that all of us that are

744
01:16:38,008 --> 01:16:46,024
responsible for this position that we all see the applicants and then we can all share input and what we think.

745
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:46,726
I think that it

746
01:16:48,785 --> 01:17:05,199
In all due respect to my fellow counselors, I think it's important that at least for the first round, I think we should all be together and reviewing the applicants and then moving forward to the next phase, I can understand.

747
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:13,546
And I would respect that the designee would then move the process along with the HR and the city representative.

748
01:17:13,626 --> 01:17:16,869
But to full disclosure, this position,

749
01:17:17,743 --> 01:17:21,322
in the ordinance is the employee of this council.

750
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:37,717
And I think it's important that we look, we have eyes in all of the first applicants because it might be candidates that when we look at, it's going to be very different than what the HR director sees or what the chief of staff sees and says, this is a better candidate.

751
01:17:37,757 --> 01:17:51,342
So I think it'd be important that if we can amend this, Mr. President, that we set up a phase prior to, uh, any, even just the first phase that reviewing all applicants that the council meets to

752
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:54,084
go through that process together.

753
01:17:54,404 --> 01:17:56,905
I would make that in the form of a motion before moving on with this.

754
01:17:56,965 --> 01:18:07,732
I feel strongly enough that I wouldn't support this unless we have, as a council, the person that's going to be working for us that we see all the candidates.

755
01:18:08,273 --> 01:18:10,474
And I would appreciate that respect.

756
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:11,034
So thank you.

757
01:18:11,495 --> 01:18:15,137
I'll recognize Councilor Lozaro, and then I recognize the HR Director, Councilor Lozaro.

758
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:16,943
Thank you.

759
01:18:17,283 --> 01:18:22,145
I have a couple of notes from the job description that I was reading over.

760
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:23,245
There are a couple of typos.

761
01:18:26,446 --> 01:18:29,447
Should I mention that here or should I email that to the HR director?

762
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:31,628
Are they substantive or just?

763
01:18:31,928 --> 01:18:32,568
They're typos.

764
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,428
Okay, yeah, I think you can just email that along.

765
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:36,009
Okay.

766
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:42,351
I do think that Councillor Scarpelli's point is valid.

767
01:18:45,092 --> 01:18:45,692
I think that

768
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:54,011
it would be valuable for all of us to review the candidates.

769
01:18:55,832 --> 01:19:07,504
I don't think that the, since the city clerk is the only employee of the council, I just think it would be valuable, but I know we run into open meeting law issues, so.

770
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:11,339
I'll email the edits, thank you.

771
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,519
Thank you, you can email this to Lisa Crowley on the job description.

772
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:24,622
Yeah, I'll recognize Councilor Kellyanne in just a second, but to Councilor Lazaro and Councilor Scarpelli's point, the question was like confidentiality in some way.

773
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:36,665
If we are meeting, and I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm not saying I wouldn't vote for a motion to amend this, but the initial thinking talking to HR and the city solicitor was that if somebody has to

774
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:44,803
have their name made public to apply for the position that would reduce the pool of people who may be willing to apply for the position.

775
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:45,864
That was the initial thought.

776
01:19:46,624 --> 01:19:48,045
Just saying where we're coming from.

777
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:55,909
I'll recognize Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Lazaro.

778
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:56,709
Councilor Callahan.

779
01:19:56,729 --> 01:19:58,870
Thank you.

780
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:04,893
I had a couple of points that I was hoping to add to the job description in essential functions.

781
01:20:06,948 --> 01:20:07,769
appropriate to bring up here?

782
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:07,869
Yeah.

783
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,010
Right.

784
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:20,801
Um and these are basically ones where I I feel uh I just wanna make sure that these are things that are happening in the clerk's office and I I think having them written on the job description is probably good.

785
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:31,711
Um the first is to and I did send this in an email to the clerk and President Bears just now to track and coordinate follow-up actions arising from city council and committee meetings.

786
01:20:32,672 --> 01:20:41,544
communicating directives and information requests to relevant city departments, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining records of progress and completion.

787
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:43,868
That's one.

788
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:46,065
Should I pause?

789
01:20:46,085 --> 01:20:47,346
Okay.

790
01:20:47,566 --> 01:20:58,712
The second one is providing timely and accurate post-meeting deliverables to city councilors, including updates on motions, ordinances, and directives in process, ensuring council members are informed of progress and next steps.

791
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:07,817
Now, maybe those are, you know, a little similar to each other, but I just want to make sure that the follow-up actions are being taken to speak to city staff.

792
01:21:07,857 --> 01:21:08,978
That's the first half.

793
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:12,500
The second part is to communicate with councilors about

794
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,742
the updates that they that they have coming back to them.

795
01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:20,765
All right.

796
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:24,367
I can come back to you or I can go to Lisa Crowley and solicitor Foley.

797
01:21:24,387 --> 01:21:26,488
That again, in our rules, I think that the

798
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:44,477
the order of business and the employee that falls under this body to say that there's confidentiality issues that wouldn't pertain to us because we would be the hiring body.

799
01:21:44,497 --> 01:21:46,078
This person is working directly with us.

800
01:21:47,098 --> 01:21:51,460
It would be simply as we've done in the past when we hired

801
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,244
Our city clerk her to bees after city clerk been retired.

802
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:07,956
We would retire to executive session and discuss any confidential information that we keep between ourselves.

803
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:16,477
as we have in the past with very private information that we know that goes on in that room.

804
01:22:16,537 --> 01:22:28,199
So I don't think that there is a reasonable answer that I'll hear from the solicitor or from the HR director that will change my mind, Mr. President.

805
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:37,822
I think it's important that this body, this is our responsibility, this person is working for us, and we should be directly involved at least in the first step of viewing

806
01:22:39,462 --> 01:22:56,657
The first of the round of applicants that come our way with all of the requirements that are vetted through the HR department that we sit in we negotiate that with them, and then move forward with the hiring process to say that this confidentiality issues, and that this

807
01:22:57,618 --> 01:23:10,967
that I don't buy that for the fact that we've sat in that room with the city solicitor, with the law department, with the HR director on some pretty important information that has to stay in that room.

808
01:23:11,027 --> 01:23:19,053
So that would eliminate any concerns or issues with open meeting law violations and any confidential concerns.

809
01:23:19,113 --> 01:23:20,194
So thank you, Mr. President.

810
01:23:22,136 --> 01:23:27,363
I do want to be clear like I did advocate that all the counselors would be able to review the initial applications.

811
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:37,316
And this is what the solicitor and HR director said so just wanted to state that I'm going to recognize the HR director and the city solicitor.

812
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:41,787
I'll go to the HR director first.

813
01:23:41,827 --> 01:23:43,708
There's a couple of items.

814
01:23:43,748 --> 01:23:47,931
It looks like there's some amendments that Councilor Callahan would like to make to the job description.

815
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:51,374
A couple of typos that Councilor Lazaro would like to correct.

816
01:23:51,514 --> 01:24:01,701
And then the main question from Councilor Scarpelli, which is how can we amend the process so that councilors can review the initial applications and then move them into the interview process?

817
01:24:01,741 --> 01:24:02,902
So go ahead, Lisa.

818
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,009
Okay, thank you.

819
01:24:05,049 --> 01:24:07,313
Through you, Mr. President to the council.

820
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:16,466
Yeah, we wouldn't have any problem with the counselors getting copies of all the resumes of those applicants who meet the minimum qualifications.

821
01:24:17,007 --> 01:24:18,709
Typically, what my office does will

822
01:24:20,652 --> 01:24:22,313
file through all the applications.

823
01:24:22,373 --> 01:24:25,974
Some people just apply and they don't actually meet those minimum requirements.

824
01:24:26,474 --> 01:24:32,136
So those would not come across to the council unless they wanted to see all of them.

825
01:24:32,576 --> 01:24:34,196
But we wouldn't have a problem.

826
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:46,120
Again, it is your appointee if the council is wanting to get copies of all the resumes in a packet before we start the actual process that's been put in front of you tonight.

827
01:24:47,342 --> 01:24:51,629
And we'll check on those spelling errors if you send them to me tonight.

828
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:12,927
I would be happy to receive packets for sure, but I also I wonder if we could do separate meetings with without being in a quorum of counselors to meet the candidates once they move to maybe move to a certain level or something.

829
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:19,408
I'm just trying to think about a way to not have to make the candidates be publicly interviewed.

830
01:25:19,468 --> 01:25:21,269
I mean, obviously, that's not what we would want to do.

831
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:23,449
The final three would be so that right.

832
01:25:23,489 --> 01:25:24,049
Yeah, right.

833
01:25:24,129 --> 01:25:27,730
And they would, I'm sure they would have to agree to that anyway, because this is a very public position.

834
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:28,010
But

835
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:39,375
I mean, prior to that we wouldn't want to lose the opportunity to review somebody that might be eliminated when it could be somebody that would be a good match.

836
01:25:45,142 --> 01:26:11,160
we can we can do the review of the applications we can review the applications first and then we can go to executive session where it is confidential that we can discuss as a council and what we who we feel that uh candidates that we can then recommend or move forward as our right as as counselors for this appoints appointee so um I

837
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:23,234
I appreciate that we can view those applications but I think that's important that after we do those applications that we do call for a committee of the whole that then.

838
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,742
moves to executive session that we can have a discussion on candidates where it's private.

839
01:26:30,162 --> 01:26:37,025
We're not sharing any information that's to the public, but then we can talk as a council.

840
01:26:37,065 --> 01:26:41,727
This is our team and this is our responsibility.

841
01:26:41,747 --> 01:26:44,508
I think it's important that we share our thoughts on candidates.

842
01:26:44,548 --> 01:26:48,690
So I'm going to stick with my motion, Mr. President, if we

843
01:26:49,830 --> 01:27:03,998
After viewing the applications that we call for a, a, a commuter the whole that that moves to executive session, and then we could then leave it up to your.

844
01:27:05,522 --> 01:27:16,491
your leadership, Mr President, to then share those recommendations to the HR director and then move forward with that designee as we go on to the interview process.

845
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:19,534
I feel that's a reasonable request.

846
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:30,963
I don't think that that's something that will put anybody's personal agenda public, but I think it would make me feel confident in the person that's hopefully that

847
01:27:31,654 --> 01:27:37,880
in November, I'm elected again that I can work with and understand that my colleagues all were part of that process.

848
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,961
So thank you, Mr. President.

849
01:27:40,042 --> 01:27:40,423
Thank you.

850
01:27:40,643 --> 01:27:48,291
I'm going to go to Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan just to clarify Councilor Scarpelli, what you're saying is you'd like for the Councilors to receive all the applications.

851
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:54,457
And then once that has closed to meet an executive session to decide who should move to the interview process.

852
01:28:04,099 --> 01:28:11,241
Like out of eight, let's say that's a process through us that then we have the system in place where we have a designee.

853
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:12,801
I hope that makes sense, Mr. President.

854
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:20,163
I think you summed it up pretty succinctly, but I don't want to have anything lost in translation.

855
01:28:20,183 --> 01:28:20,623
So thank you.

856
01:28:20,663 --> 01:28:20,903
All right.

857
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,324
I'll go to Vice President Collins and then Councilor Callahan.

858
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:25,785
Thank you.

859
01:28:25,805 --> 01:28:31,250
Yeah, I just briefly wanted to state that I think I agree with Councilors Carpelli and President Behrs on this.

860
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:39,578
I think it would probably leave all councilors with a greater feeling of involvement and peace of mind as we advance

861
01:28:41,798 --> 01:28:50,726
potential applicants for this role in the process if we've had a chance to not only review resumes at the beginning but meet once confidentially to discuss them.

862
01:28:50,746 --> 01:29:02,216
I know that solicitor Foley is on the line and if there's something I'm missing here for why it wouldn't be possible for us to have that conversation in an executive session

863
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:16,583
confidentially without the names of resumes being published, you know, in much the same way that we have executive sessions on other matters concerning personnel or specific names that are never an agenda and always confidential.

864
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:26,529
I'd like to hear that explanation because right now I think that I would also, it would be nice to begin this process just as a council and be able to discuss our first steps before proceeding.

865
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:27,089
Thank you.

866
01:29:32,525 --> 01:29:32,805
Thank you.

867
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:43,833
I would like to ask about the feasibility of having the all of the interviews recorded and having the recordings available to city counselors to review.

868
01:29:46,622 --> 01:29:55,668
back to the HR director and then also the solicitor if you'd like to chime in.

869
01:29:56,168 --> 01:30:04,054
It sounds like the request is that the council review all of the applications and then meet in executive session and decide who to move to the interview stage.

870
01:30:04,594 --> 01:30:09,257
And then also there's a request that the interviews be recorded so counselors could view them.

871
01:30:11,499 --> 01:30:14,821
Lisa, Kevin, what are the thoughts there?

872
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:22,477
So, again, through you, Mr. President, like I said before, that would be fine.

873
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:28,540
We could always send those packets out to the council before your meeting.

874
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:34,423
And then if you went into executive session, a lot of these people apply and that's why we talked about confidentiality.

875
01:30:34,904 --> 01:30:38,867
And their current employees don't realize that they've applied to a position.

876
01:30:39,387 --> 01:30:42,529
So that's why I would like to keep those names obviously confidential.

877
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:49,073
As far as recordings, we typically don't record interviews other than our police force.

878
01:30:49,513 --> 01:30:53,055
So it's not something we have the capability of in my office.

879
01:30:54,256 --> 01:30:56,318
Typically, we don't record.

880
01:30:58,178 --> 01:31:10,107
interviews, but if it's something the council is looking to do, we'd have to maybe defer to Kevin to see if there's anything that he can see that would allow us not to record.

881
01:31:10,568 --> 01:31:14,431
But we wouldn't have the technology, so we'd have to figure that out through the IT department.

882
01:31:17,113 --> 01:31:27,601
Solicitor Foley, could you comment on the executive session for review of the initial applications and then also the issue of recording interviews?

883
01:31:28,658 --> 01:31:29,559
Thank you, Mr. President.

884
01:31:30,279 --> 01:31:46,729
First and foremost, I want to say to some of the remarks I've heard already that, you know, the objective here really is, um, to find the most qualified individual, um, to fill the position as the city clerk, um, to serve the city council and the city of Medfin.

885
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:56,876
And so I think what we've kind of put forward for your reaction is kind of a hybrid of the standard hiring and recruiting process that we use.

886
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:09,040
in city hall now for department heads with some modification, of course, having, uh, the city council president, uh, heavily involved with the, with all aspects of it.

887
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:18,548
And we thought that probably made sense in terms of streamlining the process, trying to move forward on this in a, in a faster manner.

888
01:32:18,568 --> 01:32:22,331
Um, with some of the considerations being given to.

889
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:27,707
trying to recruit the highest qualified candidates to serve in the position.

890
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:44,950
Having been involved with this in a prior life as an elected official in my community, I know what happens with some of these recruitment processes when the candidates' names become revealed publicly too soon in the process.

891
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:50,191
Sometimes it creates an effect of people withdrawing from the position.

892
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:52,292
And I don't think that's what you want to see happen.

893
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:59,232
Uh, the most qualified candidates, uh, apply, um, be vetted.

894
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:08,577
Um, and, you know, of course with the city council president, I think that all of you probably trust the judgment of the city council president.

895
01:33:09,277 --> 01:33:17,180
Um, although I'm hearing some remarks tonight that makes me wonder how much your trust to city council president, but I think that certainly it's your process.

896
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,802
You have to decide what I would want to see from the council is.

897
01:33:21,577 --> 01:33:23,659
some sort of a modification in writing.

898
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:28,024
I react a lot better to writing and seeing how this is all going to work.

899
01:33:28,847 --> 01:33:34,069
Um, having you look at all the initial applications, I don't see a problem with that.

900
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:48,556
I don't know the answer offhand to the question of, um, going into executive session to discuss all the applicants to the position on whether that will be a proper use or a legal use or a qualified use.

901
01:33:48,616 --> 01:33:49,696
I'd have to look into that.

902
01:33:49,776 --> 01:33:55,739
I had my cheat sheet with me on that, but I don't have it with me right now, uh, for executive session.

903
01:33:55,779 --> 01:33:58,140
So I need to look at that and the idea of.

904
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:10,549
um, um, you know, uh, recording each of the candidates in all of their interviews, um, may create more problems than what it's worth.

905
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:13,533
I think that relying on the people that serve in those

906
01:34:14,345 --> 01:34:27,429
on those subcommittees to do those interviews to pull forward the most qualified candidates with a member of the city council there and present and giving remarks to them may be the best way.

907
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:35,891
Interviewing them all and recording them all, I want to tell you, creates a public records issue that all of those recordings now

908
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:41,956
because we have them subject to disclosure under the public records law.

909
01:34:42,036 --> 01:34:50,923
And so although we'll ask standard questions, there may be candidates that don't want their interviews to become public record.

910
01:34:51,384 --> 01:34:54,726
And I would have to disclose them as the public records officer.

911
01:34:54,787 --> 01:34:56,288
So you may have candidates

912
01:34:56,608 --> 01:35:10,552
that would be the dream candidate for the council to choose as the next city clerk for the city of Medford, who says, well, now you're requiring me that my oral interview be recorded and be available through the public records law.

913
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:11,853
No thanks.

914
01:35:12,113 --> 01:35:12,913
Thank you anyway.

915
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:15,494
So there's my remarks right off the top of my head.

916
01:35:15,514 --> 01:35:17,835
I'll have to look into that executive session piece of it.

917
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:23,116
But I would ask Mr. President, through you, if I could have something.

918
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:25,277
I think I have the idea of

919
01:35:25,717 --> 01:35:28,439
The council wants to see all the applications.

920
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:44,067
Um, and I think that could be accomplished as Lisa pointed out, but in terms of, um, then going into executive session for the purpose of reviewing those applications with the full council, I've got to check and see if that's a proper use of the executive session.

921
01:35:44,467 --> 01:35:49,230
And then you heard my, my most recent remarks about recording all of them.

922
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:49,890
And that might.

923
01:35:50,491 --> 01:35:52,692
Might as a practical matter, create a barrier.

924
01:35:53,143 --> 01:35:56,344
to finding the most qualified candidate for the job.

925
01:35:59,526 --> 01:36:00,586
Thank you, Solicitor.

926
01:36:01,367 --> 01:36:02,187
Councilor Scarapelli.

927
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:03,708
Thank you, Mr. President.

928
01:36:03,728 --> 01:36:05,608
I appreciate Solicitor Foley.

929
01:36:05,628 --> 01:36:12,772
I respect his opinion, but as one councilor that has already gone through this process, we did go to executive session.

930
01:36:12,832 --> 01:36:20,415
We did vet the applicants together and going through the process as the hiring authority, the hiring agent

931
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:42,469
for this position so I would then table table the motion until the city solicitor comes back with his his his legal findings and then we can move forward Mr. President but I wouldn't feel comfortable moving forward with this until again this council I and to to insinuate that that

932
01:36:43,169 --> 01:36:44,871
don't trust the city council president.

933
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:46,492
That's not true at all, Mr. President.

934
01:36:47,653 --> 01:36:56,120
I fully trust the designee to move the process along as we move forward, but I think it's important that this council

935
01:36:57,215 --> 01:37:07,723
puts their eyes on the candidates that are qualified so we can then give our input to move that forward and then fast track the process with our designee.

936
01:37:08,104 --> 01:37:22,035
So I don't, anytime I felt that I didn't trust the leadership in this hiring process, but I do trust the fact that this hire is this committee, this council's prerogative.

937
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:24,816
It's not that office, it's this office.

938
01:37:25,396 --> 01:37:28,538
So I think it's important that we're part of the vetting process, Mr. President.

939
01:37:28,918 --> 01:37:46,587
And again, I would wait for a final ruling so then we can, once it's moved forward, that we can go through the executive session to discuss the candidates that we have already vetted in our own process.

940
01:37:47,107 --> 01:37:52,957
through the human resource directors process, then we can then move forward.

941
01:37:52,997 --> 01:37:55,240
So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

942
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:55,621
Thank you.

943
01:37:56,763 --> 01:37:57,003
Thank you.

944
01:37:57,023 --> 01:37:59,628
I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Sang.

945
01:38:00,904 --> 01:38:01,164
Thank you.

946
01:38:02,185 --> 01:38:09,192
Yes, I just want to comment that I really appreciate the solicitor's advice around the recorded meetings.

947
01:38:09,252 --> 01:38:10,874
I think that makes absolute sense.

948
01:38:10,894 --> 01:38:12,115
That's why I asked it as a question.

949
01:38:12,135 --> 01:38:13,196
I did not make it as a motion.

950
01:38:14,517 --> 01:38:17,340
So I agree that that is not a great idea.

951
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:24,467
I do think that an executive session, I'm in favor of us having an executive session to discuss.

952
01:38:26,368 --> 01:38:38,177
I also just want to reiterate what Councillor Scarpelli said, which is that it's fine to try to mirror the administration hires for department heads, but the administration hires those department heads.

953
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:42,320
The city council hires the city clerk.

954
01:38:43,368 --> 01:38:44,668
So I do think that's important.

955
01:38:44,888 --> 01:39:01,014
And also, I hope that we do not hear future suggestions of lack of trust when we are in good faith making an effort to do the work that is our work.

956
01:39:01,674 --> 01:39:05,235
It is our job to hire this person, this staffer,

957
01:39:06,912 --> 01:39:20,887
not the administration's we appreciate all the help that we have from the administration, but it is definitely not bad intent or any lack of trust for us to be interested in doing that work.

958
01:39:21,207 --> 01:39:21,447
Thank you.

959
01:39:26,764 --> 01:39:48,780
I think Councillor Callahan's remarks underscores my point, which is that if you look through the job description if you look at what the city clerk does and who the city clerk is responsible to it's us, it's the council it's a lot of work that isn't your normal kind of what you'd expect for a normal department head so

960
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:58,169
I would personally favor a executive session, but I also want to make sure that we are not jeopardizing having a city clerk in time.

961
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:14,038
And so my question would be to you, President Behrs, and to our Director Crowley, would tabling this mess up the timeline for hiring a city clerk?

962
01:40:17,474 --> 01:40:24,318
I mean, from my perspective, we table it until next week, we get an answer on the executive session, I don't think it's a huge delay.

963
01:40:24,778 --> 01:40:33,204
We can also authorize the posting of the position as amended, and then come back next week and make a decision after we know about the executive session piece.

964
01:40:33,804 --> 01:40:38,767
I also think, hey, I'm just saying I don't, I don't mind not having to do it all.

965
01:40:40,817 --> 01:40:50,689
So, you know, that's, that's a piece of, there's a lot of behind the scenes work of being the president of the city council and this adding on to that.

966
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,594
I certainly don't mind having the burden shared with my colleagues.

967
01:40:55,957 --> 01:41:02,842
And, you know, if we find that the executive session piece of things is an issue, I think we can also maybe come up with an alternative approach.

968
01:41:03,003 --> 01:41:17,454
And I'm just directing this to Councilor Scarpelli of perhaps, you know, if the executive session is an issue that all our resumes would go out to everybody and anyone that any councilor wanted to see interviewed, I would make a recommendation that they be interviewed.

969
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:18,855
That could be an alternative.

970
01:41:19,155 --> 01:41:24,179
I personally would prefer that we sit down and, you know, I want to list, the body seems to be very clear that they'd like to have

971
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:28,761
a meeting to say here we've looked at the people, here's what we want to put forward.

972
01:41:29,862 --> 01:41:33,604
If that is a legal issue, that would be my proposed alternative.

973
01:41:34,364 --> 01:41:37,086
So just want to say that I'm hearing what you're saying.

974
01:41:37,106 --> 01:41:40,328
And I feel, I feel fine about the approach.

975
01:41:42,469 --> 01:41:43,409
Councillor Scarpelli.

976
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:49,813
Motion that we have our HR director move forward as you recommended Council President.

977
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,315
And then we revisit the executive session portion next week.

978
01:41:54,143 --> 01:41:59,425
and then come to a conclusion whether we move to step one or the alternative.

979
01:42:00,005 --> 01:42:00,325
Got it.

980
01:42:00,605 --> 01:42:00,865
Okay.

981
01:42:01,326 --> 01:42:09,168
So I think it's a B paper that we authorize the HR director to post the job description with the amendments from Councilor Callahan and Councilor Lozaro.

982
01:42:09,188 --> 01:42:20,152
Just writing it down.

983
01:42:21,132 --> 01:42:22,613
Giving Rich time to write it down too.

984
01:42:23,668 --> 01:42:41,814
So authorizing the posting of the job description as amended by Councilor Callahan and Councilor Lazaro.

985
01:42:41,934 --> 01:42:52,538
Councilor Lazaro, if you could forward, you can make an email maybe with me, Lisa Crowley and Anna and send your typos and you can send your amendments and then

986
01:42:53,618 --> 01:42:56,181
Then Lisa can send back an edited document, and we can all make sure.

987
01:42:57,262 --> 01:42:59,404
Yeah, I'm saying let's do it this way instead.

988
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:03,628
Let's just go through Lisa directly, if that's OK, whoever wants to do it.

989
01:43:08,253 --> 01:43:09,454
You already sent it to Lisa and me.

990
01:43:09,474 --> 01:43:11,176
All right, then Anna, you send it to Lisa.

991
01:43:11,576 --> 01:43:16,401
You send it to Lisa and me, and then Lisa, you can take them and send us back an updated version.

992
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:16,962
That's fine.

993
01:43:18,703 --> 01:43:23,828
I don't, you know, I'm not reading my emails during this meeting.

994
01:43:24,428 --> 01:43:25,789
All right.

995
01:43:26,570 --> 01:43:27,551
So that's the B paper.

996
01:43:28,031 --> 01:43:30,153
I want to recognize Kevin and Lisa one more time.

997
01:43:31,614 --> 01:43:34,137
Does that sound, I'll go to Kevin and then Lisa.

998
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:35,237
Kevin, does that sound good?

999
01:43:35,298 --> 01:43:39,942
Do you think you can by next week, let us know about the executive session purpose?

1000
01:43:40,522 --> 01:43:41,643
I'd be glad to check in that.

1001
01:43:41,663 --> 01:43:43,785
I just want to confirm with you, Mr. President.

1002
01:43:44,522 --> 01:43:48,125
What is the purpose then of the executive session that I'm checking on?

1003
01:43:48,425 --> 01:43:52,288
Is it to review all applications for city council, city clerk?

1004
01:43:53,429 --> 01:43:53,689
Yes.

1005
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:54,570
Okay.

1006
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:55,791
Let me check on that.

1007
01:43:55,811 --> 01:43:59,514
I don't know that offhand and I don't want to give an answer that's incorrect.

1008
01:44:00,775 --> 01:44:00,975
Okay.

1009
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:16,654
Lisa, on the job description posting, does this sound if with the amendments from Councillor Callahan and Lazaro, go ahead and post the description, and then we'll make a decision next week on that last piece of the process?

1010
01:44:17,754 --> 01:44:18,634
Yes, absolutely.

1011
01:44:18,654 --> 01:44:19,254
We can do that.

1012
01:44:19,274 --> 01:44:21,095
Not a problem.

1013
01:44:22,315 --> 01:44:22,995
Thank you very much.

1014
01:44:23,415 --> 01:44:26,096
And also just one thing I wanted to state beforehand.

1015
01:44:26,116 --> 01:44:30,597
Anna, you know, especially you or George,

1016
01:44:32,163 --> 01:44:36,527
In terms of the designee for the interview stage, I wasn't thinking that would necessarily be me.

1017
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:46,035
So if you feel like you want to be present instead of the ability to record, I think we should just, you know, if anyone wants to be part of those interviews, let me know.

1018
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:49,898
If more people want to be part of it than one in each interview phase, then we'll figure it out.

1019
01:44:50,919 --> 01:44:51,159
Thank you.

1020
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,280
All right.

1021
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,763
So we'll do the B paper and then we'll table the main paper for one week.

1022
01:44:56,603 --> 01:44:56,904
All right.

1023
01:44:57,644 --> 01:44:58,245
Councilor Scarpelli.

1024
01:44:59,640 --> 01:44:59,880
Yes.

1025
01:45:01,001 --> 01:45:04,583
Oh, you're good with that.

1026
01:45:04,763 --> 01:45:06,024
I'm good with that.

1027
01:45:06,204 --> 01:45:07,565
All right.

1028
01:45:09,707 --> 01:45:10,207
All right.

1029
01:45:10,307 --> 01:45:18,513
On the, on the B paper first, which is to authorize the HR director to post a job description with the amendments from Councilors are on Councilor Callahan, please call the role.

1030
01:45:21,635 --> 01:45:22,516
Councilor Callahan.

1031
01:45:23,796 --> 01:45:24,897
Vice President Collins.

1032
01:45:25,177 --> 01:45:25,357
Yes.

1033
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:31,453
Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli.

1034
01:45:31,573 --> 01:45:31,833
Yes.

1035
01:45:32,393 --> 01:45:33,114
Councilor Sang.

1036
01:45:33,174 --> 01:45:33,354
Yes.

1037
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:34,815
President Behrs.

1038
01:45:34,975 --> 01:45:35,195
Yes.

1039
01:45:35,335 --> 01:45:36,395
I'm affirmative, none the negative.

1040
01:45:36,435 --> 01:45:39,557
And that was to note Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Sang.

1041
01:45:40,778 --> 01:45:47,922
And then on the motion of the table for one week by Councilor Scarpelli, the main paper seconded by Councilor Sang.

1042
01:45:48,503 --> 01:45:49,403
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1043
01:45:54,926 --> 01:45:55,827
Councilor Callahan.

1044
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,161
Vice President Collins?

1045
01:45:59,461 --> 01:45:59,661
Yes.

1046
01:46:01,202 --> 01:46:02,023
Councilor Zaro?

1047
01:46:02,043 --> 01:46:02,103
Yes.

1048
01:46:03,684 --> 01:46:04,305
Councilor Lemming?

1049
01:46:04,325 --> 01:46:04,385
Yes.

1050
01:46:05,706 --> 01:46:06,607
Councilor Scarpelli?

1051
01:46:07,167 --> 01:46:07,427
Yes.

1052
01:46:08,168 --> 01:46:08,889
Councilor Singh?

1053
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:09,269
Yes.

1054
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:10,910
President Peers?

1055
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:11,390
Yes.

1056
01:46:12,251 --> 01:46:14,453
Seven in affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1057
01:46:14,693 --> 01:46:14,993
Okay.

1058
01:46:15,013 --> 01:46:16,234
Thank you.

1059
01:46:16,294 --> 01:46:17,716
There's a quick executive session.

1060
01:46:17,796 --> 01:46:18,656
Do we want to take that?

1061
01:46:18,716 --> 01:46:21,759
Yeah, no, if I could suspend the rules.

1062
01:46:22,539 --> 01:46:25,282
If we can have public participation

1063
01:46:26,643 --> 01:46:48,951
Mr. President, before we go to executive session, I know we have residents that have to be in bed at a certain time, and I think that if we can do that, and I believe, if we can hear the final resolution, I believe, I'm sorry, I don't... The proposed amendment?

1064
01:46:52,052 --> 01:46:53,192
Solicitor Foley is here, but...

1065
01:46:57,011 --> 01:47:03,474
I think it's 24069 and public participation, if we can.

1066
01:47:03,494 --> 01:47:05,995
25151 Salem Street.

1067
01:47:06,015 --> 01:47:07,015
25151, I'm sorry, 25151.

1068
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:09,076
Okay, let's do public participation.

1069
01:47:09,096 --> 01:47:09,176
Yeah.

1070
01:47:09,516 --> 01:47:10,257
And then that, okay.

1071
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:10,817
Okay, thank you.

1072
01:47:10,877 --> 01:47:22,982
On the motion of Councilor Scott Felder to take public participation in paper 25151, suspend the rolls to take them, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1073
01:47:28,242 --> 01:47:29,242
Councilor Callahan?

1074
01:47:29,603 --> 01:47:29,723
Yes.

1075
01:47:31,243 --> 01:47:32,324
Vice President Collins?

1076
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:32,804
Yes.

1077
01:47:34,905 --> 01:47:35,805
Councilor Lazaro?

1078
01:47:35,885 --> 01:47:35,945
Yes.

1079
01:47:37,126 --> 01:47:37,806
Councilor Lemming?

1080
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:37,886
Yes.

1081
01:47:39,947 --> 01:47:40,868
Councilor Scarpelli?

1082
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:41,728
Yes.

1083
01:47:42,548 --> 01:47:43,189
Councilor Hussain?

1084
01:47:43,209 --> 01:47:43,289
Yes.

1085
01:47:44,289 --> 01:47:44,989
President Pierce?

1086
01:47:45,269 --> 01:47:46,350
Yes, I'm affirmative.

1087
01:47:46,450 --> 01:47:46,930
None negative.

1088
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:48,751
The motion passes with public participation.

1089
01:47:49,331 --> 01:47:53,693
The first is we did receive a petition from Sharon Diesso on August 25th.

1090
01:47:53,793 --> 01:47:57,595
I'm going to take Sharon and then we'll take you for public participation.

1091
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:03,321
We've taken votes on them, but we'll take you during public participation.

1092
01:48:03,341 --> 01:48:12,091
Sharon, do you want to describe your public comment or do you want me to read your petition?

1093
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:18,912
Okay.

1094
01:48:19,052 --> 01:48:21,114
Yes, we can hear you.

1095
01:48:21,154 --> 01:48:25,977
Three minutes, Sharon, India so circuit road and Mass Ave in Medford.

1096
01:48:27,819 --> 01:48:40,888
As you know, we don't have a real public circulation, other than email and maybe Billy Charles older paper that is now online also he is reviewing that and hopefully

1097
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:47,215
In the winter will be able to come up with something a little bit more public and left off in popular places.

1098
01:48:48,836 --> 01:48:58,927
During the last few months, people have approached me we do discuss things we don't criticize all the time we try to move forward and give suggestions.

1099
01:48:59,888 --> 01:49:13,001
First and foremost, I'd like to remind everyone that when you take an oath, any public official or anyone even in a CEO position, your first and foremost duty is safety of the public.

1100
01:49:13,502 --> 01:49:23,492
So, I would say without a lot of adieu, that a lot of phone calls and a lot of emails to you were about the condition of the roads in Medford.

1101
01:49:24,272 --> 01:49:48,771
We're wondering if anyone would take it upon this fine counsel one person who may put it on the agenda for soon future, but people could come and listen to an update on conditions, and the foreseeable repairs and funds forthcoming to help us with these roads that might include some sidewalks I myself had a very bad tumble about six years ago.

1102
01:49:49,372 --> 01:49:52,058
broke my two fronties and my knee was in a brace.

1103
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:57,831
So, included in that may be a visit with the tree warden.

1104
01:49:59,272 --> 01:50:03,354
I'm if someone would want to include her on that position because it is safety.

1105
01:50:03,834 --> 01:50:06,435
We have many tree limbs that just come down the dead.

1106
01:50:06,935 --> 01:50:15,659
Before you accept more grants on new saplings, we would like, which are half dead, most of them place dead road Governors Avenue.

1107
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:20,201
We'd like to know who's paying for the saplings and why they aren't maintained.

1108
01:50:20,602 --> 01:50:22,102
If you can't maintain a service.

1109
01:50:22,582 --> 01:50:23,123
Don't do it.

1110
01:50:24,524 --> 01:50:35,517
Next I would like to speak about zoning, moving forward I know that you're going to be halting some of this, and we're very happy with that because it's a big job.

1111
01:50:36,218 --> 01:50:41,404
As a suggestion for someone who worked in part time in real estate in the stock market for years before teaching.

1112
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:48,169
We were suggesting that maybe you could go to already pre zoned areas that really need help.

1113
01:50:48,849 --> 01:50:56,514
For instance, maybe maybe a block in West method, you could have a meeting and have them come to public meeting here also.

1114
01:50:57,355 --> 01:51:25,793
the lessees not all those business places are occupied by the owners would they concede to go building up what would it take for them to work comfortably with council that may be a nice short way to start the ball rolling and no abutting streets with single families with lots of privacies would be heard thirdly and lastly i'm trying to keep my tone the same i would have to go over a minute if i could

1115
01:51:28,576 --> 01:51:31,299
We have been here we have three minutes.

1116
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:35,524
Sometimes during the year I know it gets emotional with different topics.

1117
01:51:35,965 --> 01:51:46,617
We've had to sit here with 15 to 20 minutes of people's Councilman's and Councilwoman's biographies, also interjecting with federal topics.

1118
01:51:47,037 --> 01:51:48,618
We don't pay you to do that.

1119
01:51:48,858 --> 01:51:54,302
We see enough, we hear enough, and we would like to be able to make our own decisions.

1120
01:51:54,722 --> 01:52:05,270
Some of you, I know, have even gone forward and labeled federal people and also people in the community with different labels.

1121
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:06,550
In business,

1122
01:52:07,491 --> 01:52:09,031
This is called steering.

1123
01:52:09,552 --> 01:52:10,152
It's illegal.

1124
01:52:10,672 --> 01:52:13,012
I don't know how it gets solved here.

1125
01:52:13,032 --> 01:52:23,655
I'm not saying that you're doing an illegal thing, but we have to be very, very observant of matters that really concern us.

1126
01:52:24,175 --> 01:52:25,956
And I'm sure that you'll agree with this.

1127
01:52:26,596 --> 01:52:30,877
We appreciate your time and a happy autumn to everyone and a safe night.

1128
01:52:31,477 --> 01:52:31,917
Thank you.

1129
01:52:32,517 --> 01:52:33,237
Thank you.

1130
01:52:33,257 --> 01:52:36,198
Is this public participation?

1131
01:52:39,043 --> 01:52:41,384
Can we just take it at the end?

1132
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:44,046
Anyone else would like to speak in public participation?

1133
01:52:44,066 --> 01:52:46,287
I see Gaston.

1134
01:52:46,307 --> 01:52:48,828
Is there anyone else?

1135
01:52:49,349 --> 01:52:50,689
I'm not seeing any hands on Zoom.

1136
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,030
We'll go to Gaston.

1137
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:53,611
Name and address for the record, please.

1138
01:52:53,651 --> 01:52:56,252
Thank you, Mr. President.

1139
01:52:56,572 --> 01:53:01,135
I just was curious why no public comment was taken on the previous resolution.

1140
01:53:01,865 --> 01:53:27,019
a motion to table which was there done that ends all discussion and has to be voted on so okay so you you vote on a motion to table yeah there was a big paper and then there was a motion yeah thank you so it will come back next it'll be next week it'll be back on next week yeah so for public participation um i studied i have started hearing about the new high school and i just

1141
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:33,991
Juan Fernando C?rdoba Marentes?s iPhone 2.0 He or He?s iPhone 2.0 He or He?s iPhone 2.0 He or He?s iPhone 2.0 He or He?s iPhone 2.0 He or He?s iPhone 2.0

1142
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:59,289
too late for the bulk of people to realize what was going on, then those people started becoming public.

1143
01:53:59,529 --> 01:54:11,018
And then now we have basically backtracked on a lot of work that has already been done, that we have already paid, and that probably will end up not being used, which means that, unfortunately, we're wasting money.

1144
01:54:11,858 --> 01:54:16,182
So with the new high school, I feel that we're going down the same route.

1145
01:54:17,838 --> 01:54:20,780
A handful of people have already started doing work on it.

1146
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:24,544
I'm not familiar because I don't have kids in the public school system.

1147
01:54:25,264 --> 01:54:28,767
But my fear is that we'll redo what happened with the zoning.

1148
01:54:29,408 --> 01:54:32,950
A minuscule group of people will end up making lots of decisions.

1149
01:54:33,771 --> 01:54:37,174
A lot of money will be spent based on those decisions.

1150
01:54:37,394 --> 01:54:44,400
And at some point in the future, someone is going to come with some project that is going to be shown to the public at large

1151
01:54:45,519 --> 01:54:51,985
And at that point, it's going to start getting publicized because obviously we'll need to either vote for an override or something like this.

1152
01:54:52,186 --> 01:54:53,507
So we'll have to get publicized.

1153
01:54:54,368 --> 01:55:04,378
And then I fear that people like me, the regular resident, will be against the wall, basically being asked the question, do you support this?

1154
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:06,946
or you don't support this.

1155
01:55:07,186 --> 01:55:24,097
And when we come up with a nuance approach, which is what I like, basically saying, I absolutely most definitely support a new high school, but these things that I see on this project that you're showing me at this late stage, I would actually prefer doing it this other way, or maybe adding something or something like that.

1156
01:55:24,497 --> 01:55:27,880
And then I'm gonna be accused of like, oh, I can see that you're not for a new high school.

1157
01:55:28,598 --> 01:55:50,730
So I just beg those responsible right now for starting to drive the process that there has to be a lot of outreach at this early stage so we avoid committing resources both people and financial resources now that will end up being wasted in a future time when a lot of people start realizing what has been done and then they're not happy with it.

1158
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:55,032
So I feel we need a lot of community participation now and unfortunately you know

1159
01:55:56,273 --> 01:55:59,075
We need to push this information to people, because people are busy.

1160
01:55:59,115 --> 01:56:00,136
They have tons of things to do.

1161
01:56:00,296 --> 01:56:03,418
Unfortunately, they are not going to seek for this information themselves.

1162
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:07,821
I bet you that no one knows that there's a committee for the high school, et cetera, going on.

1163
01:56:08,862 --> 01:56:15,247
So my humble suggestion is that we try to learn from what happened with zoning, and we do the outreach now.

1164
01:56:15,327 --> 01:56:22,052
So at least we get a ballpark idea of what we should go for in such a way that we optimize both human and financial resources.

1165
01:56:22,112 --> 01:56:23,273
Thank you so much, and sorry for the excess.

1166
01:56:23,313 --> 01:56:23,633
Thank you.

1167
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,342
All right, I have a hand on Zoom, so I'm going to go to Zoom, then I'll come back.

1168
01:56:32,403 --> 01:56:34,405
I'll go to Ren on Zoom.

1169
01:56:34,465 --> 01:56:35,566
Ren, name and address for the record.

1170
01:56:35,586 --> 01:56:36,607
You have three minutes.

1171
01:56:38,117 --> 01:56:40,898
Hi yeah, Ren Bean from 37 Woodrow Avenue.

1172
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:50,123
I'm just calling in to press for feels like the time support for the overall zoning project.

1173
01:56:50,423 --> 01:57:01,408
I feel like there's been a narrative that's developed recently that City Council has been working in secret to up so in the city and there's been no public participation and this is being

1174
01:57:02,068 --> 01:57:06,653
Forced on people, you know, this, this idea of the real Medford that doesn't want it.

1175
01:57:07,074 --> 01:57:21,231
And I just, I want to kind of counter that narrative and express explicit support for what the council has been doing through many, many, many hours of public engagement at these meetings and others, you know, going into the neighborhoods holding Q and a's.

1176
01:57:22,098 --> 01:57:25,180
Um, I know through a lot of, uh, you know, just general outreach as well.

1177
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,401
And, uh, I've attended a lot of those meetings.

1178
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:28,482
I've given a lot of comments.

1179
01:57:28,862 --> 01:57:32,545
Um, I've watched a lot more meetings that I've commented on or were attended in person.

1180
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:37,848
And, um, you know, I, I just, I just think the process has been.

1181
01:57:38,792 --> 01:57:53,515
uh deliberate and thoughtful and has incorporated a lot of community feedback and this idea that we need to blow it up and start over because not enough people are engaged just strikes me as uh you know to echo something that was just said a huge waste of time and resources

1182
01:57:54,075 --> 01:57:59,978
for something that is pretty well constructed and pretty well built and something that a lot of people did vote for.

1183
01:57:59,998 --> 01:58:07,861
I mean, the current city council, you know, won their seats in elections and they were pretty explicit about what they intended to do.

1184
01:58:08,301 --> 01:58:09,182
And now they're doing it.

1185
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:10,362
No one should be surprised.

1186
01:58:10,502 --> 01:58:16,345
I would count myself among a happy constituent to see this important work finally getting done.

1187
01:58:17,205 --> 01:58:21,047
That's just, you know, been sort of kicked down the road for 30 plus years.

1188
01:58:22,508 --> 01:58:28,154
Because the city really needs this you know we need to reform zoning to conform with reality.

1189
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:40,548
We also need to expand our tax base, we need to get revenue to deal with things like fixing our roads and picking up trash, I mean things that came up in this meeting, and, you know, implicitly.

1190
01:58:42,213 --> 01:58:45,114
been said that we don't have enough money to do these things that we would like to do.

1191
01:58:45,214 --> 01:58:53,576
So one, it's not the only solution, but a key part of getting these things that our city needs is expanding our commercial and residential tax base.

1192
01:58:54,136 --> 01:59:03,799
And we can't really do that if we zone the entire city for single family homes and don't allow additional density for our commercial squares.

1193
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:08,582
And yeah, not everyone is going to like that change, but it's important and necessary.

1194
01:59:08,843 --> 01:59:11,905
A lot of the folks that don't want to see that change also don't want to pay high taxes.

1195
01:59:12,525 --> 01:59:14,747
And unfortunately, we can't really have it both ways.

1196
01:59:14,967 --> 01:59:18,330
So I just count myself and a lot of other people who gave comments.

1197
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:26,856
If you look back over public participation, there's been a lot, a lot, a lot of comment in support of zoning reform in the direction it's been taking.

1198
01:59:27,437 --> 01:59:31,660
And I just hope that people listening to this, even if they don't agree with it,

1199
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:39,626
can at least acknowledge that there's legitimate discussion to be had here, and this is not something City Council has been forcing on an unwilling public.

1200
01:59:40,346 --> 01:59:45,270
There's a lot of fatigued people who have been carrying this on, and I would like to see the work finish.

1201
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:48,693
And on the Mayor's, I know she was on the docket this resolution,

1202
01:59:49,393 --> 01:59:51,334
I actually hope the city council will pass it.

1203
01:59:51,514 --> 01:59:57,397
I'm not attached to this one particular corner, but the mayor has apparently made it a hill to die on, which I think is kind of silly.

1204
01:59:57,597 --> 01:59:58,878
I'll write her a letter separately.

1205
02:00:00,098 --> 02:00:05,581
I don't really get what the flex is about, but fine, let her have it.

1206
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:15,886
I don't know who she's trying to win over here, but to blow up the whole project and throw the baby out with the bathwater at this stage in the game would be a huge waste.

1207
02:00:16,668 --> 02:00:20,691
Um, you know, so anyway, that's, that's what I'll say about that particular resolution.

1208
02:00:21,392 --> 02:00:29,558
And that I hope if the mayor can hear that message from a lot of the constituents that support this, that would be helpful as well so that we can move forward.

1209
02:00:29,698 --> 02:00:30,859
Thank you very much.

1210
02:00:31,419 --> 02:00:31,960
Thank you.

1211
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:37,984
All right, I'm gonna go to the podium name dress record, you'll have three minutes and we have one more hand on zoom.

1212
02:00:39,325 --> 02:00:40,166
Cool.

1213
02:00:40,246 --> 02:00:43,288
Like a customer for nine nine, nine Main Street.

1214
02:00:44,445 --> 02:00:48,069
I have a couple things that I just wanted to bring up during the general public comments.

1215
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:56,777
The first one is really just like a friendly reminder, and I can be friendly.

1216
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,879
My comments, it's shocking, I know.

1217
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:06,686
But as the election season heats up and everyone's getting into their campaigns,

1218
02:01:09,783 --> 02:01:28,208
You do need people's permission to use their photos and post them online and this seems like a small thing and it's an easy thing to overlook, but there are many people who are very particular about how.

1219
02:01:29,265 --> 02:01:34,868
Their own or their family or their children's likenesses are used on proprietary social media platforms.

1220
02:01:35,628 --> 02:01:42,131
And it is not a right that you have to post things without people's permission if it includes their likeness.

1221
02:01:42,991 --> 02:01:54,897
Every company I've ever been to, every organization that has any consideration of risk management will be very, very careful to get many waivers signed.

1222
02:01:55,534 --> 02:02:03,375
and permission signed before they use anyone's likeness in photos or video that they post online.

1223
02:02:03,835 --> 02:02:05,876
So this is just a gentle reminder.

1224
02:02:05,896 --> 02:02:11,417
I'm not trying to point out anyone in particular, but I just want to make sure that this heads off before it can happen.

1225
02:02:12,697 --> 02:02:13,477
Keep that in mind.

1226
02:02:13,557 --> 02:02:20,638
And if you're going to use people's images in your public whatever you want to do, make sure you have the permission.

1227
02:02:20,958 --> 02:02:22,659
It's just a reasonable common courtesy.

1228
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:23,899
And that applies to everyone.

1229
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:30,562
So, that said, the other thing I want I do want to bring up and this is where I'm going to be a little bit more pissy.

1230
02:02:31,282 --> 02:02:33,904
It's been a hell of a week.

1231
02:02:34,704 --> 02:02:39,646
And, and it's only getting worse probably going forward.

1232
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:45,009
I, we are in a situation in our city, where we're seeing more and more people.

1233
02:02:45,927 --> 02:02:53,553
that are being picked up off the street and taken away from their families and vanished into a system.

1234
02:02:55,134 --> 02:02:56,696
Some of them literally disappearing.

1235
02:02:57,136 --> 02:02:58,998
We're not able to figure out what happened to them.

1236
02:02:59,538 --> 02:03:02,460
There's no contacts able to like find them in the system at all.

1237
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:08,645
And this is happening here in Medford, like five, 10 people a week, and it's getting worse.

1238
02:03:10,767 --> 02:03:11,528
I know that

1239
02:03:13,153 --> 02:03:14,913
Many people don't think the cops can do anything.

1240
02:03:15,214 --> 02:03:16,014
Okay, fine.

1241
02:03:16,174 --> 02:03:18,214
I'm not going to fight about that right now.

1242
02:03:18,734 --> 02:03:31,798
But what I do want this council to really take into serious consideration and I know there's already some work happening on this front is what we can do to support the people who are left behind after these people are abducted and taken from their families.

1243
02:03:32,748 --> 02:03:45,824
We have many families that are being financially impacted where their main breadwinner is being disappeared, and those families themselves are now also in living in fear and unable to provide for themselves.

1244
02:03:46,305 --> 02:03:50,971
The city can and should provide first and foremost as a fundamental

1245
02:03:51,171 --> 02:03:55,574
de minimis function of a city government, the safety and security of its residents.

1246
02:03:56,214 --> 02:04:04,639
And that means that the people of these impacted, like the impacted families of the victims, they need support.

1247
02:04:04,899 --> 02:04:05,960
They need financial support.

1248
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:09,242
They need support with housing and rental assistance.

1249
02:04:09,282 --> 02:04:11,203
They need support with food.

1250
02:04:11,724 --> 02:04:18,488
They need support getting their kids to school and keeping sure that their kids are getting the education that they deserve.

1251
02:04:19,437 --> 02:04:34,364
And we really as a city need to prioritize this and this isn't something that we can just sit here and plan to plan about and think about people are being impacted and hurt irrecoverably.

1252
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:38,406
Today, right now, and every day it gets worse.

1253
02:04:38,966 --> 02:04:40,987
So I really, really

1254
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:58,999
Calmly urge the council to really take this to heart and make this the biggest priority because this is not some petty little single family multifamily whatever this is people's whose lives are being destroyed in real time.

1255
02:05:00,019 --> 02:05:05,282
And it needs to be addressed, it is the most important thing happening right now in the city.

1256
02:05:05,902 --> 02:05:06,162
Thank you.

1257
02:05:11,232 --> 02:05:15,356
I'm going to go to GABA's iPhone on Zoom.

1258
02:05:15,676 --> 02:05:17,337
Name and address for the record, please.

1259
02:05:17,397 --> 02:05:18,158
You have three minutes.

1260
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:21,341
Hi, my name is Gil Gabay.

1261
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:23,343
I live at 48 Almont Street.

1262
02:05:24,324 --> 02:05:30,109
I'm calling in for echoing a few other callers what has felt like

1263
02:05:33,222 --> 02:05:44,748
Over a year now, in full support of the zoning proposal as a young ish homeowner and new resident of Medford.

1264
02:05:44,768 --> 02:05:44,788
I.

1265
02:05:51,373 --> 02:06:09,486
want to say that it is it's frustrating walking down Salem Street and other areas that are in desperate need of revitalization of development and I urge the council to continue pressing forward on the zoning proposals and thank you for letting me speak.

1266
02:06:11,728 --> 02:06:12,208
Thank you.

1267
02:06:12,228 --> 02:06:14,370
We'll go to the podium.

1268
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:16,692
Name and address for the record please and you'll have three minutes.

1269
02:06:19,275 --> 02:06:21,276
Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street.

1270
02:06:22,677 --> 02:06:24,258
I'm here against this new zoning.

1271
02:06:24,858 --> 02:06:25,939
Everybody's saying it's fine.

1272
02:06:26,799 --> 02:06:27,219
It's not.

1273
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,721
Salem Street doesn't have many single family homes.

1274
02:06:31,622 --> 02:06:35,003
And you're looking at people, LLCs buying the single family homes.

1275
02:06:35,824 --> 02:06:40,887
I know they purchased two out of about six that I know of on Salem Street.

1276
02:06:42,287 --> 02:06:43,928
Most of them are two and three family homes.

1277
02:06:44,388 --> 02:06:47,270
The people who are coming out for this don't live in the area.

1278
02:06:47,884 --> 02:06:49,305
They're not going to be affected by it.

1279
02:06:49,325 --> 02:06:53,948
They're not going to look at the brick walls, the back of the building.

1280
02:06:54,188 --> 02:06:57,670
The facades would be beautiful to face the front of the building when you drive by.

1281
02:06:58,451 --> 02:06:59,911
Nobody looks at the back of the building.

1282
02:07:01,172 --> 02:07:02,973
Go to the one up in West Medford.

1283
02:07:03,634 --> 02:07:05,135
Look at the back of the sink building.

1284
02:07:05,775 --> 02:07:07,156
It's almost as bad as the front.

1285
02:07:08,837 --> 02:07:10,138
I mean, this is getting crazy.

1286
02:07:10,858 --> 02:07:13,780
We have probably 600 units being built in Medford.

1287
02:07:15,289 --> 02:07:21,635
where the storage facility was on the Felsway, where Gold's Gym is, they're gonna be building there.

1288
02:07:21,715 --> 02:07:23,296
Bertucci's is supposedly coming up.

1289
02:07:24,957 --> 02:07:28,060
600 units is possibly 800 people.

1290
02:07:29,081 --> 02:07:30,042
Where were they gonna go to school?

1291
02:07:30,062 --> 02:07:31,163
The schools were overcrowded.

1292
02:07:31,703 --> 02:07:38,649
Only one school isn't overcrowded, the Tufts Curtis, not the Tufts Curtis, the Miss Tuck, almost in some of them.

1293
02:07:38,989 --> 02:07:40,351
The only school that isn't overcrowded.

1294
02:07:41,051 --> 02:07:42,212
The Roberts has 600 kids in there.

1295
02:07:43,969 --> 02:07:46,151
I know that because my children go there, my grandchildren.

1296
02:07:46,971 --> 02:07:50,614
So this rush to rezone and say, oh, nothing's been done.

1297
02:07:50,634 --> 02:07:52,955
The Wellington Woods has been built.

1298
02:07:53,476 --> 02:07:55,277
The condos on Park Street has been built.

1299
02:07:56,098 --> 02:07:59,040
There's seven units out of one going in on Hadley Place.

1300
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,322
Are we supposed to not look around, look and not see?

1301
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:04,704
We're supposed to just hear and not listen.

1302
02:08:05,825 --> 02:08:06,685
That's the problem.

1303
02:08:07,306 --> 02:08:10,188
You're not listening to the people who live in the areas you're going to expect.

1304
02:08:10,878 --> 02:08:14,101
Listen to people who don't live there who say, oh, I want to go to another neighborhood.

1305
02:08:15,261 --> 02:08:17,703
Don't ruin my neighborhood because you don't want it to come to yours.

1306
02:08:18,784 --> 02:08:19,985
That's what this is about.

1307
02:08:21,286 --> 02:08:22,347
My neighborhood is close.

1308
02:08:22,927 --> 02:08:26,670
And some counselors made a statement that the area is prejudiced.

1309
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:29,632
Four homes on my street, single family.

1310
02:08:30,213 --> 02:08:33,115
They're owned by all owned by immigrants.

1311
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,517
Four of the homes.

1312
02:08:37,028 --> 02:08:41,169
So don't say we're prejudiced, we're all privileged and all this, it's not.

1313
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:43,789
These people moved into the neighborhood, why?

1314
02:08:44,209 --> 02:08:47,370
Because it's a neighborhood, it's not a building, it's not a condo.

1315
02:08:48,090 --> 02:08:53,571
The condos, there's 20 people across the street from you live in the condominiums, 169 Park Street.

1316
02:08:55,011 --> 02:08:56,272
Don't see them, don't talk to them.

1317
02:08:56,292 --> 02:08:57,932
They come in, they go in their home and they leave.

1318
02:08:58,592 --> 02:08:59,472
That's not a neighborhood.

1319
02:08:59,952 --> 02:09:03,313
You wanna build neighborhoods, build houses and make it for people.

1320
02:09:04,183 --> 02:09:12,147
You say affordable housing, well, if you're putting up 300 units, they're over 10, so half of them should be affordable.

1321
02:09:12,707 --> 02:09:14,008
Don't make them all unaffordable.

1322
02:09:15,388 --> 02:09:18,550
Change the zoning from not every building that's going up is nine to 10 units.

1323
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:21,851
10 units, you have to make it affordable.

1324
02:09:23,052 --> 02:09:23,752
Nine, you don't.

1325
02:09:24,653 --> 02:09:26,234
So how are you making it affordable in Medford?

1326
02:09:26,274 --> 02:09:29,235
The building in West Medford, nine units.

1327
02:09:29,515 --> 02:09:31,896
Coffee shop, don't have to do anything there.

1328
02:09:32,637 --> 02:09:33,297
Not affordable.

1329
02:09:34,164 --> 02:09:38,448
You want to do it, change your rules for what you build in this city.

1330
02:09:38,988 --> 02:09:42,611
Don't let these contractors come in and run roughshod over you.

1331
02:09:43,232 --> 02:09:48,076
Change your rules, not the city's rules, not the people who live there.

1332
02:09:48,336 --> 02:09:48,696
Thank you.

1333
02:09:49,257 --> 02:09:49,657
Thank you.

1334
02:09:55,082 --> 02:09:55,362
Marianne?

1335
02:09:58,478 --> 02:09:58,999
Thanks for coming.

1336
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:08,997
Name and address record three Mariana doozy to not straight from the August 5 City Council meeting till today it's been nine weeks.

1337
02:10:09,746 --> 02:10:16,608
And there have been, this is the fourth city council meeting, one of which was not open to the public.

1338
02:10:17,748 --> 02:10:21,729
And I don't have a computer, so I listen to the city council meetings on TV.

1339
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:29,671
So I was listening to the August 5th meeting, which didn't end till 1.24, I believe, in the morning.

1340
02:10:31,092 --> 02:10:34,693
Now, you people were sitting here from seven o'clock.

1341
02:10:35,899 --> 02:10:39,782
I wonder how much you absorbed in those last three hours.

1342
02:10:40,883 --> 02:10:43,726
Basically, the city council meetings are too long.

1343
02:10:44,487 --> 02:10:51,032
And now you don't know this, because you never know how many public speakers are going to come up here and lengthen the meeting.

1344
02:10:51,593 --> 02:10:56,998
But I think you seriously need to consider going back to the weekly schedule, because this is not working.

1345
02:10:57,018 --> 02:11:01,241
It's not working for you, I believe, because I don't think you can make good decisions at midnight.

1346
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:10,941
and it isn't working for the public because we have to stay here sometimes until midnight if we want to speak because you put the public comments at the end of the meeting.

1347
02:11:11,842 --> 02:11:18,603
So before the election and the next month, I want you to seriously consider going back to weekly meetings.

1348
02:11:19,523 --> 02:11:22,463
But I want to know, and I believe the voters want to know.

1349
02:11:23,224 --> 02:11:23,684
Thank you.

1350
02:11:25,904 --> 02:11:26,324
Thank you.

1351
02:11:26,344 --> 02:11:29,505
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak in general public participation?

1352
02:11:29,645 --> 02:11:30,885
Sharon, we'll take you for one more minute.

1353
02:11:37,062 --> 02:11:37,483
Thank you.

1354
02:11:37,503 --> 02:11:48,039
It was a little difficult coming out tonight because many of you have seen me walking around with that beautiful white lab he he sadly passed on on Saturday.

1355
02:11:49,441 --> 02:11:49,862
Thank you.

1356
02:11:50,042 --> 02:11:51,504
Polo's known by everybody.

1357
02:11:52,886 --> 02:11:58,330
I did forget something very important and I would be uncomfortable at home if I didn't say this.

1358
02:11:59,230 --> 02:12:13,721
Some part of conversation that we never hear here, a few words like, in consideration of the taxpayers and homeowners, they're really, those words are very limited in your conversation.

1359
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:23,027
And also, regarding zoning with the housing, we hear diversity, density, we hear affordable housing, et cetera.

1360
02:12:23,587 --> 02:12:39,378
Someone also should call on one of the meetings to have all the definitions, Mr. President, for affordable housing, Section 8, vouchers, federal housing, we don't know.

1361
02:12:39,398 --> 02:12:42,300
Also, we are in all these conversations

1362
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:43,921
is veteran housing.

1363
02:12:44,441 --> 02:12:49,565
It doesn't mean that they're all recovering alcoholics with different issues.

1364
02:12:49,985 --> 02:13:00,453
Some of them have been discharged for many years, they're in between apartments and they really need to be addressed to with some housing in the city we'd be very proud to do that I'm sure it's a city.

1365
02:13:00,993 --> 02:13:01,393
Thank you.

1366
02:13:01,413 --> 02:13:02,134
Thank you.

1367
02:13:02,194 --> 02:13:02,694
Good evening.

1368
02:13:03,355 --> 02:13:06,617
So anyone else would like to speak in general public participation.

1369
02:13:08,779 --> 02:13:12,001
We have one person on zoom Caitlin.

1370
02:13:13,077 --> 02:13:14,818
Name and address record you have three minutes.

1371
02:13:16,379 --> 02:13:19,440
I thank you, Caitlin Robinson 31 effort street.

1372
02:13:20,901 --> 02:13:34,467
And I just wanted to say that I was one of the people who lives in the Salem Street area who spoke in support of the rezoning of Salem Street, and I remember that there were several of us who do live in the neighborhood.

1373
02:13:37,586 --> 02:13:45,228
just want to push back on the narrative that the people who live in the neighborhood were against it because I support it and I know that there are other people who do.

1374
02:13:45,528 --> 02:13:45,908
Thank you.

1375
02:13:47,468 --> 02:13:47,928
Thank you.

1376
02:13:47,948 --> 02:13:54,230
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in the public participation portion of the meeting?

1377
02:13:54,250 --> 02:14:01,112
Seeing no hands on Zoom and no one in the room standing for it, we'll move on to 25151.

1378
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:10,553
Proposed amendments to the Medford Zoning Ordinance, change to the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District for referral to the Community Development Board.

1379
02:14:10,693 --> 02:14:11,953
This is a procedural vote.

1380
02:14:12,133 --> 02:14:24,918
The Community Development Board has sent us a request from the mayor to amend the parcels at the Salem Street and Park Street node from MX2 to MX1.

1381
02:14:26,079 --> 02:14:28,860
The council can't vote to do that tonight.

1382
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:33,662
We just can vote to refer that to the Community Development Board for them to open

1383
02:14:34,387 --> 02:14:47,578
public hearing, they would then hold a public hearing, make a recommendation, refer that back to the City Council, we would open a public hearing, and then take a final vote after that public hearing is closed.

1384
02:14:48,679 --> 02:14:51,221
Are there members of the Council who have a comment or a motion?

1385
02:14:52,281 --> 02:14:53,362
Vice President Collins.

1386
02:14:57,245 --> 02:14:57,986
Thank you, President Behrs.

1387
02:15:00,424 --> 02:15:09,088
I don't necessarily agree with Mayor Longo-Kern's decision to raise this particular zoning of this particular intersection once again.

1388
02:15:09,188 --> 02:15:22,935
However, I don't think that we should deprive the residents of their another opportunity to weigh in on it and go through the statutorily required multi-step public participation that is required for any proposed zoning amendment.

1389
02:15:23,135 --> 02:15:24,536
So I'd be happy to make a motion to

1390
02:15:25,676 --> 02:15:33,057
refer this paper to the Community Development Board so that they can open a public hearing on it and we can take the process forward from there.

1391
02:15:34,838 --> 02:15:42,339
On the motion of Vice President Collins to refer the amendment to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Sang, sorry.

1392
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,200
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

1393
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:54,661
Is there anyone from the public who wants to comment on this vote to refer to the Community Development Board?

1394
02:16:03,315 --> 02:16:04,296
Name and address for the record.

1395
02:16:04,316 --> 02:16:05,356
You have three minutes.

1396
02:16:07,377 --> 02:16:07,757
Good evening.

1397
02:16:08,398 --> 02:16:09,278
for Robinson Road.

1398
02:16:10,579 --> 02:16:12,720
I strongly support this referral.

1399
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:21,144
I think I like others don't believe the six story height maximum is appropriate all for the note and I think it's important to point out the same height maximum.

1400
02:16:21,424 --> 02:16:21,945
It's a commercial

1401
02:16:23,265 --> 02:16:41,485
I know there are many neighbors who express concerns about that MX to designation early on so I applaud not only them for voicing their concerns but also for the Community Development Board for for listening and ultimately recommending that MX one designation so of course the Council does have discretion to accept or reject.

1402
02:16:42,265 --> 02:16:46,207
recommendation of the CDB but I think it's just a matter of principle.

1403
02:16:46,227 --> 02:16:48,848
It should be giving significant deference to those recommendations.

1404
02:16:49,028 --> 02:16:56,111
So, it's unfortunate that we're in this position where we have to essentially backtrack because the recommendation of the board was not taken.

1405
02:16:56,571 --> 02:17:06,114
So, strongly in favor of referral and I'm looking forward to speaking more substantively on this when that public hearing opens.

1406
02:17:06,235 --> 02:17:06,555
Thank you.

1407
02:17:09,036 --> 02:17:09,456
Thank you.

1408
02:17:12,934 --> 02:17:22,618
Seeing no further hands on Zoom or discussion on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Seng to refer the proposed zoning amendment to the Community Development Board.

1409
02:17:23,138 --> 02:17:24,279
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

02:17:38,325 --> 02:17:38,425
Yes.

1420
02:17:40,166 --> 02:17:40,786

02:17:40,806 --> 02:17:40,866

1423
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:12,646
which states that the public body or its chair or designee shall add reasonable interviews, review the minutes of executive sessions to determine if the provisions of the subsection warrant continued non-disclosure.

1424
02:18:13,147 --> 02:18:19,231
Such determination shall be announced at the body's next meeting and such announcement shall be included in the minutes of that meeting.

1425
02:18:19,251 --> 02:18:22,873
Is there a motion to enter executive session?

1426
02:18:23,053 --> 02:18:24,795
And I want to note that votes may be taken.

1427
02:18:24,855 --> 02:18:25,555
Is there a motion?

1428
02:18:25,575 --> 02:18:28,777
On the motion by Councilor Zaro, seconded by.

1429

Yes.

1440
02:18:47,566 --> 02:18:48,167
President Beers.

1441
02:18:48,207 --> 02:18:50,687
Yes, I have the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

1442
02:18:51,167 --> 02:18:52,548
We're entering executive session.

1443

1444
02:45:42,149 --> 02:45:43,210
All right, oh.

1445
02:45:43,230 --> 02:45:53,680
All right, we're reconvening an open session.

1446
02:45:55,381 --> 02:45:56,462
Vice President Collins.

1447
02:45:59,425 --> 02:46:00,226
Thank you, President Behrs.

1448

On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Seng, seconded by.

Yeah, this is a motion to reconsider.

Sure, give me one second.

1462
02:47:05,901 --> 02:47:06,101
Yeah.

1463
02:47:06,921 --> 02:47:11,264
On the motion to reconsider the vote by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang.

Councilor Kellyanne.

1466

We're first voting to reconsider, which means we'll take the vote a second time.

1467
02:47:25,654 --> 02:47:25,814
Yeah.

1468
02:47:27,536 --> 02:47:28,476
Vice President Collins.

Yes.

1479
02:47:53,562 --> 02:47:54,482
Councilor Scarpelli.

1480
02:47:56,303 --> 02:48:04,005
My fellow Councilors, I know that we did receive a response from the Mayor, and if I could just read this,

1481
02:48:05,323 --> 02:48:11,164
not the whole, I don't want to read the whole response from KP law, but I didn't receive a response from the mayor or anyone.

1482
02:48:11,485 --> 02:48:14,565
So, um, is this the third reading?

1483
02:48:17,306 --> 02:48:17,586
Okay.

1484
02:48:17,606 --> 02:48:19,727
Do you know, do you know when that was delivered?

1485
02:48:19,747 --> 02:48:22,247
It was an email sent.

1486
02:48:22,587 --> 02:48:24,988
It was sent out via email.

1487
02:48:25,248 --> 02:48:27,148
It was an email sent Mr. President.

1488
02:48:27,208 --> 02:48:27,869
I apologize.

1489
02:48:28,249 --> 02:48:32,870
Um, I mean, it was sent by the mayor.

1490
02:48:34,653 --> 02:48:37,814
It was dated September 23rd from KP Law, Mr. Chris.

1491
02:48:37,914 --> 02:48:39,495
September 28th.

1492
02:48:39,515 --> 02:48:42,916
All right, I never received that email.

1493
02:48:44,856 --> 02:48:45,636
Go ahead, that's fine.

1494
02:48:45,817 --> 02:48:47,157
I'm just saying I've never seen it, so.

1495
02:48:47,217 --> 02:48:49,198
Okay, I'm sorry, I did see this email.

1496
02:48:49,278 --> 02:48:51,098
It was addressed to all the counselors.

1497
02:48:52,099 --> 02:48:52,859
I believe it was from 2023.

1498
02:48:53,059 --> 02:48:59,301
It was a ruling from KP Law on this initiative, the amendment.

1499
02:49:00,613 --> 02:49:04,576
the amended values aligned local investment ordinance legal review.

1500
02:49:04,596 --> 02:49:19,105
I will just give you the question that you requested in the legal opinion we got in the current form of the draft values aligned local investment ordinance as proposed and reviewed by the city council at its August meeting.

1501
02:49:19,545 --> 02:49:22,427
Please note that this legal summary does not include the financial

1502
02:49:23,127 --> 02:49:34,555
and policy implications relative to the proposed ordinance, which will need to be addressed separately by the city internal and external financial teams and advisors, including bond council.

1503
02:49:35,216 --> 02:49:38,518
I know this is a four page document.

1504
02:49:39,487 --> 02:49:43,128
response but I'm just going to read the short answer just to summarize.

1505
02:49:43,188 --> 02:49:53,972
It says, in my opinion, this is KP Law, the draft value aligned local investment ordinance as currently proposed has significant legal implications regarding the city's compliance with state law.

1506
02:49:55,004 --> 02:50:16,096
It's fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the interpretation and implementation of the same by the city's trust fund commissioners, treasurer, internal and external financial advisors that warrant significant consideration regarding legal and financial implications to the city and the city council's authority to adopt same in the light of the state law.

1507
02:50:16,776 --> 02:50:38,309
While it appears that portions of the proposed ordinance are in part based on the City of Boston's divestment ordinance while adding other categories of the prohibited investments, please be advised that the City of Boston is exempt from the rules for trustee investments under General Law 44, Section 54.

1508
02:50:38,349 --> 02:50:38,690
In addition,

1509
02:50:42,317 --> 02:51:11,749
In addition, and without waiving the above statutory limitations on the proposed ordinance, the use of the term financial instruments as written in the ordinance is vague, in my opinion, and should also be reviewed in consultation with the Treasury Finance Director and Bond Council to ensure that it does not conflict with the state law and the city's legal and financial documents, including investments, bonds, or contracts currently in effect with the city and third party entities.

1510
02:51:12,868 --> 02:51:27,401
the ordinance proposal language must be diligently analyzed within the city's financial advisors, treasury financial director, bond council to ensure compliance with the applicable legal requirements prior to the adoption in my opinion.

1511
02:51:27,521 --> 02:51:35,809
So again, I, I, I brought this question forward, whether there was legal issues from the beginning, this wasn't to, um, um,

1512
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:39,271
I bring this forward.

1513
02:51:39,291 --> 02:51:49,915
Unfortunately, I didn't know you didn't get this I thought we got it so I can forward it to you but again, I would ask the council that we don't vote on this

1514
02:51:50,527 --> 02:52:02,755
process right now until we get further understanding the fact that you didn't see this as well, Mr. President's bothersome and alarming to me that this, the administration didn't get this to you and didn't vet it properly with you as our president.

1515
02:52:02,795 --> 02:52:14,122
So, but, um, again, I, I, I would make the motion that if we cannot, that we do suspend this and table this until at least the council

1516
02:52:14,875 --> 02:52:29,384
president and the city administration review this so it's vetted properly and we're not held in any legal questions as we move forward with this process.

1517
02:52:29,404 --> 02:52:32,166
So I apologize and- I'll take a look at it.

1518
02:52:33,027 --> 02:52:34,227
I didn't receive the email.

1519
02:52:34,247 --> 02:52:42,192
I don't know if I was just left off of it by accident, but we did request, you didn't receive it either, Councilor Seng never received it.

1520
02:52:43,349 --> 02:52:44,750
Councilor Lazaro did not receive it.

1521
02:52:47,572 --> 02:52:48,653
Councilor Callahan.

1522
02:52:50,355 --> 02:52:50,675
Okay.

1523
02:52:51,155 --> 02:52:54,298
So, tonight.

1524
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:55,899
Okay.

1525
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:00,163
And I didn't see it until I came in on Monday.

1526
02:53:00,183 --> 02:53:05,107
Yeah, I know it came from Rich Alessio and to the city

1527
02:53:15,968 --> 02:53:18,089
Yeah, I mean, again, yeah, I'm not saying you didn't.

1528
02:53:19,270 --> 02:53:20,791
And it sounds like there didn't get to us.

1529
02:53:20,911 --> 02:53:27,614
I just want to make the point that we requested four months ago, and two months ago.

1530
02:53:28,154 --> 02:53:31,495
And it sounds like we got something at best two days ago.

1531
02:53:31,615 --> 02:53:32,916
And then actually, none of us got it.

1532
02:53:33,016 --> 02:53:34,677
And some people saw it in an inbox tonight.

1533
02:53:35,517 --> 02:53:39,419
And just as one person, I'm not really a fan of the

1534
02:53:40,123 --> 02:53:42,747
delay the communication tactic to try to avoid the outcome.

1535
02:53:43,088 --> 02:53:46,113
So I'm still going to stick with what I want to stick with.

1536
02:53:46,173 --> 02:53:50,399
If they want to actually do their job and submit amendments, they're welcome to do so.

1537
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:51,822
Councilor Callahan.

1538
02:53:54,316 --> 02:53:55,336
Thank you.

1539
02:53:56,096 --> 02:54:00,297
I did have a chance to look this over and essentially there are two points in here.

1540
02:54:01,418 --> 02:54:13,200
One is that monies that are requested by the donor to be set to a very specific purpose should remain under that purpose.

1541
02:54:13,721 --> 02:54:17,761
I'm quite sure that that is not what we are talking about.

1542
02:54:17,861 --> 02:54:23,823
That has nothing to do with this ordinance that we are working on tonight and have been working on for many months.

1543
02:54:24,483 --> 02:54:40,591
The second one is the one I really want to talk about because what it says is that under state law, the city is required to ensure that the only goal of our investments is profit.

1544
02:54:43,112 --> 02:54:43,232
Now,

1545
02:54:45,119 --> 02:54:48,721
Many years ago, I was on a commission in another city.

1546
02:54:48,741 --> 02:54:50,802
It was the Open Governance Commission.

1547
02:54:51,302 --> 02:54:57,226
I was on it because I helped to pass a public financing of elections law in that city.

1548
02:54:58,687 --> 02:55:02,649
It was a ballot measure, and it passed overwhelmingly.

1549
02:55:03,089 --> 02:55:04,970
The public really wanted this.

1550
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:09,713
And as I sat on that commission,

1551
02:55:11,062 --> 02:55:15,605
We were tasked with updating it.

1552
02:55:15,625 --> 02:55:26,971
And one of the comments that came to us was that something that the people wanted in our city had been questioned by the Arizona Supreme Court.

1553
02:55:28,032 --> 02:55:51,219
not our city's law, but some city in Arizona had passed something similar, and their Supreme Court had questioned it because the federal Supreme Court has essentially said over many decades that corporations are people, that money is speech, and essentially, and that Citizens United, of course, has passed as well, and over many decades has made it clear that

1554
02:55:52,645 --> 02:55:59,346
Their legal opinion is that corporate corruption of our government is perfectly legal.

1555
02:56:00,907 --> 02:56:05,648
And I remember what one of my fellow commissioners said, and I will never forget what he said.

1556
02:56:07,388 --> 02:56:21,451
He said, it is not our job as elected people, as an elected body in our city, to uphold legal opinions that go against the values of our residents.

1557
02:56:22,707 --> 02:56:48,498
And I'm going to say right now that the argument that we should not pass a values ordinance that our people want, that helps prevent harm to our residents of our city, that we shouldn't do that because the state law says we have to uphold profit as the only possible thing that we can have for our investments, I will happily vote in favor of

1558
02:56:50,068 --> 02:56:53,949
the values of our residents and preventing harm to our residents.

1559
02:56:54,549 --> 02:57:06,831
And if the state is going to fight me on that because it wants us to value profit over that, then I am not going to be in favor of whatever the state law is that they are talking about here.

1560
02:57:07,151 --> 02:57:17,553
So I feel quite strongly that neither of the arguments in this particular document are ones that are going to change my view that we should pass this for third reading.

1561
02:57:17,913 --> 02:57:18,173
Thank you.

1562
02:57:19,468 --> 02:57:19,970
Thank you.

1563
02:57:19,990 --> 02:57:26,430
I'm going to go to Council Lazzaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Sang, Councilor Collins, Councilor Lazzaro.

1564
02:57:28,719 --> 02:57:29,099
Thank you.

1565
02:57:29,660 --> 02:57:50,879
I also had a minute between meetings today to look at the letter from KP law, and I agree with what counselor Callahan mentioned about both of the points but another thing I wanted to note about the state law that says that there's an obligation of municipalities to

1566
02:57:51,867 --> 02:58:17,135
only prioritize making money on their investments, is that I struggle to comprehend how you can make a statement that this ordinance would not make money, that investing in Lockheed Martin would always make more money than what we're suggesting with this, that values have nothing to do with logical or

1567
02:58:18,770 --> 02:58:37,166
prudent investments and the assumption that investing in private prisons and fossil fuels and weapons and companies that are profiting off of wars is the only way to do right by your residents.

1568
02:58:38,307 --> 02:58:42,211
That immediate assumption in this letter is insane to me.

1569
02:58:44,625 --> 02:58:55,774
just as easily we could assume that you would make only make money by investing in milk or like there's no way to know that there's a diversity of things that you can invest in.

1570
02:58:55,814 --> 02:59:01,098
It doesn't, the assumption that any of that is necessary is irrational to me.

1571
02:59:01,579 --> 02:59:04,921
So I see no reason for us not to continue this.

1572
02:59:05,702 --> 02:59:08,144
We did not receive this in a timely manner.

1573
02:59:08,444 --> 02:59:09,325
So that's that.

1574
02:59:09,505 --> 02:59:09,845
Thank you.

1575
02:59:10,706 --> 02:59:11,907
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

1576
02:59:13,327 --> 02:59:25,289
Yeah, I think that if this were a serious objection to this ordinance, then it would have been important enough to email us about it when it was received.

1577
02:59:26,289 --> 02:59:41,272
I'm not, just like Council President Baird just mentioned, I'm not a fan of politically timed moves like this, which we've seen a lot of.

1578
02:59:43,380 --> 02:59:56,703
say what you want about the Salem Street message that we just got from the mayor through the CDB that we just referred back to the CDB.

1579
02:59:56,743 --> 03:00:00,824
I don't like the fact that it was announced the day after a preliminary election.

1580
03:00:02,104 --> 03:00:10,006
And I don't like the fact that this was literally thrown on our desk via paper.

1581
03:00:11,089 --> 03:00:30,218
two days before when apparently she's been sitting on it for a week it just means it's not it just means it's not really a serious objection that they're just like if this were if this were a serious thing like you know I would have gotten a phone call would have like had the common decency to email actually email this to us instead of just like this last minute

1582
03:00:30,798 --> 03:00:36,182
thing to try to delay this ordinance for whatever reason.

1583
03:00:36,222 --> 03:00:45,989
And, you know, we see that pretty frequently as like a bad faith tactic to put off actually doing anything in this body.

1584
03:00:46,069 --> 03:00:51,153
Like, I remember like a while ago we got, just like prior to a meeting, we got like some

1585
03:00:52,562 --> 03:01:01,747
email from somebody on a board asking us to just delay this whole meeting that we've been preparing months for just because they sent us a letter.

1586
03:01:04,028 --> 03:01:05,509
It's not something I take seriously.

1587
03:01:05,529 --> 03:01:13,233
So I'm not going to comment on the content of it, because my colleagues already have done that very eloquently.

1588
03:01:13,273 --> 03:01:15,674
But I just want to comment that I really don't.

1589
03:01:16,374 --> 03:01:20,737
I'm not a fan of this sort of game of chicken and this political timing that we see a lot.

1590
03:01:24,815 --> 03:01:25,276
Thank you.

1591
03:01:25,836 --> 03:01:35,546
Um, maybe add in content and countering what I'm counseling said I'm going to bring us back to the content of the opinion.

1592
03:01:35,566 --> 03:01:43,274
I think if you read through the detailed analysis, you'll find that half of the analysis is basically a policy recommendation.

1593
03:01:45,322 --> 03:01:57,172
which basically ends up with the recommendation that we talk to stakeholders, which I know President Behrs has done a lot of, including too many, if not all of the stakeholders mentioned in the opinion itself.

1594
03:01:57,673 --> 03:02:03,037
The legal aspect of this opinion, I would want to

1595
03:02:06,737 --> 03:02:09,961
walk through from a more legal perspective, naturally.

1596
03:02:11,303 --> 03:02:19,693
Essentially, you know what, if parts of mass general law preempts some of what we do, let that be that.

1597
03:02:20,214 --> 03:02:23,938
But I think Councilor Lazaro's reading is correct, that

1598
03:02:25,192 --> 03:02:31,235
What I think this ordinance will do is help us be more innovative, more careful with our investments.

1599
03:02:31,975 --> 03:02:45,242
It's going to force us to think more out of the box to make sure that we're not only deriving profit from industries that we think will derive us profit, but to require us to be more innovative with how we make investments.

1600
03:02:45,882 --> 03:02:49,804
And that, at the very least, is what would happen if we passed this ordinance tonight.

1601
03:02:50,304 --> 03:02:53,065
It wouldn't be, in my reading of things,

1602
03:02:54,886 --> 03:03:09,474
on kind of this hill that we can't climb with regards to executing it, it would just be that forcing our city to be more careful with investments and forcing us to evaluate in the future.

1603
03:03:09,894 --> 03:03:20,940
Actually, maybe these other things that align with our values make up just as much money, if not more money, than we originally kind of are.

1604
03:03:42,522 --> 03:03:43,042
Was that to me?

1605
03:03:43,062 --> 03:03:45,243
I think my internet is shorting out.

1606
03:03:45,263 --> 03:03:46,684
Yes, Vice President Collins.

1607
03:03:47,925 --> 03:03:50,226
Sorry, I think I lost audio for a split second.

1608
03:03:50,626 --> 03:03:51,907
Please let me know if I start to break up.

1609
03:03:54,855 --> 03:03:55,675
Thank you for the chance to speak.

1610
03:03:57,016 --> 03:04:00,638
I also didn't receive the letter from the administration.

1611
03:04:00,858 --> 03:04:05,441
Seems like something must have happened in our email inboxes or something.

1612
03:04:05,501 --> 03:04:06,381
I won't speculate on that.

1613
03:04:08,763 --> 03:04:16,407
But I haven't had a chance to review it in detail, but I appreciate Councillor Scarpelli for reading it out loud because I haven't gotten a chance to read it.

1614
03:04:17,816 --> 03:04:42,986
Um, and I agree with what much of what has been shared in the past several minutes by my fellow counselors, and I don't want to belabor the point, um, but I would be remiss not to say that in my four years of experience on this body, the, uh, sending a concern at the very last minute before a meeting is a pattern I've seen from Mayor Longo Curran's administration over and over again.

1615
03:04:43,586 --> 03:04:46,507
Um, and it's, it's frustrating, but I don't think it's something that

1616
03:04:47,270 --> 03:04:51,654
We need to, on that alone, let it interrupt the work of this council.

1617
03:04:52,295 --> 03:05:09,932
More importantly, and again, I don't want to belabor points made by my fellow counselors already, the point shared in the letter that arrived today or yesterday or inboxes, I'm not really sure which, strike me as very similar to points made by the administration, concerns raised by the administration.

1618
03:05:11,713 --> 03:05:18,719
A couple of months or I guess a month earlier into this process when we were taking earlier votes and having earlier discussions on the ordinance.

1619
03:05:19,660 --> 03:05:27,626
And of course I appreciate any good faith and thorough participation in discussion of the ordinance and I think that that's fine.

1620
03:05:27,646 --> 03:05:28,887
I think that raising concerns is fine.

1621
03:05:29,768 --> 03:05:32,891
It's just that I think that we've already talked about all those concerns that have been raised.

1622
03:05:33,973 --> 03:05:40,720
I don't think that it is correct to assume the premise that a values-aligned local investments ordinance will lose us money.

1623
03:05:40,960 --> 03:05:45,526
I think that that is kind of irrationally pessimistic.

1624
03:05:45,586 --> 03:05:47,107
I think that's pessimistic beyond reason.

1625
03:05:47,808 --> 03:05:48,808
We have no reason to think that.

1626
03:05:48,848 --> 03:06:03,754
There's a plethora of profitable industries that we could invest in that aren't things that are anathema to both our values and the safety and the thriving of our residents here in Medford.

1627
03:06:06,175 --> 03:06:11,537
And I don't think that it is correct or rational for us to make a decision based on an alternative premise.

1628
03:06:16,002 --> 03:06:25,064
In addition, I think that a lot of the concerns about the difficulty to implement this and the stakeholders that would be need to involved in this, those have been discussed.

1629
03:06:25,864 --> 03:06:34,666
I want to, again, tip my hat to President Behrs for the thorough process that went into this ordinance and making sure to discuss it with everybody who might be involved in this ordinance.

1630
03:06:35,106 --> 03:06:40,467
And I think the other premise that is missing from the concerns from the administration include that

1631
03:06:41,627 --> 03:06:44,889
Everything I've heard in these chambers leads me to believe that this ordinance is proactive.

1632
03:06:45,109 --> 03:06:52,572
It's not like we have to get rid of millions and millions and millions of dollars in ethically objectionable industries, and that's a good thing.

1633
03:06:53,453 --> 03:07:00,917
So I don't think it's correct to make a decision on the premise that this would be an incredibly difficult lift for us to achieve anyway.

1634
03:07:01,497 --> 03:07:05,379
I think we can go into this optimistically,

1635
03:07:06,239 --> 03:07:22,350
and with excitement to say we're already in a pretty good place it seems when it comes to making sure that our investments are aligned with our values and this the structure of this ordinance will just make us give us another tool to ensure that that is the case right now and into the future.

1636
03:07:23,391 --> 03:07:26,233
So with that I'm looking forward to taking a final vote on this tonight.

1637
03:07:26,413 --> 03:07:26,733
Thank you.

1638
03:07:31,556 --> 03:07:34,158
You know looking at this agenda I didn't think this would be the meeting

1639
03:07:36,267 --> 03:07:53,410
that pushed me over the edge to say what I'm about to say, but like the abject failure of the city administration to effectively communicate with the public and with this council about the basic things that we're trying to do as a city.

1640
03:07:55,731 --> 03:08:05,493
You know, I've worked really hard to try to collaborate with this administration on a bunch of major initiatives, and I'm really proud that we've gotten some of them done, but

1641
03:08:07,100 --> 03:08:08,041
like George was right.

1642
03:08:12,605 --> 03:08:18,671
And, and I didn't think this would be the meeting or the set of circumstances and I promise I'm not trying to kill you.

1643
03:08:19,191 --> 03:08:25,697
Like, it's just that the amount of time that we spend trying to

1644
03:08:27,475 --> 03:08:37,766
Pull the administration to do the basic work to effectively communicate about the things that we're trying to do in this community, instead of like doing those things and doing the communication directly.

1645
03:08:39,058 --> 03:09:02,867
It's, it's, it's, it's what we're always doing all the time, whether it's us whether it's the school committee whether it's the public schools, whether it's city staff, like, and the things that have happened over the last five or six months, like throwing the planning department under the bus, when they worked in really good faith on the zoning, or taking two months, and then another two months to just not respond to our requests about this ordinance,

1646
03:09:04,813 --> 03:09:17,180
Going back to the overrides like the amount of work that we had to do to try to just get that to happen and then like the just lack of really serious commitment to communicating it about effectively, and then like to what Gaston said tonight about the high school.

1647
03:09:19,180 --> 03:09:31,667
No, and no and they're open meetings, they're all public meetings, but like the effort is not there from the administration to adequately put communications resources to informing people about these public meetings and making sure people attend.

1648
03:09:32,207 --> 03:09:41,713
And then when people come and say I had no idea that this was happening we say oh they were public meetings but actually the answer is like we held public meetings we have no control over the communications resources of the city.

1649
03:09:42,233 --> 03:10:11,458
and the mayor's office didn't put any money into any of it so people actually didn't know and then it comes back to what George says here often which is people didn't inform and want to be involved and you know what like we've worked in good faith to do this well and like I'm not gonna throw away the baby with the bath water and say that the work product that we've done isn't good but all of these threads that people are talking about around all the things that we actually share and want to do are coming back to the same point over and over and over again which is

1650
03:10:12,445 --> 03:10:19,915
The administration is not effectively communicating with this council or with residents or even inside City Hall, about what's going on in the city, and it's

1651
03:10:21,482 --> 03:10:23,484
It's the reason that people are not more aligned.

1652
03:10:23,744 --> 03:10:25,505
It's the reason that people are frustrated.

1653
03:10:25,565 --> 03:10:27,467
It's the reason that some people aren't feeling heard.

1654
03:10:27,927 --> 03:10:31,470
And we don't have the authority or the resources to actually do that outreach ourselves.

1655
03:10:32,171 --> 03:10:33,852
And we can't force them to respond to us.

1656
03:10:34,373 --> 03:10:35,734
And then they leave us holding the bag.

1657
03:10:36,394 --> 03:10:42,920
Like standing up here having not even seen this document because somebody forgot to BCC someone and then never had the courtesy to call me about it.

1658
03:10:45,704 --> 03:10:53,431
I get more than I ever have I think how George and a bunch of residents feel about the way that the city is communicating about the things that are going on in the city.

1659
03:10:54,572 --> 03:10:57,335
And to be honest, I'm sorry that it took me.

1660
03:10:58,997 --> 03:11:09,927
I'm sorry that it took me this long to, to say something about it and I'm sorry I'm just saying something about it now but like you try to work in good faith and collaborate to try to make progress for the city.

1661
03:11:12,455 --> 03:11:13,656
And then this is what you get for it.

1662
03:11:14,776 --> 03:11:18,178
So I'm sure this is going to cause me trouble for having just said all of this.

1663
03:11:18,478 --> 03:11:18,798
Whatever.

1664
03:11:19,198 --> 03:11:26,381
I don't have the time to do this work anymore of making the administration do the bare minimum to try to do their jobs.

1665
03:11:27,182 --> 03:11:28,122
So thanks.

1666
03:11:28,362 --> 03:11:29,303
That's my rant.

1667
03:11:29,803 --> 03:11:33,685
Tried to avoid making a rant.

1668
03:11:33,925 --> 03:11:35,245
Call me George Scarpelli tonight.

1669
03:11:35,926 --> 03:11:39,447
Because no.

1670
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:51,816
I don't think that I didn't mean to say that, that you're not just like I didn't really fully, I get it, grasp until it comes a couple of the things that have happened tonight.

1671
03:11:52,197 --> 03:11:53,738
Some of what you've been saying over the last year.

1672
03:11:54,058 --> 03:11:58,161
So, I just want to I want to say that out loud.

1673
03:11:59,302 --> 03:12:00,843
All right, I get to go buy him a drink.

1674
03:12:02,083 --> 03:12:02,584
The motion.

1675
03:12:03,024 --> 03:12:07,667
We had a motion to reconsider the vote is to take the paper off the table and approve for third reading.

1676
03:12:11,348 --> 03:12:12,749
I'm seeing no hands on Zoom.

1677
03:12:13,709 --> 03:12:14,409
You would like to speak?

1678
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:14,670
Sure.

1679
03:12:20,872 --> 03:12:22,553
Name and address for the record, please.

1680
03:12:22,633 --> 03:12:24,094
And you have three minutes.

1681
03:12:27,935 --> 03:12:33,459
Judy Beatrice 49 Wyman Street Medford mass I'm the chairperson of the commissioners trust funds.

1682
03:12:33,979 --> 03:12:42,465
The good news is the Red Sox one tonight three to one for those of you that don't know, who've been sitting here just want to, we've been very close on the ninth inning that doesn't count as my three minutes please.

1683
03:12:43,806 --> 03:12:48,749
We had three men on, they had three men on based on the last of the ninth and we still want so that's a good omen.

1684
03:12:49,569 --> 03:13:04,897
Mr Chairman, the reason I'm here tonight really is to clarify the role of the commissioners as we had talked about earlier, and just to have it go on the record so I'm going to read it and then I'll give it to each of the counselors, the purposes to identify why we exist and what we actually do just will be on the record.

1685
03:13:05,737 --> 03:13:08,959
The Board of Commissioners of the Trust Funds is established by Mass.

1686
03:13:09,019 --> 03:13:21,767
Law, General Laws 41, Sections 45 to 47, has granted full management and control over trust funds given or bequeathed for the benefit of the City of Medford or its inhabitants, unless otherwise provided by the donor.

1687
03:13:22,528 --> 03:13:22,728
Mass.

1688
03:13:22,748 --> 03:13:32,254
General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 55, provides the Treasury is responsible for the investment of all municipal trust funds in accordance with the prudent investment rule as defined by Mass.

1689
03:13:32,294 --> 03:13:33,274
General Laws, Chapter 2013.

1690
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:53,216
Method ordinances chapter two out of the three division, division three section two sections 181 to 184, the Board of Commissioners of trust funds shall as far as consistent with the terms of the trust, manage control and trust and distribute the income in accordance with the terms of the respective trust funds.

1691
03:13:53,496 --> 03:13:55,618
I think that's what you were referring to and being separate.

1692
03:13:56,518 --> 03:14:07,488
Any investment action made on behalf of the municipal trust funds must comply with fiduciary duties, including the obligation to prioritize safety principle reasonableness of returns and donor issues.

1693
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:20,379
Mass values assignment local ordinance seeks to impose an investment restriction on city funds, based on political and ideological criteria, including but not limited to prohibitions against certain investments, and for other sectors.

1694
03:14:21,043 --> 03:14:41,388
Whereas such ordinance also explicitly includes application where it would violate fiduciary duty to pensioners and beneficiaries and the commissioners of trust funds who do not manage pension fund assets or public funds, but rather a distinct pool of restricted and perpetual trust funds under the document and content of how to be done resolve as follows.

1695
03:14:42,235 --> 03:14:55,165
The Board of Commissioners of the Trust Funds retains the authority to determine, recommend, and approve all investment strategies and instruments appropriate to the preservation and growth of trust funds and consistent with donor intent and fiduciary responsibility.

1696
03:14:55,822 --> 03:15:11,847
The treasurer shall implement such investments recommendations in accordance with compliance with the prudent investment rule and in collaboration with the commission and shall not be directed by any ordinance or political body to act contrary to the fiduciary standards of the commissioners approval of the investment policy.

1697
03:15:12,127 --> 03:15:16,108
This comes right out of Medford ordinance chapter 2 article 3 division 3 section 2 181 to 184.

1698
03:15:18,782 --> 03:15:34,339
Any ordinance or directive that seeks to override the commissioners fiduciary responsibilities by requiring the treasurer to invest in trust assets in politically screened or higher risk vehicles shall be considered incompatible with state and local laws and our fiduciary standards.

1699
03:15:34,879 --> 03:15:48,070
The Commission therefore reaffirms its duty as trustee of donor-restricted public funds and assets to the commitment of nonpartisan, mission-based investment decisions grounded in expert judgment, legal compliance, and public accountability.

1700
03:15:48,511 --> 03:15:50,853
So we're just putting that on the record as to where we stand.

1701
03:15:51,353 --> 03:15:56,297
One of the things I think you brought up, you can't imagine people investing money and not making money.

1702
03:15:56,638 --> 03:15:59,120
Calipers, which is the largest pension fund,

1703
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:01,742
way back when, had invested first.

1704
03:16:01,782 --> 03:16:09,688
They had a lot of invested their money when it was popular to invest in real estate, and they lost all of it, and they had to change their fund proposal.

1705
03:16:10,028 --> 03:16:16,834
Recently, as a matter of fact, it was Calipers and another one who had done very heavily invested in what they called then ESG funds.

1706
03:16:16,894 --> 03:16:27,002
I have actually sold in my day as a private person, social responsibles, and their loss of funds over the past four years that they had to change it, and there was a lawsuit with them and BlackRock,

1707
03:16:27,362 --> 03:16:30,143
and they had to reevaluate it and they now call it growth funds.

1708
03:16:30,463 --> 03:16:42,589
So when you get in that area, and this is where you have avoided that by saying by fiduciary duty you have explicitly refused, you know, excluded them from this quote public funds so that I think that is in the favor of the bill itself.

1709
03:16:43,109 --> 03:16:50,819
The other comment I would make in terms of the public funds, I think you really have to be careful in terms of the things that you use to vet it with.

1710
03:16:50,859 --> 03:17:02,413
My concern was reading, Councilor Beers, the long list we had of United Nations rules and regulations, and the question I have there is a lot of times people put these in their documents or in their proposals,

1711
03:17:02,953 --> 03:17:07,955
And those documents are continually being re-evaluated and changed and some of them are being obliterated.

1712
03:17:08,395 --> 03:17:21,579
So I would caution as you use references to be sure that you've either vetted them or maybe do a more general notification of it instead of listing every single one of them, because I have gone through some of them and some of them have already not even be applicable and that wouldn't be noted.

1713
03:17:21,599 --> 03:17:26,060
So I think you should, that would be one area you may wanna take a look at in particular to having done it.

1714
03:17:26,200 --> 03:17:29,261
Other than that, I have a copy for each of them and they can put it on their record.

1715
03:17:29,401 --> 03:17:30,182
And thank you very much.

1716
03:17:30,942 --> 03:17:31,462
Thank you, Judy.

1717
03:17:36,854 --> 03:17:40,876
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1718
03:17:43,918 --> 03:17:45,478

Yep.

1720
