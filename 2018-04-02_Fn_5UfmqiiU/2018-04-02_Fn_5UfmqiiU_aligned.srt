00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,536
Hi everybody, welcome once again to the Stevie B Show.

2
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:08,476
I'm Stevie B and I have a very special guest with me tonight, Mr. Frankie Ambergamo.

3
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:09,757
How you doing Frankie?

4
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,057
Not too bad Steve, how's everything?

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,377
Everything's going fine.

6
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,178
I'm going to tell an interesting story before we continue.

7
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:25,940
I had you on my show back in 2012 and we taped the show and it was shown a couple of times and then the studio closed up and

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,453
The show ended up getting lost, pretty much.

9
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,875
We never could get the show back.

10
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:37,761
So after five years later, I wanted to have you back on the show.

11
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:38,782
Oh, I appreciate that.

12
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:39,122
Thank you.

13
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:42,286
Because you've been a good friend of mine for so long.

14
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,168
Thank you very much for having me.

15
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,311
We're going to do the show again.

16
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:48,232
Now, Frankie, you...

17
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,471
You have an interesting story.

18
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,633
You used to work as a mailman, right?

19
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,615
Yeah, I was a supervisor in the postal service.

20
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,738
I started off as a craft employee, you know, car carrier.

21
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,564
And after about 88 years, I went into, I was a union rep for about four years.

22
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:07,828
Then I went into management after about my first 10 years of postal service.

23
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:37,808
and after the ten years i went to management and i became a supervisor and i was a manager uh... i was a supervisor at the cf at the forwarding unit where they forward the mail yeah into south post atlantics gmf boston and then i went to harvard square as a manager and central square and then i went to belmont and a few other places and i did my last seven years in the malden post office wow wow i was a supervisor then i retired now how did you get uh... you have an interesting story of how you got into show business yeah you uh...

24
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:42,246
What is, you have a friend named Emeril Lagasse?

25
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:43,848
Emeril Lagasse, Emeril, yeah.

26
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:50,853
What happened was, back in 2004, I submitted a recipe, my meatballs and gravy.

27
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,155
We call it gravy, some people call it sauce.

28
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,016
I call it sauce, my family is sauce.

29
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,878
We talked about that before, that could be a whole show.

30
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:59,359
Yeah, that could be a whole show, it's gravy, it's sauce.

31
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,504
So anyway, make a long story short, I submitted a recipe to Emeril, he was having an Emeril's Italian contest.

32
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:06,905
So there was 1,500 contestants.

33
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:09,346
1500 contestants?

34
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,408
Yeah, so I sent my recipe in out of my cookbook.

35
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:13,488
As you know, I wrote a cookbook.

36
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,769
Yeah, I got your cookbook.

37
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:19,172
Yeah, so I sent that in, and then I was at work at the time at the post office.

38
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,294
I got a call from one of the producers.

39
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,737
They said, gee, we've got your recipe and everything for the contest, and you're in the top 100.

40
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:26,317
Wow.

41
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,218
So I didn't think nothing of it.

42
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,659
A week later, the guy called me again.

43
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,581
He said, you're in the top 25, and we'll get back to you.

44
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,142
The third call came in.

45
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,043
I was the top winner.

46
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:36,455
You were the top?

47
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:37,456
I was the top winner.

48
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,357
So they said, we're going to come to Boston.

49
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:45,360
And so they came, they met me in the North End at the Abruzzi Meat Market, where I was buying the ingredients to make the meatballs.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,680
Yeah.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,981
You know, the fresh hamburger.

52
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,883
And so after that, we did that with some walking and talking through the North End.

53
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:55,765
And then we went back to my house in Medford, and I made it live in front of all the whole crew was there.

54
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,285
Wow.

55
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:57,166
The Food Network crew.

56
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,586
And we stayed about eight hours there.

57
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:03,107
So we're having meatballs and some pasta and a little wine and stuff like that.

58
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,188
So we had a good time.

59
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:08,869
A week after that, they flew me and my wife over to the Food Network studio in New York City.

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,789
And I was on the Emeril Hive show with Emeril Agassi.

61
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:12,349
Oh, wow.

62
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,771
And what he did is he picked four winners and he recreates the whole four recipes.

63
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,671
And then he called me up to the stove.

64
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,832
He says, want to smell the sauce?

65
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:21,292
Come on up.

66
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:21,932
How am I doing?

67
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,393
Then after that happened, after that show, I got calls from Boston Casting.

68
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:29,433
They said, we're doing a movie, doing some movies in Boston.

69
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,174
We'd like you to come up for an audition.

70
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,254
We think you'd be a good fit for this movie.

71
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,055
It's with Danny Aiello.

72
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:35,895
It was called Stips.

73
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,995
We did that.

74
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,176
I think that's when I met you, I think, Stips.

75
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:39,556
Exactly.

76
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:40,716
That's where I met you and your father.

77
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,356
My father.

78
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:44,137
They use my father more than they use me.

79
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,497
He's got the Italian features and I don't.

80
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,598
He's a nice guy, your father.

81
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:49,538
Nice man.

82
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:57,005
So after that happened, the first movie was Stiffs, then the second movie was The Game Plan, then Pink Panther 2, Mulk, all those.

83
00:04:57,425 --> 00:05:01,246
And after about the sixth or seventh movie, I started getting waivers and I joined SAG.

84
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,767
And now up to 2018, I've been in 52 movies.

85
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:04,767
52?

86
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:05,387
Yeah.

87
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:05,927
Wow.

88
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:10,448
And that's including some independent films and a few other movies.

89
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,668
Mostly big major films, you know?

90
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:13,429
I believe it.

91
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,850
Now, we're going to take a look at the footage of you on the Emeril Lagasse show.

92
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,210
Yeah.

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,150
So, we're going to see Frankie with... Bam!

94
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:22,891
Okay?

95
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,031
Let's take a look at that.

96
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:28,932
Hi, Emeril.

97
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:33,293
I'm Frankie Bergamo from Boston's North End, and I'm going to show you how to make Frankie's gravy.

98
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:41,493
One of my fondest memories was when my mother was frying the meatballs on Sunday mornings.

99
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:45,237
The aroma from the meat that we buy here at Frank's.

100
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:45,998
Morning, Frank.

101
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:46,418
How are you?

102
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:47,199
Morning, good morning.

103
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,080
How are you?

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,482
I'm going to make a gravy today.

105
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,544
I just need two pounds of hamburger, all beef.

106
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:54,748
The Italians that live in the South Shore call it sauce.

107
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,450
Are you ready for the sauce?

108
00:05:57,177 --> 00:06:00,520
Most of the Italian people that live in Boston, not then, would call it gravy.

109
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,503
I don't know how that happened, but that's the way it is.

110
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,667
So we got Frankie Imbrogamo, his lovely wife.

111
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:09,909
Welcome.

112
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:10,629
Thank you.

113
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,270
Good to have you.

114
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,131
Thank you.

115
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,772
It's a pleasure.

116
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:14,853
Welcome.

117
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,975
So I'm gonna try to make Frankie's gravy now.

118
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,077
And I've got the ground meat.

119
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,198
So every Sunday you make this?

120
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,519
Every Sunday.

121
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,140
Good, every Sunday I'll start coming over.

122
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:25,163
You're welcome.

123
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:25,984
Anytime.

124
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,605
All right, now what we're gonna do, folks, is we're gonna mix all these ingredients together.

125
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:38,187
And then you gotta have a lot of sauce and a lot of gravy, and you gotta have a lot of cheese to go on top, right?

126
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:40,748
Great, great job.

127
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,188
Super job.

128
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:45,389
Hey, folks, we're gonna dish this up to the audience here.

129
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,670
When we come back, you'll meet the next winner.

130
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,350
Stick around.

131
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:50,851
of a

132
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,839
You said you've been in 52 movies.

133
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,579
Have you met many famous people?

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,640
I've met Adam Sandler, the whole group of grown-ups.

135
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,842
I stayed with them for three or four days, working in grown-ups one.

136
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:22,764
And then I met Adam Sandler, then I met Wilson McCarthy, Sandra Bullock.

137
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,204
All the people like that.

138
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,505
All the big movies, I've been fortunate.

139
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,006
I've got some good scenes with them, you know?

140
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,086
Like The Proposal.

141
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,247
R.I.P.D.

142
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:32,647
I was with...

143
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:34,468
I did R.I.P.D.

144
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,249
at Fenway Park, I remember that.

145
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,911
Yeah, I was in what they called the bullpen at that time.

146
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:47,058
I was a police officer, a 1970s police officer, and they had by decades how many police officers they had in each decade.

147
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,159
I was with Jeff Bridges.

148
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,840
Ryan Reynolds.

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,261
I love Jeff Bridges.

150
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,101
They give me a whole month.

151
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,061
I worked there for a whole month.

152
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,102
I remember one story.

153
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:05,244
Jeff Bridges, he always went during the set, during breaks in the set, he would always go up to the young ladies and say, how are you doing girls?

154
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,024
How are you doing?

155
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:07,545
Funny guy.

156
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:08,265
Yeah, nice guy.

157
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,247
Yes, I met a lot of Danny Aiello stiffs.

158
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:13,448
I met The Rock.

159
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:17,451
Yeah, I met... I met Kevin Hart recently.

160
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:23,355
We did Central Intelligence up in Somerville at Tavern on the Hill, that bar.

161
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,796
So I met him in there.

162
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:29,579
I just recently met Will Ferrell and a couple of the ones in Daddy's Home, too.

163
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,822
I think it was... Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg was there.

164
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:35,723
I was talking to him for a while.

165
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,648
I have an interesting story about Will Ferrell.

166
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:42,330
When we did Daddy's Home 2 at Logan Airport, I was in this.

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,931
There was an extra there, his name was Billy.

168
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:52,674
He had Down syndrome and Will Ferrell came up to him between takes, had his picture taken with him.

169
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,395
Will Ferrell was a nice guy.

170
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,455
Very good guy.

171
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,756
Listen, we're going to take a look at your demo.

172
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:02,378
We're going to look at some of the things you've been in and then we'll talk more with you, okay?

173
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,059
Sure, I appreciate it.

174
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,086
Jesus Christ, Lord.

175
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:18,989
This guy comes in here every friggin' day and gets into my meatballs.

176
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,570
How come he never pays?

177
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:21,871
Who is he?

178
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,109
It's a new kind of Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.

179
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:08,029
Oh yeah?

180
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:08,810
Yeah!

181
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,791
Yankees-Red Sox scratch games from the Connecticut Lottery.

182
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,242
Hey Frankie, I ordered the chicken parm with extra cheese.

183
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:33,109
Annie, today's your lucky day, because I've got a deal for you.

184
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:38,814
How about if I give you this sandwich, filled with lovin' from the oven, and you agree to go out with me?

185
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,277
How about this, Frankie?

186
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:50,484
I'll agree to pay you double for the sandwich, and you'll agree to leave me the frig alone!

187
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,988
Mr. Trombone, where are you on family values?

188
00:10:58,682 --> 00:10:59,422
Peace Forum.

189
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:00,403
Thank you very much.

190
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:06,687
Man, you've been in a lot of things, Frankie.

191
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:07,507
That's amazing.

192
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:15,392
Who would have thought that you were a mailman at one time and now you're a big movie star?

193
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:16,593
Look at this.

194
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:19,435
He's even on the cover of this magazine right here.

195
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:20,636
Imagine Magazine.

196
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:26,859
You appeared in Patriots Day, Manchester by the Sea, Ghostbusters.

197
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,584
I've been in 17 movies myself but you've been in 52.

198
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,465
Wow.

199
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,447
That's a lot.

200
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,468
Sometimes what happens is they start calling you.

201
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,690
You might do like 10 movies in a year.

202
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,771
One year I did 13 movies.

203
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:51,183
Boston right now is like, because of the tax breaks, a lot of production companies come here.

204
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:57,166
It's been on a lull right now because of the, lately.

205
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:02,413
Okay, we did Stiffs, I remember that.

206
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,676
Yeah, Danny Aiello was a nice guy.

207
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:11,740
I went up to him and I said, Danny, I'm a big fan, my favorite movie with you is 29th Street.

208
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,042
Oh, I love that, that's one of my favorite movies.

209
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,383
That's one of my favorites, me and my brother.

210
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:20,407
If you guys ever see a Danny Aiello movie, rent 29th Street.

211
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:21,387
Excellent, excellent movie.

212
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,628
Maybe it's on Netflix, I don't know.

213
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,710
Anthony Rapalio, he was good too, he played a good part.

214
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:29,084
Now, you recently were in a movie that you actually starred in.

215
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,124
What's it called?

216
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:30,904
DJ Stand the Man.

217
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:31,725
DJ Stand the Man.

218
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,786
And I play a photographer, one of the lead roles.

219
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,327
And the story is written by Matt Fisher.

220
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:39,347
He directed it and wrote it.

221
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,648
Did a great job on the story.

222
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,409
The story goes about this DJ.

223
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,730
He's a washed-up DJ.

224
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,731
Are you the DJ?

225
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:47,591
No, I'm not the DJ.

226
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:48,411
I'm the photographer.

227
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:52,333
I'm the photographer that works with the DJ.

228
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,454
It's about the wedding business.

229
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,695
It's about a washed-up DJ.

230
00:12:58,176 --> 00:12:59,617
30 years ago, he was a rock star DJ.

231
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,700
And now he gets small gigs and small money, small weddings.

232
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,663
But in his mind he still thinks he's like the best.

233
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:12,368
He's very bitter and he starts trouble with people.

234
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,210
People like the mother and father of weddings.

235
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,232
He fights with his staff like myself.

236
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,474
It's a good story behind it and it's a good movie.

237
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,996
We had the premiere about a year and a half ago in the Arlington region.

238
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,817
We had about 400 people, 500 people.

239
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:31,837
And then we had an after party at Bocelli's in Medford.

240
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,938
We had a couple hundred people downstairs in the back there.

241
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,639
They took care of us, it was a good after party.

242
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,100
And then recently, after that we had a screening in Belmont.

243
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,206
That was about six, maybe eight months ago.

244
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:51,389
And then recently, now last week, we just had a, two weeks ago, we had it at the Capitol Theater, the screening.

245
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,189
Oh, wow.

246
00:13:52,209 --> 00:14:02,294
It was a smaller theater, because for people who didn't see it, like, so he wanted to get a smaller venue, a smaller, there was only about 100 seats, but it was good, there was like half of it, it was good, it was a lot of fun.

247
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,555
It was a lot of fun?

248
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,136
Yeah.

249
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,937
So who else stars in the movie?

250
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,678
Chase Carson plays the DJ.

251
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,300
He's actually a real DJ.

252
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,263
He's on WMFO, Tufts University.

253
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,106
He's got his own show on Friday nights at 10 o'clock.

254
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,467
It's called The Time Tunnel.

255
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,387
So he's a real DJ.

256
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,050
But anyway, who else is in it?

257
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,053
There's Eddie Nason, there's Tyra Pell, Alex Hawke.

258
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:31,134
I know Alex.

259
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:32,695
I know Alex.

260
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:36,378
We did Arsenic and Old Lace back with the Mystic Players.

261
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:39,541
It was one of the last shows we did with the Mystic Players back in 2006.

262
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:42,883
Alex is a good guy.

263
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,585
You might know Heidi Rhodes is in it too.

264
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:45,946
She was in the movie Kahn.

265
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:49,968
She was with Bob DiCicco and the other guys, yeah.

266
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:50,608
She's been around.

267
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,149
She lives in California now, but she did a good job.

268
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,810
So we had a lot of fun doing that.

269
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,612
He's gonna put it out in festivals and he does other movies.

270
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:00,913
He's been doing some other movies too.

271
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:02,254
Matt Fisher, you know him?

272
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:07,196
No, that one's... Yeah, so we might be doing another movie pretty soon.

273
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:09,357
Oh, are they holding auditions or anything?

274
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,695
Well, I don't know what he's doing yet.

275
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,676
He said he's going to get back to me and see, but he's definitely going to do some movies.

276
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:15,797
But he didn't hold any of this shit.

277
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:17,378
I'll let you know if you're interested.

278
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:17,958
Oh, definitely.

279
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,699
Listen, we're going to show a clip from DJ Stan the Man.

280
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,080
Okay.

281
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,421
And we're going to take a look at it and enjoy.

282
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:25,562
DJ Stan the Man.

283
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,663
You don't have to hit me.

284
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:32,365
And you don't have to be a ... but you are constantly.

285
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,446
I'm just telling you.

286
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:35,047
You don't have to hit me.

287
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,267
You ... my face.

288
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:37,768
It's just a black eye.

289
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,386
I looked in the mirror, you f***ed my face, people gonna notice.

290
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,187
Tell them you walked into something.

291
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:45,969
Who am I, Tina Turner?

292
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,850
Tina Turner?

293
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:49,432
Rihanna, is that better?

294
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,074
Oh yeah, that's good.

295
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:57,118
There's nothing funny about abuse.

296
00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,380
I can have you arrested, you know.

297
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,722
It's just a black eye.

298
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,402
Yeah, Calvin, it's just a black eye.

299
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,163
I mean, come on, look at Stan.

300
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,964
He's got two of them.

301
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:08,865
There you go.

302
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,146
If anybody says anything, just say, hey, you should see the other guy.

303
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:15,247
That's not fucking funny.

304
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,369
I need my eyes, both of them, to take pictures.

305
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,929
You don't need both your eyes.

306
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,630
You close one when you look through the hole.

307
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,571
Close the black one.

308
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,691
You think it's that easy?

309
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:25,712
Yes, I do.

310
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,133
Oh wow.

311
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,628
Wow.

312
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:42,489
So how long is the movie going to be before it comes to DVD?

313
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:54,872
He said the end of April he's doing a box set because last year he got the five main characters and we did a documentary on how DJ became, how the people got together.

314
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,472
So he did a little documentary.

315
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,052
Everybody did 30 minutes each segment.

316
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,593
So he put it together and made a documentary.

317
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,774
And now he's going to have a box set with the DJ movie and the documentary.

318
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:10,416
So it'll probably be on iTunes or it'll be on Amazon.

319
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,376
It'll be coming out, I think, at the end of April.

320
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:12,996
Wow.

321
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:13,657
I'll let you know.

322
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:14,717
I'll put it on Facebook.

323
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:15,117
You'll see it.

324
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:15,757
Oh, definitely.

325
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,778
I'll definitely want to see it.

326
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,118
Yeah, I want to see the movie now.

327
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:19,318
I'll get you a copy anyways.

328
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,419
Yeah, definitely.

329
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:30,802
Now, do you have any, like, since you've been in so many movies, is there, like, any good stories you can tell about, you know, certain actors or certain things that have happened, or directors, or is that confidential?

330
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,777
American Hustle, I did American Hustle.

331
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,080
I was the waiter.

332
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,121
I saw you in that.

333
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,565
I served the food to Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale.

334
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,358
That particular movie, we had a lot of fun.

335
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,839
It was done in Worcester in a restaurant.

336
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,601
And so I had a lot of fun doing that.

337
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,742
I met David O. Russell.

338
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,103
I actually made some eggplant parmesan for all of them.

339
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,085
You made eggplant parmesan for David O. Russell?

340
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:56,685
David Russell, yeah.

341
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:57,726
Oh my god.

342
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:57,946
Yeah.

343
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,107
I made three trays.

344
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,509
You know, Angela Perry is a good friend of mine.

345
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,989
Angela.

346
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:02,990
So Angela asked me.

347
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,410
So I did it.

348
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,972
They were very great, very nice people.

349
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,273
I had a lot of fun with them.

350
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:09,655
We went to Angela's house and we had a good time.

351
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,518
I can tell you a funny, I'll tell you a story that's, I was in my car.

352
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,839
I just got done with the Proposal movie.

353
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,540
That's the Sandra Bullock movie.

354
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,682
Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

355
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:24,325
This is at the time... What was her name?

356
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:26,186
His wife that he married there.

357
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,047
Ryan Reynolds?

358
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:27,847
Yeah.

359
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:28,788
Scarlett Johansson.

360
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,849
Scarlett Johansson, right.

361
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:31,670
So Scarlett Johansson...

362
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:35,879
I'm in my car, it's in the car and it's raining and I can't see and she's knocking on the window.

363
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,259
She comes out, Scarlett Johansson.

364
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,880
She goes, do you know where Ryan Reynolds is?

365
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,340
I said, yeah, his bus, his trailer's right there, I'll show you.

366
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,941
So I got out of the car and it was raining, I had an umbrella and we walked over to the trailer.

367
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:49,862
She just flew in from California, she had like two dozens of roses, it was his birthday.

368
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:54,284
So she flew all the way from California and she wanted to give him roses.

369
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,124
So I sent her the trailer.

370
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,204
But the roses weren't for you?

371
00:18:58,825 --> 00:18:59,845
That was a good story, exactly.

372
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:01,485
I was shocked when I saw her.

373
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,426
I said, Scarlett Johansson was knocking on the window.

374
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,967
And I said, gee, that's Scarlett Johansson.

375
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,247
And I was in a private lot.

376
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,528
The movie was probably roped off.

377
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,909
But then I just walked her over to the trailer.

378
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,169
And she said, well, thank you very much.

379
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:18,891
But it was an interesting story that someone would do something like that.

380
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,931
Any other story you want to say?

381
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,062
Melissa McCarthy, I've talked to her, she's very nice.

382
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,924
I had a long talk with her, and we talked about food.

383
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,686
And she wanted some, and I gave her a list of restaurants.

384
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:33,008
When you're Italian, that's when you talk about food.

385
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:37,751
She knew I was from the North End originally, so I gave her some, I made a list of North End restaurants that she visited.

386
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,672
So she was very, she was nice.

387
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:40,412
And Sandra Bullock.

388
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,053
Most of them are very nice people.

389
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:47,777
I haven't had... Was there like one star that was really, as you say, like a jerk or anything?

390
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:49,961
You don't want to say that sometimes?

391
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:50,763
No, it's okay.

392
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:54,270
I really didn't find it much.

393
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:58,038
I know there's a few, but nothing to me.

394
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:03,024
I, the first movie I did was Celtic Pride, which was 1994.

395
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,866
That's a long time ago, yeah.

396
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,989
It was one of the last things done at the old Boston Garden.

397
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,070
Yeah, right, right, right.

398
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:17,876
And, you know, I was, you know, and I remember these extras, the crowd, right?

399
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:23,840
Matt, no, Damon Wayans was shooting, he was playing Louis Scott, and they were,

400
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:29,238
They looked at, he was shooting baskets, and the kid said, we love you, Damon.

401
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,200
And he turns around, and I love you, too.

402
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,383
Well, I can tell you a funny story.

403
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:38,027
Most of the time, you're not supposed to talk to them because they're working.

404
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,209
Well, they say that, but that's not really true.

405
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:41,170
I'm glad you brought that up.

406
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,970
They say, as long as you don't initiate the conversation with the actors.

407
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,352
Like Adam Sandler, I was walking and he called me over.

408
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:53,336
He goes, come on, we're going to go upstairs and play basketball at the YMCA with grown-ups.

409
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:59,682
I was in three or four days, so one of the days we had a film at the YMCA in the South End.

410
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:04,399
So on the break, there was Chris Rock, David Spain, and myself.

411
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,200
We played basketball upstairs.

412
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,022
So he called me over.

413
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,966
I didn't ask him if I wanted to go play basketball with him, but we did on the break.

414
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:13,707
It was about an hour.

415
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,949
Adam Sandler invited you to play basketball.

416
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:16,229
Yeah.

417
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,070
So I was on his team.

418
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,833
It was me and Adam Sandler against Chris Rock and David Spain.

419
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:23,034
Adam Sandler was a good shooter, he was making all the baskets.

420
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:29,677
Kevin James was in that movie too, wasn't he?

421
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,497
Yeah, he was.

422
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,258
He's the guy that wasn't too popular.

423
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,240
I don't know why, just a lot of people didn't care for him.

424
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,230
Yeah.

425
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,592
Frankie, what other projects are you working on now?

426
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,713
Pizza makers, we're going to be doing, right now we have to go on a hiatus.

427
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,534
I actually had your friend Chris Palermo.

428
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:52,236
The first show I did when we came back, Chris Palermo does that show.

429
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:54,476
He showed a clip of Pizza Makers.

430
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:55,237
Oh, good.

431
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:55,757
It was funny.

432
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:57,838
You were doing like this funny dance with this meatball.

433
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:00,299
I was just dying laughing.

434
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:00,799
Yeah, that was funny.

435
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,859
That was a good one.

436
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:08,263
That was the last episode we did, I think, yeah.

437
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,884
He's supposed to be doing a short film.

438
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:10,585
Yeah.

439
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:12,306
And then he wants to put it out in festivals.

440
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,568
So I don't know if he's going to continue with the episode.

441
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:15,729
We did 12 episodes.

442
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,770
He may be doing more episodes.

443
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,312
He's going to make a decision on that pretty soon, he said.

444
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,035
He wants to get, he's on, right now, you know, he's on the radio every day.

445
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,837
So he's busy with that right now.

446
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:26,917
Yeah.

447
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,239
Now you mentioned your screen actor, Gil, right?

448
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,080
Yeah, I'm with the screen actor.

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,340
Yes.

450
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:32,242
Is it,

451
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:43,035
easier do they do companies production companies like film companies tend to hire more union than non-union do you find that?

452
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,561
It's like a 50-50 thing.

453
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:55,007
I don't think they hire... Well, it depends on the budget of the people who are running the movie, you know?

454
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:59,130
Because if they can get non-union actors for sharp money, then that's what they do.

455
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,214
But most of the big movies, 90% of the big movies, are Screen Actors Guild members.

456
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:05,575
Oh, wow.

457
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:13,140
Well, I always tell people, if you get waivers, you should join SAG, because instead of making 100 bucks a day for a movie, you could make 700 to 800 a day.

458
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,708
Now, they have residuals too, right?

459
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:27,316
Because after eight hours you get over, time and a half, and after ten you get double time, and then after like 15 hours, you call golden time, it's like $150 an hour or something like that.

460
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:27,636
Wow.

461
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,298
So, I've gone there twice.

462
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,601
Once I got it in Ted, the movie, we were at the aquarium.

463
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:35,822
Yeah.

464
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:38,864
And we did overnight, so we took golden time.

465
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,927
And then I got it again, one time, again in another movie, I think it was Ghostbusters, we did.

466
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:52,011
I don't care what anybody says, I loved the female reboot of Ghostbusters.

467
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,472
I thought it was great.

468
00:23:54,632 --> 00:24:03,996
It's not the original, nothing can beat the original, but Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and I think Kay McKinnon stole the show.

469
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,817
She's so funny, I like her, she's good.

470
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:08,258
I was talking to her, I met her, she's very nice.

471
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:20,961
Yeah, so most of the big movies, we have the Pizza Makers, the DJ Stan the Man, and the big movies, I'd say recently, I'm in two movies that didn't come out yet.

472
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:25,422
One's called Catcher is a Spy with Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd.

473
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,082
That's coming out, I think, in May.

474
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:34,024
April 6th, this weekend, April 6th is Chappaquiddick is coming out.

475
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,284
You did that?

476
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:36,304
I did that, yes.

477
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,645
I played part of the Mary Jo Kopechny family.

478
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:43,488
They put us in a 1970s suit and we're at the funeral scene.

479
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:47,311
Not a pallbearer but we had to mingle in with the family and say I'm sorry.

480
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:49,233
Things like that.

481
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,734
It's going to be a good movie I think.

482
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:52,395
Jason Clarke's a nice guy.

483
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:52,755
I met him.

484
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:53,456
Jason who?

485
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:54,256
Jason Clarke.

486
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,457
He plays Ted Kennedy.

487
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:57,419
He's a good actor.

488
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,120
I've definitely got to see that.

489
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,980
He looks like him.

490
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:01,742
I think when he was younger.

491
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,546
Well, Frankie, I gotta tell you, it is a pleasure to have you on.

492
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:07,607
I appreciate you having me.

493
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:08,568
It was very nice of you.

494
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:09,309
It was nice.

495
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,411
We had fun.

496
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:12,152
Like I said, I've known you... We go back a long way.

497
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:17,198
We go back a long way, from Stiffs to the old station, all that stuff.

498
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,740
Like I said, I wanted to have you back on.

499
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,340
Thank you very much.

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,821
I appreciate it.

501
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:21,042
I want to appreciate it.

502
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:21,463
Thank you.

503
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,045
And hope we'll see you in a future movie as well.

504
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:33,412
And that's all the time we have, so I want to thank my friend Frankie Ambergamo for coming and hope to see you on the next episode of the Stevie V Show.

505
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:35,153
Until then, so long.

506
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:50,325
do
