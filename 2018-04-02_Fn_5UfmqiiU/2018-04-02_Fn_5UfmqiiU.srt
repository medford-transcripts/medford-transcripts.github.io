1
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi everybody, welcome once again to the Stevie B Show.

2
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:08,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Stevie B and I have a very special guest with me tonight, Mr. Frankie Ambergamo.

3
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:09,757
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing Frankie?

4
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too bad Steve, how's everything?

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's going fine.

6
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell an interesting story before we continue.

7
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:25,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I had you on my show back in 2012 and we taped the show and it was shown a couple of times and then the studio closed up and

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,453
[SPEAKER_06]: The show ended up getting lost, pretty much.

9
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We never could get the show back.

10
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:37,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So after five years later, I wanted to have you back on the show.

11
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:38,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I appreciate that.

12
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:39,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

13
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:42,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you've been a good friend of mine for so long.

14
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for having me.

15
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do the show again.

16
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:48,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Frankie, you...

17
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,471
[SPEAKER_06]: You have an interesting story.

18
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,633
[SPEAKER_06]: You used to work as a mailman, right?

19
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was a supervisor in the postal service.

20
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off as a craft employee, you know, car carrier.

21
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And after about 88 years, I went into, I was a union rep for about four years.

22
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:07,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I went into management after about my first 10 years of postal service.

[SPEAKER_06]: What is, you have a friend named Emeril Lagasse?

25
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:43,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Emeril Lagasse, Emeril, yeah.

26
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:50,853
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened was, back in 2004, I submitted a recipe, my meatballs and gravy.

27
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,155
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it gravy, some people call it sauce.

28
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it sauce, my family is sauce.

29
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that before, that could be a whole show.

30
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:59,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that could be a whole show, it's gravy, it's sauce.

31
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, make a long story short, I submitted a recipe to Emeril, he was having an Emeril's Italian contest.

32
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was 1,500 contestants.

33
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:09,346
[SPEAKER_06]: 1500 contestants?

34
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:12,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I sent my recipe in out of my cookbook.

35
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:13,488
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, I wrote a cookbook.

36
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got your cookbook.

37
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:19,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I sent that in, and then I was at work at the time at the post office.

38
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a call from one of the producers.

39
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, gee, we've got your recipe and everything for the contest, and you're in the top 100.

40
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:26,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

41
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't think nothing of it.

42
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,659
[SPEAKER_03]: A week later, the guy called me again.

43
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, you're in the top 25, and we'll get back to you.

44
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:34,142
[SPEAKER_03]: The third call came in.

45
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the top winner.

46
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:36,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You were the top?

47
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:37,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the top winner.

48
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said, we're going to come to Boston.

49
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:45,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they came, they met me in the North End at the Abruzzi Meat Market, where I was buying the ingredients to make the meatballs.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,981
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the fresh hamburger.

52
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And so after that, we did that with some walking and talking through the North End.

53
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:55,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went back to my house in Medford, and I made it live in front of all the whole crew was there.

54
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

55
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:57,166
[SPEAKER_03]: The Food Network crew.

56
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And we stayed about eight hours there.

57
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:03,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're having meatballs and some pasta and a little wine and stuff like that.

58
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:04,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a good time.

59
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:08,869
[SPEAKER_03]: A week after that, they flew me and my wife over to the Food Network studio in New York City.

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was on the Emeril Hive show with Emeril Agassi.

61
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:12,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

62
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he did is he picked four winners and he recreates the whole four recipes.

63
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he called me up to the stove.

64
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, want to smell the sauce?

65
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:21,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on up.

66
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:21,932
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I doing?

67
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that happened, after that show, I got calls from Boston Casting.

68
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, we're doing a movie, doing some movies in Boston.

69
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:31,174
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like you to come up for an audition.

70
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We think you'd be a good fit for this movie.

71
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with Danny Aiello.

72
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:35,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Stips.

73
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:36,995
[SPEAKER_06]: We did that.

74
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:39,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's when I met you, I think, Stips.

75
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

76
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I met you and your father.

77
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,356
[SPEAKER_06]: My father.

78
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:44,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They use my father more than they use me.

79
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,497
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the Italian features and I don't.

80
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,598
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a nice guy, your father.

81
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:49,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice man.

82
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:57,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So after that happened, the first movie was Stiffs, then the second movie was The Game Plan, then Pink Panther 2, Mulk, all those.

83
00:04:57,425 --> 00:05:01,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And after about the sixth or seventh movie, I started getting waivers and I joined SAG.

84
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And now up to 2018, I've been in 52 movies.

85
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:04,767
52?

86
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

87
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

88
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:10,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's including some independent films and a few other movies.

89
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly big major films, you know?

90
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:13,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it.

91
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we're going to take a look at the footage of you on the Emeril Lagasse show.

92
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

93
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're going to see Frankie with... Bam!

94
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:22,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

95
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at that.

96
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:28,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Emeril.

97
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:33,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Frankie Bergamo from Boston's North End, and I'm going to show you how to make Frankie's gravy.

98
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my fondest memories was when my mother was frying the meatballs on Sunday mornings.

99
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:45,237
[SPEAKER_03]: The aroma from the meat that we buy here at Frank's.

100
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:45,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Morning, Frank.

101
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:46,418
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

102
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:47,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Morning, good morning.

103
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,080
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make a gravy today.

105
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need two pounds of hamburger, all beef.

106
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:54,748
[SPEAKER_03]: The Italians that live in the South Shore call it sauce.

107
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready for the sauce?

108
00:05:57,177 --> 00:06:00,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the Italian people that live in Boston, not then, would call it gravy.

109
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that happened, but that's the way it is.

110
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got Frankie Imbrogamo, his lovely wife.

111
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:09,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

112
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:10,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

113
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to have you.

114
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

115
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pleasure.

116
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:14,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

117
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna try to make Frankie's gravy now.

118
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got the ground meat.

119
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So every Sunday you make this?

120
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Sunday.

121
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, every Sunday I'll start coming over.

122
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

123
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

124
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,605
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now what we're gonna do, folks, is we're gonna mix all these ingredients together.

125
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:38,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you gotta have a lot of sauce and a lot of gravy, and you gotta have a lot of cheese to go on top, right?

126
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:40,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great job.

127
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Super job.

128
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:45,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, folks, we're gonna dish this up to the audience here.

129
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back, you'll meet the next winner.

130
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick around.

[SPEAKER_06]: You said you've been in 52 movies.

133
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you met many famous people?

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met Adam Sandler, the whole group of grown-ups.

135
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I stayed with them for three or four days, working in grown-ups one.

136
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:22,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I met Adam Sandler, then I met Wilson McCarthy, Sandra Bullock.

137
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,204
[SPEAKER_03]: All the people like that.

138
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,505
[SPEAKER_03]: All the big movies, I've been fortunate.

139
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some good scenes with them, you know?

140
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Like The Proposal.

00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: R.I.P.D.

00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:32,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with...

[SPEAKER_06]: I did R.I.P.D.

144
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,249
[SPEAKER_06]: at Fenway Park, I remember that.

145
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was in what they called the bullpen at that time.

146
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:47,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a police officer, a 1970s police officer, and they had by decades how many police officers they had in each decade.

147
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with Jeff Bridges.

148
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan Reynolds.

149
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Jeff Bridges.

150
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,101
[SPEAKER_03]: They give me a whole month.

151
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked there for a whole month.

152
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember one story.

153
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:05,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff Bridges, he always went during the set, during breaks in the set, he would always go up to the young ladies and say, how are you doing girls?

154
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,024
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

155
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:07,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny guy.

156
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:08,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice guy.

157
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I met a lot of Danny Aiello stiffs.

158
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:13,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I met The Rock.

159
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I met... I met Kevin Hart recently.

160
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:23,355
[SPEAKER_03]: We did Central Intelligence up in Somerville at Tavern on the Hill, that bar.

161
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:25,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So I met him in there.

162
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I just recently met Will Ferrell and a couple of the ones in Daddy's Home, too.

163
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was... Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg was there.

164
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:35,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to him for a while.

165
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an interesting story about Will Ferrell.

166
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:42,330
[SPEAKER_06]: When we did Daddy's Home 2 at Logan Airport, I was in this.

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,931
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an extra there, his name was Billy.

168
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:52,674
[SPEAKER_06]: He had Down syndrome and Will Ferrell came up to him between takes, had his picture taken with him.

169
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Will Ferrell was a nice guy.

170
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good guy.

171
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, we're going to take a look at your demo.

172
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:02,378
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to look at some of the things you've been in and then we'll talk more with you, okay?

173
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I appreciate it.

174
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ, Lord.

175
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:18,989
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy comes in here every friggin' day and gets into my meatballs.

176
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,570
[SPEAKER_02]: How come he never pays?

177
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is he?

178
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,109
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new kind of Yankees-Red Sox rivalry.

179
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:08,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah?

180
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:08,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!

182
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Frankie, I ordered the chicken parm with extra cheese.

183
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:33,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Annie, today's your lucky day, because I've got a deal for you.

184
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:38,814
[SPEAKER_03]: How about if I give you this sandwich, filled with lovin' from the oven, and you agree to go out with me?

185
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:42,277
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this, Frankie?

186
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:50,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll agree to pay you double for the sandwich, and you'll agree to leave me the frig alone!

187
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,988

[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.

192
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:15,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have thought that you were a mailman at one time and now you're a big movie star?

193
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:16,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.

[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.

200
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes what happens is they start calling you.

201
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,690
[SPEAKER_03]: You might do like 10 movies in a year.

202
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,771
[SPEAKER_03]: One year I did 13 movies.

203
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:51,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Boston right now is like, because of the tax breaks, a lot of production companies come here.

204

[SPEAKER_06]: It's been on a lull right now because of the, lately.

205
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:02,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we did Stiffs, I remember that.

206
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Danny Aiello was a nice guy.

207
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:11,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I went up to him and I said, Danny, I'm a big fan, my favorite movie with you is 29th Street.

208
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love that, that's one of my favorite movies.

209
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my favorites, me and my brother.

210
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:20,407
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys ever see a Danny Aiello movie, rent 29th Street.

211
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:21,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, excellent movie.

212
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's on Netflix, I don't know.

213
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:24,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony Rapalio, he was good too, he played a good part.

214
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:29,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you recently were in a movie that you actually starred in.

215
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,124
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it called?

216
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:30,904
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Stand the Man.

217
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:31,725
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Stand the Man.

218
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:34,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And I play a photographer, one of the lead roles.

219
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And the story is written by Matt Fisher.

220
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: He directed it and wrote it.

221
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Did a great job on the story.

222
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,409
[SPEAKER_03]: The story goes about this DJ.

223
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,730
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a washed-up DJ.

224
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you the DJ?

225
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not the DJ.

226
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:48,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the photographer.

227
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the photographer that works with the DJ.

228
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:54,454
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the wedding business.

229
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a washed-up DJ.

230
00:12:58,176 --> 00:12:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago, he was a rock star DJ.

231
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he gets small gigs and small money, small weddings.

232
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But in his mind he still thinks he's like the best.

233
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:12,368
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very bitter and he starts trouble with people.

234
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,210
[SPEAKER_03]: People like the mother and father of weddings.

235
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,232
[SPEAKER_03]: He fights with his staff like myself.

236
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,474
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good story behind it and it's a good movie.

237
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:24,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the premiere about a year and a half ago in the Arlington region.

238
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,817
[SPEAKER_03]: We had about 400 people, 500 people.

239
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:31,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had an after party at Bocelli's in Medford.

240
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a couple hundred people downstairs in the back there.

241
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,639
[SPEAKER_03]: They took care of us, it was a good after party.

242
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And then recently, after that we had a screening in Belmont.

243
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,206
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about six, maybe eight months ago.

244
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:51,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And then recently, now last week, we just had a, two weeks ago, we had it at the Capitol Theater, the screening.

245
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

246
00:13:52,209 --> 00:14:02,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a smaller theater, because for people who didn't see it, like, so he wanted to get a smaller venue, a smaller, there was only about 100 seats, but it was good, there was like half of it, it was good, it was a lot of fun.

247
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:04,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of fun?

248
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

249
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:06,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So who else stars in the movie?

250
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Chase Carson plays the DJ.

251
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,300
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually a real DJ.

252
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,263
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on WMFO, Tufts University.

253
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,106
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his own show on Friday nights at 10 o'clock.

254
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called The Time Tunnel.

255
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a real DJ.

256
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,050
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, who else is in it?

257

[SPEAKER_06]: I know Alex.

[SPEAKER_06]: We did Arsenic and Old Lace back with the Mystic Players.

261
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of the last shows we did with the Mystic Players back in 2006.

262
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:42,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex is a good guy.

263
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know Heidi Rhodes is in it too.

[SPEAKER_03]: She's been around.

267
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,149
[SPEAKER_03]: She lives in California now, but she did a good job.

268
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a lot of fun doing that.

269
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,612
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gonna put it out in festivals and he does other movies.

270

[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, are they holding auditions or anything?

274
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know what he's doing yet.

275
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,676
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he's going to get back to me and see, but he's definitely going to do some movies.

276
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:15,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But he didn't hold any of this shit.

277
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:17,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know if you're interested.

[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a black eye.

289
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked in the mirror, you f***ed my face, people gonna notice.

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's good.

00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing funny about abuse.

296
00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have you arrested, you know.

297
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,722

[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

302
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,146
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody says anything, just say, hey, you should see the other guy.

303
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fucking funny.

304
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I need my eyes, both of them, to take pictures.

305
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need both your eyes.

306
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,630
[SPEAKER_02]: You close one when you look through the hole.

307
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Close the black one.

308
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,691
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's that easy?

309
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:25,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

310
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:28,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow.

311
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

312
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:42,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long is the movie going to be before it comes to DVD?

313
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:54,872
[SPEAKER_03]: He said the end of April he's doing a box set because last year he got the five main characters and we did a documentary on how DJ became, how the people got together.

314
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did a little documentary.

315
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody did 30 minutes each segment.

316
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So he put it together and made a documentary.

317
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:05,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's going to have a box set with the DJ movie and the documentary.

318
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:10,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll probably be on iTunes or it'll be on Amazon.

319
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:12,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be coming out, I think, at the end of April.

320
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:12,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

321
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:13,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know.

322
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:14,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it on Facebook.

323
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:15,117
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it.

324
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:15,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, definitely.

325
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll definitely want to see it.

326
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to see the movie now.

327
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:19,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you a copy anyways.

328
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.

329
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:30,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do you have any, like, since you've been in so many movies, is there, like, any good stories you can tell about, you know, certain actors or certain things that have happened, or directors, or is that confidential?

330
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,777
[SPEAKER_03]: American Hustle, I did American Hustle.

331
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:39,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the waiter.

332
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you in that.

333
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I served the food to Jennifer Lawrence and Christian Bale.

334
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That particular movie, we had a lot of fun.

335
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done in Worcester in a restaurant.

336
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had a lot of fun doing that.

337
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I met David O. Russell.

338
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually made some eggplant parmesan for all of them.

339
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:56,085
[SPEAKER_06]: You made eggplant parmesan for David O. Russell?

340
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:56,685
[SPEAKER_03]: David Russell, yeah.

341
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:57,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

342
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

343
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I made three trays.

344
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Angela Perry is a good friend of mine.

345
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Angela.

346
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:02,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So Angela asked me.

347
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:03,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did it.

348
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,972
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very great, very nice people.

349
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of fun with them.

350
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Angela's house and we had a good time.

351
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you a funny, I'll tell you a story that's, I was in my car.

352
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got done with the Proposal movie.

353
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,540
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Sandra Bullock movie.

354
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.

355
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:24,325
[SPEAKER_03]: This is at the time... What was her name?

356
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:26,186
[SPEAKER_03]: His wife that he married there.

357
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryan Reynolds?

358
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

359
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:28,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Scarlett Johansson.

360
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarlett Johansson, right.

361
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:31,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So Scarlett Johansson...

362
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:35,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in my car, it's in the car and it's raining and I can't see and she's knocking on the window.

363
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:37,259
[SPEAKER_03]: She comes out, Scarlett Johansson.

364
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,880
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, do you know where Ryan Reynolds is?

365
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, yeah, his bus, his trailer's right there, I'll show you.

366
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got out of the car and it was raining, I had an umbrella and we walked over to the trailer.

367
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:49,862
[SPEAKER_03]: She just flew in from California, she had like two dozens of roses, it was his birthday.

368
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:54,284
[SPEAKER_03]: So she flew all the way from California and she wanted to give him roses.

369
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sent her the trailer.

370
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But the roses weren't for you?

371
00:18:58,825 --> 00:18:59,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good story, exactly.

372
00:19:00,445 --> 00:19:01,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I was shocked when I saw her.

373
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Scarlett Johansson was knocking on the window.

374
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, gee, that's Scarlett Johansson.

375
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was in a private lot.

376
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,528
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie was probably roped off.

377
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,909
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I just walked her over to the trailer.

378
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, well, thank you very much.

379
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:18,891
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was an interesting story that someone would do something like that.

380
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other story you want to say?

381
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Melissa McCarthy, I've talked to her, she's very nice.

382
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a long talk with her, and we talked about food.

383
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And she wanted some, and I gave her a list of restaurants.

384
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:33,008
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're Italian, that's when you talk about food.

385
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:37,751
[SPEAKER_03]: She knew I was from the North End originally, so I gave her some, I made a list of North End restaurants that she visited.

386
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was very, she was nice.

387
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:40,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sandra Bullock.

388
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are very nice people.

389
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:47,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had... Was there like one star that was really, as you say, like a jerk or anything?

390
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to say that sometimes?

391
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:50,763
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's okay.

392
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:54,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I really didn't find it much.

393
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a few, but nothing to me.

394
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:03,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I, the first movie I did was Celtic Pride, which was 1994.

395
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,866
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long time ago, yeah.

396
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of the last things done at the old Boston Garden.

397
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right, right, right.

398
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:17,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I was, you know, and I remember these extras, the crowd, right?

399
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:23,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, no, Damon Wayans was shooting, he was playing Louis Scott, and they were,

400
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:29,238
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked at, he was shooting baskets, and the kid said, we love you, Damon.

401
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,200
[SPEAKER_06]: And he turns around, and I love you, too.

402
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can tell you a funny story.

403
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:38,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time, you're not supposed to talk to them because they're working.

404
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they say that, but that's not really true.

405
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:41,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you brought that up.

406
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,970
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, as long as you don't initiate the conversation with the actors.

407
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Adam Sandler, I was walking and he called me over.

408
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:53,336
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, come on, we're going to go upstairs and play basketball at the YMCA with grown-ups.

409
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:59,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in three or four days, so one of the days we had a film at the YMCA in the South End.

410
00:21:00,195 --> 00:21:04,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the break, there was Chris Rock, David Spain, and myself.

411
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,200
[SPEAKER_03]: We played basketball upstairs.

412
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So he called me over.

413
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ask him if I wanted to go play basketball with him, but we did on the break.

414
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about an hour.

415
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam Sandler invited you to play basketball.

416
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

417
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was on his team.

418
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It was me and Adam Sandler against Chris Rock and David Spain.

419
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:23,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam Sandler was a good shooter, he was making all the baskets.

420
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:29,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin James was in that movie too, wasn't he?

421
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was.

422
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,258
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that wasn't too popular.

423
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, just a lot of people didn't care for him.

424
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

425
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Frankie, what other projects are you working on now?

426
00:21:43,472 --> 00:21:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Pizza makers, we're going to be doing, right now we have to go on a hiatus.

427
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had your friend Chris Palermo.

428
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: The first show I did when we came back, Chris Palermo does that show.

429
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:54,476
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed a clip of Pizza Makers.

430
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

431
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:55,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny.

432
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:57,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You were doing like this funny dance with this meatball.

433
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:00,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just dying laughing.

434
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:00,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was funny.

435
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good one.

436
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:08,263
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the last episode we did, I think, yeah.

437
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: He's supposed to be doing a short film.

438
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:10,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

439
00:22:10,885 --> 00:22:12,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he wants to put it out in festivals.

440
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if he's going to continue with the episode.

441
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:15,729
[SPEAKER_03]: We did 12 episodes.

442
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: He may be doing more episodes.

443
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,312
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to make a decision on that pretty soon, he said.

444
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,035
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to get, he's on, right now, you know, he's on the radio every day.

445
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's busy with that right now.

446
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:26,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

447
00:22:27,398 --> 00:22:29,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you mentioned your screen actor, Gil, right?

448
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm with the screen actor.

449
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

450
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:32,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it,

451
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:43,035
[SPEAKER_06]: easier do they do companies production companies like film companies tend to hire more union than non-union do you find that?

452
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a 50-50 thing.

453
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:55,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they hire... Well, it depends on the budget of the people who are running the movie, you know?

454
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:59,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if they can get non-union actors for sharp money, then that's what they do.

455
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the big movies, 90% of the big movies, are Screen Actors Guild members.

456
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:05,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

457
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:13,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I always tell people, if you get waivers, you should join SAG, because instead of making 100 bucks a day for a movie, you could make 700 to 800 a day.

458
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they have residuals too, right?

459
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:27,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Because after eight hours you get over, time and a half, and after ten you get double time, and then after like 15 hours, you call golden time, it's like $150 an hour or something like that.

460
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

461
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've gone there twice.

462
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I got it in Ted, the movie, we were at the aquarium.

463
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:35,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

464
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:38,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did overnight, so we took golden time.

465
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got it again, one time, again in another movie, I think it was Ghostbusters, we did.

466
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:52,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care what anybody says, I loved the female reboot of Ghostbusters.

467
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was great.

468
00:23:54,632 --> 00:24:03,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the original, nothing can beat the original, but Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and I think Kay McKinnon stole the show.

469
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,817
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so funny, I like her, she's good.

470
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:08,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to her, I met her, she's very nice.

471
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:20,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so most of the big movies, we have the Pizza Makers, the DJ Stan the Man, and the big movies, I'd say recently, I'm in two movies that didn't come out yet.

472
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:25,422
[SPEAKER_03]: One's called Catcher is a Spy with Paul Giamatti and Paul Rudd.

473
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out, I think, in May.

474
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: April 6th, this weekend, April 6th is Chappaquiddick is coming out.

475
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You did that?

476
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:36,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that, yes.

477
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I played part of the Mary Jo Kopechny family.

478
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:43,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They put us in a 1970s suit and we're at the funeral scene.

479
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:47,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a pallbearer but we had to mingle in with the family and say I'm sorry.

480
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:49,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.

481
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,734
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good movie I think.

482
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:52,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Clarke's a nice guy.

483
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:52,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him.

484
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:53,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason who?

485
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:54,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Clarke.

486
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,457
[SPEAKER_03]: He plays Ted Kennedy.

487
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:57,419
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good actor.

488
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely got to see that.

489
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,980
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like him.

490
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:01,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when he was younger.

491
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Frankie, I gotta tell you, it is a pleasure to have you on.

492
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:07,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you having me.

493
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:08,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very nice of you.

494
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:09,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice.

495
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,411
[SPEAKER_06]: We had fun.

496
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:12,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I've known you... We go back a long way.

497
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:17,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We go back a long way, from Stiffs to the old station, all that stuff.

498
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I wanted to have you back on.

499
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,821

501
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:21,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to appreciate it.

502
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

503
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And hope we'll see you in a future movie as well.

504
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:33,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all the time we have, so I want to thank my friend Frankie Ambergamo for coming and hope to see you on the next episode of the Stevie V Show.

505
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:35,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, so long.

506
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:50,325
