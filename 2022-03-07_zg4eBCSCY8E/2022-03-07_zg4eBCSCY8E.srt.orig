00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:23,522
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working in cooperation with Eastern bus to be able to support their employees, with regard to additional mass and testing supplies that they are in need of them, but for students riding Eastern bus.

148
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:26,804
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be a mask mask optional policy.

149
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:42,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like I'd ask for some indulgence with respect to the specialized transportation services and the students riding on other vendors and we'll report back via most likely via email and certainly communicate that out to all affected families prior to the end of this week.

150
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:53,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from the transportation piece, Miss Hines provided to you a public health update data with regard to our final week of surveillance testing.

151
00:18:54,665 --> 00:19:00,687
[SPEAKER_00]: We completed over 2200 tests and had a positivity rate district wide under 1% at 0.41%.

152
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:11,270
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously encouraging it's both consistent with what we've seen regionally, and in the community with regard to the declining positivity.

153
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,071
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also reached a point where our.

154
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:35,292
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid test distribution has exceeded that are currently our most recent surveillance testing numbers so we have 2600 over 2600 students close to 2700 who have registered to receive the rapid test on a weekly basis and the vast majority of medical school staff are also participating in the.

155
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:47,621
[SPEAKER_00]: In the rapid test program so we'll continue to put this in our communications, but I'll just put a reminder out here that participation in the rapid test program sponsored by the Department of elementary and secondary education.

156
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:57,468
[SPEAKER_00]: requires both the receipt of the rapid test and the reporting in of any positive results so that second piece the reporting requirement that.

157
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:07,180
[SPEAKER_00]: is part of why we track the consent forms and while we'll continue to reiterate that piece via all of our communications is just as important as actually taking the test and completing the test.

158
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:20,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I believe the superintendent mentioned that the clinic, or in school, excuse me, our after school clinic on Wednesday for vaccination clinic will take place this Wednesday.

159
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:27,680
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be our final vaccination clinic we run approximately 10 after school vaccination clinics and so good participation in that.

160
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,584
[SPEAKER_00]: We've sort of reached a point in the cycle or just let everybody come into the clinics in this last week and this week are there for their follow up second shot in the series of vaccinations.

161
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:45,008
[SPEAKER_00]: In the event anyone does receive a first shot they'll need to report to the Board of Health with the city to receive their their follow up shot.

162
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:56,589
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to extend the gratitude and part of the administration to the health services team who have extended their days on Wednesdays since January to make those clinics a success.

163
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:09,413
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week in all of our elementary schools, starting today at the Mississippi is the second shot for over a hundred students who received their vaccination in school as part of our in school vaccination program.

164
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:15,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of other very quick comments with regard to the conclusion of our safe balance testing program.

165
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:16,124
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ms.

166
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:20,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham, I'd like to stop here and just see if there are any questions before I make the offer those final comments.

167
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:22,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions?

168
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,166
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're good to go.

169
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:38,308
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say last week we concluded a surveillance testing program that was made possible through our partnership with Tufts University starting in

170
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:47,341
[SPEAKER_00]: for staff starting in late September of 2020, and then ramping up with students at the end of November of 2020.

171
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:54,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had an opportunity to speak to the chief information officer at Tufts, Chris Sidor, earlier this evening.

172
00:21:55,365 --> 00:22:10,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I called him, I told him that I think it was the first time in over a year and a half of calling him with regularity, that I was not calling to ask for anything on behalf of the district or to inform him as to what our needs were.

173
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:12,859
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was calling only to express.

174
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:24,566
[SPEAKER_00]: On behalf of the district, the gratitude we feel for what Tufts, in particular, Mr. Sador and Karen Graziano on his staff have positioned us to do over the course of the last year and a half.

175
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:41,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way that I would just put it for the community's benefit is that over the course of the pandemic, school districts have been asked repeatedly to do things that we're not particularly adept at doing, that we're not structured to do, and that in many respects, we don't have the capacity to do.

176
00:22:43,665 --> 00:23:02,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't overstate how Tufts University, in particular Mr. Sador and Karen, have exhibited flexibility and adaptability on our behalf to position us to be able to run our testing program over the course of the last year and a half.

177
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:07,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly also thanks to our health services team, both Ms.

178
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:07,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray and her

179
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:11,197
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership of the department at that time and Ms.

180
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:15,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines over the course of this year and certainly working closely with Mariana O'Connor, Board of Health.

181
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:37,466
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the parents and community members who are wondering what are some of the things that can distinguish the Medford Public Schools and position us to be successful and serve students well, our partnership and our relationship with Tufts has truly been invaluable and is frankly very unique.

182
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:40,987
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the types of partnerships that school districts can benefit from.

183
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:51,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to use this opportunity to say publicly how indebted we are to the Tufts team and to all the contributions they've made to us over the course of the last year and a half.

184
00:23:51,928 --> 00:24:07,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you happen to see any Tufts administrators out or if you're a neighbor of some Tufts students and they're keeping you up, just keep in mind that we could not have done the work that we did without them and we'll always be very grateful to them for that.

185
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:12,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it for surveillance testing updates because we won't be doing it going forward.

186
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:13,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

187
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions from the committee?

188
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:22,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay.

189
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:31,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Item number three, report on the proposed integrated mathematics programming at Medford High School from Director of Mathematics, Ms.

190
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Faisal Khan.

191
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me here.

192
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:46,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe everybody has a copy of my slides and the FAQs.

193
00:24:47,384 --> 00:25:00,429
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm here today to propose the addition of integrated mathematics pathways to the mathematics education that we are offering in Medford Public Schools.

194
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:07,231
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to start out by giving a short description of what pathways

195
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:12,992
[SPEAKER_12]: in mathematics are according to the Massachusetts frameworks of 2017.

196
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:18,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So pathways represent a coherent sequence of courses.

197
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:31,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And the word coherent here is really important because in Massachusetts frameworks of 2017, there is emphasis on three aspects of mathematics education.

198
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:35,145
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is coherence, other one is focus, and the third one is rigor.

199
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:45,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So pathways represent a coherent sequence of courses which give all students access to math education in order to get them ready for future studies.

200
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:54,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Math pathways provide students with more equitable access to a foundational core curriculum and increase opportunities to pursue directions of interest.

201
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:59,697
[SPEAKER_12]: The pathways empower the students to choose what learning style works for them.

202
00:26:00,337 --> 00:26:13,988
[SPEAKER_12]: While both pathways listed below start with the same basic concepts, the students can choose the courses in their later years at the high school which align with their own interest for their post-secondary goals.

203
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:20,413
[SPEAKER_12]: So currently we are offering the traditional mathematics pathways and that's what we have done for quite a few years.

204
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,995
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the AGA sequence or

205
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:26,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Algebra 1 geometry, Algebra 2 sequence.

206
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:33,381
[SPEAKER_12]: We would like to introduce integrated mathematics pathways, where it is course 1, course 2, and course 3.

207
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:44,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Slide three is a visual of what we currently have as compared to what we would like to have.

208
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:54,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And when I say as compared to, I would like to emphasize on the fact that we are keeping the traditional pathway.

209
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:00,642
[SPEAKER_12]: We are introducing integrated pathway in addition to the traditional pathway.

210
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,883
[SPEAKER_12]: And another

211
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:19,856
[SPEAKER_12]: point to note here in the visual is that you will see in the integrated pathway hexagon that that's how mostly outside of United States studies are taking place.

212
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:33,243
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how our students learn it basically here as well in the K through eight mathematics education that they learn integrated math without getting the label of integrated math.

213
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:45,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So on slide four, integrated mathematics pathways is not very different from the traditional pathway.

214
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:56,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, integrated mathematics is re-imagining the courses of algebra one, geometry, and algebra two as math one, math two, and math three.

215
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:03,352
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically, again, it's taking algebraic geometric statistical thinking and it's,

216
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:16,138
[SPEAKER_12]: spreading it throughout all three courses of course one, course two, course three, rather than only teaching algebra one concepts in ninth grade slash 10th grade or eighth grade.

217
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:21,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's giving them a mix at every level.

218
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:29,783
[SPEAKER_12]: The integrated pathways cover, the pathway covers the same exact standards as the traditional pathway because

219
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:44,232
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an approach that is also introduced in the Massachusetts framework, so they want to make sure same standards are covered, whether you cover them in a mix or whether you cover them as a standalone course.

220
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:46,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So why are we thinking about it?

221
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:47,977
[SPEAKER_12]: This is on slide five.

222
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:55,641
[SPEAKER_12]: After three years of integrated math, students will have mastered the concepts presented in a traditional three-year pathway.

223
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:10,007
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we expect students' problem-solving and reasoning skills to be much stronger because integrated math more deeply explores the relationships among algebraic, geometric, and statistical concepts.

224
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:20,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Ideally, through the integrated math curriculum, students are challenged to solve tasks rather than simply focusing on mastering the algorithms.

225
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:29,414
[SPEAKER_12]: This should fall in line with what we have at our middle school level and what we are trying to have at our elementary curriculum level.

226
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:39,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Slide six is why is it important to make math connections and to form one's own math identity?

227
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:41,338
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really important.

228
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:53,850
[SPEAKER_12]: What you see in the bullet points below is actually taken from a department of elementary and secondary education meeting that I attended.

229
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,791
[SPEAKER_12]: They want us to recognize

230
00:29:56,432 --> 00:30:05,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That math should not be used as a filtering mechanism, but rather as a pumping mechanism to college, this is an extremely important point to keep in mind.

231
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:15,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, as our students move through the high school they come to either like or dislike math and some of them even get there much earlier than that.

232
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:18,376
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want that to happen.

233
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:31,342
[SPEAKER_12]: We want our students to be excited about mathematics and then they can choose, as you'll see in subsequent slides, they can choose which pathway they want to follow in their higher education.

234
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Point two is depth is necessary to be able to understand college level mathematics.

235
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:45,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Focus on speed, doing one and a half or two grade levels work of content in one grade undermines the depth of the curriculum.

236
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:46,962
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very true.

237
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:58,450
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a few students who are able to do it, but if we want students to form their math identity, if we want to focus on depth, we must allow enough time for exploration.

238
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:07,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we are doing that in a one class period, that a student is learning one and a half year worth of material, whereas only one year is,

239
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:12,666
[SPEAKER_12]: recommended, something has got to give.

240
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:19,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to make compromises and usually depth is the piece that's compromised because students don't have the time to explore.

241
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:26,598
[SPEAKER_12]: We are teaching them as educators and whether they're receiving it or not, that becomes difficult to assess.

242
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:33,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Most colleges renounce calculus in lieu of, and I cannot emphasize on this,

243
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:41,972
[SPEAKER_12]: particular piece in lieu of core foundational skills needed throughout middle school and high school education.

244
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:55,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Many STEM inspired students or students with a math aptitude lose confidence if they're rushed through algebra and they revert to taking remedial math courses at the college level instead of starting from calculus.

245
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:58,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Because some students

246
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:03,284
[SPEAKER_12]: go through that rapid learning, they lose the interest.

247
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:18,053
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we, these students who could be future engineers, because they were prematurely put in a situation like that, there are times when we have seen them revert away from calculus.

248
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:26,719
[SPEAKER_12]: The last piece is inherent value in the two pathways and sustain developmentally appropriate identity formation.

249
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:29,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Let students develop their own math identity.

250
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:34,444
[SPEAKER_12]: It should not be what I want my students to be.

251
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:39,066
[SPEAKER_12]: It should not be what parents want the students to be or their child to be.

252
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:41,288
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be what student wants to be.

253
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:47,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is going in their future steps.

254
00:32:49,938 --> 00:33:09,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide is, is about how did we get in Medford Public Schools get all started about this process that we want our students to have a mathematics identity and we want them to be able to choose courses according to their learning style.

255
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:11,324
[SPEAKER_12]: So we formed a committee.

256
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:14,085
[SPEAKER_12]: If you recall, last year, April.

257
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:22,428
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a committee of educators, as of now, the name is equitable six through 12 math pathways program review committee.

258
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:27,511
[SPEAKER_12]: We started out by reading and CTMs catalyzing change in high school mathematics.

259
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:38,760
[SPEAKER_12]: We read related articles, we talked about and discussed the growth mindset through Joe Bowler's articles and through her books.

260
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:46,427
[SPEAKER_12]: We reviewed the existing course offerings at MHS, MVTHS, to analyze if we are serving all our students.

261
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,690
[SPEAKER_12]: We discussed the pros and cons of offering a new pathway.

262
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:55,931
[SPEAKER_12]: We worked on course descriptions before we can introduce it so that we know what our mission is.

263
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:04,953
[SPEAKER_12]: And we reviewed different programs also to see if they'll be a good fit for the students that we have here.

264
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:11,575
[SPEAKER_12]: We reached out to the districts that either offer the pathway or are in the process of offering the pathway.

265
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,216
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like there is great interest in the districts around us.

266
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:21,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are currently teaching selected lessons from the different programs.

267
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:29,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide is exactly out of a DESE presentation.

268
00:34:30,592 --> 00:34:32,493
[SPEAKER_12]: So I must give them credit for this.

269
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:35,896
[SPEAKER_12]: So two DESE math pathways.

270
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:40,477
[SPEAKER_12]: taking us to four DHE career-aligned pathways.

271
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,841
[SPEAKER_12]: DHE is Department of Higher Education.

272
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:50,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Pathways proactively support the transitions between primary and secondary schooling, higher education and career.

273
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see that pre-K through 12 curriculum

274
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:57,059
[SPEAKER_12]: supports the higher education, which supports the career.

275
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,584
[SPEAKER_12]: So math courses should always include grade level learning.

276
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:05,328
[SPEAKER_12]: This cannot be emphasized upon grade level learning.

277
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:10,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes we sacrifice the grade level learning to go to the more accelerated piece.

278
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what happens is that

279
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:20,862
[SPEAKER_12]: the students are not confident about their mathematics education and they have to repeat the courses or take remedial courses.

280
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:29,167
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's very important that your math courses, our math courses should have, they are based on Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

281
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:30,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they are.

282
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Balance all three aspects of rigor.

283
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:34,170
[SPEAKER_12]: They do.

284
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:39,733
[SPEAKER_12]: And then explicit opportunities to develop the mathematical practices.

285
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:51,285
[SPEAKER_12]: there are more chances to develop mathematical practices through integrated pathways, just because of the nature of the courses.

286
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:55,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, in the subsequent slides, you will see how that can happen.

287
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:57,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, higher education.

288
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:09,237
[SPEAKER_12]: All Massachusetts public institutions support four career-aligned pathways, quantitative reasoning, statistics, STEM, math for elementary teachers, because we do need

289
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,594
[SPEAKER_12]: to emphasize on that particular pathway for the DHE.

290
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:21,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Next one is also a slide from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

291
00:36:23,037 --> 00:36:31,520
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the objective being all students can complete a credit-bearing college-level course within their first year of enrollment in college.

292
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:48,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So recent shifts in Massachusetts public higher education, and please note, this is higher education, not department of elementary and secondary education, so we are talking about grade 13 and above, four distinct career focused mathematics pathways, we just saw them.

293
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:50,379
[SPEAKER_12]: A to B alignment.

294
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,560
[SPEAKER_12]: A to B is associates to bachelorette programming.

295
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Multiple measures for course placement, other than ACCUPLACER.

296
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:06,426
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of us who are not familiar with ACCUPLACER, it's a test that's given to students who enter college.

297
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:11,148
[SPEAKER_12]: 2.7 cumulative GPA if you graduated high school within three years.

298
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:17,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And a customized placement test created by Massachusetts Higher Education Institutions.

299
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:31,450
[SPEAKER_12]: This test is given to the majority of students, and many students, believe it or not, who have taken calculus at high schools, not just in Medford Public Schools, are referred back again to take a remedial course.

300
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:38,275
[SPEAKER_12]: That should not be the case if we stay on our objective stated right on the slide on the top.

301
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:43,740
[SPEAKER_12]: All students can complete a credit-bearing college-level course within their first year of enrollment.

302
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,483
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it is gonna be calculus, we want to give them

303
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:56,524
[SPEAKER_12]: a good strong standing to be able to make it to that course, rather than we speed them through the secondary education.

304
00:37:56,764 --> 00:38:03,549
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we realize, wait a minute, they still have to take calculus, but now with much more shaky foundation.

305
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:11,376
[SPEAKER_12]: The last one is core requisite support courses in lieu of developmental education courses.

306
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,763
[SPEAKER_12]: So next slide, which is our course chart here.

307
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:19,965
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the proposed course flow chart.

308
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:25,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that will be happening at Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School.

309
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:33,313
[SPEAKER_12]: The progression that you see is integrated Math 1, Math 2, and Math 3.

310
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,635
[SPEAKER_12]: You see it right in the middle of the slide.

311
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:42,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And you see that as of now, it is running

312
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:48,718
[SPEAKER_12]: just in line with the Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II courses.

313
00:38:49,559 --> 00:39:11,310
[SPEAKER_12]: And the side note is, which I did not put here because we don't want to make any claims right now, we will see how the courses run in the future, is that when you see under Integrated Mathematics III, there is an honors section that we are hoping for.

314
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:18,085
[SPEAKER_12]: to offer and that will hopefully lead directly to calculus.

315
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, there are no promises made.

316
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:28,249
[SPEAKER_12]: We will have to see how it goes, how our student population is receptive to it, what we are able to cover.

317
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:36,172
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a long haul incorporating a new pathway is, it will take time if done right.

318
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:43,436
[SPEAKER_12]: So next slide is completing integrated mathematics pathway sequence, completing it.

319
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:47,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Courses one, two, three versus traditional sequence.

320
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:49,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing will change.

321
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:52,801
[SPEAKER_12]: You will still end up taking the same courses.

322
00:39:54,323 --> 00:40:12,138
[SPEAKER_12]: The course definitions, as you can see for course one, course two, and course three are pretty much alike combining, as we mentioned, algebra, geometry, and statistical pieces of the standards from the traditional pathways three years.

323
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:18,444
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll take us to slide number 15, the integrated mathematics pathways at MHS.

324
00:40:19,906 --> 00:40:20,527
[SPEAKER_12]: pilot year.

325
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:29,356
[SPEAKER_12]: This coming year, we are proposing a pilot as proposed by the equity committee that I discussed earlier.

326
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:35,702
[SPEAKER_12]: We will only be offering course one and that will be only at the CP level.

327
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:41,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Student placement is going to be based on teacher recommendation and parental input.

328
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:45,087
[SPEAKER_12]: We do want your input as parents and we value it.

329
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:55,213
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's good to get it from the teacher as well as to how they see the student and their learning style because they have had the student for some time.

330
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:59,134
[SPEAKER_12]: 9th grade course is a CP course.

331
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:10,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we say college preparatory level means that it that's what is recommended by Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and if they stay on that path, they'll be ready to take

332
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,714
[SPEAKER_12]: the credit-bearing course in college.

333
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:19,295
[SPEAKER_12]: Continues the learning style from elementary and middle school math instruction.

334
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:23,236
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one of the strongest points of the integrated mathematics pathway.

335
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:29,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Students are used to it until eighth grade, and then suddenly we say you take algebra one, geometry, and algebra two.

336
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:34,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Very few countries outside of US do it, and we have done it for years.

337
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,780
[SPEAKER_12]: This is about a good time that we pilot a new pathway.

338
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:46,026
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I mentioned, they integrate the three courses, they integrate the standards.

339
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:50,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And that takes us to slide number 16.

340
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:59,996
[SPEAKER_12]: This is again, a visual that I took from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, proposed progression.

341
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:01,357
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see,

342
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:16,039
[SPEAKER_12]: if students take math one, two, and three, or they take algebra one, geometry, and algebra two, they shall land stats in statistics or AP stats, quantitative reasoning, pre-calculus, or calculus.

343
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:25,847
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said, this will be our goal that with students being in honors integrated mathematics three, that we make it happen.

344
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:28,769
[SPEAKER_12]: We just have to be cautious about it.

345
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,792
[SPEAKER_12]: We, again, don't want to be in a situation where we

346
00:42:32,373 --> 00:42:42,219
[SPEAKER_12]: speed through the standards and students don't get the real gist of calculus and that will take us to post secondary gateway course.

347
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,644
[SPEAKER_12]: slide number 17 you will see that this these, this is basically a table of contents that I took from one of the.

348
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:55,779
[SPEAKER_12]: one of the integrated mathematics books that we are looking at.

349
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:18,363
[SPEAKER_12]: The first seven are algebra based chapters and the rest of them, five of them, starting from chapter eight are geometry based standards, just to give you an insight into how this pathway might unfold in Medford public schools.

350
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:21,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Please let me know if you have any questions.

351
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:32,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to mention that there was a parent session that was done with Mr. Duleva to the eighth grade parents.

352
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,720
[SPEAKER_12]: It was recorded.

353
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,542
[SPEAKER_12]: It was sent out to all the parents.

354
00:43:36,582 --> 00:43:39,244
[SPEAKER_12]: We answered the questions to the best of our ability.

355
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:46,169
[SPEAKER_12]: The FAQs, there were quite a few of them, but these are the distilled ones.

356
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:51,793
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think capture basically what was asked and what was answered.

357
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:53,968
[SPEAKER_12]: on that particular night.

358
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:56,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

359
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:57,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

360
00:43:58,169 --> 00:43:58,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

361
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:01,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very excited by this, this integrated approach.

362
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that as a student myself, when I remember math, I was very strong in math, but terrible in geometry.

363
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:16,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And it really derailed my entire mathematics education because there was like a whole year bump.

364
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:19,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this is very exciting.

365
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:26,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a number of questions, I'll just ask two and then we can go around Robin if other people have questions and come back to me.

366
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,202
[SPEAKER_09]: But so how will this be reported on report cards in the student record?

367
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:44,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I mean, I have to admit, I don't remember how colleges consume the student's record, but a math course simply saying course one probably isn't

368
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:52,454
[SPEAKER_09]: much to go on and much to compare when they're looking at students to admit that'd be my first question.

369
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:53,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

370
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:59,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's one thing that we discussed with the neighboring districts.

371
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,842
[SPEAKER_12]: We know was him has just.

372
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,694
[SPEAKER_12]: shifted completely away from traditional pathway.

373
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:14,242
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that this question was definitely asked by the community there.

374
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:17,246
[SPEAKER_12]: So I discussed it with them and with other schools as well.

375
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:24,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Colleges are familiar with integrated mathematics course one, course two, and course three.

376
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,611
[SPEAKER_12]: And this has been long being done.

377
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,872
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not the first ones.

378
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:38,633
[SPEAKER_12]: We are happy to take this path, but colleges know how to rate them.

379
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:49,456
[SPEAKER_12]: They know that if a public institution like ours is offering it, exactly what will be covered underneath that course title and course description.

380
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:53,400
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be my, my thank you.

381
00:45:54,921 --> 00:46:00,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that answers my second question but my third question is, are there any.

382
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:11,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it feels like there are going to be some risks associated with students that are coming in midstream or leaving midstream in their academic career and have you already.

383
00:46:11,342 --> 00:46:23,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized we're doing a pilot this year with grade nine so you don't have to have answers yet, but that in particular concerns me, I suppose, since we're going to be keeping both for now.

384
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:41,098
[SPEAKER_09]: it's probably less of a concern, but like if Waltham has abandoned the traditional approach completely, and a student comes in and they have just completed algebra one in Medford, and they're going there and they want to take geometry, but they just have course two, which isn't geometry.

385
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,863
[SPEAKER_09]: This seems like this could be a risk for students transitioning in and out of our district.

386
00:46:49,664 --> 00:46:52,066
[SPEAKER_09]: So have you been thinking about that or?

387
00:46:52,836 --> 00:46:55,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we have have been.

388
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:01,347
[SPEAKER_12]: This is actually one of the points that the committee members faced and we are discussing it.

389
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:02,388
[SPEAKER_12]: So

390
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:22,861
[SPEAKER_12]: The students will have to, in that particular case, while we encourage everybody that once you enter the stream, we will support you to make it through integrated one, integrated two, integrated three, at least if you are in Medford Public Schools, we will support you, we will help you.

391
00:47:23,442 --> 00:47:29,364
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers of the next year will help you because that's what our teachers do.

392
00:47:30,404 --> 00:47:33,285
[SPEAKER_12]: But one thing to keep in mind is that

393
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:37,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, there can be challenges that will come with it.

394
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:44,362
[SPEAKER_12]: As you notice, first half of the year is all algebra, and the second half of the year is all geometry.

395
00:47:44,702 --> 00:47:48,285
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends on where the student lives.

396
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:52,768
[SPEAKER_12]: But yes, that risk does come with the integrated approach.

397
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:53,668
[SPEAKER_12]: We are aware of it.

398
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:55,069
[SPEAKER_12]: We are working on it.

399
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,293
[SPEAKER_12]: But then there are some things that will evolve with time.

400
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:03,175
[SPEAKER_12]: So we are trying to find a solution to it right now.

401
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:04,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

402
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:29,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, certainly, you know, when I think about a student in this situation, I mean, they may not be on an IEP, or they may be, and each student, especially if they were not coming from a district in Massachusetts, for instance, I suppose this is a longstanding problem for students coming from other countries or just from other states, but I would just want to make sure we've

403
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:45,890
[SPEAKER_09]: prepared so that the students who may in fact end up being future engineers and mathematicians don't land here and get completely derailed by that because it seems like too much to ask that the math teacher.

404
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:58,017
[SPEAKER_09]: who is teaching a curriculum to the class of students is then also attempting to teach a totally different curriculum, frankly, to one or two students in their class.

405
00:48:59,538 --> 00:49:02,601
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that you've said you've been thinking about it.

406
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:10,507
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just something that worries me because we do have relatively high turnover of students, although I don't actually know where is that in the younger grades or in the older grades.

407
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:12,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And so,

408
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:23,658
[SPEAKER_09]: For students that are experiencing those transitions, they're often experiencing them, especially mid year, not in the best of circumstances.

409
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:31,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just want to make sure we can find a way to take care of them and help them along their academic careers.

410
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just ask my last question since I only have one more.

411
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:44,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this create any problems or has the MCAS already been aligned to this?

412
00:49:45,355 --> 00:49:47,316
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a great question.

413
00:49:49,877 --> 00:49:53,500
[SPEAKER_12]: We have looked at this pathway.

414
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Initially, we did not look at it from the lens of MCAS.

415
00:49:59,023 --> 00:50:00,244
[SPEAKER_12]: So as

416
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:04,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Things unfolded.

417
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:19,427
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like this will be a better approach for mks anyhow, just because you're learning algebra and geometry ninth grade and algebra and geometry in 10th grade and that's when you take mks so teachers.

418
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:32,821
[SPEAKER_12]: who have been teaching geometry in a traditional pathway in certain schools, they just stop teaching geometry and they review algebra because MCAS has algebra, geometry, and statistics in it.

419
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:43,348
[SPEAKER_12]: We feel as a committee that this will be a better approach to preparing our students to take MCAS

420
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:49,612
[SPEAKER_12]: at bare minimum cost, because they'll be covering the same standards, just in different courses.

421
00:50:49,692 --> 00:51:00,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will be less inclined to stop teaching and then just teaching them to the test, because it'll be the natural flow of the things.

422
00:51:00,678 --> 00:51:02,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the hope and the dream.

423
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll figure it out.

424
00:51:04,721 --> 00:51:07,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see how it turns out.

425
00:51:08,263 --> 00:51:08,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

426
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:11,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Edward-Vincent?

427
00:51:11,825 --> 00:51:12,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

428
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:22,355
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to just make a few comments in and say that first, Jesse is supporting this pathway.

429
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:32,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one of the most important pieces to me about this presentation, and in talking with Miss con.

430
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:44,815
[SPEAKER_14]: was about the fact the amount of students that are going to college having completed four years of math and falling flat on their face that they're not able to take math 101.

431
00:51:46,047 --> 00:52:01,675
[SPEAKER_14]: that they have to go back and take 075 089, so they're essentially going back to take high school math at paying tuition, while they're in college, and you end up saying well what happened.

432
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:06,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I think about mathematics being a content that.

433
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:17,103
[SPEAKER_14]: People say, well, I don't have a math brain, you know, all kinds of excuses that people make or just justifying why there's this lack of comfort with mathematics.

434
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:35,053
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like this integrated approach of teaching both algebra and geometry over the course of the same year, you know, a lot of people had that experience where they did great in algebra, they fell flat on their face in geometry or the reverse.

435
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:42,357
[SPEAKER_14]: when you would talk to your friends, oh, I hated algebra, I love geometry, or I love geometry, whichever way you want to look at it.

436
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:56,244
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like this approach of trying to teach it together over the course of the three courses, and not necessarily separating it out, that you are learning how

437
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,605
[SPEAKER_14]: the different areas work together.

438
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:02,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So I almost feel like it's an inclusive way of learning.

439
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:13,728
[SPEAKER_14]: When you keep doing the same thing over and over again, and you're expecting different results, they say that's like insanity.

440
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:24,510
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's the way that we've done mathematics or we've taught it for so long, but there were so many people that are math adverse, they don't like math.

441
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,873
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's try teaching math differently.

442
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:33,598
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I feel like still maintaining the traditional pathway.

443
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:44,251
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the same time, piloting with parent consent and students understanding you're gonna be learning math in a different way.

444
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:59,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And I actually feel like if we want to see different outcomes when they go to college and see how students think about mathematics, we do need to think about teaching mathematics in a different way, a different sequence.

445
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:11,048
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm very curious and kind of excited to see who those students are that will actually want to be part of this pilot pathway.

446
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:19,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Your point member Rousseau about transitioning or moving between districts is a very valid point, but when I'm thinking about

447
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:46,080
[SPEAKER_14]: If we continue to teach math, the way math has always been taught, the way we were taught when we went to school, we're going to continue to have this generation of individuals who are just allergic to math, afraid of math, and not really wanting to adventure into the engineering or high sciences or accounting or anything with math.

448
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,461
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to just run away from that.

449
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:49,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And so

450
00:54:51,869 --> 00:55:10,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually feel like this is probably what's going to be happening, that it's going to catch more momentum, and we're just, I think, one of the districts that is trying to look at another way to teach math to yield different results that are going to be more sustainable in the long run.

451
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there other questions?

452
00:55:17,499 --> 00:55:17,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kretz?

453
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

454
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

455
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to thank you, Ms.

456
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:22,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Kahn, for the presentation.

457
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:24,442
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very informative in the frequently asked questions.

458
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:26,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's great.

459
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:32,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And my son was a student at the vocational school and he struggled with math.

460
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:43,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really wish they had this program when he was there, because he got into college, accepted for the engineering program, but he changed majors because he's the phobia of math.

461
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:48,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And he had great teachers at the vocational school, in fact, co-taught teachers.

462
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:54,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So will co-taught teaching be an option for the integrated math classes?

463
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:55,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

464
00:55:56,285 --> 00:55:57,606
[SPEAKER_12]: This is all inclusive.

465
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:04,430
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to keep everybody in the loop, the equity committee that's looking at it, we have

466
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:22,004
[SPEAKER_12]: teachers who are co-teaching, we have students with disabilities teachers who are supporting, and we also have English learners teacher also in the committee so that we can get their input on this new pathway.

467
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:23,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, thanks.

468
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:28,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it says the student placement is based on the teacher recommendation and parent input.

469
00:56:29,691 --> 00:56:30,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there going to be a

470
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:44,169
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a decision date, like will the students and the families know where they're going to be going, whether they're going into integrated math, or are they just going to fill out a form that says, you know, I want to go traditional route, or I want to go integrated math.

471
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:54,356
[SPEAKER_12]: So over the last week or so, Mr. Dileva has gone to both the middle schools, and he has given presentations to the students.

472
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:59,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know we had the open house for selection night at the high school where I was there.

473
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:11,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So was Mr. Deliver, we were able to answer the questions, what will the process shall take place as follows the students with their parents help fill out the form.

474
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:15,121
[SPEAKER_12]: The teachers also recommend them and.

475
00:57:16,162 --> 00:57:18,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we go from there.

476
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:29,064
[SPEAKER_12]: They can come to the teacher and say, you recommended me for algebra one, but I would like to be in the integrated one course.

477
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:30,885
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will go from there.

478
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,445
[SPEAKER_12]: We like to value that.

479
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,645
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would want to value it.

480
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:40,946
[SPEAKER_12]: The teacher can go back and that's a conversation that can be had between the student and the teacher.

481
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:43,787
[SPEAKER_12]: But we always take parent,

482
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:50,120
[SPEAKER_12]: recommendation of input over everything else.

483
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:58,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Our job is to advise and we will continue to advise, but the selection is the final process and that's done by the student and the parent.

484
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:05,093
[SPEAKER_10]: And one last question, because we're approaching the budget season and this is going to be a new pilot.

485
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:08,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Will we be needing any additional math teachers?

486
00:58:09,057 --> 00:58:10,498
[SPEAKER_10]: What if there's an increase in

487
00:58:11,293 --> 00:58:14,254
[SPEAKER_10]: integrated math versus traditional pathways?

488
00:58:14,735 --> 00:58:15,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just thinking ahead.

489
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,096
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great question.

490
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:21,418
[SPEAKER_12]: We are thinking about it.

491
00:58:21,558 --> 00:58:27,180
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that the committee will be discussing in its next meeting coming up in a week.

492
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,801
[SPEAKER_12]: That's on the agenda.

493
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:31,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I am in talks with Mr. Dileva.

494
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:34,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see where that takes us.

495
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:35,964
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is definitely on our radar.

496
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:36,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

497
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:37,685
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

498
00:58:37,745 --> 00:58:37,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

499
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hayes.

500
00:58:47,221 --> 00:59:02,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I was just curious, because when I read the, when we got this packet and I read about it, it sounded like it was brand new, but yet it sounds like maybe it's been around for a while and there are a lot of districts doing it.

501
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:10,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you give just a quick, I don't want to take too much time, but just how long has this integrated pathway existed in Massachusetts anyway?

502
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:12,309
[SPEAKER_15]: like you said, apparently is around the world.

503
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:16,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And what districts, or not what, but how many districts are doing it?

504
00:59:16,732 --> 00:59:20,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, can we get some support from other districts in understanding how to implement it?

505
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:21,635
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

506
00:59:21,835 --> 00:59:36,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll answer your second question first, is that we have had multiple guest educators from other districts who are doing this, who have come in and spoken with our equity committee members who proposed and

507
00:59:37,785 --> 00:59:41,768
[SPEAKER_12]: are willing to go this way and wanting to go this way, and they have done research.

508
00:59:41,808 --> 00:59:45,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have talked to Waltham.

509
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Somerville is moving in this direction.

510
00:59:49,913 --> 00:59:53,375
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know Brookline High School has it.

511
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:56,457
[SPEAKER_12]: We looked at Arlington.

512
00:59:56,697 --> 00:59:57,258
[SPEAKER_12]: They have it.

513
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:05,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Some districts are only offering course one and course two, and then they go to course three, and they don't offer it.

514
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:21,626
[SPEAKER_12]: They offer pre-calculus, but we would like to incorporate one, two, and three as given to us by DESE, as suggested to us by DESE, and not play around too much with the sequence that they're suggesting, because we are new to this.

515
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:27,348
[SPEAKER_12]: And fidelity is extremely important in the first few years of either a new program or a new pathway.

516
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,620
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the first thing.

517
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:37,368
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't mind repeating your first question again so that I answered it with much detail.

518
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:43,255
[SPEAKER_15]: You might have already answered it just in the course of it was just a general sense of how long has this

519
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

520
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:47,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it has.

521
01:00:47,431 --> 01:00:48,431
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great question.

522
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:57,554
[SPEAKER_12]: It has existed for quite a long time, at least, I would say, before 2017 frameworks, we had 2011 frameworks.

523
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:04,177
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's definitely in 2017 framework, and it's definitely I would say in 2011 framework too.

524
01:01:05,377 --> 01:01:07,758
[SPEAKER_12]: So it has been around for a while because

525
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:14,953
[SPEAKER_12]: of these districts, only Wolfham and Somerville are the newer ones in this.

526
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:20,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Arlington has had it for quite some time, and Brookline has had it for at least 10 years.

527
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:22,575
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yes.

528
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:28,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ms.

529
01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:29,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Khan.

530
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:29,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

531
01:01:33,658 --> 01:01:42,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a report on February camp Mustang at Medford High School presented by director of people services Joan Bowen and the assistant superintendent of elementary schools miss Suzanne Galussi.

532
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:52,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

533
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:54,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

534
01:01:55,398 --> 01:02:03,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're here to present just a little update on how camp Mustang the first of the school vacation weeks went for February vacation.

535
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:17,216
[SPEAKER_13]: On this first slide we discussed this as we explained camp Mustang to this body previously we just wanted to have this slide in here just to review a little bit of.

536
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:26,003
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose for camp Mustang for both of the vacation weeks, so it is a way to keep students anchor to school throughout the vacation.

537
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:39,175
[SPEAKER_13]: So this way they have time to still socially engage with their grade level peers from across the district, as well as have an opportunity to participate in some enrichment activities.

538
01:02:40,316 --> 01:02:43,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Students were provided with several different choice activities, which Ms.

539
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:51,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen will explain and discuss on an upcoming slide, that were prepared by Medford Public Schools employees.

540
01:02:54,305 --> 01:03:04,528
[SPEAKER_13]: The offerings, as we previously said, focused on both academically rich enrichment opportunities, as well as movement and physical opportunities.

541
01:03:06,288 --> 01:03:16,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Students from kindergarten to grade 12 were invited up to Medford High School on the Tuesday of the vacation, February 22nd, and the Wednesday, February 23rd.

542
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:23,052
[SPEAKER_13]: The morning session was dedicated to our elementary students in grades kindergarten through grade five,

543
01:03:23,752 --> 01:03:27,904
[SPEAKER_13]: And the afternoon was dedicated to the secondary students in grades six through 12.

544
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:31,494
[SPEAKER_13]: All of these offerings took place at Medford High School.

545
01:03:32,978 --> 01:03:44,028
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you can see here, we had a little bit over around 100, excuse me, 300 or a little over active registrations when we sent this out to families in Medford.

546
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:51,394
[SPEAKER_13]: As you can see for the first day for the elementary morning session, we were expecting 187 students, but 148 showed.

547
01:03:56,478 --> 01:04:03,064
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the PM session for the secondary, we were expecting 56 and 47 students participated.

548
01:04:04,085 --> 01:04:15,855
[SPEAKER_13]: On the second day, our numbers went up slightly and at the elementary, we were expecting 212 students to arrive and 171 participated in the activities.

549
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:23,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the PM session, we were expecting 56 secondary students and 42 showed up for the camp.

550
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:29,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are some of the activities that were offered on both days.

551
01:04:30,055 --> 01:04:33,457
[SPEAKER_11]: So some of the activities were on Tuesday and Wednesday.

552
01:04:34,177 --> 01:04:40,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Some just occurred in the morning for either elementary students and some occurred in the afternoon just for secondary students.

553
01:04:41,282 --> 01:04:43,283
[SPEAKER_11]: But as you could see, we had a wide variety.

554
01:04:44,143 --> 01:04:46,725
[SPEAKER_11]: There were STEM activities, team sports.

555
01:04:47,685 --> 01:04:53,008
[SPEAKER_11]: There was cookies with Chef P, cosmetology, friendship rocks.

556
01:04:53,388 --> 01:05:03,174
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was a wide range that the students were really excited about, and we got some really good feedback from parents regarding their activities that their students participated in.

557
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:05,335
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go to the next slide, please.

558
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:10,923
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are just some pictures of the different activities that were offered.

559
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:19,326
[SPEAKER_11]: This is jumpstart music, and the students had an opportunity to get a jumpstart on their band and orchestra instruments.

560
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:31,010
[SPEAKER_11]: They strengthened their instrumental musical skills and techniques while covering note reading, rhythm skills, sight reading, and instrumental terminology.

561
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:42,012
[SPEAKER_11]: They had the upper level students working with the elementary students and both Miss Chang and Miss Rello reported that it was a great success and everyone had a great time.

562
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:48,455
[SPEAKER_11]: The next activity was a STEM activity, which is ice cream making.

563
01:05:49,744 --> 01:06:03,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Students, this was for secondary level students, and they were able to make their own ice cream and apply principles of chemistry to make the process more efficient and maximize production.

564
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:08,693
[SPEAKER_11]: All the students made vanilla ice cream and they were able to eat the ice cream before they went home.

565
01:06:08,773 --> 01:06:09,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was great to see.

566
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:11,754
[SPEAKER_11]: They seemed to enjoy it.

567
01:06:12,114 --> 01:06:14,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't get to taste anything, but it looked really delicious.

568
01:06:15,957 --> 01:06:27,348
[SPEAKER_11]: The next activity was CAD in robotics and engineering, and students got to spend time in the robotics and engineering shop learning to use a real laser cutter.

569
01:06:29,363 --> 01:06:42,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Students received an introduction to computed-aided drafting using Tinkercad, as well as hands-on experience using our state-of-the-art Epilogue Fusion Pro 120-watt laser cutter.

570
01:06:43,093 --> 01:06:52,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Each student designed, created, and cut their own personalized acrylic keychain, and they also got to play around with a few other laser-cut surprises in the shop.

571
01:06:53,832 --> 01:06:58,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the other shops activities that were offered was kindness rocks.

572
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:02,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was students went out for a walk.

573
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,182
[SPEAKER_11]: They went hunting for different rocks.

574
01:07:04,883 --> 01:07:08,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they came back in and decorated and painted.

575
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:17,534
[SPEAKER_11]: This was all based on the kindness rocks project which was started in 2015 with the goal of cultivating connections

576
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:22,142
[SPEAKER_11]: with communities and lifting others up through the simple acts of kindness.

577
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:25,988
[SPEAKER_11]: These rocks will be distributed throughout the city of Medford.

578
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So as Ms.

579
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:44,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen expressed, we have gotten some great feedback from families as well as staff and students about the opportunities that they had on the February vacation.

580
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:52,521
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have already planned to bring it back for the April vacation, as you can see here for the same two days.

581
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:59,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would be the Tuesday and the Wednesday following a similar format, culminating both of these

582
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:02,392
[SPEAKER_13]: activities for the vacation weeks.

583
01:08:02,693 --> 01:08:08,734
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to follow up with some surveys so that we can gather some input in terms of like plans moving forward.

584
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:13,035
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're going to keep the same format for this right as for right now.

585
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:18,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of the same opportunities are going to be offered again to families.

586
01:08:18,936 --> 01:08:21,757
[SPEAKER_13]: We are just finalizing that registration form now.

587
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:26,178
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a few staff that were unable to offer something in February.

588
01:08:27,178 --> 01:08:32,460
[SPEAKER_13]: So there will be, they're able to offer in April, so there will be some newer opportunities as well.

589
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:41,282
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be sending out this information about the April Camp Mustang, all the offerings and registrations to the community.

590
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:52,166
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just wanna make sure that families have ample time to sign up and be able to choose for the registration, the activities that they'd like to register for.

591
01:08:52,906 --> 01:08:55,647
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd also like to thank all the staff that took the time

592
01:08:56,427 --> 01:09:00,429
[SPEAKER_11]: During February vacation, the activities were well received.

593
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,351
[SPEAKER_11]: We also want to thank Andy O'Brien and Alice Beck Fitzpatrick.

594
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:07,073
[SPEAKER_11]: They oversaw the programming once it was up and running.

595
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:18,379
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also have some behind the scenes, Michelle Bissell and Lisa Malone, who are key in the organization, getting everything compiled for us and ready to go when we started the camp.

596
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:21,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So we just wanted to say thank you to everyone who assisted us.

597
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:23,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

598
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:30,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

599
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:33,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

600
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:35,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

601
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:39,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I can't find my hand raised button here, so I apologize.

602
01:09:40,032 --> 01:09:50,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say thank you very much for the presentation and also for the way the entire team from the staff and teachers and

603
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:59,197
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the two of you, everybody to ensure that this was an inclusive, a truly inclusive program in our district.

604
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:05,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a great example and a great model of how things can go and how things can work.

605
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:08,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a really thoughtful way that you all teamed up together.

606
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:10,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to say thank you.

607
01:10:10,825 --> 01:10:14,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know my daughter had a great time and I know lots of children that did.

608
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:15,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.

609
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:18,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

610
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:20,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hayes.

611
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:24,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one quick comment and one quick question.

612
01:10:25,163 --> 01:10:27,966
[SPEAKER_15]: One, I think all of the programs sounded wonderful.

613
01:10:28,446 --> 01:10:37,374
[SPEAKER_15]: I love, especially that we're finding a way to get kids to understand and know about the voc tech, like that's wonderful to have them going into some of those programs.

614
01:10:37,754 --> 01:10:44,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I can remember doing that as a kid myself, and it was fun to be able to do that, and it's a good way to just make that more known in the community.

615
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,562
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also wondering about

616
01:10:47,595 --> 01:10:50,136
[SPEAKER_15]: summer, if you're thinking about doing this for the summer.

617
01:10:50,556 --> 01:10:58,798
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know, I'm sure as parents yourself, you know, like summer camps are filling up now, parents are needing to commit now.

618
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:08,821
[SPEAKER_15]: So if there's any way to give people a heads up of whether you think you're going to be doing it, when you think it might be, I mean, I know that's difficult.

619
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:15,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not trying to put any pressure, but as you know, people are committing now and it makes it hard to hold out if we don't know for sure.

620
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:40,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I think throughout this pandemic, our goal for Camp Mustang, which we launched last summer and we call it, now we've called these vacations, 2.0, but the goal behind Camp Mustang was always to offer an anchor for students to the schools, to keep them engaged in the school community and with their peers and with like the trusted adults that are in the building.

621
01:11:41,074 --> 01:11:43,655
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is something we're definitely looking into for the summer.

622
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:47,139
[SPEAKER_13]: we want to gauge some information from the surveys.

623
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:56,384
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we would be looking towards the month of August as a way, again, to transition students back to the school community.

624
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:03,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ms.

625
01:12:03,568 --> 01:12:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Stone?

626
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:21,010
[SPEAKER_08]: $50,000.

627
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:21,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think for anyone interested in robotics and engineering, the laser cutter is amazing and we'll have a lot of future engineers because of that program.

628
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And the teachers too, thank you very much.

629
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:24,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

630
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:24,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

631
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:32,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, we have a report on the March 3rd professional, district-wide professional development.

632
01:12:32,892 --> 01:12:41,319
[SPEAKER_02]: The report presented by director of people services, Joan Bowen, the assistant superintendent of elementary schools, Suzanne Galussi, and the assistant superintendent of secondary schools, Dr. Peter Cushing.

633
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:43,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

634
01:12:44,222 --> 01:12:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carmen Williams, our superintendent intern.

635
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:53,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Madam Vice Chair, and members of the school committee.

636
01:12:53,231 --> 01:13:01,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for this opportunity for us to present to you on the professional development activities that took place last Thursday, March 3rd in the district.

637
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:05,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll start off, we shared the schedule with you.

638
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:09,394
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a comprehensive look at the events of the day.

639
01:13:09,854 --> 01:13:11,875
[SPEAKER_01]: The only two things that are not on there is 8.30 to noon.

640
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:21,897
[SPEAKER_01]: The humanities department had a News Ella training that connects math growth to News Ella as well.

641
01:13:22,517 --> 01:13:31,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And the math department grade six through 12 engaged in the final piece of a four part better lessons professional development.

642
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:42,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was four part, but you can see the activities that were done throughout the day that really covered all of the district staff and gave them an opportunity for some professional learning.

643
01:13:45,182 --> 01:13:49,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so most of the morning, I'm going to just explain a little bit about the map growth.

644
01:13:49,924 --> 01:13:55,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was our second opportunity to do a data dive, excuse me, with staff.

645
01:13:55,987 --> 01:14:07,392
[SPEAKER_13]: The first data dive happened towards the beginning of the year, and it really focused for teachers on the platform and the format, and the family report that is sent home to families to understand how their children are doing growth wise.

646
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:19,626
[SPEAKER_13]: This focused on the professional development day on the other resources that are available to educators on the platform, because there are several reports.

647
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:26,429
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you can see here, the four bullet points, educators were grouped by discipline and grade level.

648
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:32,471
[SPEAKER_13]: So they were grouped by their department and or the grade in which they work for the training sessions.

649
01:14:33,331 --> 01:14:36,473
[SPEAKER_13]: They reviewed the current data in both the math

650
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:38,493
[SPEAKER_13]: and their reading scores.

651
01:14:39,634 --> 01:14:42,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Time was provided for teachers to access their class data.

652
01:14:43,515 --> 01:15:01,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So teachers were provided after this training with MAP Growth, which went for two hours, they then had the opportunity to work in leveled groups, grade level, or their department levels to really work with the data with their school-based teams and principals.

653
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:10,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Teachers were given the time to examine the reports that were available for educators to shift instructional to shift instruction and provide supports for students.

654
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:29,056
[SPEAKER_13]: learning targets to identify impactful uses for map growth data throughout the school year, explore components of strengths, strength-based conversations to support and interpret the application of data, and to accurately communicate assessment results to stakeholders.

655
01:15:29,596 --> 01:15:34,559
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the participation, Dr. Cushing and I were a part of these trainings as well.

656
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:35,500
[SPEAKER_13]: We stuck with one

657
01:15:36,547 --> 01:15:46,352
[SPEAKER_13]: particular level, Dr. Cushing can speak about his, I stuck with kindergarten, just to make sure we heard the complete, we were part of the training for one complete source.

658
01:15:46,472 --> 01:16:02,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And so teachers were brought through various other report forms and shown exactly how to access the data to create student groups, to move instruction, as well as to really target the growth that students are making throughout the year.

659
01:16:03,637 --> 01:16:09,442
[SPEAKER_01]: And simply to follow up on that the training was similar, even though it was secondary I was with the history and social studies group.

660
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:22,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teachers were extraordinarily well engaged asking relevant meaningful questions and really interested in how the data can really be used to impact their instruction to help students at a micro level.

661
01:16:22,653 --> 01:16:27,235
[SPEAKER_01]: and to really focus targeted supports for small groups of students.

662
01:16:28,695 --> 01:16:45,582
[SPEAKER_01]: The day went overall very smoothly with just two minor technical challenges at the start of the day, but we were able to resolve those fairly quickly and teachers were very patient with our partner as we addressed those brief technical issues.

663
01:16:50,031 --> 01:16:57,035
[SPEAKER_11]: The special education staff, we did our final training with Alan Bloom in regards to IEP writing.

664
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:06,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Special education teachers, related service providers, we spent 830 to 1130 fine tuning our writing skills.

665
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:13,125
[SPEAKER_11]: We looked at, all year long, we've looked at various aspects that we wanna improve when it comes to our IEPs.

666
01:17:14,606 --> 01:17:16,047
[SPEAKER_11]: The disability statement,

667
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:19,088
[SPEAKER_11]: accommodations, that sort of thing.

668
01:17:19,489 --> 01:17:23,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was our last training with Alan for this year.

669
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:31,515
[SPEAKER_11]: We are now as a district coming up with a plan for teachers on how to implement what we've learned in these four sessions.

670
01:17:32,175 --> 01:17:40,540
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what we're hoping to do next year is have Alan come back and work at the building base level, specifically with teachers and teams of teachers,

671
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,562
[SPEAKER_11]: to fine tune what we learned this year.

672
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:49,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And then our other hope is that he could do a presentation to CPAC next year.

673
01:17:49,705 --> 01:18:00,251
[SPEAKER_11]: So parents can understand what are these changes that they're seeing in the IEP process and how we've changed some of our, the ways that we write.

674
01:18:01,213 --> 01:18:06,437
[SPEAKER_11]: the IEP goals and objectives, service delivery page, that sort of thing.

675
01:18:06,897 --> 01:18:13,462
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were really happy to have this training with Alan and it was very well received by staff for this year.

676
01:18:13,502 --> 01:18:16,304
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking forward to continuing our work with him next year.

677
01:18:20,047 --> 01:18:20,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

678
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:30,135
[SPEAKER_16]: So I worked with Eric Greenberg and the paraprofessionals on March 3rd, and it was a continuation of our work that we did on November 2nd.

679
01:18:31,389 --> 01:18:37,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of that work was training paraprofessionals on aspects of their job as far as working with students in the classroom.

680
01:18:38,773 --> 01:18:45,416
[SPEAKER_16]: But we also recognize that paraprofessionals are a critical working group, and we want to keep them.

681
01:18:45,877 --> 01:18:47,698
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to retain our paraprofessionals.

682
01:18:48,198 --> 01:18:54,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, the district has a turnover rate of about 20% every year with paraprofessionals.

683
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:55,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we asked them,

684
01:18:56,948 --> 01:18:58,989
[SPEAKER_16]: what's working well for you in your school.

685
01:18:59,209 --> 01:19:11,777
[SPEAKER_16]: And they talked a lot about when they are able to develop meaningful relationships with their teachers, that really helps when they're clear on their expectations for how to work with students and execute behavior plans, they feel effective.

686
01:19:12,357 --> 01:19:17,380
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we took that data and we created a virtual resource bank for them.

687
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:25,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the materials are videos, some are reading materials, but we categorize them for the paraprofessionals.

688
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:37,478
[SPEAKER_16]: to say here are more supports outside of our structured professional development days, and we encouraged them, gave them some time to look at those materials and investigate them.

689
01:19:38,379 --> 01:19:45,428
[SPEAKER_16]: The big takeaway was that paraprofessionals are vested in our students and desire community.

690
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:51,296
[SPEAKER_16]: So another important piece was our ability to bring all of them together, even though it was virtual.

691
01:19:51,997 --> 01:19:58,220
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have a lot of time to interact with Paris and other buildings or even in other programs within the same building.

692
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:05,424
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was a great opportunity for them to come together and learn from each other, as well as the materials we provided.

693
01:20:05,444 --> 01:20:06,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

694
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:21,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, to close out the day, the entire district staff, paraprofessionals, school and district leaders, as well as our teaching core, we're all on a district-wide Zoom.

695
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: The presentation was led by Teacher 21.

696
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:28,406
[SPEAKER_01]: It's titled Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

697
01:20:29,226 --> 01:20:36,531
[SPEAKER_01]: We had returning presenters from our November Professional Development Day, Chris Taylor and Gabrielle Palmer.

698
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:41,715
[SPEAKER_01]: We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback thus far about the session.

699
01:20:42,516 --> 01:20:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, they had a number of topics to go through.

700
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:49,661
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall goals for the presentation

701
01:20:50,181 --> 01:21:04,698
[SPEAKER_01]: were to really have teachers do some self-reflection, there was some pre-work for teachers to do, really to focus on bias and culturally responsive teaching, frameworks for equity, really looking through that lens of equity in various

702
01:21:05,879 --> 01:21:14,202
[SPEAKER_01]: frameworks that can be utilized, practical learning experiences, and then while links to assets, link assets to instructional practices.

703
01:21:15,142 --> 01:21:22,164
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things with a great professional development is that sometimes you don't get to all the things because it spurs really good discussion.

704
01:21:22,605 --> 01:21:29,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were really good questions and really good discussion from many of our staff members verbally when they were able to engage.

705
01:21:30,287 --> 01:21:30,568
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.

706
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:35,432
[SPEAKER_01]: We also were able to do a breakout room, which we were able to successfully launch.

707
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:43,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom sometimes gets quirky with that many people in that many breakout rooms, but we were able to successfully launch and deliver it well.

708
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:54,988
[SPEAKER_01]: And so without going into too much detail with the information in front of you, we will be sharing the entire PowerPoint presentation with the staff as was promised by the presenters.

709
01:21:56,055 --> 01:22:03,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that represents our March 3rd professional day of learning for our faculty and staff.

710
01:22:04,602 --> 01:22:05,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

711
01:22:05,663 --> 01:22:06,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

712
01:22:06,783 --> 01:22:07,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

713
01:22:07,224 --> 01:22:08,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions?

714
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:10,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I think online.

715
01:22:14,009 --> 01:22:14,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none.

716
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

717
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:17,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

718
01:22:19,276 --> 01:22:22,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six, presentations of the public, not to begin before 7pm.

719
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:31,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

720
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:35,253
[SPEAKER_02]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

721
01:22:36,255 --> 01:22:42,456
[SPEAKER_02]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

722
01:22:42,956 --> 01:22:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

723
01:22:52,078 --> 01:22:58,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The details of submitting a presentation can be found within policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public.

724
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,560
[SPEAKER_02]: We have none on the agenda for this evening.

725
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:13,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any agenda item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

726
01:23:14,176 --> 01:23:17,297
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

727
01:23:17,517 --> 01:23:23,278
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

728
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:28,259
[SPEAKER_02]: A welcoming and inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

729
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and we value your perspective.

730
01:23:33,802 --> 01:23:36,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Number seven, continued business, we have none.

731
01:23:37,105 --> 01:23:38,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Number eight, new business.

732
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:44,191
[SPEAKER_02]: The first item, 2022-21 offered by member Rousseau.

733
01:23:44,851 --> 01:24:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford School Committee shall authorize one member to attend the Medford City Council public health and community safety meetings regarding the proposed civilian control over public surveillance ordinance to provide input and consider compliance with relevant student privacy laws.

734
01:24:02,703 --> 01:24:03,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

735
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:04,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

736
01:24:04,464 --> 01:24:16,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So as the members may know, the Medford City Council is drafting a new ordinance called the CCOPS or C-C-O-P-S.

737
01:24:16,774 --> 01:24:30,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is in layman terms, how the police camera, the body worn cameras, how that data will be managed and the oversight and

738
01:24:30,849 --> 01:24:34,171
[SPEAKER_09]: maintenance of that data and all that stuff they're drafting an ordinance on that.

739
01:24:34,911 --> 01:24:54,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing I consider it concerns about was that while the city council obviously is drafting an ordinance that covers all of Medford, they are not necessarily particularly well versed in education law and the federal education privacy.

740
01:24:55,112 --> 01:24:57,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably can't remember all the letters, what they mean.

741
01:24:58,515 --> 01:25:20,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And so my request is that the committee gives one of us, and I obviously volunteer, the authority to show up to these meetings and speak, not just as a member of the public, but as a member of the school committee, which we shouldn't be doing unless we all agree that that's appropriate, just to make sure that

742
01:25:21,193 --> 01:25:23,734
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not missing this issue.

743
01:25:24,294 --> 01:25:49,781
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that I know if you agree to this and you select me, I will insist that they have passed the ordinance through educational law specialists, not just the regular legal services that they use, but that they have passed it through that because an ordinance on how body-worn cameras can be used once you're on school property,

744
01:25:51,384 --> 01:25:56,846
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the City Council can't pass an ordinance that exceeds federal or state law.

745
01:25:56,946 --> 01:25:58,087
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not one of their options.

746
01:25:58,207 --> 01:25:59,107
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us can do that.

747
01:25:59,648 --> 01:26:19,516
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just think it's really important that before this ordinance is fully drafted and becomes, you know, approved, that we've had some kind of, had our fingers in the pie, because there's really nothing worse than an ordinance that is completely done and approved

748
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:22,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And then turns out it's violating the law.

749
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:23,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody wants that.

750
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what this is about.

751
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe the next meeting is on March 16th, which I believe is a Wednesday.

752
01:26:32,058 --> 01:26:37,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the members approve this, I do volunteer.

753
01:26:38,342 --> 01:26:38,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

754
01:26:43,445 --> 01:26:43,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ms.

755
01:26:43,785 --> 01:26:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone?

756
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:45,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

757
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for volunteering.

758
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:51,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering, is the school administration part of this group at present?

759
01:26:52,695 --> 01:26:54,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Or have you talked to Chief Buckley?

760
01:26:55,355 --> 01:26:56,436
[SPEAKER_14]: At present, we're not.

761
01:26:57,316 --> 01:27:01,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I have not spoken with him regarding this particular piece.

762
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:02,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

763
01:27:03,357 --> 01:27:04,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want- Member Grant?

764
01:27:05,098 --> 01:27:06,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I can definitely speak with him.

765
01:27:06,538 --> 01:27:07,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I can do that.

766
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:07,778
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

767
01:27:08,378 --> 01:27:15,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, member Rousseau, because we're taught with the masks associated school committees,

768
01:27:15,987 --> 01:27:26,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't represent us right or you can't speak as a school committee member you're going to report back to us to make sure what they're proposing follows education law.

769
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:32,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I'm not a lawyer so I can't actually make that determination.

770
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:38,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But members, we as a body can certainly appoint a member to act on our behalf.

771
01:27:39,452 --> 01:27:43,335
[SPEAKER_09]: but that is not to say that I don't have the voting rights on the city council.

772
01:27:43,355 --> 01:27:57,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I say acting on our behalf, it's making sure that the conversation is including, okay, when the police show up and they're on school property, that is not the same law as when they're not on school property.

773
01:27:57,847 --> 01:28:00,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And has the ordinance considered it?

774
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they actually pull in?

775
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:05,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Because all their ordinances go through a legal review.

776
01:28:06,433 --> 01:28:07,014
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't just like,

777
01:28:07,644 --> 01:28:11,469
[SPEAKER_09]: like a lot of our policies, we don't just jot them down and pass them and call it a day.

778
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:18,297
[SPEAKER_09]: They go through a legal department to make sure that they're meeting whatever laws they need to meet.

779
01:28:18,998 --> 01:28:22,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's entirely plausible that that would happen here.

780
01:28:24,004 --> 01:28:26,767
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seems also possible that it could be a blind spot.

781
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:43,312
[SPEAKER_09]: that this is a relatively new thing that the police reform, I forget what it's called, the Reform Act of last year around police accountability, that's all from last year, maybe the year before.

782
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just think it's important that we get out ahead of it because if we don't, and the ordinance allows, for instance, the police to come on campus with their recording going on,

783
01:28:56,307 --> 01:28:59,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that turns out to be a violation of FERPA, which I don't know that it would be.

784
01:29:00,188 --> 01:29:16,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, again, my point is to make sure that we are, before this is passed, that we are actually making sure that the specialized case of student privacy is really being included in the ordinance when it's drafted.

785
01:29:17,392 --> 01:29:23,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not to say that I, as I'm not a lawyer, and I could not comment on to whether the language is legal or not,

786
01:29:25,143 --> 01:29:37,909
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and since I wouldn't be voting, all I'm asking is that you give one of us and it doesn't have to be me permission to go and speak for us and speaking for us since we're not voting is not.

787
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:45,855
[SPEAKER_09]: I would obviously be very happy to come back and report back on what's going on in that group.

788
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:55,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes a lot of sense that the subcommittee, that I come back and report to the full committee, you know, what I'm seeing and hearing.

789
01:29:56,918 --> 01:30:01,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I have any other, if I have any concerns, be happy to do that.

790
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:08,221
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so I do think it's really important that, I mean, I could just go as a member of the public,

791
01:30:09,656 --> 01:30:11,297
[SPEAKER_09]: we're not just members of the public.

792
01:30:11,577 --> 01:30:19,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I go there and I stand there and I'm talking about school committee policy and educational law, that's not really okay.

793
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:26,427
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not appropriate for us to be doing that.

794
01:30:26,807 --> 01:30:31,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like, whether or not it is, it will look like I'm speaking for the school committee.

795
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:36,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's why I think it's important that somebody here goes and speaks for the school committee.

796
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you member Graham.

797
01:30:43,246 --> 01:31:03,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel comfortable voting to have somebody go on behalf of the school committee, I would feel comfortable with taking a vote that we asked the city council to allow us to, or even if we just send the ordinance which I have a copy of to attorney Greenspan to look it over and give us guidance.

798
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with

799
01:31:05,305 --> 01:31:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody going and taking notes and then reporting back to us, but I'm not okay with approving any one of us just going on behalf of the school committee.

800
01:31:14,328 --> 01:31:17,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pretty tough ordinance to read.

801
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:20,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot of substance in it.

802
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:23,451
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even questions from our legal team in the city.

803
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:29,733
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely questions and insight that Chief Buckley has that he'll go and ask about and

804
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,267
[SPEAKER_03]: give detail about on the 16th.

805
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:35,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to give my two cents.

806
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:53,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't vote to have any of us go as one person to represent the school committee, but if you adjust the motion, I can see how we could approve something that would at least get us notes or have our attorney on the school side review and give us insight.

807
01:31:58,886 --> 01:31:59,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo?

808
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:04,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I certainly understand the reservation.

809
01:32:04,673 --> 01:32:08,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that just sounds like going as a member of the public.

810
01:32:10,118 --> 01:32:19,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And just as if the mayor shows up to a public meeting and speaks, nobody in the community thinks he's just Brianna Lungo Kern, nobody.

811
01:32:21,606 --> 01:32:26,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't speak as a member of the public, even though technically you can.

812
01:32:26,968 --> 01:32:32,532
[SPEAKER_09]: because you are the mayor and I can't speak as a member of the public because I'm an elected official.

813
01:32:33,093 --> 01:32:46,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, if I show up to the meeting as a member of the public and I see that they're just totally ignoring or not even considering it and I speak, it's really a bad look.

814
01:32:46,884 --> 01:32:47,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very bad look.

815
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:52,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we can't

816
01:32:52,986 --> 01:32:55,847
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't insert ourselves into the ordinance making process.

817
01:32:56,027 --> 01:32:58,348
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't tell them we want to see it before they approve it.

818
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have watched how ordinances are made.

819
01:33:01,569 --> 01:33:18,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And aside from being, well, taking an enormous amount of time, by the time they are done with an ordinance to the point where they would pass it to us, if they wanted to, by the way, because we can't ask them, demand it, you know, the cake is made.

820
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:30,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, I know that in the last two or three years, there's been, I don't remember which ordinance it was, the one that keeps timing out and has to start over.

821
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:48,455
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess I'm just like, what is the, as complicated as it is, and I have looked at the language right now, and it is complicated, I think it seems like it would be far worse for us to wait for them to pass the ordinance and then

822
01:33:50,266 --> 01:33:58,513
[SPEAKER_09]: what let students and parents sue the city for violating FERPA, I mean, or whatever other laws are appropriate.

823
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:18,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems to me that not having our fingers in this, I keep using pie and I'm terrible with these analogies, but having at least a voice there to say, you know, the current language says nothing about when you walk into the schools, is there any difference?

824
01:34:19,504 --> 01:34:21,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a difference and that's a fact.

825
01:34:21,806 --> 01:34:28,310
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just think it seems it behooves us to not wait till it's over.

826
01:34:31,473 --> 01:34:39,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think it's really, I'm not interested in going to this meeting as a member of the public because I don't think I can speak as a member of the public.

827
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

828
01:34:50,068 --> 01:34:50,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor?

829
01:34:51,309 --> 01:34:55,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just wanna say that I just have to disagree with that one point.

830
01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:59,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, any of us could go to any meeting and speak as a member of the public.

831
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:18,366
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different for mayor, because there's only one of me, but with regards to needing four or five votes from a school committee, one person can go from the school committee to give their own opinion on any ordinance that the city council is drafting, but for one to go and give an opinion like it's,

832
01:35:20,021 --> 01:35:26,585
[SPEAKER_03]: a consensus of the entire school committee, it's just, you can't, you just can't do it.

833
01:35:27,525 --> 01:35:40,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, I mean, unless all seven of us have read it and had meetings on it and are on the same page, that's one thing, but where it's kind of just being released and the meeting's not until the 16th, I just don't feel comfortable with it.

834
01:35:43,348 --> 01:35:51,572
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, is there an anticipation that the meeting on the 16th is gonna be the final vote?

835
01:35:53,012 --> 01:36:06,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So does it make sense then for us to send a member of this committee to participate on the 16th so that we can form an opinion, as you say, Mayor?

836
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:13,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes total sense to have one of us go and take notes and report back on the notes.

837
01:36:13,702 --> 01:36:20,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine that it's something that will pass that evening and it would still, it's a, I believe it's a Wednesday night.

838
01:36:20,385 --> 01:36:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't be able to go onto the floor until the following Tuesday, even if it was reported out of committee.

839
01:36:26,468 --> 01:36:33,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can also have our legal team on the city side to look at this from a school standpoint, because.

840
01:36:34,085 --> 01:36:44,314
[SPEAKER_03]: The attorney that will be going on the 16th has worked on these types of ordinances for different cities and towns and I can have her look at it from that perspective as well.

841
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:52,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

842
01:36:53,017 --> 01:37:01,161
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not been on city council mayor and I know you have, I guess my question is what if you pass and if the city council passes an ordinance that is clearly a violation of law.

843
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:04,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who's who's who's who's who.

844
01:37:06,925 --> 01:37:14,890
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, how do we respond, I know I'm not interested in how I spend my Wednesday evening I'm interested in not having.

845
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:26,307
[SPEAKER_09]: body worn cameras in our schools recording students without permission, we go through an absurd number of hoops to make sure we don't accidentally take a picture of a kid.

846
01:37:28,637 --> 01:37:40,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's sort of like amazing that we don't screw that up more because frankly, it's so like, you know, there'll be a whole class and there'll be one kid who's the no picture kid and that's fine, that's great.

847
01:37:41,104 --> 01:37:43,625
[SPEAKER_09]: But we somehow manage that.

848
01:37:44,085 --> 01:37:50,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, does the ordinance say anything about when you walk onto school property, you turn the camera off?

849
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:56,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Or does the data go to the same place in the sky as it would when you're not on school property?

850
01:37:57,435 --> 01:37:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just seems to me like we're just...

851
01:38:00,475 --> 01:38:03,796
[SPEAKER_09]: leaving it all out there and hoping for the best.

852
01:38:04,716 --> 01:38:09,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, it doesn't feel responsible for me as a school committee member.

853
01:38:09,537 --> 01:38:23,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously if the majority of the members feel it's more responsible to just hope that the city council does the right thing and hope that the right kinds of lawyers take a look at this before it gets approved, then that's up to the committee.

854
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:28,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, as I said, not like I really want to spend my Wednesday night doing this.

855
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, sorry to interrupt Member Russo, sorry.

856
01:38:32,523 --> 01:38:33,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

857
01:38:33,664 --> 01:38:35,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I can't put my hand up, sorry.

858
01:38:35,404 --> 01:38:37,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

859
01:38:38,365 --> 01:38:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

860
01:38:38,805 --> 01:38:54,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to ask if there was a way that we could consider, you know, writing a letter to the city council from the school committee as a whole, letting them know that these are some of the concerns that we think should be considered as part of this ordinance.

861
01:39:00,395 --> 01:39:08,897
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, I think we certainly can, but I don't know that we could draft such a letter in advance of the 16th.

862
01:39:10,157 --> 01:39:14,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we do not have a meeting scheduled to do so, so I think.

863
01:39:15,358 --> 01:39:16,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't think it's sorry.

864
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:22,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Just point of information I don't think it needs to be a collective letter I don't think it needs to be a meeting to draft a letter.

865
01:39:22,765 --> 01:39:41,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could potentially appoint a member to draft a letter expressing the concerns and ask that they be considered in a way that it's coming as a collective as opposed to seemingly from one person.

866
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:47,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau.

867
01:39:52,846 --> 01:40:11,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a point about disagreeing that we could act as members of the public and I guess I should have been more clear, certainly I have no trouble sending in commentary to the city council when they're drafting ordinance or making a decision about parking or the budget.

868
01:40:13,168 --> 01:40:23,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, anything that's not related to schools, the moments it's related to schools, I just think it is, it's really a stretch to believe that we are not seen as school committee members when we're making our comments.

869
01:40:24,217 --> 01:40:28,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in that regard, I think.

870
01:40:29,657 --> 01:40:40,906
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, as individuals I think we're all welcome to write our letters, I think a letter is different than than participating and trying to have a voice at such a meeting.

871
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:56,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly am happy to write a letter to each of the city counselors and you know, remind them that school law is not the same as just regular law and that they, I hope that they will take the time to consider it I mean, they may be watching this meeting but.

872
01:40:58,772 --> 01:41:09,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I, my biggest concern is that, considering how long it takes to write an ordinance considering the complexity of this and many other ordinances, knowing that they got it right before

873
01:41:09,742 --> 01:41:11,603
[SPEAKER_09]: it's approved and ends up in muni code.

874
01:41:12,603 --> 01:41:33,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, it just seems reasonable I mean I know we, we actually have the City Council has a joint education subcommittee with the school committee that I don't know that has, I don't know when that's met, probably not since the new buildings for the middle and elementary schools, and I think other communities do have a joint

875
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:37,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's a subcommittee, whatever.

876
01:41:37,471 --> 01:41:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some kind of joint meeting between the city council and the school committee and this seems like the situation where that kind of thing would be very appropriate to discuss it but we don't have those at this time so it feels like, you know, that's in our potential rules if we get to keep that part that we will do something like that.

877
01:41:57,438 --> 01:41:59,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it, you know, considering that so many

878
01:42:02,803 --> 01:42:20,217
[SPEAKER_09]: it's clear there's a reason, like nobody wants just more meetings, but there are some times when the city council and the school committee really do have to have an interaction, an official interaction, not just a memo to the people you know or something.

879
01:42:20,337 --> 01:42:27,522
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, if there's, we can just vote this down, I can withdraw it.

880
01:42:27,562 --> 01:42:29,043
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like there's not support.

881
01:42:29,624 --> 01:42:30,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the floor?

882
01:42:31,535 --> 01:42:32,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not heard a motion on the floor.

883
01:42:45,984 --> 01:42:49,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing and seeing no motion, do we move on to the next topic?

884
01:42:51,928 --> 01:42:52,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

885
01:42:57,984 --> 01:43:05,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Next topic, 2022-22, offered by Paul Rousseau, Sharon Hayes, and Jenny Graham.

886
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:12,596
[SPEAKER_02]: All nurses offices in every school within the Medford Public Schools will stock an assortment of menstrual care products, including tampons and pads.

887
01:43:13,636 --> 01:43:22,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Effective immediately, these products will be free of charge to students who request them, and students will be supplied up to three items at each visit to the nurse's office.

888
01:43:23,244 --> 01:43:24,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Beginning May 1st, 2022,

889
01:43:26,537 --> 01:43:31,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Students requesting these products will be supplied sufficient quantities to meet their needs.

890
01:43:31,345 --> 01:43:33,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Students will not be charged for these products.

891
01:43:35,731 --> 01:43:36,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

892
01:43:36,933 --> 01:43:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.

893
01:43:38,095 --> 01:43:38,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

894
01:43:38,896 --> 01:43:39,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Mayor Graham.

895
01:43:42,818 --> 01:43:47,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to read a little statement I had drafted around this.

896
01:43:47,259 --> 01:43:55,181
[SPEAKER_09]: So last Thursday, March 3rd, Senate Bill 1445 was unanimously passed by the Massachusetts Senate.

897
01:43:55,641 --> 01:44:05,944
[SPEAKER_09]: The bill, an act to increase access to disposable menstrual products in prisons, homeless shelters, and public schools is the culmination of a lot of work by a lot of people.

898
01:44:06,244 --> 01:44:09,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is important to mention the names of these people right here in Medford.

899
01:44:10,514 --> 01:44:24,538
[SPEAKER_09]: From 2016 to 2018 Maya Gomez and will address school created the free the pad project as part of the Center for citizenship and social responsibility from 2019 to 2020 Christina saying and Elizabeth hunt.

900
01:44:26,098 --> 01:44:35,384
[SPEAKER_09]: continued and expanded this work with their Tax Less Tampons Free Feminine Products project, also as part of the CCSR.

901
01:44:35,744 --> 01:44:44,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And now Malina McGovern and Mariana Constantara are continuing this important work with their project as part of the CCSR.

902
01:44:45,289 --> 01:44:50,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Maya, Willa, Christina, Elizabeth, Malina, and Mariana.

903
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:56,587
[SPEAKER_09]: for all they've done to make sure that this doesn't, that this stays an issue that we keep talking about.

904
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:03,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very excited that the state house is doing something about it.

905
01:45:03,869 --> 01:45:11,192
[SPEAKER_09]: The lead sponsor of the Senate bill is none other than our own Senator Pat Jalen of, well, she lives in Somerville, but she's our Medford Senator.

906
01:45:11,952 --> 01:45:18,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanna thank Pat for all of her hard work on getting this to the floor of the Senate and getting it voted.

907
01:45:19,055 --> 01:45:20,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was unanimously approved.

908
01:45:21,401 --> 01:45:29,528
[SPEAKER_09]: There are two lead sponsors in the House, our own Christine Barber and also Representative Jay Livingstone of Boston.

909
01:45:29,548 --> 01:45:39,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Christine and Jay for all of their hard work and all the work that is definitely to come as they attempt to marshal this into becoming law through the House of Representatives.

910
01:45:40,977 --> 01:45:48,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank the CCSR and their benefactors who ensure that the resources are available so our students can become the leaders that we know that they can be.

911
01:45:49,832 --> 01:46:03,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, I want to thank the leadership of the Massachusetts menstrual equity coalition in the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization of Women for their sustained work, which is needed to keep this important effort moving forward.

912
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:06,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

913
01:46:08,621 --> 01:46:08,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

914
01:46:09,502 --> 01:46:12,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion approved by Member McLaughlin, second by Member McStone.

915
01:46:15,505 --> 01:46:15,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

916
01:46:22,905 --> 01:46:23,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

917
01:46:23,045 --> 01:46:23,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

918
01:46:23,265 --> 01:46:23,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

919
01:46:23,786 --> 01:46:24,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

920
01:46:24,867 --> 01:46:25,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

921
01:46:25,047 --> 01:46:25,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

922
01:46:25,247 --> 01:46:25,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

923
01:46:25,387 --> 01:46:25,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

924
01:46:27,048 --> 01:46:27,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

925
01:46:54,781 --> 01:47:04,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to ask if there was a way that a letter can be written to Willa, Maya, and the rest of the women who worked on this as a thank you from the school committee.

926
01:47:04,185 --> 01:47:23,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Maya's in Scotland now and Willa's in DC, but they still have their local home addresses that I'd be happy to provide or happy to draft a letter thanking each of the women students from Medford that helped make this happen and are helping

927
01:47:23,638 --> 01:47:24,499
[SPEAKER_05]: so many of our students.

928
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:32,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess I'm asking for a motion that we send a letter of thank you to the six women who initiated this in our Medford public schools.

929
01:47:34,144 --> 01:47:34,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

930
01:47:35,966 --> 01:47:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to send a letter of thanks from the school committee to all of the women that were noted in member So's lead up to this motion made by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rossell.

931
01:47:50,955 --> 01:47:51,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

932
01:47:52,447 --> 01:47:52,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

933
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:53,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

934
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kretz?

935
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:54,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

936
01:47:55,610 --> 01:47:55,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes?

937
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

938
01:47:57,952 --> 01:47:58,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

939
01:47:59,654 --> 01:47:59,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

940
01:48:01,175 --> 01:48:01,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McStone?

941
01:48:01,776 --> 01:48:01,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

942
01:48:02,677 --> 01:48:03,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rousseau?

943
01:48:03,197 --> 01:48:03,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

944
01:48:03,517 --> 01:48:04,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Longo Kern?

945
01:48:04,939 --> 01:48:05,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

946
01:48:09,303 --> 01:48:11,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

947
01:48:13,707 --> 01:48:14,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Item 2022-23, offered by myself.

948
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Medford public schools is required to distribute notifications to caregivers regarding truancy and absenteeism, and whereas Medford public school, the medical committee and the public school administration are committed to creating a collaborative partnership between home and school.

949
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:39,872
[SPEAKER_02]: that the Family Engagement and Communications Subcommittee will meet to review the district communications regarding truancy and absenteeism.

950
01:48:40,332 --> 01:48:49,239
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee will review our regulatory requirements and current communications to ensure there is compliance with the regulations and that the letters achieve our objectives of collaborative partnership.

951
01:48:51,422 --> 01:49:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I put this forward, not to have a weedy discussion before, but to send it to subcommittee where we can have a discussion about this with a sort of wide variety of folks in the community who are interested, some in the truancy letter,

952
01:49:11,348 --> 01:49:14,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes out at the beginning of the year, some in the absenteeism letter.

953
01:49:15,289 --> 01:49:20,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there's a lot of regulatory requirement around these letters.

954
01:49:21,272 --> 01:49:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping that you all will agree that we should take a quick peek at this in subcommittee.

955
01:49:30,035 --> 01:49:30,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

956
01:49:33,176 --> 01:49:36,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion approved by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Hayes.

957
01:49:38,278 --> 01:49:38,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?

958
01:49:42,111 --> 01:49:44,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we'll call member Graham.

959
01:49:44,353 --> 01:49:44,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

960
01:49:45,574 --> 01:49:49,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Chris.

961
01:49:49,958 --> 01:49:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

962
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:53,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

963
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

964
01:49:55,582 --> 01:49:55,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

965
01:49:57,264 --> 01:49:59,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative zero in the negative motion passes.

966
01:50:01,034 --> 01:50:19,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Item 2022 dash 24 offered by myself, whereas the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee met on December 1 2020 to discuss the district communication strategy and whereas during that meeting the administration discuss goals for a new and comprehensive platform to manage communications and the need for a new website.

967
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communications Subcommittee will meet to review progress to date, understand current efforts, discuss future efforts, and identify funding requirements to meet the goal of having a cohesive communication strategy that meets the needs of families and the district.

968
01:50:36,973 --> 01:51:03,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Um I was thinking through, I I had some questions recently about the website and I think, you know, there's general feedback that it doesn't contain information that families are looking for in a whole in a whole variety of ways and I was looking back through the minutes of that meeting on on twelve one and there was a lot of really good discussion in that meeting about the constraints and

969
01:51:06,443 --> 01:51:20,667
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as sort of the need to be comprehensive in terms of how we think about that outreach from a website perspective, both for prospective families, for current families, for alumni, et cetera.

970
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:33,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And we even had a pretty detailed discussion about the ways in which all of that work could ultimately work in partnership with our PTOs that we depend on so significantly.

971
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: If this motion is supported, we'll hold a subcommittee meeting and talk about where we are at, what those conversations have been to date, get an update, and then determine what actions, if any, we need to think about as we go forward.

972
01:51:49,737 --> 01:51:50,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

973
01:51:52,198 --> 01:51:53,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

974
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:54,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Edward-Gunson.

975
01:51:55,059 --> 01:52:02,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I just wanted to share that we have been working with some of our students.

976
01:52:04,623 --> 01:52:07,865
[SPEAKER_14]: One of our teachers, Lisa Miller, Ms.

977
01:52:07,905 --> 01:52:14,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Caldwell also has been helping to coordinate that with our technology team and our vocational students on web design.

978
01:52:15,428 --> 01:52:19,350
[SPEAKER_14]: They have been working diligently for the past few months

979
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:25,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will be presenting something very soon to the school committee.

980
01:52:25,755 --> 01:52:35,382
[SPEAKER_14]: It is taking the feedback that was given and trying to update, change images, all of those things.

981
01:52:35,862 --> 01:52:39,445
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually have made significant progress.

982
01:52:39,985 --> 01:52:47,251
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we actually will be having a presentation to you in the very near future, probably sometime in April.

983
01:52:48,091 --> 01:52:56,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I don't think we'll be able to have it for the March 21 meeting, but I just wanted to let you know that from the time this December of 2020.

984
01:52:56,917 --> 01:53:07,705
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been working in the background diligently on that so hopefully when we have that presentation, you'll see significant

985
01:53:08,785 --> 01:53:17,329
[SPEAKER_14]: a significantly better look, user-friendly, and having documents more readily available.

986
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:21,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look forward to bringing that to the committee in the very near future.

987
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:24,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

988
01:53:26,934 --> 01:53:29,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion approved by Member Laughlin, seconded by Member McStone.

989
01:53:31,536 --> 01:53:31,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

990
01:53:32,957 --> 01:53:33,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

991
01:53:34,297 --> 01:53:35,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Member Krebs.

992
01:53:45,997 --> 01:53:47,518
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't hear a member, sorry.

993
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:49,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you turn on your microphone?

994
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:52,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was on, I'm sorry.

995
01:53:53,083 --> 01:54:05,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I think what the superintendent mentioned was that we're going to have a presentation, probably in April, where we'll hear, you know, what the work they've done so far on the website.

996
01:54:07,493 --> 01:54:07,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

997
01:54:08,054 --> 01:54:12,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm wondering, like, you know, I think maybe we have to wait to have

998
01:54:12,728 --> 01:54:18,332
[SPEAKER_10]: that meeting, you know, if there's further questions, then we would have another subcommittee meeting.

999
01:54:18,673 --> 01:54:27,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just wondering, you know, if we could hold off on this until we hear from the superintendent's presentation in April.

1000
01:54:32,003 --> 01:54:32,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau.

1001
01:54:33,564 --> 01:54:34,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1002
01:54:34,465 --> 01:54:39,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the part about the website I agree with, although the rest of it is about, you know,

1003
01:54:40,548 --> 01:54:48,112
[SPEAKER_09]: the communication strategy, because I think the website is definitely a part of our communication strategy, but I think it's just one piece.

1004
01:54:49,832 --> 01:55:06,660
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, I mean, I think the other parts of a cohesive communication strategy, I think we still need to, you know, in particular, I'm interested in understanding more about like the funding requirements.

1005
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,081
[SPEAKER_09]: None of this stuff is ever free.

1006
01:55:11,385 --> 01:55:19,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I would still support this I agree that the website part, you know, that there's probably.

1007
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:25,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Until we have it, we can't really probably say much.

1008
01:55:25,617 --> 01:55:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Although maybe during the subcommittee, there can be a sneak peek, maybe.

1009
01:55:30,078 --> 01:55:36,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I definitely can have it presented to the subcommittee.

1010
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:48,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I can figure out where we are and schedule the subcommittee meeting and have the new website launch happen, take place at the school, at the subcommittee meeting.

1011
01:55:49,045 --> 01:55:56,786
[SPEAKER_14]: so that the subcommittee can actually see it in real time and then report out, the subcommittee can report out to the larger committee.

1012
01:55:57,206 --> 01:56:14,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because I think I would, you know, I love websites and technology and all that stuff, but this big meeting doesn't, this big, there's nobody here, but this format doesn't feel like the meeting to go through the website and for us to poke around in it and really dig in.

1013
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a subcommittee is a much better

1014
01:56:18,808 --> 01:56:31,038
[SPEAKER_09]: place for that, but again, that's just a piece of the communication strategy that I think, I'm not part of this subcommittee, so I have to admit I'm a little, it's out of my wheelhouse, so I don't know who else is on it.

1015
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not on that, right?

1016
01:56:34,081 --> 01:56:34,501
[SPEAKER_09]: No, okay.

1017
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:45,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would still support moving forward with this, but the website part is actually just part of the whereas, it's not the what should be done.

1018
01:56:48,174 --> 01:56:49,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other questions?

1019
01:56:51,636 --> 01:56:52,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

1020
01:56:52,736 --> 01:56:53,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham?

1021
01:56:53,837 --> 01:56:54,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1022
01:56:54,657 --> 01:56:55,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kretz?

1023
01:56:55,658 --> 01:56:55,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1024
01:56:57,359 --> 01:56:58,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hayes?

1025
01:56:59,780 --> 01:56:59,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1026
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1027
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:02,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1028
01:57:03,702 --> 01:57:04,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Mustone?

1029
01:57:04,262 --> 01:57:04,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1030
01:57:05,062 --> 01:57:05,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Soyes?

1031
01:57:05,983 --> 01:57:06,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Longo Kern?

1032
01:57:07,183 --> 01:57:07,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1033
01:57:09,345 --> 01:57:11,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

1034
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Item number 2022-25 offered by Jenny Graham and Paul Rousseau.

1035
01:57:19,757 --> 01:57:27,761
[SPEAKER_02]: The wellness policy ADF to K-8 students will be sent to the rules and policy subcommittee for revision.

1036
01:57:27,921 --> 01:57:38,166
[SPEAKER_02]: The subcommittee shall hold at least one working session and that invites members of the administration and the public to provide input on the goals and requirements of the revised policy.

1037
01:57:40,452 --> 01:57:47,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommended revised policy will be returned to this committee prior to the end of the 2021-2022 school year.

1038
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rizzo, can you start by telling us what the policy is about?

1039
01:57:51,563 --> 01:57:59,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the policy is about a lot of things, but the part that this actually was a motion that I had put on

1040
01:58:01,499 --> 01:58:03,560
[SPEAKER_09]: just when the pandemic was beginning.

1041
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:08,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the recess policy amongst, is the key part.

1042
01:58:09,102 --> 01:58:17,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And considering we were, nobody was going to school, the recess policy felt a little out of left field at that moment in time.

1043
01:58:18,025 --> 01:58:18,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So we tabled it.

1044
01:58:19,305 --> 01:58:25,487
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm re-offering it instead of trying to take it from the table because we didn't have a numbering system back then.

1045
01:58:25,607 --> 01:58:27,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really hard to like,

1046
01:58:28,712 --> 01:58:32,393
[SPEAKER_09]: dig up an old agenda and try and pull something from the table without numbers.

1047
01:58:32,673 --> 01:58:34,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I've offered it again.

1048
01:58:34,273 --> 01:58:41,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, this is to take a look at and perhaps revise our recess policy.

1049
01:58:42,994 --> 01:58:43,595
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that's it.

1050
01:58:48,135 --> 01:58:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions?

1051
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:54,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion approved by Member McStone.

1052
01:58:55,257 --> 01:58:56,657
