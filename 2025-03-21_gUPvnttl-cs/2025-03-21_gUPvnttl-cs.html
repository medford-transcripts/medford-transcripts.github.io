    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=65.027s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=65.127s">Stone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.048s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.208s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.268s">Geary.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.428s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.588s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=66.668s">Vandenbroek.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=67.749s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=68.069s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=68.269s">Vandenbroek.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=68.909s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=69.309s">Seven</a>  present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=70.43s">We</a>  will now rise to salute our flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=73.992s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=78.172s">The</a>  United Republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=87.257s">Before</a>  we start this meeting, we're all aware that we lost a very special Medford citizen this past weekend, John Jack McGlynn, and it was a heartache for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=98.644s">He</a>  was our former mayor and he certainly drove this city forward during the time that he spent leading this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=105.669s">So</a>  if we could all just take a moment of silence and dedicate this meeting in his memory, please rise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=118.871s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=123.574s">This</a>  is a special meeting of the Medford School Committee Monday, August 29, 2016 in the Library Resource Center at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=130.619s">The</a>  purpose of the meeting are to discuss the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=133.742s">Update</a>  report on the opening of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=136.423s">Item</a>  number one, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=140.146s">Madam</a>  Mayor, members of the committee, you have a report in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=143.669s">It's</a>  a preliminary report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=145.43s">As</a>  you know, school opens tomorrow for grades <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=149.283s">1</a>  through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=150.563s">Kindergarten</a>  will come in next week on September 7th, on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=156.365s">In</a>  preparation for the opening of school, administrators have been meeting all last week and all throughout the summer, hiring and reviewing necessary policies, protocols, and programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=167.748s">We've</a>  also participated in meetings with our new teachers, staff, contractors to ensure they're off to a great start. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=174.689s">Enrollment</a>  in the school is increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=177.827s">We'll</a>  reserve judgment on the need for maybe additional faculty or staff until we see who actually shows up in the first week or so of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=187.029s">And</a>  we'll calculate actual attendance at that time, which is typical practice for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=192.75s">Transportation</a>  routes are posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=195.59s">We</a>  used Transfinder this year, our first time using that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=199.051s">As</a>  usual, adjustments are made during the first month to reflect actual ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=203.992s">And</a>  we're working to consolidate at least one bus <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=206.86s">and</a>  possibly downsize one bus to a smaller vehicle heading to Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=212.024s">Security</a>  plans are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=213.505s">All</a>  schools have updated their plans and scheduled drills to practice the various response measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=218.769s">I've</a>  attached a copy of a recent article which I sent you previously, but in case you didn't see it, on the bomb scares in Medford Public Schools and was in the American School Board's journal featuring Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=232.038s">A</a>  preliminary report on our summer maintenance and repair work has been included. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=236.457s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=237.577s">A</a>  lot was done, a lot more will be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=240.979s">Tonight</a>  we'll discuss capital planning, which is another dimension of our building repairs and long-term improvement of our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=250.422s">Additional</a>  work was completed in our buildings with the help of the vocational school faculty and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=255.583s">And</a>  we're awarding a new contract to cleaning service sometime this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=261.571s">We've</a>  interviewed multiple vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=263.092s">We've</a>  narrowed it down to four individuals, four individual groups, and we should have a decision probably by tomorrow or no later than Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=274.602s">We're</a>  working on a new initiative that would have students, especially in the high school and the middle schools, adopt specific sections of their buildings for upkeep and improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=285.131s">Almost</a>  like what you see in the islands around the city where you adopt an island and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=290.477s">We'll</a>  have you some details on this initiative at a subsequent meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=295.519s">After</a>  school and before school programs are ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=298.039s">Demand</a>  for these programs and services continues to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=301.861s">We're</a>  working hard to ensure that we have enough staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=304.881s">It's</a>  a little challenging as people come and go in this after school staff at the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=309.663s">And</a>  sometimes people become available if they feel they don't have another type of job for themselves at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=317.428s">Supplies</a>  materials are on hand for the opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=321.31s">New</a>  techs have been ordered and will be in place this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=324.811s">Team</a>  Medford, Hallmark Health, and they'll be with us on the meeting at the 12th, along with Armstrong Ambulance and Staples, presented over $27,000 worth of additional school supplies to us this past week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=337.156s">Our</a>  athletic teams have been practicing and will be ready for their openings in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=341.138s">A</a>  fall schedule is included in your materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=344.219s">The</a>  marching band practices virtually every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=347.223s">and</a>  they'll be very active in our games and other community events this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=351.045s">I've</a>  enclosed some additional articles that have been in the transcript and on our blog that highlight Medford school programs and in particular I put my first article into the transcript this week entitled standing up together for our Medford public schools and cover a lot of the things that went on and will go on in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=369.377s">We've</a>  had several meetings with the transcript in an attempt to try and develop a new relationship <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=375.84s">that</a>  will be positive for the transcript and for the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=379.803s">So</a>  we'll follow up with a report on the actual opening of our schools at a regularly scheduled meeting on September 12, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=387.149s">Again,</a>  if we go to the next page, you'll see the typed copy of what was actually in the transcript on August 25th, listing many of the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=399.699s">One</a>  of the interesting parts of this first part was that, you know, obviously I'm calling for parents to <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=404.062s">stay</a>  engaged with us and for us to work with them and to encourage their involvement and giving them ways that they can participate in your meetings and in conjunction with the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=414.149s">We</a>  spoke to the faculty about a similar thing this week and we think that we're making that a serious priority going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=422.575s">I'm</a>  not going to read through this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=424.056s">I</a>  know you've had opportunities to go through these things yourself and if you have any questions I'll be happy to comment on any of it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=432.488s">Over</a>  the weekend I've seen several phone calls from concerned parents in the elementary bus schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=440.17s">One</a>  parent was emphatic that the bus time for pickup for her child would not allow the bus and her child to get to school on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=448.973s">Is</a>  there any truth to that or does it need to be tweaked? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=452.394s">Will</a>  this rule be circulating throughout the community for the next couple of weeks?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=458.23s">It's</a>  hard to know whether the buses are going to get there on time in the first week because in the first week a lot of people are still figuring it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=465.395s">Some</a>  people arrive at the stops a little bit late. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=468.637s">We</a>  think we schedule them to get there on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=472.039s">But,</a>  you know, Pat may have another view.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Velie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=491.734s">We</a>  used TransFinder for the first time this year and in the past one of the parent complaints was that we were not posting pick up times just to start time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=500.921s">So</a>  this was our first attempt to give them a time that their child should be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=505.424s">And</a>  we always say 10 minutes early the first two weeks of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=508.967s">And</a>  as I've told everybody that I've responded to, those are only estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=513.585s">A</a>  computer program does not know our traffic, does not know our weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=517.187s">And</a>  so as the buses get underway in the next two weeks, we'll review all those and we'll try and put a more accurate time down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=524.63s">And</a>  of course that will be affected by weather and traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=526.811s">I</a>  understand.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=527.952s">I</a>  just wanted to address the concerns of the parents.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Velie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=531.193s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=532.434s">I</a>  responded to a lot of them.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=533.834s">The</a>  phone calls keep coming from the same group. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=536.015s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=540.317s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=543.253s">So</a>  the next part of the report has some materials on what was done in maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=549.357s">John</a>  McLaughlin is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=550.658s">I</a>  won't try to read through it all because you have it in front of you, but if you have a specific question, John is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=556.942s">I</a>  can answer some and John can answer anything else that you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=562.966s">So</a>  if you have any questions about what was done in buildings and grounds, more is going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=572.365s">We're</a>  still working at things, but for the most part, we're very functional going into the school year.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.168s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=578.348s">Conyo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=579.429s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=579.969s">Welcome,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=582.871s">If</a>  Mr. McLaughlin doesn't mind coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=589.414s">I</a>  know we have the report in front of us, and we know that the report is available to everyone, but is it possible, John, just to go over a few things that you've done so that way people are aware of what's been going on?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=607.995s">Okay,</a>  so here at the high school, we did a lot of painting with the custodial staff, the nurses suite, three stairwells in C building, lecture halls two and three, in the car and near the pool area, and along with the fitness center, we did a lot of painting up in the fitness center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=628.879s">And</a>  of course we had the landscape project out front where we tore down 15 shrubs to try to tidy it up a little bit, the appearance of the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=638.233s">Garland</a>  Roofing was here the last two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=640.254s">We're</a>  doing a scan of the roof to see if we can find out the longevity of the roof, see where we're at for the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=651.542s">Then</a>  we had the bad winters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=655.505s">Some</a>  parts of the roof did take a beating from the shoveling. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=662.129s">Then</a>  the ceiling over here in this back room, we removed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=665.492s">So</a>  we're going to make a nice little space for meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=668.02s">We're</a>  going to do lights and a new ceiling over here so that there's a nice little area over here for meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=675.471s">That</a>  was working with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=678.996s">The</a>  backboard project that we're going to be doing in that high school <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=683.251s">is</a>  they're going to start the demo Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=686.532s">So</a>  I'm assuming that that backboard project will be done by the middle of next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=690.933s">So</a>  that was one of our key, key projects this summer, replacing six backboards up in the junior area with the basketball program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=701.476s">And</a>  at the McGlynn Middle and Elementary, we had a lot of painting done from the Department of Corrections. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=710.998s">The</a>  maintenance team went in there and went through all the sinks because we were fielding issues of leaky sinks and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=722.082s">So</a>  they went through all the sinks and they replaced over 50 of the hot water cartridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=728.405s">A</a>  lot of times the cartridges creates the leaking sink. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=734.387s">So</a>  they were down there most of the summer working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=739.426s">In</a>  working with Mayor Burke, we were able to replace some sidewalks at the Columbus and at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=747.469s">We're</a>  still working on it, replacing the curbing that has rotted out over the years from the winters.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=756.473s">Can</a>  I ask a question about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=757.913s">Sure,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=758.233s">Vanderhoof.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=760.234s">Could</a>  you please tell us what you're replacing the curbing with? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=762.914s">I</a>  thought that was a higher cost item that was going to be looked at in terms of the capital improvement plan when we spoke about it last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=772.617s">So</a>  I'm curious, since we've already seen that curbing had a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=779.058s">I'm</a>  wondering what you're replacing it with.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=780.279s">At</a>  this point, the safety issue ones were the ones that we had to correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=787.863s">As</a>  part of the capital improvements plan, yes, there's still more to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=793.426s">But</a>  we just wanted to make sure that anything where a kid could trip or create a safety hazard, we went down there to make sure that those were okay first.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=804.832s">So</a>  how are we correcting it?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=806.593s">We're</a>  replacing the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=808.275s">They're</a>  taking out all the curb and putting new ones in.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=812.718s">But</a>  the same type of curb?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=813.939s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=814.46s">It's</a>  a stronger material though.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=816.001s">It's</a>  a stronger material. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=817.102s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=817.422s">Because</a>  what, obviously my question is what's going to prevent that, the same thing from happening again?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=822.947s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=823.347s">And</a>  I definitely thought we were looking at a different material completely, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=827.11s">I'm</a>  a little concerned about that.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=827.971s">Well,</a>  when the time comes again, we should probably look into granite.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=831.113s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=831.873s">And</a>  then our problems, we wouldn't have to worry too much about that.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.035s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=835.996s">Well,</a>  we'll discuss this, I guess, with capital improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=840.079s">So</a>  in essence, this is step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.36s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=842.841s">A</a>  temporary fix.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=843.881s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=844.162s">And</a>  we did a couple of sidewalk panels at the Columbus School, too, that were creating a hazardous condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=850.746s">So</a>  we're working down there as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=854.809s">We</a>  did a site visit of a few different locations that were of serious concern, so we wanted to address those outside of the capital plan so that we felt that the children and parents and teachers were safe going in and out of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=868.005s">What's</a>  in the capital plan is above and beyond that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=870.928s">Mayor</a>  Burke, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=872.249s">Cunha,</a>  just while we're on that, I know that we have to repair them because of safety issues, and that's definitely something that has to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=880.452s">My</a>  concern, though, is that when we go into the capital planning, is that I just don't want to start seeing patches everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=889.295s">and</a>  things starting to look old. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=891.836s">If</a>  we're going to patch it up and we're going to fix it, I totally understand and doing it now, but I also want to make sure that it looks the same when we go into the capital planning or if it's going to look the same as you repair it because I mean the cosmetic part of it <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=908.822s">needs</a>  to be looked at, you know, looked at it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=911.463s">So</a>  I want to make sure everything just stays on page and that everything still looks as new as we possibly can make it look. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=918.045s">Instead</a>  of, I just don't want to go to any of the schools and start seeing, you know, like one curb looking this way and another curb looking another way.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=927.216s">Just</a>  to refer to the Columbus, they went and they matched the paint because that concrete was treated with a stain. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=933.76s">They</a>  went and matched it so that it would fit in with what's there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=937.283s">So</a>  they did spend a lot of time trying to work on things not to make it look like it's just going to get it done.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=943.487s">Right,</a>  and that's one thing.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=945.149s">No,</a>  aesthetically we would like to keep the aesthetics.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=948.391s">And</a>  I know that you and your staff and everyone involved has done a tremendous job over the summer and I really thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=954.878s">Just</a>  a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=956.159s">The</a>  carpet in the front where the community, not the community schools is, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=960.543s">The</a>  bathroom is where the pool is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=962.886s">I</a>  know that we had put it in there temporarily, but it's still very bubbled up because it wasn't laid down properly when it was first done.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=970.393s">I</a>  think it's ready anyways.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=971.594s">I</a>  think it's ready for either to get pulled out and yeah because that is a safety issue because kids are walking on that and it keeps on rattling, not rattling, wrapping up that you can trip on it.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=983.386s">You</a>  have to be careful because of the flooring.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=985.888s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=987.27s">So</a>  that was one and the other thing is that <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=990.408s">I'm</a>  very happy to see the painting outside and the crosswalks and all that, but I'm looking still for my signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=997.233s">Where</a>  are the signs that say, like, slow down, school entrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1001.476s">We</a>  need those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1002.797s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1004.078s">I've</a>  seen them in different cities and towns, and it's just, I know that everybody, you know, we know that the school is here.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1011.464s">We're</a>  actually looking to put some speed bumps in, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1014.186s">That's</a>  why I was... Especially up the vocational side.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1017.508s">The</a>  vocational side, but the hill coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1019.87s">The</a>  temporary ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1020.951s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1021.431s">The</a>  hill coming down is really... I've been out there many a times, especially at night during the summertime, and I know people always think it's the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1031.0s">It's</a>  really not the kids driving those vehicles that are spinning around that corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1035.303s">And</a>  my concern, and that's been brought up many a times, so I'm happy that we're looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1041.428s">And</a>  again, it's common sense, you see kids, you're in a school area, you're supposed to slow down, but if we could stop putting up the signs for it, it would be good.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1051.732s">And</a>  the crosswalk up here, I hope people notice the artistic crosswalk that was put in for them from the Arts Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1057.114s">Yeah,</a>  it looks good.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1061.019s">And</a>  at the Curtis Tufts School, high school, the DOC came in again and they painted all the classrooms on the top floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1071.306s">And</a>  we were able to do some, we did a test of one of the rooms, stripping the varnish off the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1078.991s">You'll</a>  have to see it, it came out very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1080.652s">So</a>  we'll be looking to systematically go into all the classrooms.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1090.82s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1092.822s">I</a>  just want to say thank you very much for devoting some time and attention there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1097.426s">I</a>  know you did it last summer, and again this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1101.209s">And</a>  I'm really grateful for all the attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1103.931s">And</a>  that you and the superintendent, I think last year I had the superintendent walk the building three times with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1109.055s">I</a>  let him off the hook this year, but I think I'm going down in September.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1113.299s">Well,</a>  he was down there too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1115.1s">We</a>  all did it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1117.632s">Before</a>  the summer, we all came in, starting to formulate a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1122.835s">Chip</a>  away. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1123.395s">We'll</a>  chip away at it little by little.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1126.097s">And</a>  so my next priority down there is that room with the kitchen in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1130.179s">I'd</a>  like to go down and visit that maybe in the next week or two if the superintendent has time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1135.862s">maybe</a>  we can coordinate it so we can both be there at the same time, as well as the principal and the special education director.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1143.347s">Yeah,</a>  we were talking about maybe opening that room up again and taking down the wall and then working with it somehow like that, with the wall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1156.315s">The</a>  wall isn't really aesthetically pleasing down there.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1159.218s">So</a>  if we can look at something like that so it could be done over a long vacation or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1163.621s">But</a>  if we stop planning now, we might be able to do that throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1167.324s">I'd</a>  really love to see that continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1169.966s">It's</a>  a valuable property that the department owns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1173.749s">And</a>  I know that the children there really benefit from having that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1178.233s">So</a>  I just want to say thank you for not forgetting about it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1182.441s">Madam</a>  Mayor, I just want to request that when that happens all the school committee members are informed of when there might be an opportunity to view it so that it's not, so that we can all have access to that information.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1197.504s">I'm</a>  just going to piggyback on that and actually a couple of years ago we all had, we all made it a point that we had meetings that were set up to go and visit all the schools and look through all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1209.815s">So</a>  if we could do that and include the Tufts, you know, Curtis Tufts School and include all the rest of the schools and we could incorporate that into one of our meetings, our subcommittee meeting, so that way it gives everybody the opportunity to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1223.967s">We</a>  all have walked into the schools separately, but if we're going to be looking at this and we're going to be looking at a capital plan that's coming up, I think it'd all be good if we're on the same page.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1238.693s">And</a>  at the Columbus School, we had some roof flashing repaired last week, too, that was damaged from the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1246.436s">So</a>  that's at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1249.972s">At</a>  the Roberts, Columbus, Andrews, and Brooks, we had the rug shampooed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1254.615s">They</a>  hadn't been done for a while, so we sent them down to have them shampooed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1260.86s">And</a>  then, again, at the McGlynn and the Roberts, we had some painting outside in the facade, the metal facades painted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1268.426s">It</a>  came out really good.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1270.603s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1271.664s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1272.966s">John,</a>  I remember last spring when I was talking about the flooring tile in some of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1278.231s">I</a>  don't know if it's just the cafeterias or the entrances. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1282.896s">Even</a>  at the high school, there were some questions about the entrance coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1287.361s">Could</a>  you just update us where we are with that?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1289.623s">We've</a>  been, the superintendent and myself have walked through the main entrance of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1294.908s">And</a>  we've talked about different things that we'd like to see, different things that we'd like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1299.071s">So</a>  we're pushing towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1302.574s">At</a>  the Brooks School, they had a lot of tiles that were out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1307.138s">Right</a>  at the end of the summer, we sent our cop, Frank Olson, down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1312.022s">He</a>  did a couple of rooms in a couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1314.624s">So</a>  it's another <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1318.814s">job</a>  that we're just going to keep chipping away at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1321.297s">We</a>  have plenty of tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1322.478s">You</a>  can find them anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1325.382s">The</a>  colors are standard, so we don't really have to worry about matching dye lots and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1330.888s">We're</a>  just going to keep chipping away.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1333.351s">I</a>  think we especially noticed it in the cafeterias?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1336.454s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1337.375s">Were</a>  they addressed at all yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1339.337s">The</a>  Brooks Cafeteria, last November, we did a lot, but there's still a lot too.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1346.844s">Was</a>  it the Columbus as well that had some missing?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1350.488s">I</a>  don't know if we hit the Columbus last year, but I think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1354.705s">We're</a>  going to stop making our way around, just to get back on track.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1361.387s">I</a>  know your list is very long, but it's just something that we remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1365.129s">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1366.309s">If</a>  it needs to be done, it needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1367.889s">We</a>  can work and get it done.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1371.284s">Just</a>  one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1372.204s">You</a>  just mentioned dye lots, and that hit upon another concern I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1376.967s">I'm</a>  really glad painting is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1379.868s">You</a>  mentioned the McGlynn in particular, but I was concerned because we spent hours and hours and days and months when we initially picked out colors, and I'm under the impression that there's no longer existing paint from the original project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1397.518s">So</a>  I just wondered what paint you used, how you match colors.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1400.68s">We</a>  have the colors, the original colors and the numbers, all on a spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1406.424s">So</a>  if I walk into a room and it's the white, I get the white.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1411.547s">And</a>  they still make them?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1413.429s">Yeah,</a>  they still make all those colors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1416.471s">So</a>  we try to, you know, they're obviously going to be a little fresher or a little brighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1421.014s">But</a>  yeah, we match them up to <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1423.956s">to</a>  the existing colors in the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1426.357s">And</a>  I think you'll see, too, up at the high school, that we're starting to incorporate some of the colors from those buildings up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1434.502s">Yeah,</a>  not the babyish colors, but the more adult colors, like the grays and the dark blues and yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1443.927s">Mr.</a>  Skerry? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1445.088s">John,</a>  were you able to</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1451.583s">succeed</a>  in getting any grants through Alicia Hunt to replace the lights in the cafeterias?</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1457.349s">Yes,</a>  she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1458.651s">She</a>  did get the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1460.893s">I</a>  think she's waiting for the contracts to come back.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1464.077s">If</a>  I could, we got the contract today and I think last <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1466.84s">spring</a>  I sent everyone a copy of what was in the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1469.723s">We</a>  received $250,000 from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1472.506s">And</a>  we're doing lighting projects throughout all of the schools as part of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1475.889s">In</a>  addition, some of the library is getting some lighting repaired as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1480.174s">And</a>  we just got a signed copy today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1482.776s">So</a>  work will be going out to bid very shortly.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1485.8s">>>:And</a>  the current stuff, so all the classrooms will get them in the current structure.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1492.611s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1493.532s">Thank</a>  you, John and the superintendent and the mayor for working on that and especially to Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1499.576s">I</a>  know I bothered her a lot last summer, but I'm glad it's... She does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1506.462s">And</a>  Kathy Medaglio too, just bringing things to our forefront that kids need and the colors that they need.</p>

    <p>[Mr. McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1516.269s">So</a>  system-wide we had all the parking lots repainted, all the stripes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1522.547s">which</a>  was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1523.888s">And</a>  I was working with Dr. Riccio on a bunch of projects over in the vocational school and over in Method High. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1532.474s">And</a>  working with Boyd Maloney, athletic director, we were able to refinish the Roberts, Columbus, and Brooks gymnasium floors this past summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1545.384s">And</a>  then, again, working with the mayor, Brian Kerins, and Steve Tanaglia, <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1550.738s">and</a>  Mike Nesta and Rob Poirier from the Department of Corrections, very instrumental in helping us get a lot done this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1561.366s">And</a>  then again at the bottom, Alicia Hunt, too, for the lighting project.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1568.912s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1569.772s">Are</a>  there any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1572.034s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1572.795s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1574.716s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1576.287s">So</a>  the rest of the packet on the opening is just some articles that we thought appeared recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1583.969s">We</a>  thought you might like to just have another copy of them or look at them if you haven't seen them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1588.451s">And</a>  again, new teacher orientation was held. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1593.312s">We</a>  put out some information about school brains, the new parent communication system that goes with our data management operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1600.735s">We</a>  had training today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1602.274s">on</a>  that with the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1603.255s">The</a>  athletic schedule is here, the meeting schedule is here, and the school calendar is here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1610.542s">So,</a>  happy to take any questions you have.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1613.264s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1615.186s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1616.867s">On</a>  the school committee meetings, I noticed that we have a meeting and it's listed December 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1622.713s">That's</a>  a Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1623.874s">I</a>  was wondering if that was a typo and possibly meant to be the 19th.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1627.857s">I'm</a>  sure it is and we'll correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1629.619s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1630.86s">Unless</a>  you want to come on the 16th and we'll be happy to hold a meeting for you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1633.863s">That's</a>  quite all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1635.324s">Also</a>  in your opening enrollment in our schools, that section of your beginning... Well, you know, it's still early because people have been coming in and, you know, until we actually see them arrive.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1647.296s">Because</a>  what you have is you have people coming and you have people going who don't tell us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1651.34s">So</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1652.1s">Will</a>  we have an updated calendar?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1653.722s">Yeah,</a>  you'll get a class size chart in our first meeting in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1659.388s">That'll</a>  give us enough time to really see whether people are going to be with us or go or what it really looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1664.855s">But</a>  it looks like we've got it under control. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1667.726s">People</a>  can come and go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1669.167s">So</a>  we'll see.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1670.308s">Also,</a>  I was wondering, and I know I asked for a lot of data, because it helps me understand what's going on in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1676.452s">The</a>  other piece is an update of the number of students attending before and after school, and how many staff members there are, and if there's a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1684.978s">So</a>  that way we can see where needs are in the future and just make adjustments throughout.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1690.362s">Again,</a>  when they actually show, we've got pretty good enrollments right now, but let's see what actually shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1695.949s">We</a>  are a little stressed on after school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1699.633s">It</a>  seems like as people get jobs, they leave that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1704.419s">So</a>  there's some turnover there, but everyone's working hard to make sure that that's done.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1710.703s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1711.443s">I</a>  know these fluid documents, and they'll change throughout the whole month of September, but it's just good to have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1717.765s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1719.065s">And</a>  if I see parents along the way, and they say, oh, I want to get into a morning program, I'll say, oh, it's almost full, so make your calls quickly, or it might be full. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1729.308s">It's</a>  good to have that knowledge.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1730.809s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1731.149s">To</a>  be able to pass along throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1733.71s">Also,</a>  we can see which areas we might have to switch staff to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1739.454s">If</a>  they're willing to do that, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1742.175s">I</a>  know hiring people for those positions is difficult.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1748.559s">I</a>  have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1751.52s">I</a>  wanted to know, I got some calls from some parents with the election on September 8th, where it's the first, you know, full week of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1759.924s">There</a>  are some concerned parents that, you know, there could be some security issues with the people coming in to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1769.106s">at</a>  the different elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1771.468s">Some</a>  of them are concerned enough that they don't want to send their children to school on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1776.731s">And</a>  they recall that, you know, usually schools close on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1782.736s">So</a>  what type of security and, you know, what will be done at the schools, Superintendent, just so that we can make the public aware?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1792.883s">So</a>  what we did was we certainly talked to <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1797.113s">our</a>  principals and also to Ed Finn, the city clerk, about the location of each polling station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1803.336s">Now</a>  at each polling station, there is a Medford police officer who will be assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1807.858s">So</a>  they will be there, and the entrance to and from will be reserved strictly for the people polling. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1814.88s">Students</a>  will not go through those entrances or exits, and the people will not be allowed into the buildings in any other way, unless they're coming there for a student as well as election, and then they have to sign in.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1826.577s">So</a>  there'll be a different entrance?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1829.159s">Each</a>  polling area will have its own entrance.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1833.141s">And</a>  the police will be on?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1833.942s">The</a>  police officer will be there.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1835.202s">On</a>  all day?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1836.283s">All</a>  day.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1836.583s">There'll</a>  be coverage even during the day?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1838.344s">Yes,</a>  they rotate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1838.845s">They're</a>  not there all the time, but they rotate.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1840.826s">Full</a>  coverage? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1841.366s">Okay,</a>  full coverage.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1844.288s">And</a>  I did speak to a few parents who called, and you know, someone might keep their youngster home for that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1850.752s">I</a>  understand some people are more concerned than others about that, but <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1854.468s">If</a>  we start breaking up the beginning of school, we lose all momentum this first couple weeks of school because of Labor Day and other things that come up.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1862.855s">Do</a>  you think we could have a robocall where just the night before a call could go out to all of the community letting them know that there will be police and there'll be separate entrances just so their parents are comfortable that their children will be safe in school that day?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1879.431s">I'm</a>  wondering whether or not if we wouldn't do something like a backpack express. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1883.332s">Sometimes</a>  robo calls kind of get people uptight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1886.612s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1887.413s">And</a>  if we send them a letter from the school saying how it's going to be set up, that might be an easier way for them to see it.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1895.154s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1895.674s">Okay?</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1896.054s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1896.474s">And</a>  could we also ask if Lisa would be able to do the MS blog?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1901.535s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1901.696s">A</a>  little note on that and then we can share that with the public.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1904.656s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1905.396s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1906.176s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1907.177s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1908.597s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1912.328s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1913.088s">I</a>  know that we have the calendar in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1915.591s">I</a>  just want to make it clear that last year, not last year, but the previous academic year, we had Monday nights designated for our meetings and our subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1926.562s">Are</a>  we also going to have that extra night during the week that we're going to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1932.102s">available.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1933.042s">So</a>  if we have subcommittee meetings, we know it's going to be Mondays and Wednesdays, Mondays and Thursdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1937.624s">Or</a>  how are we going to work it out?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1939.225s">That's</a>  an internal issue that we can determine on a committee by committee basis.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1943.787s">And</a>  the other thing is that since we are starting <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1948.104s">I'd</a>  like to request that we have Glenn Kutcher come from the MASC, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1954.832s">So</a>  that way he could go over the rules, regulations, and everything of what school board members are supposed to do and what our roles are all about.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1962.862s">I'm</a>  sure we can set that up.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1964.604s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1966.106s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1971.094s">The</a>  second item before you is the presentation and discussion of the capital plan proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1976.116s">And</a>  I guess before we get going on, the real details that are in this report is to keep in mind that this really is 100% wish list at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1985.321s">Once</a>  we get the list compiled from all the different departments of the city, then we'll be better able to decide which projects can go forward in which years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1994.345s">So</a>  this is a cumulative list of things that we know, we're aware of, that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2000.288s">But</a>  we will be fine tuning them as we proceed in this process.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2003.452s">These</a>  are some additional pieces of paper.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2011.822s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>
