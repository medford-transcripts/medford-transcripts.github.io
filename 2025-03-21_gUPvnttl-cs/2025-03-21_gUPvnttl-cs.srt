1
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:58,203
[SPEAKER_07]: The special meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:58,484 --> 00:00:59,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:01,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. O'Neill.

4
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:02,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

5
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:03,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

6
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:03,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Here.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:04,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Ritz.

8
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:05,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

9
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

10
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:05,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Stone.

11
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Here.

12
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:06,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

13
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:06,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Geary.

14
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:06,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

15
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:06,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

16
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:07,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Vandenbroek.

17
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:08,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

19
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:08,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Vandenbroek.

20
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:09,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

21
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven present, none absent.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,711
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now rise to salute our flag.

23
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

24
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:25,317
[SPEAKER_20]: The United Republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

25
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:38,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we start this meeting, we're all aware that we lost a very special Medford citizen this past weekend, John Jack McGlynn, and it was a heartache for this community.

26
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:45,168
[SPEAKER_07]: He was our former mayor and he certainly drove this city forward during the time that he spent leading this city.

27
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:50,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could all just take a moment of silence and dedicate this meeting in his memory, please rise.

28
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,313
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

29
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a special meeting of the Medford School Committee Monday, August 29, 2016 in the Library Resource Center at Medford High School.

30
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of the meeting are to discuss the following.

31
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Update report on the opening of the school year.

32
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:17,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Item number one, Mr. Superintendent.

33
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:23,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, you have a report in front of you.

34
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,849
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a preliminary report.

35
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,412
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, school opens tomorrow for grades

36
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:29,963
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 through 12.

37
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:35,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Kindergarten will come in next week on September 7th, on Wednesday.

38
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:47,028
[SPEAKER_00]: In preparation for the opening of school, administrators have been meeting all last week and all throughout the summer, hiring and reviewing necessary policies, protocols, and programs.

39
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:53,649
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also participated in meetings with our new teachers, staff, contractors to ensure they're off to a great start.

40
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Enrollment in the school is increasing.

41
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:06,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll reserve judgment on the need for maybe additional faculty or staff until we see who actually shows up in the first week or so of school.

42
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:11,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll calculate actual attendance at that time, which is typical practice for us.

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Transportation routes are posted online.

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,351
[SPEAKER_00]: We used Transfinder this year, our first time using that.

45
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:23,051
[SPEAKER_00]: As usual, adjustments are made during the first month to reflect actual ridership.

46
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:26,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working to consolidate at least one bus

47
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,843
[SPEAKER_00]: and possibly downsize one bus to a smaller vehicle heading to Minuteman.

48
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Security plans are in place.

49
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,848
[SPEAKER_00]: All schools have updated their plans and scheduled drills to practice the various response measures.

50
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:50,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attached a copy of a recent article which I sent you previously, but in case you didn't see it, on the bomb scares in Medford Public Schools and was in the American School Board's journal featuring Medford.

51
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:55,581
[SPEAKER_00]: A preliminary report on our summer maintenance and repair work has been included.

52
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:57,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. McLaughlin is here.

53
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:00,578
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot was done, a lot more will be done.

54
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:09,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight we'll discuss capital planning, which is another dimension of our building repairs and long-term improvement of our facilities.

55
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:14,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional work was completed in our buildings with the help of the vocational school faculty and staff.

56
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:20,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're awarding a new contract to cleaning service sometime this week.

57
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,032
[SPEAKER_00]: We've interviewed multiple vendors.

58
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:32,520
[SPEAKER_00]: We've narrowed it down to four individuals, four individual groups, and we should have a decision probably by tomorrow or no later than Thursday.

59
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:44,451
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on a new initiative that would have students, especially in the high school and the middle schools, adopt specific sections of their buildings for upkeep and improvement.

60
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:49,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like what you see in the islands around the city where you adopt an island and the like.

61
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,878
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have you some details on this initiative at a subsequent meeting.

62
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,019
[SPEAKER_00]: After school and before school programs are ready to go.

63
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand for these programs and services continues to grow.

64
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:04,021
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working hard to ensure that we have enough staff.

65
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:08,983
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little challenging as people come and go in this after school staff at the outset.

66
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:16,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people become available if they feel they don't have another type of job for themselves at this point in time.

67
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:21,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplies materials are on hand for the opening.

68
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,891
[SPEAKER_00]: New techs have been ordered and will be in place this month.

69
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:36,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Team Medford, Hallmark Health, and they'll be with us on the meeting at the 12th, along with Armstrong Ambulance and Staples, presented over $27,000 worth of additional school supplies to us this past week.

70
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:40,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Our athletic teams have been practicing and will be ready for their openings in September.

71
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,339
[SPEAKER_00]: A fall schedule is included in your materials.

72
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,440
[SPEAKER_00]: The marching band practices virtually every day.

73
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:50,105
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be very active in our games and other community events this year.

74
00:05:51,045 --> 00:06:08,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I've enclosed some additional articles that have been in the transcript and on our blog that highlight Medford school programs and in particular I put my first article into the transcript this week entitled standing up together for our Medford public schools and cover a lot of the things that went on and will go on in the public schools.

75
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:14,961
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had several meetings with the transcript in an attempt to try and develop a new relationship

76
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,863
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be positive for the transcript and for the public schools.

77
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:25,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll follow up with a report on the actual opening of our schools at a regularly scheduled meeting on September 12, 2016.

78
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:38,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we go to the next page, you'll see the typed copy of what was actually in the transcript on August 25th, listing many of the programs.

79
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,642
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting parts of this first part was that, you know, obviously I'm calling for parents to

80
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:53,389
[SPEAKER_00]: stay engaged with us and for us to work with them and to encourage their involvement and giving them ways that they can participate in your meetings and in conjunction with the school system.

81
00:06:54,149 --> 00:07:01,815
[SPEAKER_00]: We spoke to the faculty about a similar thing this week and we think that we're making that a serious priority going forward.

82
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read through this thing.

83
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:09,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've had opportunities to go through these things yourself and if you have any questions I'll be happy to comment on any of it.

84
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:20,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Over the weekend I've seen several phone calls from concerned parents in the elementary bus schedules.

85
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:28,553
[SPEAKER_19]: One parent was emphatic that the bus time for pickup for her child would not allow the bus and her child to get to school on time.

86
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there any truth to that or does it need to be tweaked?

87
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:36,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Will this rule be circulating throughout the community for the next couple of weeks?

88
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:44,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to know whether the buses are going to get there on time in the first week because in the first week a lot of people are still figuring it out.

89
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:48,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people arrive at the stops a little bit late.

90
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:50,938
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we schedule them to get there on time.

91
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,580
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Pat may have another view.

92
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:20,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We used TransFinder for the first time this year and in the past one of the parent complaints was that we were not posting pick up times just to start time.

93
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:25,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was our first attempt to give them a time that their child should be there.

94
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And we always say 10 minutes early the first two weeks of school.

95
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I've told everybody that I've responded to, those are only estimates.

96
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:36,646
[SPEAKER_04]: A computer program does not know our traffic, does not know our weather.

97
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:43,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as the buses get underway in the next two weeks, we'll review all those and we'll try and put a more accurate time down.

98
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course that will be affected by weather and traffic.

99
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:47,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

100
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,153
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to address the concerns of the parents.

101
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:52,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

102
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:53,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I responded to a lot of them.

103
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,875
[SPEAKER_19]: The phone calls keep coming from the same group.

104
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:56,295
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

105
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

106
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:09,317
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next part of the report has some materials on what was done in maintenance.

107
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,638
[SPEAKER_00]: John McLaughlin is here.

108
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:16,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't try to read through it all because you have it in front of you, but if you have a specific question, John is here.

109
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:20,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer some and John can answer anything else that you might have.

110
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:31,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions about what was done in buildings and grounds, more is going to be done.

111
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:36,547
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still working at things, but for the most part, we're very functional going into the school year.

112
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:38,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

113
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:38,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Conyo.

114
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:39,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

115
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, everyone.

116
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: If Mr. McLaughlin doesn't mind coming up.

117
00:09:49,414 --> 00:10:00,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have the report in front of us, and we know that the report is available to everyone, but is it possible, John, just to go over a few things that you've done so that way people are aware of what's been going on?

118
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:28,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so here at the high school, we did a lot of painting with the custodial staff, the nurses suite, three stairwells in C building, lecture halls two and three, in the car and near the pool area, and along with the fitness center, we did a lot of painting up in the fitness center.

119
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:36,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course we had the landscape project out front where we tore down 15 shrubs to try to tidy it up a little bit, the appearance of the front.

120
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Garland Roofing was here the last two weeks.

121
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:50,962
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing a scan of the roof to see if we can find out the longevity of the roof, see where we're at for the past couple of years.

122
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:54,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we had the bad winters.

123
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:59,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Some parts of the roof did take a beating from the shoveling.

124
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the ceiling over here in this back room, we removed that.

125
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,573
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to make a nice little space for meeting.

126
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,910
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to do lights and a new ceiling over here so that there's a nice little area over here for meeting.

127
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,654
[SPEAKER_12]: That was working with the superintendent.

128
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,141
[SPEAKER_12]: The backboard project that we're going to be doing in that high school

129
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,852
[SPEAKER_12]: is they're going to start the demo Wednesday.

130
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:30,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm assuming that that backboard project will be done by the middle of next week.

131
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:41,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was one of our key, key projects this summer, replacing six backboards up in the junior area with the basketball program.

132
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:49,978
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the McGlynn Middle and Elementary, we had a lot of painting done from the Department of Corrections.

133
00:11:50,998 --> 00:12:02,042
[SPEAKER_12]: The maintenance team went in there and went through all the sinks because we were fielding issues of leaky sinks and things like that.

134
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:07,964
[SPEAKER_12]: So they went through all the sinks and they replaced over 50 of the hot water cartridges.

135
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:13,927
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of times the cartridges creates the leaking sink.

136
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:17,348
[SPEAKER_12]: So they were down there most of the summer working on that.

137
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:27,449
[SPEAKER_12]: In working with Mayor Burke, we were able to replace some sidewalks at the Columbus and at the McGlynn.

138
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:34,332
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still working on it, replacing the curbing that has rotted out over the years from the winters.

139
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask a question about that?

140
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:38,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, Ms.

141
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Vanderhoof.

142
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you please tell us what you're replacing the curbing with?

143
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:52,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that was a higher cost item that was going to be looked at in terms of the capital improvement plan when we spoke about it last spring.

144
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:56,878
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm curious, since we've already seen that curbing had a problem,

145
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering what you're replacing it with.

146
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:06,982
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, the safety issue ones were the ones that we had to correct.

147
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:12,826
[SPEAKER_12]: As part of the capital improvements plan, yes, there's still more to be done.

148
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:24,712
[SPEAKER_12]: But we just wanted to make sure that anything where a kid could trip or create a safety hazard, we went down there to make sure that those were okay first.

149
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:26,053
[SPEAKER_14]: So how are we correcting it?

150
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:27,854
[SPEAKER_12]: We're replacing the curb.

151
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,578
[SPEAKER_12]: They're taking out all the curb and putting new ones in.

152
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:33,799
[SPEAKER_14]: But the same type of curb?

153
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:34,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

154
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,981
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a stronger material though.

155
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:37,062
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a stronger material.

156
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:37,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

157
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:42,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Because what, obviously my question is what's going to prevent that, the same thing from happening again?

158
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

159
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And I definitely thought we were looking at a different material completely, so.

160
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a little concerned about that.

161
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:51,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, when the time comes again, we should probably look into granite.

162
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:51,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

163
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,995
[SPEAKER_12]: And then our problems, we wouldn't have to worry too much about that.

164
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:55,956
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

165
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:59,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll discuss this, I guess, with capital improvement.

166
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So in essence, this is step one.

167
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

168
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,761
[SPEAKER_14]: A temporary fix.

169
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:04,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

170
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:10,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did a couple of sidewalk panels at the Columbus School, too, that were creating a hazardous condition.

171
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:13,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working down there as well.

172
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:27,524
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a site visit of a few different locations that were of serious concern, so we wanted to address those outside of the capital plan so that we felt that the children and parents and teachers were safe going in and out of the school.

173
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,867
[SPEAKER_07]: What's in the capital plan is above and beyond that.

174
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor Burke, Ms.

175
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:40,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Cunha, just while we're on that, I know that we have to repair them because of safety issues, and that's definitely something that has to be looked at.

176
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:48,555
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern, though, is that when we go into the capital planning, is that I just don't want to start seeing patches everywhere.

177
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,196
[SPEAKER_03]: and things starting to look old.

178
00:14:51,836 --> 00:15:08,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to patch it up and we're going to fix it, I totally understand and doing it now, but I also want to make sure that it looks the same when we go into the capital planning or if it's going to look the same as you repair it because I mean the cosmetic part of it

179
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:11,383
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be looked at, you know, looked at it too.

180
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:17,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to make sure everything just stays on page and that everything still looks as new as we possibly can make it look.

181
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:25,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of, I just don't want to go to any of the schools and start seeing, you know, like one curb looking this way and another curb looking another way.

182
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:33,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to refer to the Columbus, they went and they matched the paint because that concrete was treated with a stain.

183
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,163
[SPEAKER_07]: They went and matched it so that it would fit in with what's there already.

184
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did spend a lot of time trying to work on things not to make it look like it's just going to get it done.

185
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:44,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and that's one thing.

186
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,631
[SPEAKER_12]: No, aesthetically we would like to keep the aesthetics.

187
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:54,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you and your staff and everyone involved has done a tremendous job over the summer and I really thank you for that.

188
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:55,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of things.

189
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,083
[SPEAKER_03]: The carpet in the front where the community, not the community schools is, I apologize.

190
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,465
[SPEAKER_03]: The bathroom is where the pool is.

191
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:09,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we had put it in there temporarily, but it's still very bubbled up because it wasn't laid down properly when it was first done.

192
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:11,554
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's ready anyways.

193
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:23,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's ready for either to get pulled out and yeah because that is a safety issue because kids are walking on that and it keeps on rattling, not rattling, wrapping up that you can trip on it.

194
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,448
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to be careful because of the flooring.

195
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:26,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

196
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one and the other thing is that

197
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:36,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy to see the painting outside and the crosswalks and all that, but I'm looking still for my signs.

198
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the signs that say, like, slow down, school entrance?

199
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,437
[SPEAKER_03]: We need those signs.

200
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

201
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:51,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen them in different cities and towns, and it's just, I know that everybody, you know, we know that the school is here.

202
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,845
[SPEAKER_12]: We're actually looking to put some speed bumps in, too.

203
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:57,168
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I was... Especially up the vocational side.

204
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:59,370
[SPEAKER_03]: The vocational side, but the hill coming down.

205
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The temporary ones.

206
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

207
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:10,459
[SPEAKER_03]: The hill coming down is really... I've been out there many a times, especially at night during the summertime, and I know people always think it's the children.

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,803
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not the kids driving those vehicles that are spinning around that corner.

209
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:19,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And my concern, and that's been brought up many a times, so I'm happy that we're looking at it.

210
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:29,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, it's common sense, you see kids, you're in a school area, you're supposed to slow down, but if we could stop putting up the signs for it, it would be good.

211
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:37,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And the crosswalk up here, I hope people notice the artistic crosswalk that was put in for them from the Arts Council.

212
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:38,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks good.

213
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:50,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the Curtis Tufts School, high school, the DOC came in again and they painted all the classrooms on the top floor.

214
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:58,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And we were able to do some, we did a test of one of the rooms, stripping the varnish off the floor.

215
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,612
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll have to see it, it came out very nice.

216
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:06,016
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be looking to systematically go into all the classrooms.

217
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

218
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:17,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say thank you very much for devoting some time and attention there.

219
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you did it last summer, and again this summer.

220
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really grateful for all the attention.

221
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:29,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And that you and the superintendent, I think last year I had the superintendent walk the building three times with me.

222
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:33,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I let him off the hook this year, but I think I'm going down in September.

223
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he was down there too.

224
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,981
[SPEAKER_12]: We all did it again.

225
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:42,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Before the summer, we all came in, starting to formulate a plan.

226
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:43,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Chip away.

227
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,316
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll chip away at it little by little.

228
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:50,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my next priority down there is that room with the kitchen in it.

229
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to go down and visit that maybe in the next week or two if the superintendent has time.

230
00:18:55,862 --> 00:19:03,107
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe we can coordinate it so we can both be there at the same time, as well as the principal and the special education director.

231
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:15,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we were talking about maybe opening that room up again and taking down the wall and then working with it somehow like that, with the wall down.

232
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,777
[SPEAKER_12]: The wall isn't really aesthetically pleasing down there.

233
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:23,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can look at something like that so it could be done over a long vacation or something.

234
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we stop planning now, we might be able to do that throughout the school year.

235
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:29,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd really love to see that continue.

236
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:33,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a valuable property that the department owns.

237
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that the children there really benefit from having that school.

238
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:40,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say thank you for not forgetting about it.

239
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:55,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, I just want to request that when that happens all the school committee members are informed of when there might be an opportunity to view it so that it's not, so that we can all have access to that information.

240
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:09,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to piggyback on that and actually a couple of years ago we all had, we all made it a point that we had meetings that were set up to go and visit all the schools and look through all the schools.

241
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:23,126
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could do that and include the Tufts, you know, Curtis Tufts School and include all the rest of the schools and we could incorporate that into one of our meetings, our subcommittee meeting, so that way it gives everybody the opportunity to do it again.

242
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:32,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have walked into the schools separately, but if we're going to be looking at this and we're going to be looking at a capital plan that's coming up, I think it'd all be good if we're on the same page.

243
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:45,236
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the Columbus School, we had some roof flashing repaired last week, too, that was damaged from the winter.

244
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's at the Columbus.

245
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:53,795
[SPEAKER_12]: At the Roberts, Columbus, Andrews, and Brooks, we had the rug shampooed.

246
00:20:54,615 --> 00:21:00,780
[SPEAKER_12]: They hadn't been done for a while, so we sent them down to have them shampooed.

247
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:08,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, again, at the McGlynn and the Roberts, we had some painting outside in the facade, the metal facades painted.

248
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:10,047
[SPEAKER_12]: It came out really good.

249
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

250
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:12,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

251
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:18,131
[SPEAKER_06]: John, I remember last spring when I was talking about the flooring tile in some of the schools.

252
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:21,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's just the cafeterias or the entrances.

253
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:27,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Even at the high school, there were some questions about the entrance coming in.

254
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:29,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just update us where we are with that?

255
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,586
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been, the superintendent and myself have walked through the main entrance of the high school.

256
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:38,951
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've talked about different things that we'd like to see, different things that we'd like to do.

257
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,613
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're pushing towards it.

258
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:45,737
[SPEAKER_12]: At the Brooks School, they had a lot of tiles that were out.

259
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Right at the end of the summer, we sent our cop, Frank Olson, down there.

260
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:54,044
[SPEAKER_12]: He did a couple of rooms in a couple of days.

261
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:56,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's another

262
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:01,217
[SPEAKER_12]: job that we're just going to keep chipping away at.

263
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:02,438
[SPEAKER_12]: We have plenty of tiles.

264
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:03,640
[SPEAKER_12]: You can find them anywhere.

265
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:10,868
[SPEAKER_12]: The colors are standard, so we don't really have to worry about matching dye lots and things of that nature.

266
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:13,031
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just going to keep chipping away.

267
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:16,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we especially noticed it in the cafeterias?

268
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:16,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

269
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Were they addressed at all yet?

270
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:26,484
[SPEAKER_12]: The Brooks Cafeteria, last November, we did a lot, but there's still a lot too.

271
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:30,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it the Columbus as well that had some missing?

272
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:33,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if we hit the Columbus last year, but I think that, you know,

273
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:41,287
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to stop making our way around, just to get back on track.

274
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:45,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I know your list is very long, but it's just something that we remembered.

275
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

276
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:47,869
[SPEAKER_12]: If it needs to be done, it needs to be done.

277
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:48,950
[SPEAKER_12]: We can work and get it done.

278
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:52,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Just one more question.

279
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,607
[SPEAKER_14]: You just mentioned dye lots, and that hit upon another concern I had.

280
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really glad painting is taking place.

281
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:16,057
[SPEAKER_14]: You mentioned the McGlynn in particular, but I was concerned because we spent hours and hours and days and months when we initially picked out colors, and I'm under the impression that there's no longer existing paint from the original project.

282
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:20,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wondered what paint you used, how you match colors.

283
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,763
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the colors, the original colors and the numbers, all on a spreadsheet.

284
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:30,967
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I walk into a room and it's the white, I get the white.

285
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:33,389
[SPEAKER_14]: And they still make them?

286
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they still make all those colors.

287
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:40,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So we try to, you know, they're obviously going to be a little fresher or a little brighter.

288
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:42,655
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, we match them up to

289
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,737
[SPEAKER_12]: to the existing colors in the buildings.

290
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:53,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you'll see, too, up at the high school, that we're starting to incorporate some of the colors from those buildings up here.

291
00:23:54,502 --> 00:24:03,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, not the babyish colors, but the more adult colors, like the grays and the dark blues and yeah.

292
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:04,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Skerry?

293
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,689
[SPEAKER_12]: John, were you able to

294
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:16,428
[SPEAKER_19]: succeed in getting any grants through Alicia Hunt to replace the lights in the cafeterias?

295
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:18,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, she did.

296
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,713
[SPEAKER_12]: She did get the grant.

297
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I think she's waiting for the contracts to come back.

298
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:26,720
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could, we got the contract today and I think last

299
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,683
[SPEAKER_07]: spring I sent everyone a copy of what was in the application.

300
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We received $250,000 from the state.

301
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're doing lighting projects throughout all of the schools as part of that money.

302
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:39,413
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, some of the library is getting some lighting repaired as well.

303
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just got a signed copy today.

304
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So work will be going out to bid very shortly.

305
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,823
[SPEAKER_12]: >>:And the current stuff, so all the classrooms will get them in the current structure.

306
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

307
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, John and the superintendent and the mayor for working on that and especially to Alicia.

308
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:06,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I bothered her a lot last summer, but I'm glad it's... She does a great job.

309
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:14,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kathy Medaglio too, just bringing things to our forefront that kids need and the colors that they need.

310
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:19,772
[SPEAKER_12]: So system-wide we had all the parking lots repainted, all the stripes.

311
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,147
[SPEAKER_12]: which was good.

312
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:30,393
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was working with Dr. Riccio on a bunch of projects over in the vocational school and over in Method High.

313
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:44,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And working with Boyd Maloney, athletic director, we were able to refinish the Roberts, Columbus, and Brooks gymnasium floors this past summer.

314
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:49,667
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, again, working with the mayor, Brian Kerins, and Steve Tanaglia,

315
00:25:50,738 --> 00:26:00,465
[SPEAKER_12]: and Mike Nesta and Rob Poirier from the Department of Corrections, very instrumental in helping us get a lot done this summer.

316
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:05,309
[SPEAKER_12]: And then again at the bottom, Alicia Hunt, too, for the lighting project.

317
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:09,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, John.

318
00:26:09,772 --> 00:26:10,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other questions?

319
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:12,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

320
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:13,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, John.

321
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:15,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Superintendent.

322
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:22,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rest of the packet on the opening is just some articles that we thought appeared recently.

323
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:27,671
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought you might like to just have another copy of them or look at them if you haven't seen them.

324
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:31,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, new teacher orientation was held.

325
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We put out some information about school brains, the new parent communication system that goes with our data management operations.

326
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,615
[SPEAKER_00]: We had training today.

327
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,235
[SPEAKER_00]: on that with the teachers.

328
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:50,461
[SPEAKER_00]: The athletic schedule is here, the meeting schedule is here, and the school calendar is here again.

329
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So, happy to take any questions you have.

330
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

331
00:26:55,186 --> 00:26:55,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

332
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:02,152
[SPEAKER_06]: On the school committee meetings, I noticed that we have a meeting and it's listed December 16th.

333
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:03,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Friday evening.

334
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if that was a typo and possibly meant to be the 19th.

335
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it is and we'll correct it.

336
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:10,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?

337
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you want to come on the 16th and we'll be happy to hold a meeting for you.

338
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite all right.

339
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:26,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Also in your opening enrollment in our schools, that section of your beginning... Well, you know, it's still early because people have been coming in and, you know, until we actually see them arrive.

340
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:30,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you have is you have people coming and you have people going who don't tell us.

341
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So

342
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we have an updated calendar?

343
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:39,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'll get a class size chart in our first meeting in September.

344
00:27:39,388 --> 00:27:44,815
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give us enough time to really see whether people are going to be with us or go or what it really looks like.

345
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:46,456
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks like we've got it under control.

346
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,607
[SPEAKER_00]: People can come and go.

347
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.

348
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:56,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I was wondering, and I know I asked for a lot of data, because it helps me understand what's going on in the schools.

349
00:27:56,452 --> 00:28:04,938
[SPEAKER_06]: The other piece is an update of the number of students attending before and after school, and how many staff members there are, and if there's a waiting list.

350
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:10,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way we can see where needs are in the future and just make adjustments throughout.

351
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:15,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when they actually show, we've got pretty good enrollments right now, but let's see what actually shows.

352
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:19,353
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a little stressed on after school staff.

353
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:24,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like as people get jobs, they leave that program.

354
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,925
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some turnover there, but everyone's working hard to make sure that that's done.

355
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

356
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:37,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I know these fluid documents, and they'll change throughout the whole month of September, but it's just good to have an idea.

357
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:38,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

358
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:49,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I see parents along the way, and they say, oh, I want to get into a morning program, I'll say, oh, it's almost full, so make your calls quickly, or it might be full.

359
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:50,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to have that knowledge.

360
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:51,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

361
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:53,129
[SPEAKER_06]: To be able to pass along throughout this community.

362
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we can see which areas we might have to switch staff to different schools.

363
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,455
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're willing to do that, who knows?

364
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I know hiring people for those positions is difficult.

365
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one question.

366
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to know, I got some calls from some parents with the election on September 8th, where it's the first, you know, full week of school.

367
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:27,188
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some concerned parents that, you know, there could be some security issues with the people coming in to vote.

368
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:30,547
[SPEAKER_09]: at the different elementary schools.

369
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:36,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them are concerned enough that they don't want to send their children to school on that day.

370
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:42,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And they recall that, you know, usually schools close on election day.

371
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So what type of security and, you know, what will be done at the schools, Superintendent, just so that we can make the public aware?

372
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:55,485
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we certainly talked to

373
00:29:57,113 --> 00:30:02,775
[SPEAKER_00]: our principals and also to Ed Finn, the city clerk, about the location of each polling station.

374
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:07,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at each polling station, there is a Medford police officer who will be assigned.

375
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:14,820
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will be there, and the entrance to and from will be reserved strictly for the people polling.

376
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:25,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Students will not go through those entrances or exits, and the people will not be allowed into the buildings in any other way, unless they're coming there for a student as well as election, and then they have to sign in.

377
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'll be a different entrance?

378
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:30,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Each polling area will have its own entrance.

379
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:33,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And the police will be on?

380
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,182
[SPEAKER_00]: The police officer will be there.

381
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:36,123
[SPEAKER_09]: On all day?

382
00:30:36,283 --> 00:30:36,563
[SPEAKER_00]: All day.

383
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,324
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be coverage even during the day?

384
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:38,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they rotate.

385
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,766
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there all the time, but they rotate.

386
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:41,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Full coverage?

387
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, full coverage.

388
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:50,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did speak to a few parents who called, and you know, someone might keep their youngster home for that day.

389
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:53,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand some people are more concerned than others about that, but

390
00:30:54,468 --> 00:31:02,114
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start breaking up the beginning of school, we lose all momentum this first couple weeks of school because of Labor Day and other things that come up.

391
00:31:02,855 --> 00:31:18,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think we could have a robocall where just the night before a call could go out to all of the community letting them know that there will be police and there'll be separate entrances just so their parents are comfortable that their children will be safe in school that day?

392
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:22,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering whether or not if we wouldn't do something like a backpack express.

393
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes robo calls kind of get people uptight.

394
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:26,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

395
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:34,654
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we send them a letter from the school saying how it's going to be set up, that might be an easier way for them to see it.

396
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:35,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

397
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:36,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?

398
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:36,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

399
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:41,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And could we also ask if Lisa would be able to do the MS blog?

400
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:41,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

401
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:44,436
[SPEAKER_09]: A little note on that and then we can share that with the public.

402
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:45,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

403
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:45,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

404
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

405
00:31:47,177 --> 00:31:47,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

406
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:48,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

407
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick question.

408
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we have the calendar in front of us.

409
00:31:55,591 --> 00:32:06,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make it clear that last year, not last year, but the previous academic year, we had Monday nights designated for our meetings and our subcommittee meetings.

410
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:10,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we also going to have that extra night during the week that we're going to make it

411
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:12,662
[SPEAKER_03]: available.

412
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have subcommittee meetings, we know it's going to be Mondays and Wednesdays, Mondays and Thursdays.

413
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how are we going to work it out?

414
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an internal issue that we can determine on a committee by committee basis.

415
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:26,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is that since we are starting

416
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:34,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to request that we have Glenn Kutcher come from the MASC, please.

417
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:42,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way he could go over the rules, regulations, and everything of what school board members are supposed to do and what our roles are all about.

418
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:44,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we can set that up.

419
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

420
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:46,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

421
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The second item before you is the presentation and discussion of the capital plan proposals.

422
00:32:56,116 --> 00:33:04,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess before we get going on, the real details that are in this report is to keep in mind that this really is 100% wish list at this point.

423
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:13,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we get the list compiled from all the different departments of the city, then we'll be better able to decide which projects can go forward in which years.

424
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:19,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a cumulative list of things that we know, we're aware of, that we need to address.

425
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:23,432
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will be fine tuning them as we proceed in this process.

426
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:25,875
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some additional pieces of paper.

427
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:32,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Superintendent.

428
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:42,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, the mayor has been working hard with her staff to create a capital plan for the city.

429
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:50,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And the school system was asked to create our own capital plan based on our best estimates and judgment as to what we needed.

430
00:33:51,026 --> 00:34:00,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally, the mayor wants each of you to have the opportunity to review what's in this document so that you can either add, subtract, or modify

431
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:12,813
[SPEAKER_00]: what's here as she continues with her plan to present something that's a system-wide plan to the city and the city council would obviously have to approve any kind of bonding.

432
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:20,575
[SPEAKER_00]: As we do capital plans, there are four basic functions and we prioritize based on that basis.

433
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:21,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Health and safety.

434
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:25,196
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a health and safety issue, we'd want to address that as early as possible.

435
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:30,838
[SPEAKER_00]: A functional need for the operation of the schools, something that would keep us from operating the school.

436
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:36,360
[SPEAKER_00]: The third would be something of educational value, and the last would be a cosmetic improvement.

437
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:48,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Albeit, sometimes things are all of the above, or two or more of the above, but we try to at least deal with health and safety and functional needs first to the extent possible.

438
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:53,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Each project should be reviewed with an eye towards an alternative source of funding.

439
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just passed out

440
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,272
[SPEAKER_00]: some information about something coming through MSBA on technology and DESE.

441
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:04,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoke to MSBA again today and DESE to get some latest information.

442
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:17,584
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect that an RFP will come out of DESE and MSBA in the next few weeks, and then we'll be able to respond more formally to any kind of technology investment that's involved.

443
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,371
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be scheduled in ways that reduce or eliminate disruption.

444
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,413
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did the science labs, you can see obviously we had to move a lot of people around.

445
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:44,058
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do anything that affects classroom space, we try to do it in a way that eliminates disruption or at least reduces it and doesn't impact operations to the greatest extent possible.

446
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:53,695
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be scheduled to reflect emergent or anticipated legal and as well as educational requirements.

447
00:35:54,215 --> 00:36:03,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things we have to do legally, for example, this year at the beginning we put in another ramp into the Caron Theater to meet the handicap requirements.

448
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:07,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things like that would be necessary to consider.

449
00:36:09,427 --> 00:36:13,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposed project solicitance report based upon our best current cost estimates.

450
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,771
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been rounded out.

451
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:15,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't try to get to $210.26.

452
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:24,744
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's $200,000, it's $200,000, and it could be $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, more or less, one way or another.

453
00:36:26,826 --> 00:36:32,351
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a preference for combining certain projects in any given year that could produce a preferred economy.

454
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first step is obviously for you to review it.

455
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:41,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we broke it out by school, and we broke it out in five years.

456
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:42,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at

457
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:50,014
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools, you'll see that there's year one projections, year two projections, year three projections, year four and year five projections.

458
00:36:50,494 --> 00:37:03,302
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a piece for technology as the last item, and it's broken up into instructional technology and network technology, as well as district-wide and equipment needs.

459
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:10,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to break it out in categories that were easy to understand and to give us a sense of how we would distribute.

460
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as the mayor points out,

461
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:14,724
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a preliminary list.

462
00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:18,467
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intended to get the conversation going to keep you involved.

463
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:28,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the same token, it's still aspirational at this point, and a lot depends on what other needs exist in the city and what other things can be done through alternative source of funding.

464
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:40,487
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to begin by thanking Pat for putting the technical side of this all together and working very hard with other school officials with John and others to identify

465
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,450
[SPEAKER_00]: what we thought we needed, sat down and went over it.

466
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:49,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the city's Procurement Officer Schaub for her work in trading ideas with us.

467
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:54,936
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an individual sheet for each project or each area, so you can look at that as well.

468
00:37:55,796 --> 00:38:07,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having said all of that, Madam Mayor, I think we're ready to take any feedback, and I would suggest we go school by school, go down the list, and if you see something that you think isn't there,

469
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:13,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And let us know, and if you see something that you don't think deserves attention, let us know.

470
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:17,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think we're not spending enough of the mayor's money, then let us know.

471
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're happy to spend money, we like to spend money.

472
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:23,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

473
00:38:23,152 --> 00:38:36,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Van der Kloot, so, you know, obviously it makes sense to go through this tonight, but I think that as a committee member, my expectation was that we would be visiting the schools and walking them and looking at them perhaps more intensely.

474
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:37,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's my first comment.

475
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:49,257
[SPEAKER_14]: My second comment is when we hit, if you just kind of look at some of the money in the columns, you know, a lot of the, I always thought that if we were going to do a capital improvement plan,

476
00:38:49,997 --> 00:39:00,403
[SPEAKER_14]: We would be putting more money in year one and not waiting until year four to get to playground surfacing or some of these other things, which we've talked about for quite a long time.

477
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,326
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm a little surprised at how they're skewed so late.

478
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:11,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I could, I didn't put this package together, the school department did, but obviously we've been looking at it.

479
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have to realize that under Prop 2.5, there's only so much that we can raise through property taxes.

480
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:25,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So to the extent that we're not able to get MSBA funding on any of these projects, then obviously the burden falls to the city.

481
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:30,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have to afford this along with other needs throughout the entire community.

482
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:35,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So until we have everything put together, the years really aren't relevant at this point.

483
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:40,025
[SPEAKER_07]: The funding, what we can support is what's gonna drive how much we can do.

484
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:43,560
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't going to drive what we can support.

485
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:46,123
[SPEAKER_07]: What we can support will drive what we can do.

486
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:48,305
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only way it can work.

487
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:51,328
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only a pie of money that we can spend, so.

488
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if I can, you know, the playgrounds are functional.

489
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:59,408
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be beautiful because of the, you know, the rips in it.

490
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:01,889
[SPEAKER_00]: We can patch them and make them functional.

491
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:10,051
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things that we need to do because the building air quality or safety factors would be far more significant.

492
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's why this is a discussion.

493
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:17,394
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you would feed in and say, you know, I think that's more of an issue than you thought it was an issue.

494
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:21,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, we try to spread it out so that as the mayor points out,

495
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:30,528
[SPEAKER_00]: As she goes over what her needs are citywide, that there's some distribution across a time frame that's believable financially.

496
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:33,991
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's all interchangeable.

497
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're here talking.

498
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:37,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

499
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:38,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuno.

500
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of things.

501
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:46,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the superintendent said that everyone sat down during the summer and went over a lot of this and that's how you came up with the list.

502
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:51,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you sit down with like each and every principal of each school and that's what it was kind of their wish list?

503
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just from the site council reports that we got last, you know, last spring?

504
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how did, how did it really come about?

505
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,934
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we get site council reports.

506
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:03,635
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at those.

507
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:09,342
[SPEAKER_00]: John McLaughlin is obviously involved in every school with buildings and repairs and things of that type.

508
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:12,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat and I have seen any number of requests over a period of time.

509
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:16,167
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also been conscious of things we have to do.

510
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:27,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the vocational school, we know when we did a compliance audit that we know we have to change the door handles on doors to stay compliant because of their handicapped accessibility.

511
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:31,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to take all the pieces of information that came from multiple sources

512
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:35,727
[SPEAKER_00]: We met with principals at the end of the school year, we've talked to them since.

513
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:39,189
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get input from virtually everybody.

514
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:46,372
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm sure different people would have different priorities because obviously, if it's theirs, it's a higher priority than if it's someone else's.

515
00:41:47,426 --> 00:41:52,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is that again, I just wanna keep in mind, I know that this is definitely a wish list.

516
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:57,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that a lot of the things that are on here will be accomplished.

517
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:08,532
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to go back to the comment that you just made to the superintendent, is that I know it's not to always beautify everything and we have to do things that are necessities.

518
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have to always keep in mind is that

519
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: When these schools were built, and the refurbishing of a lot of the things that we're doing in the high school, is that we still always want to make them look as best as possible.

520
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,420
[SPEAKER_03]: People are still out here, including myself.

521
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I always joked around, and I said that the new schools are always going to be addressed as the new schools.

522
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:33,739
[SPEAKER_03]: until another school is built.

523
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:42,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this high school was always the new high school, and it's still considered the new high school for some people, and it was built 45, 40 some years ago.

524
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:51,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that that is a promise that I know we as school committee members, I know the mayor, even before being in the position that she is in now,

525
00:42:52,290 --> 00:43:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: has always made the commitment to the city is that we want to make sure that what we have stays as pretty and as new as possible because we know we're not going to have those finances down the road to start building new schools.

526
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:08,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though that we're fixing and building, I want to make sure

527
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's not patchwork again, and I know it's been reconfirmed that we're not going to do that.

528
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also want to make sure that when someone comes through your doors, it's like if you're at home.

529
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:27,101
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you need to fix, you know what you want to do, but you also want to make sure that your home always looks beautiful.

530
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:31,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to make sure that we deal with that too.

531
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:32,366
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

532
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:33,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

533
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:33,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone?

534
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:47,909
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to add, if we could put the signage, because I remember Dr. Perella, when all the principals said their wish list, that he just wanted unified signage.

535
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,992
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's in another budget, or if that got nixed.

536
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:57,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, signage is probably more of an operating budget item, you know, unless it were major pieces of signage.

537
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,519
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in general science, we do that through operating budgets.

538
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that in the plans?

539
00:44:01,982 --> 00:44:04,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we'll sit down with Dr. Perella and find out what he has in mind.

540
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information on that?

541
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:07,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Ms.

542
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:07,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Columbo.

543
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:18,548
[SPEAKER_03]: That I'm on the site council for that, and that was something that we discussed as the site council, but we knew it was part of the operations, and there is work going on and process going on that that was definitely something that we were going to do.

544
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:27,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily the capital planning, but it is internal processing, and as far as I know, that was something that was still being looked at and something that was going to be accomplished this year.

545
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:31,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

546
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:32,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

547
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:41,718
[SPEAKER_06]: As I sit here and look at this list and then look around this room, there is something obvious missing from this list.

548
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,218
[SPEAKER_06]: The libraries.

549
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:51,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So I encourage everybody to look around and request that the Method High School library upgrade be added to this list.

550
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought we were going to have to go through the list.

551
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:56,926
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a parent I'd like to speak to.

552
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like to step forward please?

553
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:04,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a quick question.

554
00:45:04,311 --> 00:45:05,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Your name please?

555
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:06,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Carolyn Montella.

556
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:09,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a question about the library.

557
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:20,363
[SPEAKER_08]: When I came to the meeting with the superintendent in the spring, I've been in the school year, there was a beautiful plan for the library and I was very impressed but I was wondering is that

558
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:21,828
[SPEAKER_08]: going to take place?

559
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:24,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed like a great hub for the students.

560
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were semi-finalists and we didn't become finalists.

561
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:45,517
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe the poor judgment on the part of the Jobs Foundation, but nevertheless, you know, the idea is still there and the enthusiasm in the school is still there, but the funding that we had hoped for that particular source is not there for us right now.

562
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:49,138
[SPEAKER_00]: But there may be some other source of funding that we can look at and

563
00:45:50,308 --> 00:45:51,448
[SPEAKER_00]: But that funding is not there.

564
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:57,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So until that happens, Mr. Superintendent, can we add that to this list, please?

565
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:59,332
[SPEAKER_00]: We can certainly add the library as an item.

566
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:03,133
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, you know, what do we want to, what do we project for that?

567
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we'd have to do a little bit of homework on.

568
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:07,555
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big place.

569
00:46:08,175 --> 00:46:09,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends what we want to do.

570
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:12,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Furniture would be involved.

571
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:14,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly rugs, ceilings, lighting.

572
00:46:14,798 --> 00:46:16,298
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major expense.

573
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:19,940
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would estimate just off the top, we're talking at least a million dollars.

574
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:38,954
[SPEAKER_14]: As I look down the list, perhaps I thought we were going to read through the list first, but one of the questions that pops out to me is skateboard area deconstructed and modular units installed.

575
00:46:40,273 --> 00:46:52,142
[SPEAKER_14]: and you know we've not discussed that, why are we installing modular units, why would we be doing that, why is it on a priority list, etc.

576
00:46:52,582 --> 00:47:08,914
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you know this is the beginning of a capital plan and there's a lot of things on here we probably haven't fully discussed but internally we're aware of things that should be done from our standpoint so the idea with modular units is that space at the high school is becoming premium

577
00:47:09,613 --> 00:47:14,037
[SPEAKER_00]: and more and more programs are being developed at the vocational school and other activities.

578
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:23,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, the thought was if we can recapture the skateboard park, we may want to build on what is the skateboard park now for a certain number of programs.

579
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:34,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be a very interesting way for us to expand our programming while at the same time using space that right now is badly used in my opinion.

580
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:45,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so I don't even know how to address all of that in the context of this plan right now because there's many, many different questions embedded in that.

581
00:47:46,555 --> 00:47:54,657
[SPEAKER_14]: So I see it as one of the things that administration has put down on this capital planning list.

582
00:47:55,338 --> 00:48:05,461
[SPEAKER_14]: But as a school committee member sort of understanding that the whole impetus or urgency or not or whatever, that's just simply not clear at this time.

583
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:11,524
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try and say it this way, because I think this is probably the best way to, because we're going to go through this question over and over again.

584
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:17,188
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably a lot of things that you haven't, as a committee, envisioned because you don't live it every day.

585
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:21,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other things you would know about, or think about, or hear about that we haven't thought too hard about.

586
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:24,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you just mentioned the library, we thought maybe, you know.

587
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:25,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be some back and forth.

588
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:34,318
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a final document, but this is a preliminary planning document to get your input, to see what kinds of concerns either you have for

589
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:37,869
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion or deletion so that we can move forward.

590
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:43,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we move forward, then we would clearly detail each of our items.

591
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:45,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward also, remember,

592
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:53,612
[SPEAKER_00]: once year one goes or year two goes, it may be that year three, four, and five change dramatically after year one and two because of other considerations.

593
00:48:53,672 --> 00:48:55,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plan.

594
00:48:56,354 --> 00:49:00,417
[SPEAKER_00]: A plan is subject to change, is subject to modification all the way through.

595
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:10,323
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an attempt to try and lay out what we see and what might be possible and challenge us to think about what could be to our advantage.

596
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:27,419
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could, I think your suggestion of visiting each school and going through the list that's here and then all of us deliberating at these public meetings at schools, then we can determine a priority list amongst what's here and what isn't here.

597
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:32,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And that might be more beneficial than us just throwing why this, why that.

598
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:34,522
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be much more helpful to handle it that way.

599
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go back on the module units, and I'm not going to get myself fixated on this, but just to try to figure out where we're going, I mean, we had so many students up at the school for so many years, I mean,

600
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:58,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to throw out a question like I know it's going to come to us, you know, from parents that are in the city.

601
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,302
[SPEAKER_03]: We came to this high school and we had a thousand students in each class.

602
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:05,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the mayor and myself were part of that.

603
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:13,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And so times that by four, we had 4,000 students up here and we had enough room for a lot of the things that we did.

604
00:50:13,728 --> 00:50:18,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to wrap my brain around why is it now that we don't have enough room.

605
00:50:19,012 --> 00:50:28,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's more offices set up, and I understand that there is different developed programs that maybe we have now that we didn't have previously.

606
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,743
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you could just work on that a little bit.

607
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:35,245
[SPEAKER_00]: When this high school was built, there were over 25 schools in the school district.

608
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:39,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they were smaller, they housed any number of things.

609
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:40,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was the Forest Street complex

610
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:45,398
[SPEAKER_00]: which has the office of the superintendent and a number of other programs as well.

611
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:53,039
[SPEAKER_00]: As we consolidated down those programs, you know, I mean those spaces get pushed into other areas, that's one.

612
00:50:53,439 --> 00:50:57,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, special education has grown exponentially.

613
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,661
[SPEAKER_00]: ELL has grown exponentially.

614
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:04,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Other mandated programs that we have put in place that didn't previously exist have grown exponentially.

615
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:06,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Our vocational school has expanded

616
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:21,468
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially in terms of programs so we're doing more with the space we have and we have less total space than we had years ago so clearly you know it's not the same ballgame that it was when

617
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:24,699
[SPEAKER_00]: this building housed, I don't think we ever got to 4,000, but about 3,600, 3,700.

618
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,802
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we exaggerated a little because it sounded really good, you know, back then.

619
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:37,526
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the reality was is that, and also back then, there was open campus, if you remember, and not everybody had a room every day.

620
00:51:37,946 --> 00:51:42,649
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were, you know, didn't have a class, you might have been in the cafeteria, you weren't in the classroom.

621
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:56,721
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of factors that would mitigate against these things, and plus the fact, too, that there's specialized areas now, occupational therapy, vision testing, things of that type that we didn't have back then.

622
00:51:58,322 --> 00:52:02,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the clarification, because I know that's definitely going to be something that's going to be asked around in the city.

623
00:52:03,768 --> 00:52:24,778
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, again, if we're thinking of modular units, and we're thinking of putting them where the skateboard area was, I guess, I just don't want a picture like, I've seen how other cities and towns are building their schools, and then all of a sudden, they've built their school that they don't have enough students, and they don't have enough space for their students, and I see these trailers and things.

624
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to see anything like that happening.

625
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things you need to do is assume the early iterations of some, let's say, modular classrooms

626
00:52:33,705 --> 00:52:34,786
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe look like trailers.

627
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:38,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some that looked a little bit like a trailer.

628
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:44,014
[SPEAKER_00]: There were more wooden structures at the Davenport, at the Fulton, and places like that at different times in history.

629
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:49,678
[SPEAKER_00]: But today's modular classrooms, you wouldn't know the difference just from the outside.

630
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:54,202
[SPEAKER_00]: What they can do today is prefab housing, prefab buildings.

631
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:56,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.

632
00:52:57,305 --> 00:53:00,247
[SPEAKER_00]: They slap them up, and they put them together very nicely, and they're durable.

633
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:04,389
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've got steel and they've got other things in them that are more expensive, to be sure.

634
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:08,913
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can easily be put up and they do create legitimate space.

635
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:16,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day of the trailer-like modular classroom has gone away.

636
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:25,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to make clear that if that's where we're going to go, not that I'm saying that we are, it's that type of building that I'd like to see.

637
00:53:25,446 --> 00:53:26,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.

638
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:28,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto?

639
00:53:28,594 --> 00:53:33,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to make a motion that we move this to a committee of the whole with site meetings.

640
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:38,722
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to move this to a committee of the whole and have site meetings at each of the locations.

641
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Mr. Scari.

642
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,445
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

643
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:41,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

644
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:42,906
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

645
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

646
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:45,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

647
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:54,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So Madam Mayor, if we could maybe take a few second breaks so we could prepare for the next activity and we get the first candidate in.

648
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:18,865
[SPEAKER_00]: In your packets you have a job description, you have some sample questions, you have some questions you can ask, and you have the resumes of each of the finalists in this position.

649
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,908
[SPEAKER_00]: As I indicated to you in a cover letter,

650
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:27,850
[SPEAKER_00]: There were well over 20 individuals who applied for this position, some of whom did not have appropriate credentials.

651
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:29,892
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked the job.

652
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:37,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some other people who had credentials, but reference checks and other things had us eliminated from Chrome.

653
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:43,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some people who actually declined after they thought about it for various reasons or took a position elsewhere.

654
00:54:44,503 --> 00:54:47,024
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think this evening we have three very fine individuals.

655
00:54:47,724 --> 00:55:08,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process for those of you who have not done it before, the veterans who have done it before as we've had interviews of this type, is that we ask our candidate to give us a little bit of information about themselves, to tell us a little bit of why they think they should be our Director of Finance and Administration.

656
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:13,815
[SPEAKER_00]: We then go around the room and give each of you a chance to ask one or two questions, and then maybe a second round.

657
00:55:15,097 --> 00:55:21,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll allow our candidate to give us a little summation, perhaps answer something that wasn't asked or perhaps clarify something that was asked.

658
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:29,062
[SPEAKER_00]: So this evening, then afterwards, we'll have an opportunity to discuss other particulars after all the candidates have been interviewed.

659
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:37,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent just before we start the interviews I think at this point we really need to recognize the work of Pat Bailey.

660
00:55:38,146 --> 00:55:41,228
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been just a fabulous addition to the school department.

661
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: The things that she has introduced to us and streamlined processes.

662
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just an amazing woman Pat and we're very lucky to have had you.

663
00:55:49,152 --> 00:55:54,134
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to miss you desperately but we wish you the best when you relocate with your family.

664
00:55:54,634 --> 00:56:09,020
[SPEAKER_07]: and we fond memories go, fond thoughts are always being thrown your way so we wish you the best of luck and we will miss you.

665
00:56:12,461 --> 00:56:16,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the appropriate thing to say is that we appreciate her very much and so we're not going to let her go.

666
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:20,344
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to tie you up and we're just going to keep you here because we need you.

667
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:21,964
[SPEAKER_14]: You've just been so fantastic.

668
00:56:22,805 --> 00:56:23,365
[SPEAKER_14]: We adore you.

669
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:30,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, our first candidate this evening is Christine Patterson.

670
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:36,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Christine is currently at vocational school, the South Middlesex Vocational School.

671
00:56:37,363 --> 00:56:41,724
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been there for approximately seven years, previously at Blackstone Vocational.

672
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:53,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask Christine to come up and say hello to everybody and we'll introduce yourself and we can then begin the process.

673
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:12,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kirsten, you're here and obviously I'm glad you're here.

674
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:21,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself, what you've done and why you believe you'd be a great candidate to be Medford's new Director of Administration and Finance.

675
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:26,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, after that fond farewell, it's been a big shoot.

676
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:30,560
[SPEAKER_10]: So that makes me a little more nervous speaking this evening.

677
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:40,566
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do feel that my background, my career, has a lot of value to offer a district such as Medford here.

678
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:46,029
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm excited for the opportunity to work in a larger city environment.

679
00:57:46,249 --> 00:57:49,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have specialized regional and vocational technical

680
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:52,672
[SPEAKER_10]: background over 20 years.

681
00:57:52,813 --> 00:57:56,795
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I think that translates to many different projects.

682
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:06,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I've worked with MSBA projects from expansion renovations, roof projects, obvious budget issues, and the like.

683
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:10,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm also a non-traditional U.S.

684
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:13,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Navy veteran, so I have a fond place for the vocational trades.

685
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:26,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're going to go around the room and we'll take questions and we'll start off with our senior members, Paula Van de Kooten.

686
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:27,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, welcome.

687
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:34,936
[SPEAKER_14]: So you just heard us talk about capital planning and putting together a capital planning plan.

688
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:42,102
[SPEAKER_14]: What experience do you have in doing something similar and what were your thoughts as we were discussing it?

689
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:49,660
[SPEAKER_10]: very thoughtful comments and questions going around the room so that was some good feedback to hear.

690
00:58:50,381 --> 00:59:01,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously the capital plan is just that, it's a plan and sometimes things creep up and take priority that have to be addressed that were on the wish list but

691
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:06,498
[SPEAKER_10]: some safety issue ends up surfacing that becomes more relevant.

692
00:59:06,558 --> 00:59:08,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's always a consideration.

693
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:24,628
[SPEAKER_10]: But the plan is always to ensure that there are resources involved that will address those capital improvements going forward so that there are safety nets in place and the improvements of the district are addressed each year.

694
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:33,334
[SPEAKER_14]: You've already seen we're talking a bunch and we all have our own concerns and agendas.

695
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:37,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously you would report to the superintendent.

696
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:40,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're here too and we're very interested in what's going on.

697
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:53,650
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you handle that balance for the need of school committee members who approach you for information, which we do with Pat all the time, versus your report to the superintendent?

698
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:55,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, absolutely.

699
00:59:55,353 --> 01:00:06,196
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have a boss that we report to directly, but we also have a board that is the greater community at large, and that's important for considerations as well.

700
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:12,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody has concerns, and obviously the superintendent would be taking those into consideration as well.

701
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:20,740
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's important and notable to take everybody's concerns, and sometimes they're made in a

702
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:26,129
[SPEAKER_10]: a walk down to the lunchroom that isn't heard and it's important to get that.

703
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:27,830
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you do if you disagreed with him?

704
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:41,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that's healthy in any capacity and sometimes that just creates a broader conversation and some perspective that might not have been seen or addressed the first time around.

705
01:00:41,976 --> 01:00:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.

706
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I get another one or is that it?

707
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's keep it moving.

708
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:49,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin Evans Carey Jr.

709
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:51,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for coming.

710
01:00:51,975 --> 01:01:00,334
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you see as the most challenging part of coming here to Medford, leaving your environment into an urban environment?

711
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:04,768
[SPEAKER_19]: a lot of things, a lot of balls in the air at the same time.

712
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:14,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, I think that goes without saying for a school business official, finance person, you wear many hats and you have to change them quickly and swiftly.

713
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:24,512
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would say the biggest factor for me would be to engage in each of the schools themselves.

714
01:01:25,472 --> 01:01:49,636
[SPEAKER_10]: making those connections with the principals, the assistant principals, to understand and hear what their concerns are, to be effective and understand how the budget is built and driven, and I think that's best done going right to the source, seeing the buildings, seeing what their concerns are, and really trying to understand their needs as well.

715
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:52,357
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a diverse community here in Medford,

716
01:01:53,778 --> 01:02:00,203
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the strongest things that we do for our kids is every child gets a chance to get bused to school.

717
01:02:00,964 --> 01:02:03,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Once in a while buses aren't on time.

718
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:09,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Parents think that the busing is not benefiting their child.

719
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:16,560
[SPEAKER_19]: current capacity, have you had any opportunity to deal with sometimes irate parents?

720
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:24,272
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you work your norm to handle the situation and keep everybody on the same level, playing field, calm and collected?

721
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:31,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it's being able to empathize and help neutralize the issue at hand.

722
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:42,747
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's truly something that is going on, you want to take note of their concerns and let them know that you will be following up with them, that you will be looking into the situation.

723
01:02:42,787 --> 01:02:44,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it may not be addressed

724
01:02:45,650 --> 01:03:02,599
[SPEAKER_10]: as quickly or the direct method that they may have in mind, but you certainly can do your best and reach out to all sources regarding that issue and assist to the best of your capacity.

725
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:05,420
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vice Chairperson of the School Committee, Erin DiBenedetto.

726
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:06,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

727
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:08,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to Matt Finney.

728
01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:16,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, some of my questions have already come forward, like how would you disagree with the superintendent?

729
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,119
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very strong and he knows.

730
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:26,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But you would also learn a lot from him because he has a long history of knowledge and of the community as well as this role.

731
01:03:27,324 --> 01:03:29,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And he works very closely with this position.

732
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:36,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the last year and a half that Pat's been here, I don't even know how long exactly.

733
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:40,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years, two months, three months?

734
01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:42,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Really feels like a minute.

735
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:56,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But Pat was really able to streamline a lot of our payment structures from community schools to after school programs to the lunch program.

736
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:01,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have experience in some of the systems that she just newly put in place?

737
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:06,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them not directly, but implementing new systems?

738
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:07,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, absolutely.

739
01:04:07,675 --> 01:04:14,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I was instrumental in spearheading many technology projects throughout my current district.

740
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,761
[SPEAKER_10]: We are completely cloud-based.

741
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:25,526
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have a need for server rooms on-site, so we were able to realize some significant savings in that capacity.

742
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:27,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Technology is

743
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:37,497
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our world, so we have to be able to address it and live within it and be able to engage.

744
01:04:37,797 --> 01:04:39,119
[SPEAKER_10]: And it helps.

745
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:41,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Initially, it's a challenge.

746
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:47,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It's difficult going through those growing pains of the maintenance and the implementation and the rollout of a certain

747
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:56,275
[SPEAKER_10]: technology project, however, once it's in place and things are being utilized, everybody loves it.

748
01:04:56,555 --> 01:05:01,420
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, the chatter stops so you know it's working and things are going well.

749
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:12,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And another thing I noticed by watching Pat in the last few years is that she works closely with the finance department of the city.

750
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any experience with that?

751
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:15,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct in assuming that?

752
01:05:16,214 --> 01:05:16,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

753
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:19,497
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any experience with that?

754
01:05:19,577 --> 01:05:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I know with regional schools, I'm sure you've worked with multiple cities.

755
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:24,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

756
01:05:24,982 --> 01:05:25,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

757
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:30,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, in a regional setting, it's town-based, but it's multiple towns.

758
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:34,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wouldn't be just one town department.

759
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,471
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be multiple.

760
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:36,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Currently, we have five.

761
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:45,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have worked with each of those town administrators, the CFOs, and or town accountants and treasurers in each of those capacities.

762
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: So there has to be that level of coordination.

763
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:58,144
[SPEAKER_10]: transparency and working openly with the member towns, communities, which would translate to the city, City Hall.

764
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:19,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know our specific city was looking at changing some of the way the budget is and maybe even a new program, I don't know if it's citywide or schoolwide, so we can see more details of a budget and I'm hoping that you, rather than going to a journal entry to understand

765
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:22,226
[SPEAKER_06]: like an item on the budget.

766
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:29,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you worked with that type of system and any experience rolling like it over with the city at the same time?

767
01:06:29,972 --> 01:06:43,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I've done several software conversions for the financial accounting program that drills down to itemized entries within an account number, crosswalking it across many funds, obviously the

768
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:50,204
[SPEAKER_10]: governmental accounting is going to be a little different working tied in with the City Hall side.

769
01:06:50,264 --> 01:06:53,625
[SPEAKER_10]: However, as a municipal, we are one in the same.

770
01:06:53,665 --> 01:06:57,646
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the school district and we are the sixth member town, if you will.

771
01:06:57,726 --> 01:06:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So we handle everything from start to finish.

772
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:13,330
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've seen that process from implementation and rollout to monitoring compliance and reporting out to the member towns as they needed and as our annual budget process to go

773
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,090
[SPEAKER_06]: through each line item.

774
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at times I'm very specific.

775
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:21,372
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a big line item for our thing, I'm like, well, what did we buy with that?

776
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:22,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what did we spend on that?

777
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:27,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the way it is now, we have to look at journal entries to find out the fact.

778
01:07:27,873 --> 01:07:31,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a lot that I end up not pushing further.

779
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:37,795
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's differently handled, then I might ask for those type of, I like a lot of data.

780
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:39,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Data is good.

781
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:41,936
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find out a lot of information from that.

782
01:07:41,956 --> 01:07:45,738
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes you are limited by the capacity of a software program.

783
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:53,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them can be a little bit dated and not able to maneuver specific areas.

784
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So that has to be taken into consideration.

785
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:59,122
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, a financial software overhaul is a huge expense.

786
01:08:02,427 --> 01:08:09,996
[SPEAKER_10]: timely process that takes about a year to really roll out and be efficient and effective.

787
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:17,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is a complex project that I would assume wouldn't be the first item on my agenda to

788
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:19,686
[SPEAKER_10]: begin.

789
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:24,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's on the city's capital plan, I'm hoping, but... It is.

790
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:26,648
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a grant right now that we're looking at.

791
01:08:27,248 --> 01:08:32,269
[SPEAKER_07]: We signed the compact with the governor's office to review all of our financial products.

792
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:33,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

793
01:08:33,129 --> 01:08:34,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's being reviewed as we speak.

794
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:35,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

795
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:36,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Ann Marie Cuno.

796
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:37,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

797
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, thanks, Ms.

798
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Patterson, for being here and thank you for your service.

799
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:47,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading your resume and it says that your budget exceeds $20 million.

800
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the largest budget you have worked with?

801
01:08:52,056 --> 01:09:01,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked with a $36 million expansion renovation project at my former district, Blackstone Valley Vocational and Technical School.

802
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:05,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just for the project itself and then we also had the operating budget.

803
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:12,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously City of Medford has a substantially higher budget for their school department.

804
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:17,113
[SPEAKER_10]: However, when you're in accounting and finance there's a couple extra zeros on the end.

805
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,775
[SPEAKER_10]: You're monitoring the same activities, the same

806
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:24,834
[SPEAKER_10]: items, so that really is not an issue for us.

807
01:09:26,155 --> 01:09:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

808
01:09:27,216 --> 01:09:39,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you, when you mentioned the project that you worked on, again, I know it was in a similar, maybe similar, but it was a lesser scale, as we're discussing tonight about our capital planning.

809
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:46,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So could you maybe compare a little bit of what you have worked on compared to what you think we're going to be working on?

810
01:09:47,397 --> 01:09:54,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the large-scale project was prior to the changes that the MSBA had, so that was a little bit different.

811
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:57,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples.

812
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:03,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I did an accelerated roof project just two years ago that was just that.

813
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:12,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It was within 18 months we had to get the funding, we got MSBA approval, and we were able to complete the project within two years.

814
01:10:12,662 --> 01:10:15,325
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are different types of projects.

815
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:31,539
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they're on the same spectrum of getting that state funding, the MSBA approval, and or getting outside resources in order to engage with your contractor and begin a large-scale project such as that.

816
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,782
[SPEAKER_10]: But the oversight, the monitoring,

817
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:40,244
[SPEAKER_10]: accounting of those projects, I was hands-on the entire time.

818
01:10:40,924 --> 01:10:43,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so basically that's what I was going to ask you.

819
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:45,586
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of a financial director are you?

820
01:10:46,066 --> 01:10:51,528
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanted to explain to us what a daily day routine would be for you.

821
01:10:51,628 --> 01:11:02,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it changes day by day, but the main basis of the way you work with the district you're in or with the district that you're going to be in, if you want to share that with us.

822
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:10,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the finance director has a myriad of responsibilities and areas that

823
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:22,739
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as you walk in the door and have an idea of what your day is going to look like, things happen, and you have to be flexible and maneuver with those priorities.

824
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:27,960
[SPEAKER_10]: As I indicated, I am a hands-on finance director.

825
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got an accounting background, MBA.

826
01:11:30,801 --> 01:11:33,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I've worked every single role of the business office operations.

827
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:38,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no problem jumping in and helping out and assisting when we need to.

828
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,829
[SPEAKER_10]: to identify and maintain coverage across training.

829
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:52,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's all very important so that the team maintains stability for the department and everything can continue to run even if there's a hiccup somewhere else.

830
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:53,780
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

831
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:54,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Cassie Gretsch.

832
01:11:55,581 --> 01:11:56,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Ms.

833
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:56,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson.

834
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:57,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice to meet you.

835
01:11:58,221 --> 01:11:59,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your service.

836
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:01,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And your resume was really excellent.

837
01:12:01,722 --> 01:12:02,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoyed reading it.

838
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:11,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So I read in the resume that at the South Middlesex Vocational Technical, you had the in-house payroll.

839
01:12:12,265 --> 01:12:21,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to know what your thoughts were about getting used to a different payroll system, the conference payroll, and what you would do to get accustomed to it.

840
01:12:22,049 --> 01:12:26,573
[SPEAKER_09]: to get familiar with it or are you familiar with it and maybe you could share that.

841
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:31,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, in my prior district we did outsource payroll for a time.

842
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:41,829
[SPEAKER_10]: We did bring in the financial software package that enabled us to take on that role internally and save funding in that capacity.

843
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:50,682
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same processing in terms of timesheet entry, reporting, getting it in the correct classifications, correct fund codes.

844
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:54,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of you get to hand off to an outside vendor.

845
01:12:55,206 --> 01:13:01,350
[SPEAKER_10]: At one point, they get to cut the checks and send it back, where we actually do all the check cutting, check processing.

846
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:06,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do online email verification for direct deposit slips.

847
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is the cloud-based function that we've taken on.

848
01:13:11,858 --> 01:13:19,405
[SPEAKER_10]: the payroll itself start to finish is something that I've done and have no issue with turning it over to a third party.

849
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:20,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh great.

850
01:13:21,227 --> 01:13:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did have another question.

851
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:26,231
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be similar to some of the other questions.

852
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of the same questions.

853
01:13:28,173 --> 01:13:30,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really kind of going through my notes here.

854
01:13:30,995 --> 01:13:32,357
[SPEAKER_09]: So have you ever had to

855
01:13:33,678 --> 01:13:36,580
[SPEAKER_09]: attend a school committee meeting, speak before the school committee.

856
01:13:38,342 --> 01:13:39,123
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, it's fine.

857
01:13:39,143 --> 01:13:42,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just curious if you've ever been to a meeting.

858
01:13:42,846 --> 01:13:43,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

859
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:45,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I attend every single meeting.

860
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:49,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I attend the finance committee meetings for the member towns and I

861
01:13:51,113 --> 01:14:03,143
[SPEAKER_10]: been in place in front of the town meetings for the annual budget and or project renovations when we've had to go out and get approval or additional funding for those capacities.

862
01:14:03,203 --> 01:14:08,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have been at the town hall in that capacity.

863
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:09,407
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

864
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:09,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

865
01:14:10,788 --> 01:14:12,549
[SPEAKER_00]: We have much time.

866
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:16,870
[SPEAKER_17]: So Pat's here very early in the morning and often very late at night.

867
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know you don't live in Medford yet.

868
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:23,812
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't know how you'll handle your commute or have you thought about the commute?

869
01:14:23,852 --> 01:14:25,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, absolutely.

870
01:14:25,512 --> 01:14:31,894
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have commute, whether it's walking steps out the door or getting in our car and driving to work each day.

871
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:39,337
[SPEAKER_10]: When you love what you do and you care about the end result and you want to be around the people that you work with, it just becomes a ride.

872
01:14:41,453 --> 01:14:49,279
[SPEAKER_17]: And then grants, have you, could you just talk about, it says a million dollar grants, what grants are, what departments of private government?

873
01:14:49,379 --> 01:15:05,992
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a majority are entitlement grants, so the Title I, the IDEA, the Special Ed, we do have some small private grants, the Perkins vocational, but a lot of those federal grants are drying up, so it seems to,

874
01:15:06,732 --> 01:15:18,777
[SPEAKER_10]: be more relevant to go outside of that window and try to find other opportunities and engage with community membership if you can and look at all the resource availabilities out there.

875
01:15:21,571 --> 01:15:22,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Madam Mayor.

876
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:24,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Mr. Superintendent.

877
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:29,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you describe in a little greater detail your procurement experience?

878
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:45,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if in earlier interviews they explained that we're centralized procurement officers at City Hall, but it is always helpful to have the school department that can take the ball and kind of take it almost to the end zone.

879
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:51,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was wondering if you could describe your procurement experience and maybe some of the projects that you've worked on.

880
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:52,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

881
01:15:52,419 --> 01:15:57,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I have procurement experience going back to the military training.

882
01:15:57,361 --> 01:16:01,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did contract writing for U.S.

883
01:16:01,864 --> 01:16:09,168
[SPEAKER_10]: government Navy ships, but currently I work for, or I've completed the MCPPO training courses.

884
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:12,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been certified several times within those capacities.

885
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:16,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I had just recently done the building expansion procurement workshops.

886
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:24,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And I write the actual procurement documents for the major contracts that we have to do, that we send out to bid.

887
01:16:25,476 --> 01:16:33,640
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's overseeing compliance and opportunities within different cohorts and consortiums where we can

888
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,701
[SPEAKER_10]: jump on some joint purchasing.

889
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:49,672
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always helpful to know what other avenues there are if you're in a quick situation where you need to ensure that your compliance is met and you need to get some procurement done.

890
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:53,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you part of the project team for the major construction projects that you were?

891
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:54,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

892
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:55,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you were.

893
01:16:57,287 --> 01:16:59,749
[SPEAKER_07]: We spoke a little bit about bus scheduling, I think, earlier.

894
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:03,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you take care of that at your current district, or is it left to someone else?

895
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:12,557
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus schedule itself is delineated through some assistant principal that actually works with the student addresses.

896
01:17:12,677 --> 01:17:16,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have 13 routes currently that run.

897
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:20,382
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's an issue or a parent complaint, I would certainly

898
01:17:20,882 --> 01:17:24,745
[SPEAKER_10]: get that and I would work with the contract provider in that capacity.

899
01:17:25,486 --> 01:17:37,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not create the routes and go through the day-to-day addresses of the families coming in, but it's overall compliance and oversight of that contract itself.

900
01:17:37,995 --> 01:17:38,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

901
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Ann Marie Cugno, second round.

902
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:50,485
[SPEAKER_14]: My question was actually going to be on the mayor's follow-up question, which is if we had a situation where here in the city of Medford your role would be part of

903
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,441
[SPEAKER_03]: the transportation.

904
01:18:04,961 --> 01:18:16,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we have a parent that calls you and says, you know, this particular bus is overcrowded and no one's getting on or we're having a situation, what would you do in that situation?

905
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:28,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I recognize that there's a new software package that's been implemented, the Transfinder program that is implemented and is built to really identify some of those issues.

906
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:43,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, I would go to our district source who's monitoring those buses and really take a look, if it meant sit on a bus and really see what the counts are and make sure that that's

907
01:18:44,228 --> 01:19:04,577
[SPEAKER_10]: what's occurring so that we make sure that we're utilizing the buses in the correct capacity and that there isn't as much overflow and or to look for additional resources if it's needed if that's truly an issue and or to be able to work with the company to look at diversifying the schedule if that's what's needed.

908
01:19:05,517 --> 01:19:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

909
01:19:06,298 --> 01:19:07,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing one question?

910
01:19:07,238 --> 01:19:07,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

911
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:08,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

912
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:09,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that my question?

913
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:30,270
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess I'm going to go back to the superintendent school committee relations and I'm going to ask you what your expectations of both the superintendent and the school committee is and and how you've worked with them in your previous positions.

914
01:19:31,112 --> 01:19:39,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, I think as a finance position school business official, the biggest concern would be open communication.

915
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:43,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's key, it's important to be able to do my job effectively.

916
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:47,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's helpful all around, open communication.

917
01:19:48,530 --> 01:20:01,019
[SPEAKER_10]: expectation and our hope from Superintendent Belson will be mentoring some leadership, understanding the district at large, knowing that he's had such a long career here.

918
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:02,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's key and important.

919
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:12,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Working with the committee, again, transparency and being as open and helpful as possible for any questions or concerns that they may have.

920
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,321
[SPEAKER_10]: with regard to budget, finance, any of the operations that come through.

921
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:22,803
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, have you seen our budget books, like for the budget for this school year?

922
01:20:22,883 --> 01:20:23,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Not for FY17.

923
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:26,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I have reviewed prior budgets online.

924
01:20:27,905 --> 01:20:33,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And is it similar, was it similar in your previous position that you would put together, be responsible for

925
01:20:34,447 --> 01:20:49,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Making sure that book was that budget was presented to the school committee absolutely and overseeing every line item each and every line item It was developed and reviewed by myself and including salaries looking at these

926
01:20:49,704 --> 01:21:10,221
[SPEAKER_10]: teacher schedules, ensuring that the steps lanes were incorporated within that budget moving forward each year and being able to present every component within that budget to the school committee if middle managers were not able to do so or not available to speak to their own department.

927
01:21:10,661 --> 01:21:17,426
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it would always roll up through myself in that budget development process.

928
01:21:17,527 --> 01:21:17,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

929
01:21:19,662 --> 01:21:21,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go back to me and myself.

930
01:21:22,646 --> 01:21:24,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm good.

931
01:21:24,688 --> 01:21:27,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're good, but you have a question.

932
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:29,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.

933
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:29,833
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

934
01:21:29,853 --> 01:21:30,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy, how about you?

935
01:21:31,675 --> 01:21:32,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have one question.

936
01:21:32,997 --> 01:21:34,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in regards to the bus schedule.

937
01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:40,184
[SPEAKER_09]: What if a parent called you up or even a neighbor that was near

938
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:44,347
[SPEAKER_09]: a bus stop that the person was very unhappy with the bus stop.

939
01:21:44,387 --> 01:21:49,389
[SPEAKER_09]: This happens and they want the bus stop moved as soon as possible.

940
01:21:50,870 --> 01:22:05,797
[SPEAKER_09]: That is an ongoing concern that comes up every year where people who don't have children going to school live near a bus stop and they're just not happy with the bus being in their vicinity.

941
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:08,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So what would you do about something like that?

942
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:09,159
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you approach

943
01:22:10,195 --> 01:22:11,095
[SPEAKER_09]: that person?

944
01:22:12,076 --> 01:22:34,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Well again the first step would be to help diffuse their concern and bring a greater light so that they understand that there's limitations to the city itself and buses can stop at only certain places for the safety of children and most likely they might have had children that went through the schools at some point as well.

945
01:22:35,145 --> 01:22:39,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to be mindful of that and obviously

946
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:48,508
[SPEAKER_10]: just try to reassure them that things will smooth out and or if there's any way to look at a different route.

947
01:22:48,548 --> 01:22:54,869
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it is not necessarily going to happen just as each person wants it individually.

948
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

949
01:22:58,970 --> 01:22:59,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Erin DiBenedetto.

950
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:01,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Superintendent.

951
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,412
[SPEAKER_10]: So how many people do you currently supervise?

952
01:23:06,552 --> 01:23:13,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I currently have aid within my department, and I oversee the food services as well, so there's an additional aid.

953
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:17,339
[SPEAKER_10]: We do, again, our own payroll in-house, start to finish.

954
01:23:17,399 --> 01:23:18,280
[SPEAKER_10]: We do procurement.

955
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:22,483
[SPEAKER_10]: We do our own food service, scratch cooking.

956
01:23:23,063 --> 01:23:26,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So we oversee every capacity of operations.

957
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:40,491
[SPEAKER_10]: We work with facilities, we do our own plowing, we do our own, I do the utility contracts and negotiating with the power companies in order to maximize our rates for year to year.

958
01:23:41,592 --> 01:23:45,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Each of those areas is under my umbrella and oversight.

959
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:55,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you have eight people that do all of that work combined with yourselves?

960
01:23:55,507 --> 01:23:56,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

961
01:23:57,748 --> 01:24:01,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And in your office, like your immediate office, how many?

962
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:02,810
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three of us.

963
01:24:05,912 --> 01:24:12,215
[SPEAKER_06]: And does your office also do accounts receivable and accounts payable as well?

964
01:24:12,295 --> 01:24:12,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

965
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:21,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody thinks the summer we shut down and go off to Aruba, but we still have to pay the bills and get payroll done.

966
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:23,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're always there.

967
01:24:23,136 --> 01:24:28,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually work at a school, so I'm aware of that.

968
01:24:29,298 --> 01:24:33,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many years of experience do you have supervising that many people?

969
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:47,600
[SPEAKER_10]: direct supervision in my current role was seven years prior to that I was the assistant business official at Blackstone Valley where I oversaw the business office staff as well and again I have been

970
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:56,166
[SPEAKER_10]: well-versed in each of those areas to understand and know what each capacity requires.

971
01:24:56,226 --> 01:24:57,847
[SPEAKER_10]: We did a lot of building rental.

972
01:24:58,267 --> 01:25:02,028
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of outside programs that we do service for communities.

973
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:10,209
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of receivables that are unique in a vocational school that are not part of a comprehensive.

974
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:13,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So there were many different sorts

975
01:25:15,097 --> 01:25:22,422
[SPEAKER_10]: accounts receivable that we have to track, maintain, student payments, all of those as well.

976
01:25:23,363 --> 01:25:36,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're transferring a lot of our payments, like, for example, our lunch program was upgraded a few years ago, and that's going smoothly, and people can pay online now.

977
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:43,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we're recently doing community schools and rentals of our buildings, and we're switching that over.

978
01:25:44,582 --> 01:25:49,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting the word out to people and making sure that follow-up is going to happen.

979
01:25:50,065 --> 01:25:54,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we'll get an update of how that conversion went very soon.

980
01:25:56,589 --> 01:26:03,772
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just how I hinted what I like to have, just so you get used to it.

981
01:26:06,414 --> 01:26:10,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes this doesn't go easily, and people don't realize it.

982
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:13,878
[SPEAKER_06]: A mindset's been a certain way for many, many years.

983
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people don't like to change quickly.

984
01:26:18,511 --> 01:26:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So how would you address that?

985
01:26:21,712 --> 01:26:24,273
[SPEAKER_06]: And how would you handle community pushback?

986
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:36,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that's evident in every school department in the Commonwealth, that we've done things this way for so many years.

987
01:26:36,198 --> 01:26:36,959
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels right.

988
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:38,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't mess with it.

989
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:39,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just leave it alone.

990
01:26:40,642 --> 01:26:45,806
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the world we live in now, we really have to look at some of those changes.

991
01:26:45,906 --> 01:27:02,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And although change is difficult and sometimes can be uneasy for the team or the staff, my role would be to ensure that they understand why we're doing something, how we're doing it, how they will be able to

992
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:14,930
[SPEAKER_10]: improve their efficiency as well and learn from the process and be more effective in that community outreach and be more effective in helping those students and the teachers get what they need faster.

993
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:17,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a difficult challenge.

994
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:24,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I was the second person hired in my current district from the outside ever in 40 plus years.

995
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:29,174
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did a financial software conversion year two.

996
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:36,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was a necessary process that had to be done.

997
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:39,076
[SPEAKER_10]: It was green screens that were obsolete.

998
01:27:39,136 --> 01:27:42,538
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no more service on those.

999
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:50,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So as painful as it was to implement that, everybody came on board and understood that

1000
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: the change had to take place.

1001
01:27:52,947 --> 01:27:58,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been very beneficial so far after that initial conversion.

1002
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:04,192
[SPEAKER_10]: The staff and the team love it because now they can see their payroll online.

1003
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:07,233
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have to wait for a stub in the mail.

1004
01:28:07,393 --> 01:28:11,395
[SPEAKER_10]: So good things come out of difficult challenges.

1005
01:28:11,755 --> 01:28:14,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how we have to roll with that.

1006
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:15,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1007
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:15,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Robert M. and Skerry Jr.

1008
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:23,263
[SPEAKER_19]: During your professional career, have you initiated any in-service training for the people that you supervise?

1009
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:24,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, absolutely.

1010
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:40,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I encourage my team to identify some areas that they think they might need additional training, such as Excel spreadsheets and or pivot tables, and to really work at bringing in some direct

1011
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:54,518
[SPEAKER_10]: resources so that we affect the whole team and it's not, sometimes it's something specific that they have to go off-site or they have to go to direct training, especially specialized areas such as payroll.

1012
01:28:55,579 --> 01:29:01,284
[SPEAKER_10]: However, we've done some in-service for almost team building, if you will, to get

1013
01:29:03,575 --> 01:29:10,182
[SPEAKER_10]: some just positive growth for some support staff that we were looking at.

1014
01:29:10,242 --> 01:29:19,252
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, looking at those skill sets and being able to offer some direct resources so that they're able to improve their skill set as well.

1015
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:28,120
[SPEAKER_19]: How would you generate a sense of ownership among your employees and keep their morale high, especially the people you supervise?

1016
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:29,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1017
01:29:29,561 --> 01:29:38,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important to recognize every individual's strengths and compliment them on what they're doing.

1018
01:29:40,092 --> 01:29:41,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a thankless job.

1019
01:29:42,353 --> 01:29:48,477
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not seen very often, certainly not by the students that we serve for the most part.

1020
01:29:49,077 --> 01:29:54,160
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a very important role within the business office structure.

1021
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:04,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And just obviously mentoring and being a partner for them and their growth and helping identify their career path as well and being a partner for them.

1022
01:30:05,026 --> 01:30:07,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, I've got a diverse background.

1023
01:30:08,948 --> 01:30:21,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have more to learn, and I've got things that I want to learn that they can offer in their different capacities, and I think that that's a reciprocation that's important, and to let them know that that's what I'm here for.

1024
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:37,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not here to upset the apple carton and cause hate and discontent and major change, but to work with you, be able to understand what you do in your role and your capacity, so that I can help assist you in your growth and or step in

1025
01:30:37,894 --> 01:30:42,639
[SPEAKER_10]: to hold things together, if need be.

1026
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:51,728
[SPEAKER_19]: What role do you see the school committee secretary playing in helping you run affairs efficiently?

1027
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:59,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've never had that direct contact, so that would be quite a... We get to sign the bills every week.

1028
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:27,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that would be a great way to really give you an understanding of how everything functions and operates from the very basics of they need pencils, papers, googly eyes at the elementary school and how does that transfer over and recognizing that that's part of the budget piece and this is where that roll-up takes place.

1029
01:31:27,574 --> 01:31:28,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that would be

1030
01:31:30,465 --> 01:31:34,467
[SPEAKER_10]: more of the conversation building and transparency in that capacity.

1031
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:36,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1032
01:31:36,147 --> 01:31:36,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Mayor.

1033
01:31:37,568 --> 01:31:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: How many unions are you currently involved with?

1034
01:31:40,469 --> 01:31:41,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We have three.

1035
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers?

1036
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:47,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Secretarial and custodial.

1037
01:31:47,472 --> 01:31:54,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Are your teachers paid on a 10 month basis or every union 12 months, 52 weeks?

1038
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:59,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers have the option to have a summer pay or a lump sum.

1039
01:31:59,985 --> 01:32:04,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so similar to what we have, and you're familiar with different pay cycles and all of that.

1040
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've also sat at the bargaining table as well?

1041
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:13,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, not in this current ongoing, but the prior contract negotiations, yes.

1042
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:15,554
[SPEAKER_10]: directly involved.

1043
01:32:15,634 --> 01:32:29,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Each capacity finance director is involved to some degree with regard to building those schedules, looking at the ideas that have come forth from the negotiation table and putting a dollar value on that.

1044
01:32:29,492 --> 01:32:30,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Great idea.

1045
01:32:30,765 --> 01:32:31,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1046
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:34,270
[SPEAKER_10]: What software are you currently using for finance?

1047
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:36,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We use Infinite Visions.

1048
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:37,954
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Tyler Tech.

1049
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:41,138
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a municipal financial software.

1050
01:32:41,158 --> 01:32:46,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's under the umbrella with Munis and similar type packages.

1051
01:32:46,726 --> 01:32:48,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever used admins?

1052
01:32:51,797 --> 01:32:52,017
horrible.

1053
01:32:52,977 --> 01:32:53,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It's horrible.

1054
01:32:53,798 --> 01:32:54,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not.

1055
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:55,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1056
01:32:56,498 --> 01:32:56,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Get ready.

1057
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:01,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sounds like there's something in place for.

1058
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being reviewed right now.

1059
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:13,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we have a lot of bridges from hoppers payroll into admins which is the financial software and we have another software for our Treasury Department which is where all the cash deposits go.

1060
01:33:13,903 --> 01:33:16,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's three systems all trying to work together.

1061
01:33:16,944 --> 01:33:19,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really hopeful that we'll be able to streamline

1062
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:21,506
[SPEAKER_07]: but it will be a difficult process.

1063
01:33:22,726 --> 01:33:24,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like something you've already undertaken.

1064
01:33:24,227 --> 01:33:24,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1065
01:33:26,828 --> 01:33:31,229
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reached that point in the evening where you get a chance to sum it all up.

1066
01:33:32,009 --> 01:33:37,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us something that maybe you want us to know that we didn't ask.

1067
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:44,294
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe just give that final pitch as to why you need to be the Director of Finance and Administration for the Medford Public Schools.

1068
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:49,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, again, thank you all for the opportunity and coming in to meet you all.

1069
01:33:49,616 --> 01:33:51,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a great organization.

1070
01:33:51,056 --> 01:33:58,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I think doing my research on the district, the Department of Ed's rating is maybe skewed slightly.

1071
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:09,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they see the true work and effort that goes into a district this size and all the good things that are being done across the district.

1072
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:13,445
[SPEAKER_10]: just reading about the greater Mustang community.

1073
01:34:13,505 --> 01:34:16,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a phenomenal organization.

1074
01:34:16,488 --> 01:34:18,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to be a part of it.

1075
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:22,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have a lot to offer, and I think I have a lot to grow.

1076
01:34:22,772 --> 01:34:30,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really what I'm looking at as a lifelong learner, that I want to continue to grow.

1077
01:34:31,219 --> 01:34:35,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had specialized career in regional, vocational,

1078
01:34:35,896 --> 01:34:45,344
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I would really like the opportunity to look at the comprehensive side as well and be a part of some great projects that sound like they're on the cusp of occurring here.

1079
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:46,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1080
01:34:47,146 --> 01:34:47,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1081
01:34:47,686 --> 01:34:47,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1082
01:34:47,946 --> 01:34:48,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1083
01:34:48,286 --> 01:34:48,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1084
01:34:48,807 --> 01:34:49,327
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1085
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:50,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1086
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:50,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1087
01:34:51,209 --> 01:34:55,352
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take a five minute recess.

1088
01:34:56,593 --> 01:34:57,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1089
01:34:57,254 --> 01:34:58,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other commissioners?

1090
01:35:05,072 --> 01:35:06,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Superintendent.

1091
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:17,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I'm pleased to present to you Michelle Shepard, CBA, who is currently in Pitchburgh as a City Assistant Treasurer, Elector, City of Pitchburgh.

1092
01:35:18,549 --> 01:35:22,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle is licensed in the field as a School Business Administrator.

1093
01:35:23,373 --> 01:35:36,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle, the way this works is that we give you an opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself, we have your resume, and why you think you should be our new Director of Finance and Administration.

1094
01:35:36,584 --> 01:35:40,067
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll then go around the room to committee members and they'll ask you a question or two.

1095
01:35:40,907 --> 01:35:49,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of it all, you get to fill in the blanks, maybe tell us a little bit of something that we didn't ask, or sum up some key point that you want us to take home.

1096
01:35:49,913 --> 01:36:00,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are, and why you're interested, and why you think you're going to be a great find for Medford.

1097
01:36:00,361 --> 01:36:00,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1098
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:01,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

1099
01:36:02,702 --> 01:36:04,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for inviting me to interview with you tonight.

1100
01:36:05,697 --> 01:36:06,798
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Michelle Shepard.

1101
01:36:07,598 --> 01:36:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently the assistant treasurer and collector of Fitchburg.

1102
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there eight and a half years.

1103
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:22,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that I ran my own CPA practice for over 20 years and prior to that I worked at a larger regional firm, CPA firm.

1104
01:36:22,805 --> 01:36:24,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I participated on boards and non-profits.

1105
01:36:26,096 --> 01:36:31,660
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations as their treasurer and board member, giving back to the community and helping others.

1106
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:41,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout my career, I've gained a wealth of knowledge involving budgets, banking, payroll, purchasing, general ledger, and management skills.

1107
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:44,689
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these are needed for the Director of Finance.

1108
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:55,197
[SPEAKER_01]: In years past, I've worked with a variety of people, including state and federal government agents, attorneys, and the general public, along with

1109
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:57,020
[SPEAKER_01]: City Council.

1110
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:13,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had time to establish networks and resources to help me along the way, such as my Maspo mentor, other school business managers, Maspo organization itself, and I've compiled manuals from Maspo along with other sources.

1111
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:15,273
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this I bring to you.

1112
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:17,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1113
01:37:18,715 --> 01:37:22,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we begin by starting with Erin DiBenedetto.

1114
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:24,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to Method.

1115
01:37:24,486 --> 01:37:24,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Erin.

1116
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:28,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you.

1117
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:32,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So, have you worked directly in a school district?

1118
01:37:33,334 --> 01:37:39,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do some work during my internship and I do work with the school, Pitchford.

1119
01:37:40,161 --> 01:37:42,863
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet monthly, the assistant and the

1120
01:37:44,035 --> 01:37:46,336
[SPEAKER_01]: business manager and assistant superintendent.

1121
01:37:48,297 --> 01:37:50,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I did work in Clinton for a while.

1122
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:56,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with Dan with some grant work and Sped.

1123
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:02,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides that, I've worked with the School of Pittsburgh.

1124
01:38:03,075 --> 01:38:15,099
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did was we used Munis, and we were setting up a self-serve employee for payroll along with their purchase order and invoice system to be paperless.

1125
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:16,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't quite got there.

1126
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,923
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been upgrades that were made to Munis, and we got forced out of our banking relationship and had to get a new bank.

1127
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:32,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those things have held us up, but we're looking forward to move on with that and get that completed and then get the city on board.

1128
01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:34,326
[SPEAKER_01]: The school goes first and then the city.

1129
01:38:35,346 --> 01:38:40,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And you feel like the switch from the city side to the school side, you'd have the skills in?

1130
01:38:41,358 --> 01:38:43,719
[SPEAKER_01]: required to be able to make that switch?

1131
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:44,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so.

1132
01:38:45,219 --> 01:38:50,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent several years making this transition from municipality, and hopefully to get into a school system.

1133
01:38:51,042 --> 01:38:57,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I completed the MASBO licensure class, and I continue to do education through MASBO.

1134
01:38:58,184 --> 01:39:03,326
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently, I've done end of year reports, SPED, circuit breaker grants, purchasing.

1135
01:39:04,427 --> 01:39:09,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, there was a developing statement of interest for the Mass School Business Authority.

1136
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:13,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone to internet banking and security courses.

1137
01:39:17,153 --> 01:39:20,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I also follow the DOR listserv for the school business officials.

1138
01:39:21,495 --> 01:39:25,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I review the questions that they ask, the surveys, the information that they post.

1139
01:39:26,378 --> 01:39:27,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that as a resource.

1140
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:29,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learn from that.

1141
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see what the others are doing.

1142
01:39:31,582 --> 01:39:33,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a good handle on it and what's happening.

1143
01:39:34,283 --> 01:39:40,027
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently, I just attended UMass, the treasurer's school, which is a certification program.

1144
01:39:40,742 --> 01:39:46,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did long-term borrowing, trust funds and gifts, and covered Chapter 32, the health insurance.

1145
01:39:47,805 --> 01:39:49,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do continue to train in this area.

1146
01:39:50,046 --> 01:39:51,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would make an easy transition.

1147
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:52,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1148
01:39:52,687 --> 01:39:54,668
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people do you currently supervise?

1149
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:56,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, it's eight.

1150
01:39:57,729 --> 01:40:00,531
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four in my office, the treasury collectors.

1151
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:02,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two in payroll and two in parking.

1152
01:40:03,632 --> 01:40:05,473
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I've done as many as

1153
01:40:07,156 --> 01:40:13,057
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 accountants and bookkeepers, six administrative people with one IT person.

1154
01:40:14,218 --> 01:40:20,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just have, do you still do any accounting work privately, like, because you had your own business?

1155
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:21,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Very little.

1156
01:40:22,559 --> 01:40:24,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily family and a couple of friends.

1157
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1158
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we go to Robert M. Iscari Jr.

1159
01:40:36,377 --> 01:40:38,459
[SPEAKER_19]: What role do you play in developing budgets?

1160
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:40,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1161
01:40:41,741 --> 01:40:44,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used budgets over a number of years for my clients.

1162
01:40:45,264 --> 01:40:48,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I've prepared them for their financing, for SBA and the banks.

1163
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:50,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also

1164
01:40:52,423 --> 01:40:57,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I prepared budgets for board meetings for non-profits, being treasurer for the last 15 years.

1165
01:40:58,472 --> 01:41:08,626
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, I worked with the city with the historical and projected data for the budgets, and we actually have the information put into Munis.

1166
01:41:10,188 --> 01:41:12,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not do a row for the incumbences.

1167
01:41:12,412 --> 01:41:14,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a line account item.

1168
01:41:15,376 --> 01:41:18,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the departments do not have access to Munis.

1169
01:41:19,482 --> 01:41:21,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have questions on their revenues and their expenses.

1170
01:41:22,587 --> 01:41:23,489
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm

1171
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time, answering questions that they may have, printing out information for them, and reviewing it with them.

1172
01:41:31,532 --> 01:41:38,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you tell me a little bit about your experience with school transportation, getting kids to and from school every day?

1173
01:41:38,354 --> 01:41:38,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1174
01:41:39,195 --> 01:41:42,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I've not actually done it, I've reviewed documents.

1175
01:41:42,636 --> 01:41:44,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Maslow had classes on it.

1176
01:41:44,956 --> 01:41:46,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you

1177
01:41:47,177 --> 01:41:54,320
[SPEAKER_01]: hire your contractors, your responsible in-house person must work with a liaison from the bus companies.

1178
01:41:54,820 --> 01:42:00,603
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to keep track of the routes, make sure those are set, the students are being picked up, that there's no issues.

1179
01:42:01,503 --> 01:42:08,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side with the invoicing, to make sure that the bills are coming in, they're getting paid, they're correct.

1180
01:42:09,247 --> 01:42:11,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And it depends on how your contract is built.

1181
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,769
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different ways of how people actually

1182
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:18,363
[SPEAKER_01]: do their contracts with the routes and just different methods of doing the routes.

1183
01:42:18,843 --> 01:42:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a good general overall knowledge of it.

1184
01:42:21,163 --> 01:42:21,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1185
01:42:23,524 --> 01:42:26,544
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to Paulette Vandecourt.

1186
01:42:30,565 --> 01:42:33,426
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you see as the most challenging part of this new job?

1187
01:42:36,826 --> 01:42:39,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably say the software.

1188
01:42:42,508 --> 01:42:44,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different than what I'm used to.

1189
01:42:45,305 --> 01:42:49,827
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of school systems are using Munis along with the city or town.

1190
01:42:50,567 --> 01:42:53,548
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your own separate accounting software, so I would need to learn that.

1191
01:42:53,608 --> 01:42:57,190
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a quick learner, so I don't really see that as too much of a problem.

1192
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:06,514
[SPEAKER_14]: And have you had experience in collective bargaining?

1193
01:43:09,117 --> 01:43:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some training from MASBO.

1194
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:17,624
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lawyer that had a class that taught us outside of that.

1195
01:43:17,965 --> 01:43:25,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with the payroll department reviewing the contracts that come in from the city because there needs to be an update to the payroll records.

1196
01:43:27,092 --> 01:43:34,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time in either the city or the school, other than having to calculate an estimated cost before they go into negotiation,

1197
01:43:35,767 --> 01:43:42,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the HR person and the employment lawyer usually handle the majority of that.

1198
01:43:43,193 --> 01:43:44,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really not that much there.

1199
01:43:44,674 --> 01:43:53,020
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my own practice, as a CPA, I had employment contracts with my CPAs that worked for me.

1200
01:43:53,040 --> 01:44:01,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had clients that had contracts with their independent contractors, such as dentists and doctors that were combined in their practice.

1201
01:44:02,127 --> 01:44:04,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I would review those along with their lawyers

1202
01:44:04,929 --> 01:44:11,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am used to reviewing contracts and helping to put input into those contracts.

1203
01:44:11,911 --> 01:44:18,133
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, was it typical for you to attend, I don't, in Fitchburg, is it town meeting or?

1204
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:19,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Council meeting.

1205
01:44:20,434 --> 01:44:21,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Council meetings?

1206
01:44:21,854 --> 01:44:22,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Not required to.

1207
01:44:23,475 --> 01:44:27,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I did review them on TV and I did attend when it was necessary.

1208
01:44:27,736 --> 01:44:28,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure.

1209
01:44:28,536 --> 01:44:31,497
[SPEAKER_01]: The treasurer was the one that primarily went in, but sometimes we teamed in.

1210
01:44:32,898 --> 01:44:42,324
[SPEAKER_14]: You've heard that here it's very typical for our Director of Finance and Administration to attend every school committee meeting, multiple other meetings, and to stay late often.

1211
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:42,865
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

1212
01:44:43,045 --> 01:44:44,286
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't cause me a problem.

1213
01:44:44,386 --> 01:44:49,770
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not... I haven't done it because I wasn't required to, but I have no problem doing that.

1214
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:56,234
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I've worked up to 80 hour weeks between my practice and working for City Hall at the same time.

1215
01:44:56,915 --> 01:45:00,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And just when my practice was larger before, I downsized it for sale.

1216
01:45:01,538 --> 01:45:06,023
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a problem working late and doing what needs to get done.

1217
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:14,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, in order to get the job done, I work in early, work weekends, stay late.

1218
01:45:17,602 --> 01:45:21,525
[SPEAKER_01]: end of month, once a month at least, I'm there until three, four hours later.

1219
01:45:22,807 --> 01:45:26,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to stay because I have to wait for them to get done entering.

1220
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:31,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't have people entering while I'm reconciling everything and closing the books for the month.

1221
01:45:33,242 --> 01:45:37,363
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do that usually at night or first thing in the morning, real early in the morning.

1222
01:45:37,403 --> 01:45:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prefer to stay at night and get it done.

1223
01:45:40,384 --> 01:45:44,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a continuation, because I do have that driving in between, rather than come in early in the morning.

1224
01:45:45,465 --> 01:45:47,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the staff has to start entering right away.

1225
01:45:47,666 --> 01:45:51,647
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they come in, open up the office, boom, they're entering.

1226
01:45:51,767 --> 01:45:53,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1227
01:45:55,588 --> 01:45:57,749
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now we'll go to Kathy Kretsch.

1228
01:45:59,177 --> 01:45:59,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1229
01:45:59,418 --> 01:46:00,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.

1230
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:00,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.

1231
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:17,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to know, have you ever had to submit reports to the superintendent or the school committee at a priority request where maybe we might ask for the breakdown of expenses?

1232
01:46:18,155 --> 01:46:19,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever had to do anything like that?

1233
01:46:20,317 --> 01:46:29,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do on pretty much a daily basis with going through the general ledger and looking up different revenues or expenses for different departments.

1234
01:46:30,385 --> 01:46:32,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I analyze them for my own department.

1235
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:42,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the 9 and 10s that come over the counter, that's the interdepartment monies that I've received and turned over the turnover sheets as I referred to them.

1236
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:46,016
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not always coded to the right place.

1237
01:46:46,457 --> 01:46:47,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may catch it.

1238
01:46:48,058 --> 01:46:49,159
[SPEAKER_01]: The auditor may catch it.

1239
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:54,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do tend to review monthly to kind of see where things are being posted.

1240
01:46:54,080 --> 01:47:03,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I have prepared reports, PowerPoint for my Maslow class, the presentations you are required to.

1241
01:47:03,942 --> 01:47:10,404
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done budget presentations for non-profit boards for 15 years.

1242
01:47:12,104 --> 01:47:13,905
[SPEAKER_01]: In the city itself, not so much with

1243
01:47:16,053 --> 01:47:20,495
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't call it council, but they do come in occasionally and ask questions.

1244
01:47:20,615 --> 01:47:22,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why is this here?

1245
01:47:22,635 --> 01:47:23,676
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in this income?

1246
01:47:23,716 --> 01:47:24,636
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in this account?

1247
01:47:24,676 --> 01:47:25,797
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we use it for?

1248
01:47:26,437 --> 01:47:34,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And either the treasurer or I will sit with them and explain to them, you know, what the account is for and why it does what it does.

1249
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are occasions

1250
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:45,527
[SPEAKER_01]: for the school will call down and ask, you know, I know I got grant money, I can't find it, where did it go to?

1251
01:47:47,089 --> 01:47:48,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we start searching.

1252
01:47:49,051 --> 01:47:53,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It could happen from community development just as well, not just the school, or police.

1253
01:47:53,557 --> 01:47:54,958
[SPEAKER_01]: The grant money's come in wired.

1254
01:47:55,639 --> 01:48:05,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we wait for them to get information, but a lot of times we'll try to, the auditors will code it based upon the memo on the wire.

1255
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:08,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't always land exactly where it should.

1256
01:48:08,794 --> 01:48:12,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes there are reclassifications which requires an analysis.

1257
01:48:14,027 --> 01:48:14,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1258
01:48:15,008 --> 01:48:17,551
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just have another question.

1259
01:48:17,932 --> 01:48:28,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever had to submit or run the payroll for the teachers or submit monthly reports to the retirement board or anything like that?

1260
01:48:31,049 --> 01:48:33,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I am backup for my payroll person.

1261
01:48:34,512 --> 01:48:37,094
[SPEAKER_01]: The school puts the hours in and we do the payroll.

1262
01:48:37,114 --> 01:48:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We put all the deductions in and run all the payroll in Munis.

1263
01:48:42,799 --> 01:48:44,301
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in-house, so yes.

1264
01:48:44,921 --> 01:48:46,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I physically file the quarterly reports.

1265
01:48:46,963 --> 01:48:47,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all the W-2s.

1266
01:48:48,004 --> 01:48:49,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all the 1099s for the city.

1267
01:48:49,925 --> 01:48:53,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the 1095, the Obamacare forms for the city.

1268
01:48:54,589 --> 01:48:57,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am pretty much, very much hands on.

1269
01:48:57,891 --> 01:49:11,579
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had several instances with the hours, having to watch the hours because of the ACA with the substitutes and the cafeteria and the other workers have a tendency of when it gets lean and mean, people get over time, they extend their hours.

1270
01:49:12,019 --> 01:49:13,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to watch those hours.

1271
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:18,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also responsible for the workman's car insurance renewal.

1272
01:49:18,422 --> 01:49:20,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to review those payroll.

1273
01:49:20,163 --> 01:49:22,445
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a DOL report that I have to file.

1274
01:49:23,045 --> 01:49:29,327
[SPEAKER_01]: There's unemployment wages that I file quarterly, so yes, I'm very much in tune with the payroll.

1275
01:49:30,747 --> 01:49:31,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1276
01:49:32,008 --> 01:49:34,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1277
01:49:34,769 --> 01:49:39,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any experience with grants, whether state or federal or private?

1278
01:49:40,351 --> 01:49:41,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do some grants.

1279
01:49:41,731 --> 01:49:46,092
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly community foundation grants from Mass Cultural.

1280
01:49:49,147 --> 01:50:02,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I did do a little bit of grant work with researching foundations and grants when I was in Clinton, doing my internship, trying to find them some money for certain projects that they were looking at doing.

1281
01:50:03,593 --> 01:50:06,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, Maslow's had multiple classes on it.

1282
01:50:07,295 --> 01:50:10,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too long ago, they had a federal one at Fort Bevins that I went to.

1283
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do try to keep up on all the little areas.

1284
01:50:14,318 --> 01:50:17,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne Marie?

1285
01:50:19,438 --> 01:50:21,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening and thank you for being here.

1286
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:25,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you tell me what is the largest fiscal system you've worked for?

1287
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The largest fiscal system that you've worked for, like the budget?

1288
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Our budget is $105,000 million.

1289
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:33,901
[SPEAKER_01]: The school is about 50% of that.

1290
01:50:33,921 --> 01:50:34,081
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of the $105,000?

1291
01:50:34,161 --> 01:50:34,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1292
01:50:48,664 --> 01:50:50,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Just around 52, 53.

1293
01:50:51,468 --> 01:50:53,049
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies from year to year.

1294
01:50:53,069 --> 01:50:54,211
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been 54.

1295
01:50:56,533 --> 01:50:58,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So around 52 to 54 million you're saying?

1296
01:50:58,776 --> 01:50:58,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1297
01:51:00,217 --> 01:51:04,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and describe yourself as the financial director.

1298
01:51:04,682 --> 01:51:09,127
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of schedule, what type of person, when you come in in the morning, what you would do?

1299
01:51:11,426 --> 01:51:15,974
[SPEAKER_01]: My day would probably be similar to currently what I do now.

1300
01:51:16,655 --> 01:51:18,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you an example of what my typical day would be.

1301
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:21,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The office opens at 8.30.

1302
01:51:21,743 --> 01:51:24,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I get in there around 8 and I'll say my hellos.

1303
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:27,668
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down, work.

1304
01:51:28,949 --> 01:51:32,350
[SPEAKER_01]: It may consist of identifying who's missing for the day.

1305
01:51:33,091 --> 01:51:39,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to physically open the office, wait on customers, answer phones, along with doing my own work.

1306
01:51:39,654 --> 01:51:44,416
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we have the mayor or the staff in asking questions or other departments in asking questions.

1307
01:51:44,936 --> 01:51:47,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm banning all those questions.

1308
01:51:48,838 --> 01:51:54,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides doing my own work, and my own work could involve having to cover payroll because one of my people may be out.

1309
01:51:55,804 --> 01:52:02,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, one of my clerks was out, so I was manning the phone while the other two were handling the customers at the counter.

1310
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:09,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with, I just completed the DOR information, the receivables.

1311
01:52:09,595 --> 01:52:14,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I uploaded that to the DOR portal for the city's end of year report.

1312
01:52:15,835 --> 01:52:36,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the outside accounts coming in a couple of weeks, so I've been getting the files together for that, along with all the reconciliations, working on the fourth quarter and combining for the year for the workman's comp, insurance renewal for all the payroll information, getting them actual numbers for the whole year.

1313
01:52:36,962 --> 01:52:40,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So I presume here would be quite similar where

1314
01:52:40,983 --> 01:52:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime during the day, you slide into lunch, and then at the end of the day, I would probably sit with the superintendent and see if there's things that have gone on during the day that I might have missed with him, if there's something coming up, our schedule has changed.

1315
01:52:53,788 --> 01:53:08,575
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of set your schedule, and you adjust, looking at the next day, the next week, and just keeping up with the communication, and just seeing what's happening, and just making sure that the staff is brought in on any deadlines that have now changed or come up.

1316
01:53:09,675 --> 01:53:20,046
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to do is kind of have a calendar of items that need to get done and what months and what time and kind of follow through with that so you always have like a little reminder.

1317
01:53:20,346 --> 01:53:27,834
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your little to-do list for the day that constantly changes and if you get, you know, two or four of those items done, you're doing really good.

1318
01:53:29,907 --> 01:53:50,612
[SPEAKER_01]: which you have what's ongoing through the year and for the flow of everything, you know, including the budgets and just all the reports and the year reports and things that just need to get done, making sure that all the information gets in from SPED, that you have that October 1st, you have the count, you have where all the students are, so that everything else will spool off of that.

1319
01:53:51,488 --> 01:53:53,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much how my day usually goes.

1320
01:53:53,914 --> 01:54:01,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I have to stay late, it's end of meeting, like I said, or it's end of month and I'm here till, you know, whatever time it takes to finish up everything.

1321
01:54:02,674 --> 01:54:08,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you've probably heard, I mean, we've discussed, well, we've asked questions and spoke about busing.

1322
01:54:09,939 --> 01:54:13,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, the financial director would also be involved with the busing situation.

1323
01:54:14,242 --> 01:54:21,888
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you take care of a situation that arose on a particular day of a parent calling you and saying, you know, this bus is overcrowded?

1324
01:54:23,609 --> 01:54:24,850
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what would you do?

1325
01:54:25,901 --> 01:54:33,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would have first reviewed our contract to see what we have, you know, what are the requirements, what's our plus.

1326
01:54:36,132 --> 01:54:54,400
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of students that are allowed on each bus, try to figure out whether that was really true, talk to others that are involved with the liaison or whoever, find out if this was some particular reason, the bus broke down, they had to pick up extra kids, or is this something that's been on an ongoing basis?

1327
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,342
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an ongoing basis, is it something that we need to change a route?

1328
01:54:58,442 --> 01:54:59,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look at the routes.

1329
01:55:00,223 --> 01:55:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a problem somewhere?

1330
01:55:01,563 --> 01:55:02,404
[SPEAKER_01]: What's causing this?

1331
01:55:03,324 --> 01:55:06,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just an aggravated parent that thinks that there's just too many?

1332
01:55:08,346 --> 01:55:10,107
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'd be a matter of a discussion.

1333
01:55:10,687 --> 01:55:13,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Our contract calls for X number of kids on the bus.

1334
01:55:14,349 --> 01:55:15,129
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a norm.

1335
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:24,573
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's outside the norm, then maybe next time the contract comes up, we need to review it and see if there's some alternative that we can do.

1336
01:55:26,053 --> 01:55:26,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1337
01:55:26,533 --> 01:55:28,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam Mayor.

1338
01:55:28,534 --> 01:55:29,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1339
01:55:30,095 --> 01:55:32,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any direct procurement experience?

1340
01:55:33,758 --> 01:55:34,498
[SPEAKER_07]: in Fitchburg?

1341
01:55:34,999 --> 01:55:35,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little.

1342
01:55:36,779 --> 01:55:39,721
[SPEAKER_01]: It's primarily been done by our purchasing.

1343
01:55:39,741 --> 01:55:42,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three in our purchasing department that cover the school and the city.

1344
01:55:43,502 --> 01:55:48,445
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have taken certification courses, although I'm not completely certified yet.

1345
01:55:49,565 --> 01:55:54,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Maspo has gone through some purchasing classes before it was combined with the MassBys.

1346
01:55:55,067 --> 01:55:59,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone to some of the MassBys that were out in Worcester at one point during the trade shows.

1347
01:56:01,642 --> 01:56:09,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I've viewed the Inspector General's website and pretty much everything you could ever want is on that site if you want to spend the time for it.

1348
01:56:09,811 --> 01:56:12,053
[SPEAKER_01]: There's contracts, there's how to write bids.

1349
01:56:12,153 --> 01:56:21,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I have written some bids and some RFPs for garage repairs, for auditing services, for banking services.

1350
01:56:23,293 --> 01:56:28,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get involved with Pitchfork Historical Society, where I was trying to work for 15 years.

1351
01:56:28,317 --> 01:56:31,179
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a $3.5 million building renovation.

1352
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:38,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved with writing the RFP for the contractors.

1353
01:56:39,465 --> 01:56:45,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I was on the committee and approved the payments as the construction took place.

1354
01:56:46,411 --> 01:56:50,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was aware of looking at construction documents.

1355
01:56:52,557 --> 01:57:08,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done quite a bit and I don't see with, you know, some contracts that I've dealt with in the past that working with the school and going through, I'm sure that I can, I have the resources to, you know, put out whatever RFP or follow whatever guidelines that we need to.

1356
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:12,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been involved with any MSBA projects in the city?

1357
01:57:15,046 --> 01:57:22,469
[SPEAKER_01]: They just recently wrote a statement of interest, Bob did, and submitted that to have more work done at the schools.

1358
01:57:23,189 --> 01:57:25,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not been directly involved from that side.

1359
01:57:27,251 --> 01:57:30,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of their work that they have had has gone out to bond.

1360
01:57:31,272 --> 01:57:34,914
[SPEAKER_01]: We've combined it with some financing, some borrowings from the city.

1361
01:57:35,654 --> 01:57:37,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved with that a little bit.

1362
01:57:40,068 --> 01:57:52,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand when speaking with others that once you go with the school business authority, basically, you draft your statement of interest.

1363
01:57:54,033 --> 01:57:56,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll approve or disapprove.

1364
01:57:57,514 --> 01:57:59,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pretty much run the show.

1365
01:57:59,915 --> 01:58:02,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And you supply the documents, is what I've been told.

1366
01:58:03,036 --> 01:58:07,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a whole lot of leeway there, not like doing your own construction project.

1367
01:58:08,098 --> 01:58:08,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1368
01:58:08,418 --> 01:58:08,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1369
01:58:09,771 --> 01:58:15,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so any other questions anyone has right now?

1370
01:58:15,613 --> 01:58:25,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Michelle, tell us a little bit, something we didn't ask you or give us some reinforcement about something that you want us to know.

1371
01:58:27,196 --> 01:58:29,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us that extra boost as to why you should be our person.

1372
01:58:34,251 --> 01:58:36,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would be a good candidate for the position.

1373
01:58:36,272 --> 01:58:37,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very confident.

1374
01:58:38,352 --> 01:58:40,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been self-taught in Fitchburg.

1375
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:42,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I did very little training.

1376
01:58:42,813 --> 01:58:43,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't available.

1377
01:58:44,313 --> 01:58:48,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those eight and a half years, I've pretty much self-taught myself everything that I know about the city.

1378
01:58:49,555 --> 01:58:54,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with moving forward and finding if I have to stay late or do anything.

1379
01:58:55,516 --> 01:58:59,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I have resources available, like I mentioned, my mentor, Masbo.

1380
01:59:00,597 --> 01:59:03,559
[SPEAKER_01]: written documentation that I can find answers to things.

1381
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:07,282
[SPEAKER_01]: A quick phone call from somebody, you know, clear up a question.

1382
01:59:12,085 --> 01:59:13,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident that I can do it.

1383
01:59:13,405 --> 01:59:17,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loyal to a fault to my job, as my husband would say.

1384
01:59:19,129 --> 01:59:24,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told that my background is very similar to Pat's and that I would make a good transition.

1385
01:59:26,535 --> 01:59:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a track record of my longevity in my positions that I've held, and I think the stability to this position would be very advantageous to you.

1386
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:41,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a strong accounting, auditing, and finance background.

1387
01:59:43,502 --> 01:59:44,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very quick-learned.

1388
01:59:46,843 --> 01:59:49,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find a very nice environment here.

1389
01:59:49,665 --> 01:59:52,666
[SPEAKER_01]: People seem very friendly, and I really look forward to

1390
01:59:53,921 --> 01:59:56,924
[SPEAKER_01]: being the one that you pick to move the school forward.

1391
01:59:58,585 --> 02:00:00,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in learning and education.

1392
02:00:01,487 --> 02:00:02,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long road for me.

1393
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:06,391
[SPEAKER_01]: As you notice from my resume, I got my license in 2013.

1394
02:00:07,352 --> 02:00:09,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been interviewing in that time frame.

1395
02:00:10,634 --> 02:00:21,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going up against candidates who have done the job, and the school committee seemed to feel that experience in the job outweighs the desire, the devotion, and the dedication

1396
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: to succeed as a director of finance.

1397
02:00:25,284 --> 02:00:32,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always excelled with whatever tasks that I've been given, because I won't accept anything less, no matter what it takes.

1398
02:00:34,711 --> 02:00:42,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to tell you that I am as good as anyone else to doing the job, and if given the opportunity, whoever hires me won't be disappointed.

1399
02:00:44,538 --> 02:00:45,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1400
02:00:45,318 --> 02:00:45,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1401
02:00:45,899 --> 02:00:46,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1402
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:46,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1403
02:00:49,181 --> 02:00:49,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a short break.

1404
02:00:50,302 --> 02:00:51,623
Just a couple of minutes.

1405
02:00:56,614 --> 02:01:00,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So Diane Johnson is with us.

1406
02:01:00,597 --> 02:01:08,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Diane is currently the director of, chief financial officer of the Arlington Financial Schools.

1407
02:01:09,304 --> 02:01:11,366
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me introduce you to the people around the table.

1408
02:01:11,646 --> 02:01:18,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulette Van der Kloot, Henry Cugno, Robert Emmett Skerry Jr., Erin DiBenedetto.

1409
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:31,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Stephanie Burke, Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mostone, and what's her name?

1410
02:01:32,253 --> 02:01:35,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Beverly Nelson, Deputy Superintendent, and Pat Bielefe.

1411
02:01:35,834 --> 02:01:36,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.

1412
02:01:36,254 --> 02:01:38,195
[SPEAKER_09]: He's getting tired.

1413
02:01:38,495 --> 02:01:39,375
[SPEAKER_09]: We should read name tags.

1414
02:01:39,755 --> 02:01:41,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, I'm older.

1415
02:01:41,236 --> 02:01:43,116
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you expect?

1416
02:01:43,156 --> 02:01:45,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Older and better, right?

1417
02:01:47,017 --> 02:01:50,618
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so anyway, Diane, thank you for being patient with us tonight.

1418
02:01:50,718 --> 02:01:55,860
[SPEAKER_00]: We went a little bit longer than we thought initially, but that's what happens in public meetings.

1419
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:04,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself, about your background, your qualifications, and why you believe you would be a great person for this job here in medicine.

1420
02:02:04,603 --> 02:02:05,023
OK.

1421
02:02:05,723 --> 02:02:08,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I prepared an opening statement because I didn't want nerves to overwhelm me.

1422
02:02:08,924 --> 02:02:10,525
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you don't mind, I'm going to read it.

1423
02:02:12,035 --> 02:02:17,404
[SPEAKER_15]: My memories of the Boston Red Sox extend back into my early childhood, when my grandfather would have the game on the radio.

1424
02:02:18,205 --> 02:02:25,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I've always taken it to be a sign that the Red Sox won the World Series in October of 2004, just as I started on the path of school business administration.

1425
02:02:26,507 --> 02:02:32,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Last night, fighting my nerves about this interview, I watched Faith Rewarded, Nessun's documentary about the 2004 Red Sox.

1426
02:02:33,711 --> 02:02:40,015
[SPEAKER_15]: I went to bed reminiscing about the joy of standing in the crowd outside of Park Street Station watching the duck boats roll by.

1427
02:02:40,695 --> 02:02:42,236
[SPEAKER_15]: It really did help me get to sleep last night.

1428
02:02:42,476 --> 02:02:43,137
[SPEAKER_15]: It felt very good.

1429
02:02:44,422 --> 02:02:47,744
[SPEAKER_15]: I completed my undergraduate degree at Dartmouth wanting to become a college professor.

1430
02:02:48,365 --> 02:02:58,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I went straight into a doctoral program at Harvard, only to discover that tenure-track job opportunities were increasingly rare, as colleges and universities began shifting to part-time staffing to meet their teaching needs.

1431
02:02:58,871 --> 02:03:03,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Not seeing a clear path to the life I had envisioned as an undergraduate, I left graduate school with a master's degree.

1432
02:03:05,168 --> 02:03:12,115
[SPEAKER_15]: After graduate school, I worked as an office manager in a small film editing equipment business, which led me to an HR position at WGBH.

1433
02:03:12,936 --> 02:03:20,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I moved on to work in the budget office, where I was an analyst for such shows as Zoom and This Old House, before specializing in federal grants management for Channel 2.

1434
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:27,431
[SPEAKER_15]: But like academia, public television was undergoing a major shift at this time, and I was downsized in the spring of 2004 as a result.

1435
02:03:29,698 --> 02:03:37,245
[SPEAKER_15]: That summer, I came across a job posting with the Cambridge Public Schools, which seemed to be a blend of the work I had done at WGBH, and something called purchasing.

1436
02:03:38,126 --> 02:03:38,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I was intrigued.

1437
02:03:39,827 --> 02:03:41,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I applied, and I was hired.

1438
02:03:42,549 --> 02:03:46,433
[SPEAKER_15]: It was here that I discovered school business administration, a career that seemed designed for me.

1439
02:03:47,335 --> 02:03:53,300
[SPEAKER_15]: My supervisor, CFO Jim Connery, was a longstanding business manager who had been mentored into his role by his predecessor.

1440
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:59,765
[SPEAKER_15]: With Jim's support, I enrolled at Bridgewater State, which at the time was the only academic path to licensure for school business in the area.

1441
02:04:00,446 --> 02:04:03,128
[SPEAKER_15]: I attained my license and continued to grow under his leadership.

1442
02:04:04,269 --> 02:04:07,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately for both of us, Jim got sick and retired earlier than he had planned.

1443
02:04:08,132 --> 02:04:09,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I was chosen to serve as interim CFO.

1444
02:04:10,734 --> 02:04:16,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I served as replacement for a year of transition, then was hired by Arlington, where I have been the CFO for the last seven years.

1445
02:04:17,505 --> 02:04:20,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank you for the opportunity to interview tonight, and I welcome your questions.

1446
02:04:21,688 --> 02:04:22,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Diane.

1447
02:04:23,009 --> 02:04:24,810
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to begin by going around the room.

1448
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:26,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with Mia Mostow.

1449
02:04:27,772 --> 02:04:31,375
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been writing questions all night.

1450
02:04:31,395 --> 02:04:33,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to be honest with you, though.

1451
02:04:33,776 --> 02:04:35,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I did work at Federal Tax for 23 years.

1452
02:04:37,579 --> 02:04:41,221
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess the one concern that I feel like we talk about is grants.

1453
02:04:41,541 --> 02:04:44,824
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you've written them, followed them, which grants, how did it go?

1454
02:04:46,332 --> 02:04:53,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I took extensive training while I was at WGBH in federal grants management and was, oh, it was quite a few credit hours.

1455
02:04:53,994 --> 02:04:56,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I flew to Washington and took all kinds of coursework.

1456
02:04:57,215 --> 02:05:05,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So at the time, which was, God, the turn of the century now, I was very conversant in really the nitty-gritty of federal grants management.

1457
02:05:06,257 --> 02:05:09,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Since then, my job has taken me away from more of the day-to-day of grants management.

1458
02:05:10,037 --> 02:05:11,138
[SPEAKER_15]: It's become more oversight.

1459
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:16,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So at one point, I was extremely familiar, and I think I could catch up again.

1460
02:05:18,443 --> 02:05:18,723
[SPEAKER_00]: More?

1461
02:05:19,784 --> 02:05:20,004
[SPEAKER_00]: No?

1462
02:05:20,124 --> 02:05:20,684
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1463
02:05:21,124 --> 02:05:23,246
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go to Ann Marie Cugno.

1464
02:05:24,006 --> 02:05:25,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, and thank you for being here.

1465
02:05:25,467 --> 02:05:26,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1466
02:05:26,487 --> 02:05:27,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being patient.

1467
02:05:27,448 --> 02:05:28,008
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran over.

1468
02:05:30,009 --> 02:05:32,611
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the largest fiscal system that you have worked for?

1469
02:05:33,191 --> 02:05:34,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be Cambridge.

1470
02:05:34,292 --> 02:05:35,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much is that?

1471
02:05:36,533 --> 02:05:39,295
[SPEAKER_15]: At the time I left, I think their general fund budget was about $125 million.

1472
02:05:41,008 --> 02:05:43,049
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and have you, what about the school side?

1473
02:05:43,889 --> 02:05:44,589
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the school side.

1474
02:05:44,629 --> 02:05:48,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was the school side.

1475
02:05:48,831 --> 02:05:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to bring your money, to bring your money.

1476
02:05:53,733 --> 02:05:54,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.

1477
02:05:54,433 --> 02:05:56,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to put things in perspective.

1478
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:58,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1479
02:05:59,055 --> 02:06:02,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure the budget is significantly larger at this point.

1480
02:06:02,216 --> 02:06:03,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they are here.

1481
02:06:03,297 --> 02:06:04,397
They are there.

1482
02:06:04,717 --> 02:06:06,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I left seven years ago.

1483
02:06:06,478 --> 02:06:06,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1484
02:06:08,953 --> 02:06:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: As a financial director, explain what your day would be and what you think you would be doing.

1485
02:06:13,694 --> 02:06:13,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Here?

1486
02:06:15,595 --> 02:06:20,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, by biology and preference, I'm a morning person.

1487
02:06:20,636 --> 02:06:22,477
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be my choice to come in early.

1488
02:06:22,497 --> 02:06:26,878
[SPEAKER_15]: And I like to do my thinking and analytic tasks at the beginning of the day.

1489
02:06:27,722 --> 02:06:36,149
[SPEAKER_15]: I found when I was in Cambridge when I was doing finance on the one hand and purchasing, writing bid documents and specs on the other, that my brain didn't really take to doing both in the same day.

1490
02:06:36,269 --> 02:06:42,574
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would kind of set aside days to be financial and days to be procurement so that I could focus on writing or focus on analytics.

1491
02:06:43,932 --> 02:06:46,073
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't shift gears very well, which is kind of sad.

1492
02:06:47,273 --> 02:06:50,675
[SPEAKER_15]: In the afternoon, I try to do more of the day-to-day tasks.

1493
02:06:51,355 --> 02:06:58,098
[SPEAKER_15]: In Arlington, for example, right now, we still use a paper quadruplicate PO system, and so I have to hand-sign everything we buy.

1494
02:06:58,398 --> 02:07:02,120
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have many hours to invest in signing my name over and over.

1495
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:05,702
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it sounds awful, but it's actually very important.

1496
02:07:05,922 --> 02:07:08,603
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd be surprised how much you can retain when you review everything.

1497
02:07:09,003 --> 02:07:13,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Not everything, of course, but you have a general gist of things, and things do pop out at you.

1498
02:07:14,571 --> 02:07:18,255
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me that one of the truisms of school business is that you never know what your day is going to bring.

1499
02:07:18,595 --> 02:07:21,778
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is a great thing if you hate boredom.

1500
02:07:22,819 --> 02:07:25,042
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not such a great thing if you need to keep all your ducks in a row.

1501
02:07:25,642 --> 02:07:32,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So you need to be able to blend precision and planning and getting things done with the ability to be flexible as things pop up.

1502
02:07:35,911 --> 02:07:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We do, well the financial director here in our city does a lot with the transportation and the busing.

1503
02:07:41,695 --> 02:07:59,387
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is a situation that occurs and you have someone who calls and is complaining about, you know, the route is overloaded or there's too many students on the bus and the bus isn't getting there on time, explain to us what you would do in that position.

1504
02:08:00,181 --> 02:08:05,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, one of the things I've learned from the present town manager in Arlington is that very often citizens need to be heard.

1505
02:08:06,003 --> 02:08:09,184
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they need to feel like somebody cares and that somebody's listening.

1506
02:08:09,684 --> 02:08:15,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would initially take the time to write down lots of notes and, you know, hear everything they had to say.

1507
02:08:15,225 --> 02:08:16,446
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, is there anything else?

1508
02:08:16,846 --> 02:08:18,206
[SPEAKER_15]: How long has this been troubling you?

1509
02:08:18,586 --> 02:08:21,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this your shift or has it been this way from the beginning of the year?

1510
02:08:21,527 --> 02:08:23,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Really try to get as much information as I could.

1511
02:08:24,032 --> 02:08:27,414
[SPEAKER_15]: take their number and tell them I'd get back to them.

1512
02:08:28,055 --> 02:08:33,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I would go talk to the people involved, the bus driver, the routing, however it's handled.

1513
02:08:33,658 --> 02:08:37,020
[SPEAKER_15]: I would try to get the facts from our side and see what's going on.

1514
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:43,164
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I would definitely circle back to the person as soon as I could and say, you know, I've looked into it.

1515
02:08:44,690 --> 02:08:47,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And whatever the answer is, at this time, I'm very sorry.

1516
02:08:48,352 --> 02:08:51,475
[SPEAKER_15]: We hope to be able to make a change in x amount of time.

1517
02:08:52,055 --> 02:08:56,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Or that this was a one-off because another bus broke down and it won't normally be like that.

1518
02:08:56,578 --> 02:09:00,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever the actual answer is, I would always want to be truthful.

1519
02:09:02,082 --> 02:09:06,005
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's the way it's going to be and there's nothing to be done, I would try to

1520
02:09:07,447 --> 02:09:09,648
[SPEAKER_15]: say that in a way that was as palatable as possible.

1521
02:09:10,028 --> 02:09:12,548
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would want them to know that we're taking their concerns seriously.

1522
02:09:12,588 --> 02:09:20,551
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it was a genuine problem that we couldn't address immediately, I'd want to be sure we were looking at it as we move forward into another budget cycle.

1523
02:09:20,571 --> 02:09:24,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And how would you take care of looking into it in the future?

1524
02:09:24,672 --> 02:09:27,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, is it a problem of stock?

1525
02:09:27,493 --> 02:09:28,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have enough bus inventory?

1526
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:32,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Are your buses sufficiently sound so you don't have a lot of breakdowns?

1527
02:09:33,282 --> 02:09:39,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Are your routes, are you trying to do too much in too short a period of time so you end up with too many kids on the bus?

1528
02:09:39,765 --> 02:09:40,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Are your buses wrong sized?

1529
02:09:40,965 --> 02:09:42,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need a different size of bus?

1530
02:09:43,766 --> 02:09:46,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Those would be some of the initial questions that come to mind in trying to solve that.

1531
02:09:46,927 --> 02:09:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

1532
02:09:49,789 --> 02:09:51,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're gonna go now to Erin.

1533
02:09:52,590 --> 02:09:54,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Erin.

1534
02:09:55,331 --> 02:09:57,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you tell me how many people you currently supervise?

1535
02:09:58,972 --> 02:10:00,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I have

1536
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:09,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I have four direct reports and a shared fifth.

1537
02:10:10,622 --> 02:10:15,986
[SPEAKER_15]: I also am sharing one of my people who is currently overseeing the payroll office as well.

1538
02:10:16,606 --> 02:10:18,287
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of by extension.

1539
02:10:18,807 --> 02:10:20,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are my direct reports.

1540
02:10:20,589 --> 02:10:26,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I work very closely with the communications director, the assistant superintendent, and the special ed director.

1541
02:10:26,713 --> 02:10:30,135
[SPEAKER_15]: The report that I share is the fiscal manager of special education.

1542
02:10:30,615 --> 02:10:33,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And so she reports to myself and to the special ed director.

1543
02:10:36,769 --> 02:10:44,977
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Pat's just spent a lot of time since she's been here, a little more than two years, two years, two months, and how many hours?

1544
02:10:47,475 --> 02:10:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: really updating a lot of our systems.

1545
02:10:50,936 --> 02:10:59,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So like our community schools program is now online, so when people want to use any of our buildings, they have to go through that program.

1546
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:02,861
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you familiar with some of the programs?

1547
02:11:02,941 --> 02:11:05,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you've talked to her about what we're currently using.

1548
02:11:06,922 --> 02:11:11,943
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't discussed the specifics of your program, but I am a big fan of modernization.

1549
02:11:13,383 --> 02:11:22,805
[SPEAKER_15]: I implemented a budgeting software in Arlington, and we were the second district in Massachusetts to implement this, and it's a tremendous tool for planning and reporting.

1550
02:11:24,185 --> 02:11:26,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, we're going through a big Munis upgrade.

1551
02:11:27,286 --> 02:11:34,347
[SPEAKER_15]: I've worked with Lawson Insight, PeopleSoft, and of course, Munis in my travels.

1552
02:11:35,128 --> 02:11:45,318
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've, you know, right now Arlington is also a Google platform district, so I'm becoming pretty conversant in Google Docs and all of that, though Google Sheets cannot hold a candle to Excel in my humble opinion.

1553
02:11:45,798 --> 02:11:47,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I use the network as well.

1554
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:53,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I really, I am always glad to find efficiencies in that way, and I enjoy technological implementations.

1555
02:11:54,586 --> 02:11:59,631
[SPEAKER_15]: When I implemented my budget file, it was, perhaps the timing was ill-considered,

1556
02:12:00,025 --> 02:12:05,250
[SPEAKER_15]: They couldn't get me onto the schedule until November, and I have to roll out a budget book by the first of February.

1557
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:14,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I did the implementation in November and December in time to get the budget book out, and that was probably not my wisest choice, but we got it done.

1558
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you present the budget to the superintendent or at the school committee meetings or whatever?

1559
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,401
[SPEAKER_15]: I present them at the school committee meetings.

1560
02:12:23,921 --> 02:12:26,041
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also present them to the finance committee.

1561
02:12:26,762 --> 02:12:31,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And at town meeting, I'm on hand to answer any questions, any technical questions on the budget.

1562
02:12:33,524 --> 02:12:33,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1563
02:12:33,784 --> 02:12:34,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1564
02:12:35,765 --> 02:12:36,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Paulette.

1565
02:12:38,586 --> 02:12:42,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane, do you attend every school committee meeting in Arlington?

1566
02:12:42,914 --> 02:12:44,255
[SPEAKER_15]: I did for many years.

1567
02:12:45,356 --> 02:12:53,841
[SPEAKER_15]: And in my last contract cycle, I negotiated that I would go to the first meeting of every month throughout the entire year.

1568
02:12:53,881 --> 02:12:55,643
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when I do my monthly financial reporting.

1569
02:12:57,043 --> 02:13:02,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And during the budget season, which runs from the beginning of November through the end of March, I would be at every meeting.

1570
02:13:03,688 --> 02:13:06,750
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't go to the second meeting in the fall and the spring.

1571
02:13:07,212 --> 02:13:11,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless there's something brewing, which there's a lot of construction going on in Arlington right now.

1572
02:13:11,515 --> 02:13:15,238
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I ended up at more meetings, nevertheless, because there were construction issues.

1573
02:13:15,758 --> 02:13:17,679
[SPEAKER_14]: That's interesting that that's something you negotiated.

1574
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:25,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is customary, more often than not, that our finance director is at our meetings or at our beck and call.

1575
02:13:25,645 --> 02:13:35,352
[SPEAKER_14]: So that sort of leads me to the second question is, what are your expectations regarding your relationship, both with the superintendent, your boss, if you would, and the school committee?

1576
02:13:36,488 --> 02:13:37,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And how has that worked?

1577
02:13:39,071 --> 02:13:42,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I know in Cambridge, I'm not sure whether you had direct contact with the school committee?

1578
02:13:43,677 --> 02:13:46,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I would come as an assistant to the CFO.

1579
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:49,784
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I was the interim CFO, I would obviously be there in his place.

1580
02:13:51,426 --> 02:13:51,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a lot.

1581
02:13:52,007 --> 02:13:53,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a lot of contact in Arlington.

1582
02:13:54,429 --> 02:13:56,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Arlington is very much into subcommittees.

1583
02:13:57,332 --> 02:14:07,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I meet regularly with the budget subcommittee and the facility subcommittee and I serve on other town committees where there may or may not be school committee members on those town committees.

1584
02:14:08,064 --> 02:14:09,225
[SPEAKER_15]: So I see a lot of them.

1585
02:14:12,773 --> 02:14:18,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask why this position in Medford interests you and why you would be leaving Arlington?

1586
02:14:18,496 --> 02:14:19,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

1587
02:14:20,277 --> 02:14:21,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you led me right into it.

1588
02:14:21,857 --> 02:14:22,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Night meetings.

1589
02:14:23,638 --> 02:14:24,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Arlington loves to meet.

1590
02:14:25,339 --> 02:14:29,021
[SPEAKER_15]: They love to meet at night, and they love to keep it going.

1591
02:14:29,041 --> 02:14:30,521
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I said, I'm a morning person.

1592
02:14:30,561 --> 02:14:32,782
[SPEAKER_15]: My best thinking time is early in the day.

1593
02:14:33,563 --> 02:14:42,587
[SPEAKER_15]: For me to be at a night meeting, I'm here tonight, I'm amped up, I'm ready to go, and I'll go home and wander the house for several hours until I calm down enough to be able to get to sleep.

1594
02:14:45,065 --> 02:15:01,052
[SPEAKER_15]: issue but literally most of my weeks from September to March I'm in two or more meetings there are at night and there are weeks when I have done as many as six night meetings and four nights and that kind of toll it has taken a toll on me.

1595
02:15:01,532 --> 02:15:05,634
[SPEAKER_15]: I currently serve on the permanent town building committee which meets two Tuesdays a month.

1596
02:15:06,194 --> 02:15:13,877
[SPEAKER_15]: I serve on the capital budget committee meeting committee which meets two Thursdays a month from from the beginning of September until sometime in March.

1597
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:18,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm expected to attend as many nights of town meeting as they feel is appropriate.

1598
02:15:19,816 --> 02:15:22,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to go to the finance committee whenever they ask.

1599
02:15:22,739 --> 02:15:28,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that we're having building projects coming online, I'll be expected to serve on the building committees, and they'll meet opposite Tuesdays.

1600
02:15:28,525 --> 02:15:30,928
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we haven't even gotten into subcommittees.

1601
02:15:31,673 --> 02:15:35,196
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was really curious about this.

1602
02:15:35,236 --> 02:15:36,838
[SPEAKER_15]: And Pat knows I was always at Maslow.

1603
02:15:36,858 --> 02:15:37,879
[SPEAKER_15]: How many meetings do you have?

1604
02:15:37,939 --> 02:15:38,880
[SPEAKER_15]: How many meetings do you have?

1605
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:48,989
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what I figured out is that with town meeting styles of governance, it's typical 25 to 35, 30 to 35 being fairly typical.

1606
02:15:49,449 --> 02:15:52,752
[SPEAKER_15]: And city styles of government, it's 20 to 25 night meetings a year.

1607
02:15:53,352 --> 02:15:55,094
[SPEAKER_15]: In Arlington, I generally average 70.

1608
02:15:56,095 --> 02:15:57,756
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've had years where I've been above 100.

1609
02:15:59,162 --> 02:16:05,891
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I were a night person and I was happy to be up late, that would be different.

1610
02:16:06,011 --> 02:16:08,395
[SPEAKER_15]: But I feel like in the seven years I've been there.

1611
02:16:09,383 --> 02:16:13,804
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty much in a chronic state of exhaustion from September until the end of town meeting in May or June.

1612
02:16:14,465 --> 02:16:19,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I try desperately to catch up in the summer when things come back online, and then it starts again.

1613
02:16:20,166 --> 02:16:23,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have heard about town meetings in Arlington, so.

1614
02:16:24,208 --> 02:16:33,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I did want to ask you one thing about your resume, and I'm not even sure if you know this, but under every single job experience you've had, it says, please do not contact this employer.

1615
02:16:35,818 --> 02:16:39,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And mostly because people have retired or left or are no longer with the company.

1616
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:45,701
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more like, I don't want you chasing dead ends.

1617
02:16:45,741 --> 02:16:48,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I worked for Susan Posner at GBH in the budget office for several years.

1618
02:16:49,282 --> 02:16:53,583
[SPEAKER_15]: She left GBH before I did, and I don't know her whereabouts now.

1619
02:16:53,984 --> 02:16:56,804
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really more of the timing and who's still there.

1620
02:16:58,465 --> 02:16:58,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1621
02:17:00,035 --> 02:17:03,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had to check references and running down long gone references.

1622
02:17:03,197 --> 02:17:04,177
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a lot of fun.

1623
02:17:04,197 --> 02:17:04,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1624
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:07,319
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a funny thing because on it, it feels kind of negative.

1625
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,841
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was why I was curious.

1626
02:17:10,221 --> 02:17:10,361
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1627
02:17:10,501 --> 02:17:13,302
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's part of the default setting on School Spray.

1628
02:17:13,823 --> 02:17:16,564
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's either yay or nay.

1629
02:17:16,945 --> 02:17:17,265
[SPEAKER_15]: I got it.

1630
02:17:17,525 --> 02:17:19,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's no opportunity to say why you're saying nay?

1631
02:17:19,766 --> 02:17:19,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1632
02:17:20,286 --> 02:17:20,486
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1633
02:17:20,727 --> 02:17:21,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for explaining.

1634
02:17:21,787 --> 02:17:23,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Robert Evans, Scary Junior.

1635
02:17:24,389 --> 02:17:24,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1636
02:17:24,569 --> 02:17:26,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Johnson, describe your management style.

1637
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:27,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Well.

1638
02:17:29,637 --> 02:17:34,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I pull from two basic interests in my life, academia and athletics.

1639
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:45,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a ski instructor in the winter at Loon Mountain in New Hampshire, and I am a soccer coach for my young children and was a soccer coach for my older child.

1640
02:17:47,086 --> 02:17:47,927
[SPEAKER_15]: So I like teamwork.

1641
02:17:48,347 --> 02:17:52,109
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the sense of shared vision and building the collective to work together.

1642
02:17:53,029 --> 02:17:57,832
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have the kids for a 12-week span, you have to work really hard to get a team going quickly.

1643
02:17:58,532 --> 02:17:59,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really fun.

1644
02:17:59,972 --> 02:18:05,874
[SPEAKER_15]: When you have a collective vision, you can accomplish so much more, and with so much more fun, because you're working together.

1645
02:18:08,215 --> 02:18:13,256
[SPEAKER_15]: From the academic side, I really like to have my staff learn as much as possible and grow in their job.

1646
02:18:13,416 --> 02:18:17,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Because for me, the ultimate is to be trapped and to not be able to grow and learn new things.

1647
02:18:18,818 --> 02:18:27,560
[SPEAKER_15]: And so all of my staff at Arlington have gone through the NASBO office staff training program, except one who just joined my team.

1648
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:31,362
[SPEAKER_15]: and will be going to it.

1649
02:18:31,782 --> 02:18:39,947
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the staffers, my purchasing agent, is now MCPPO certified and goes to the MAPO meetings and takes part in that.

1650
02:18:40,448 --> 02:18:43,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really try to encourage professional development.

1651
02:18:44,090 --> 02:18:57,458
[SPEAKER_19]: What initiatives have you fostered to help your teammates, your colleagues at work, gain in service training or knowledge above and beyond what they would normally do in their job position?

1652
02:18:58,116 --> 02:19:03,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we, as I said, we've taken advantage of what the MASBO offerings.

1653
02:19:04,241 --> 02:19:08,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I encourage them, you know, if at any time they come to me and say, you know, this looks like a really neat seminar, I'd like to go to it.

1654
02:19:08,966 --> 02:19:11,708
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'll try to make funds available if it's possible.

1655
02:19:13,049 --> 02:19:19,375
[SPEAKER_15]: We've, we had a facilitator come into our staff meetings because we all pretty much agreed that our staff meetings had become dreary.

1656
02:19:19,855 --> 02:19:27,457
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we worked on a norming exercise to come up with the rules of how we wanted to conduct the meeting, and to think about what's important to us.

1657
02:19:27,577 --> 02:19:30,778
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was very clear that the rules emerged very painlessly.

1658
02:19:30,998 --> 02:19:36,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody wrote three rules on an index card, and we passed them around, and start and end on time, and things like that.

1659
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:41,722
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we decided as part of our norms that we would share the chairmanship.

1660
02:19:42,342 --> 02:19:46,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And so there's like four different roles in our staff meetings, and it shifts every week.

1661
02:19:46,903 --> 02:19:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So who's putting together the agenda and chairing the meeting?

1662
02:19:49,598 --> 02:19:55,621
[SPEAKER_15]: who's taking notes, who's doing the various tasks in the staff meeting.

1663
02:19:56,021 --> 02:19:59,942
[SPEAKER_15]: And we send out an email to everyone and say, what would you like to talk about at the staff meeting?

1664
02:19:59,962 --> 02:20:00,743
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on the agenda?

1665
02:20:01,543 --> 02:20:02,384
[SPEAKER_15]: What would you like to see?

1666
02:20:02,404 --> 02:20:06,105
[SPEAKER_15]: And the person who's facilitating it gathers that information, puts the agenda out, and we have a meeting.

1667
02:20:06,585 --> 02:20:10,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Since we did that, I think everybody enjoys the staff meetings a heck of a lot more.

1668
02:20:10,707 --> 02:20:16,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I do, because I found constantly being at the chair of a staff meeting to be tough sledding.

1669
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1670
02:20:18,603 --> 02:20:19,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Kathy Gretsch.

1671
02:20:19,965 --> 02:20:21,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, very nice to meet you.

1672
02:20:21,206 --> 02:20:21,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you.

1673
02:20:22,227 --> 02:20:22,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1674
02:20:22,548 --> 02:20:27,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So Pat, actually she oversees the payroll and we have Hopper's payroll.

1675
02:20:27,774 --> 02:20:34,942
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you feel about getting accustomed to a new payroll system, leaving Munis and transitioning over to Hopper's?

1676
02:20:35,842 --> 02:20:40,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, this will be my fourth fiscal system, major fiscal system.

1677
02:20:40,747 --> 02:20:43,090
[SPEAKER_15]: So they all kind of work the same.

1678
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:46,213
[SPEAKER_15]: The buttons might be at different spots, but they're all trying to do the same thing.

1679
02:20:46,773 --> 02:20:51,518
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it generally isn't a big problem to acclimate myself to a new system.

1680
02:20:53,180 --> 02:20:57,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And so another part of Pat's responsibility with the bus schedule is the

1681
02:20:58,759 --> 02:21:02,080
[SPEAKER_09]: the coordination of the homeless student transportation.

1682
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:04,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever been involved with anything like that?

1683
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, certainly.

1684
02:21:05,161 --> 02:21:18,504
[SPEAKER_15]: McKinney-Vento and our organization is predominantly handled through special education, mostly because in Arlington we have neighborhood schools, and so 95% of the transportation is special education transportation.

1685
02:21:19,364 --> 02:21:24,945
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've been familiar with McKinney-Vento from back in Cambridge, and more familiar with it in Arlington.

1686
02:21:26,323 --> 02:21:36,526
[SPEAKER_15]: but trying to set up systems to make sure that, you know, you find out who's the sending district and you get the cost shared down correctly and you're persistent and it's a lot of work.

1687
02:21:36,886 --> 02:21:40,948
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, I imagine Pat's set that up pretty well, so hopefully keep it going.

1688
02:21:41,588 --> 02:21:47,610
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always a challenge, though, because, you know, everybody would like to dodge the bill, so you have to be pretty zealous.

1689
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:51,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially with, well, I won't say.

1690
02:21:52,631 --> 02:21:53,352
Okay, thank you.

1691
02:21:53,612 --> 02:21:54,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1692
02:21:55,162 --> 02:21:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1693
02:21:56,902 --> 02:22:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a decentralized procurement process in Arlington, or do you answer to the town manager's office or the SCPPO?

1694
02:22:05,084 --> 02:22:06,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's kind of a split.

1695
02:22:07,765 --> 02:22:13,646
[SPEAKER_15]: It's centralized at the school level, but capital projects and construction are handled through the town site.

1696
02:22:14,867 --> 02:22:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So almost all procurement, budgetary procurement, goes on through the school system with no approval levels?

1697
02:22:21,507 --> 02:22:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: on the municipal side?

1698
02:22:23,673 --> 02:22:24,616
[SPEAKER_15]: Not entirely.

1699
02:22:27,139 --> 02:22:31,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the purchasing side does, but the payable side goes through the comptroller.

1700
02:22:31,462 --> 02:22:38,967
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's one comptroller who handles the final step of the payables, and the treasurer's office is responsible for issuing the checks.

1701
02:22:39,827 --> 02:22:42,129
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where the overlap is there.

1702
02:22:42,489 --> 02:22:49,514
[SPEAKER_15]: But the purchasing office on the town side is one guy, and the purchasing office on the school side is my staffer and me.

1703
02:22:49,634 --> 02:22:52,476
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not, we talk a lot.

1704
02:22:53,249 --> 02:22:56,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So you put together RFPs, RFIs, all sorts of different.

1705
02:22:57,591 --> 02:23:10,355
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been part of, and though I haven't done construction bidding, I've been part of pre-certification and designer selection and been on the permanent town building committee for a number of years.

1706
02:23:10,375 --> 02:23:12,616
[SPEAKER_15]: I was on the Thompson building committee with the MSBA.

1707
02:23:13,496 --> 02:23:16,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm on the building committee for the high school.

1708
02:23:16,178 --> 02:23:17,039
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just been picked up.

1709
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:24,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I was the point person on the application for the high school, and we got it in the second round, which I don't know whether that's... Congratulations.

1710
02:23:24,305 --> 02:23:24,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1711
02:23:24,985 --> 02:23:30,670
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know whether that's a tribute to the writing or to the dilapidation of our building, but either way, we're in the system.

1712
02:23:31,741 --> 02:23:33,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the last project that you worked on?

1713
02:23:34,604 --> 02:23:41,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, still working on the Thompson is finished, but we have to put a sixth classroom addition on it because it's too small.

1714
02:23:41,791 --> 02:23:46,816
[SPEAKER_15]: We're rehabbing the Stratton building, which is the last of our seven elementary schools to get a full rehab.

1715
02:23:47,297 --> 02:23:51,301
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're bringing a old middle school that's been out of service for 30 years.

1716
02:23:51,321 --> 02:23:53,223
[SPEAKER_15]: We're renovating it to bring it back into service.

1717
02:23:54,064 --> 02:23:59,449
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have experienced pretty tremendous enrollment growth.

1718
02:23:59,909 --> 02:24:07,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Arlington was designed, when they started the rebuilding process, they had 4,200 students and it had been fairly stable.

1719
02:24:07,777 --> 02:24:11,220
[SPEAKER_15]: We're now at 5,400 students and projected to continue to climb.

1720
02:24:12,101 --> 02:24:14,143
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's been a real challenge.

1721
02:24:14,648 --> 02:24:18,590
[SPEAKER_07]: How many unions do you work with in the school department?

1722
02:24:18,670 --> 02:24:32,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Teachers, clerical, bus drivers, traffic supervisors, custodians, senior maintenance people, and the administrators union.

1723
02:24:33,239 --> 02:24:34,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's them.

1724
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:35,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a member of the bargaining team?

1725
02:24:38,181 --> 02:24:38,661
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends.

1726
02:24:39,741 --> 02:24:43,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Typically on the teacher negotiations, I tend to provide the analytic work.

1727
02:24:43,922 --> 02:24:48,423
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm sort of bringing the financials to the table or making financial proposals.

1728
02:24:48,824 --> 02:24:50,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not usually in every session.

1729
02:24:51,264 --> 02:24:55,285
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an HR director now in Arlington, and so he is at the table for all of them.

1730
02:24:55,845 --> 02:25:01,046
[SPEAKER_15]: In our last clerical contract negotiations, I was at the table with two school committee members and the HR director.

1731
02:25:01,927 --> 02:25:07,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And we finally got something done that we've been trying for many years, and we finally accomplished it.

1732
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:08,971
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a good feeling.

1733
02:25:09,751 --> 02:25:11,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of sweat equity when you're at the table.

1734
02:25:11,373 --> 02:25:11,993
[SPEAKER_15]: For sure.

1735
02:25:12,854 --> 02:25:18,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one, just to spoof up some of the earlier questions, have you ever seen the admins financial package?

1736
02:25:18,678 --> 02:25:19,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't.

1737
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:20,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not.

1738
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:23,843
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, as I say, I've had experience with several, so.

1739
02:25:24,003 --> 02:25:25,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been part of any conversions?

1740
02:25:25,984 --> 02:25:26,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1741
02:25:26,825 --> 02:25:27,525
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was at

1742
02:25:28,642 --> 02:25:37,646
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was in Channel 2, they went from an in-house program system to Lawson Insight, and we developed our own grants management module working with consultants.

1743
02:25:37,706 --> 02:25:39,967
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were really, we were supposed to be beta testing it.

1744
02:25:40,007 --> 02:25:42,028
[SPEAKER_15]: We were, it was worse than beta.

1745
02:25:42,128 --> 02:25:43,708
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were really deep in that.

1746
02:25:44,469 --> 02:25:47,990
[SPEAKER_15]: And then when I went to Cambridge, they were converting to PeopleSoft.

1747
02:25:48,590 --> 02:25:51,272
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was part of the ramp up of PeopleSoft over there.

1748
02:25:51,352 --> 02:25:52,292
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you like PeopleSoft?

1749
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:58,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Pros and cons.

1750
02:25:58,726 --> 02:26:04,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I developed some real Excel compensatory skills, but they've served me well over the years.

1751
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:09,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Any financial system that works logically, once you figure out the internal logic of it, it's fine.

1752
02:26:10,758 --> 02:26:17,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And in this day and age, all systems can be convinced to export the data into Excel, so then you can do whatever you need to do.

1753
02:26:18,002 --> 02:26:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little more tricky.

1754
02:26:19,323 --> 02:26:24,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them don't like to ingest the data, so preferably they export and import.

1755
02:26:25,306 --> 02:26:25,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1756
02:26:25,947 --> 02:26:26,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1757
02:26:27,287 --> 02:26:29,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other questions anyone would like to ask?

1758
02:26:30,089 --> 02:26:30,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

1759
02:26:31,850 --> 02:26:33,911
[SPEAKER_14]: You gave us a number of students in Arlington.

1760
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:34,651
[SPEAKER_14]: What is their budget?

1761
02:26:37,317 --> 02:26:40,451
[SPEAKER_15]: We are at well, I should say that

1762
02:26:42,543 --> 02:26:48,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Health insurance for both retirees and active employees is on the town side, and so isn't considered part of our budget.

1763
02:26:49,066 --> 02:26:50,747
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're around $62 million all in.

1764
02:26:51,347 --> 02:26:54,449
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be grants, revolving, and general fund.

1765
02:26:54,489 --> 02:26:56,290
[SPEAKER_15]: General fund's about $57 million this year.

1766
02:26:56,390 --> 02:27:01,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wondered, in terms of the transportation routes, you mentioned special ed, which I'll set aside.

1767
02:27:01,412 --> 02:27:10,157
[SPEAKER_15]: But in terms of the other routes in the city, the only mandatory route we have is to take some students in the sixth grade from the east end of town up to the middle school.

1768
02:27:11,157 --> 02:27:27,288
[SPEAKER_15]: okay everybody else is within walking distance of their elementary school so you know we have no mandatory elementary transportation we do provide a bus for a fee for one elementary school which was a deal that was made when they closed the former elementary school what's the fee?

1769
02:27:29,109 --> 02:27:29,650
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's

1770
02:27:31,747 --> 02:27:35,210
[SPEAKER_15]: 225 for a single and 325 for a family.

1771
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:36,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, interesting.

1772
02:27:36,411 --> 02:27:44,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and I guess the last question is I'd like you to tell me about a difficult situation which you faced in Arlington and how you resolved it.

1773
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:46,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Fiscal?

1774
02:27:46,961 --> 02:27:47,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Behavioral?

1775
02:27:48,042 --> 02:27:48,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to let you pick.

1776
02:27:49,203 --> 02:27:49,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

1777
02:27:49,743 --> 02:27:53,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1778
02:28:03,682 --> 02:28:05,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is smooth in Arlington.

1779
02:28:05,343 --> 02:28:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you figured it?

1780
02:28:06,983 --> 02:28:08,644
[SPEAKER_15]: No, really, it's my harassment of riches.

1781
02:28:08,724 --> 02:28:16,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to figure out which one's going to show me in the best possible light.

1782
02:28:16,067 --> 02:28:18,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'll go for the low-hanging fruit.

1783
02:28:18,508 --> 02:28:20,808
[SPEAKER_15]: When I arrived in Arlington, I inherited a budget.

1784
02:28:20,828 --> 02:28:21,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I arrived in September.

1785
02:28:22,549 --> 02:28:31,252
[SPEAKER_15]: And I inherited a deficit budget, which was not readily apparent because the existing chart of accounts had so blurred and obscured things.

1786
02:28:31,312 --> 02:28:32,793
[SPEAKER_15]: And customary practice at the time

1787
02:28:33,351 --> 02:28:42,995
[SPEAKER_15]: was not to direct expense to grants, but rather to expense it all to the general fund and then JE it into the grants, which I knew from my experience was an extreme no-no, but that's the way they had always done it.

1788
02:28:43,775 --> 02:28:47,777
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was really hard to figure out exactly how big a problem it was.

1789
02:28:48,197 --> 02:28:49,478
[SPEAKER_15]: I struggled mightily.

1790
02:28:50,078 --> 02:28:56,200
[SPEAKER_15]: And being a brand new school business administrator, I wasn't eager to stand up and say, gee whiz, I can't make heads or tails of this, but I think it looks bad.

1791
02:28:56,880 --> 02:28:59,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to look like I knew what I was doing.

1792
02:29:00,942 --> 02:29:19,030
[SPEAKER_15]: So I knew it was bad, and after a month there, I put a non-essential purchasing freeze on everything, and I did all I could to sort it out, but it was not very easy, and while it was communicated, it was not communicated as widely as it should have been.

1793
02:29:19,650 --> 02:29:25,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Arlington and their many committees, there's an expectation of communication at a level that coming from a city government was bizarre to me.

1794
02:29:26,417 --> 02:29:33,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, you know, people got left out of the loop, not out of malice, but more out of Diane coming from the city side, where if you told this person, then that was sufficient.

1795
02:29:34,816 --> 02:29:38,999
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a very ugly time when that all, and the auditors came and said, ah.

1796
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:41,801
[SPEAKER_15]: But we got it sorted out.

1797
02:29:42,341 --> 02:29:49,546
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the process of struggling with FY10, I had arranged the FY11 budget to work on very different stuff.

1798
02:29:49,606 --> 02:29:53,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I implemented a new chart of accounts, which is a total no-no in your first year as a business manager anywhere.

1799
02:29:54,169 --> 02:29:55,069
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was necessary.

1800
02:29:55,149 --> 02:29:56,970
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had to get some order out of there.

1801
02:29:57,511 --> 02:30:00,292
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were able to write the, you know,

1802
02:30:01,453 --> 02:30:03,515
[SPEAKER_15]: really drastic cuts to get back on track.

1803
02:30:03,775 --> 02:30:07,157
[SPEAKER_15]: We figured out where the revenue projections had been grossly overstated.

1804
02:30:07,757 --> 02:30:20,105
[SPEAKER_15]: We got it together and so in FY11 when they had a special town meeting to address the deficit issue, and of course they took back the amount of the deficit out of our current year expenditure, we did not have to make any additional cuts.

1805
02:30:20,606 --> 02:30:24,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I had worked it out so that the deficit was completely covered out of the current year.

1806
02:30:25,889 --> 02:30:35,113
[SPEAKER_15]: everything came out clean, it was a lot of drama, it was very stressful, and it has absolutely put, burned into my heart that I will never run a deficit budget.

1807
02:30:35,453 --> 02:30:42,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Hadn't even been my budget, which was the part that was really tough to be blamed for something that I had inherited, but nevertheless.

1808
02:30:43,316 --> 02:30:52,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I also learned a very important lesson that if I would ever find myself in a situation like that, I would come before the school committee and I would say, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to ask for an audit.

1809
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:54,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't figure out what's going on and I need help.

1810
02:30:55,281 --> 02:30:57,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So please get me auditors in here so we can figure this out.

1811
02:30:58,324 --> 02:31:00,446
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the big mistake I made as a rookie.

1812
02:31:01,246 --> 02:31:04,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And had I to do it over again, I would certainly do that.

1813
02:31:04,449 --> 02:31:12,215
[SPEAKER_15]: But of course now, when I go looking for new jobs, I'm carefully investigating the fiscal solvency of a community before I throw my application in.

1814
02:31:12,255 --> 02:31:15,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm not going to make that mistake a second time.

1815
02:31:15,318 --> 02:31:16,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane, you know our motto, right?

1816
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:18,641
[SPEAKER_14]: On time and on budget.

1817
02:31:19,221 --> 02:31:20,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

1818
02:31:20,702 --> 02:31:21,523
[SPEAKER_14]: After my own heart.

1819
02:31:25,997 --> 02:31:27,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Under budget is what I like.

1820
02:31:32,761 --> 02:31:34,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reached that point of the evening.

1821
02:31:34,562 --> 02:31:35,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sum it all up with another question.

1822
02:31:35,622 --> 02:31:45,587
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached that point of the evening, Diane, where you get to tell us something we haven't asked you that you want us to know, or to sum it all up and tell us why you're the best person for this job.

1823
02:31:47,588 --> 02:31:50,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's lots of things I could tell you.

1824
02:31:50,810 --> 02:31:54,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I carefully wrote down answers to all the questions I received ahead of time.

1825
02:31:55,240 --> 02:32:01,744
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually delighted that you went off book because I feel a lot more comfortable answering the questions like this than trying to figure out should I read it, should I answer it?

1826
02:32:02,165 --> 02:32:02,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1827
02:32:07,788 --> 02:32:10,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'll just read my closing statement, if that's okay.

1828
02:32:11,651 --> 02:32:13,412
[SPEAKER_15]: I see government service as a relay race.

1829
02:32:13,933 --> 02:32:20,217
[SPEAKER_15]: You take the baton from the person before you, do your best to improve it while you have it, then make a clean pass to the person after you.

1830
02:32:21,309 --> 02:32:23,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I was lucky to get such a great pass from Jim Connery.

1831
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:25,711
[SPEAKER_15]: He showed me the wisdom of succession planning.

1832
02:32:27,192 --> 02:32:29,533
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been very fortunate with Superintendent Belson.

1833
02:32:30,093 --> 02:32:32,534
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a fiscally stable, well-run district.

1834
02:32:32,974 --> 02:32:35,635
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be very difficult to replace him once he retires.

1835
02:32:36,796 --> 02:32:39,137
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no substitute for knowledgeable experience.

1836
02:32:40,077 --> 02:32:42,158
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can help with the transition to new leadership.

1837
02:32:42,839 --> 02:32:50,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Since your existing systems function appropriately right now, I can take the time to build relationships around the district and learn as much as I can from everyone.

1838
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:56,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I can begin the process of holding institutional memory and become a resource to those who come later.

1839
02:32:57,116 --> 02:33:04,303
[SPEAKER_15]: With my mix of urban and suburban experience, I bring a background that will be sensitive to the cultural diversity and unique needs of Medford.

1840
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:10,249
[SPEAKER_15]: I would welcome the opportunity to work with Superintendent Belson, his administrative team, and all of you.

1841
02:33:11,270 --> 02:33:14,273
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that you'll choose me to be your next Director of Finance and Administration.

1842
02:33:15,274 --> 02:33:15,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1843
02:33:23,167 --> 02:33:24,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.
