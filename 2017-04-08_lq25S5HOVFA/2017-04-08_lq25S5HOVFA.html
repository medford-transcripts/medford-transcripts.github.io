    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=90.493s">There's</a>  not.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=93.315s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=98.899s">I</a>  don't have anything.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=100.82s">But</a>  he sent me something at the email late this afternoon.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=105.103s">It's</a>  an item for community participation, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=118.097s">Good</a>  evening, Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=119.738s">My</a>  name is Joe Villione. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=121.479s">I</a>  reside at 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=124.981s">And</a>  thank you for hearing the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=127.822s">Again,</a>  education over at Somerville TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=131.684s">We're</a>  now taping my TV show inside my radio show. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=134.726s">So</a>  we have a TV program and a radio program. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=137.907s">My</a>  goal for Medford, of course, is to expand access TV for all the residents so that we're not restricted to certain times <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=147.232s">At</a>  the high school, and I believe as Arlington has we need to have a satellite station Somewhere centrally located as Mayor McGlynn's tribunal suggested and I want to help the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=160.097s">I</a>  want to help the mayor I want to help the community in this endeavor because I started in access in 1979 and <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=167.129s">And</a>  I think it's unarguable. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=168.89s">I</a>  have more experience and more memberships and access than possibly anyone in the entire city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=174.913s">I</a>  want to help my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=177.154s">So</a>  my question to the city school committee is, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=182.105s">What</a>  is the hard date for opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=183.786s">Is</a>  it the end of April? <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=184.927s">Because</a>  I was talking to Mr. Belson and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=188.569s">Van</a>  der Kloot, and they informed me that it would probably be finished by the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=193.713s">I</a>  want to know when we can implement this for the community, when we can bring in the educational component so that citizens can learn computers, be it Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=207.702s">This</a>  is the amazing thing we've been missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=210.482s">We've</a>  been missing it in Medford for the entirety of the time we've been paying for AXS TV, because at the old station, it was never properly taught. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=219.48s">And</a>  now with the station being shut down from around July of 2014, I believe, we've now had three years in limbo where our football games, our athletics, our political speech, everything has just been kind of in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=236.378s">I</a>  want to help open the light, open the door, bring some transparency, so can anyone tell me <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=242.042s">what</a>  our next phase is.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=243.563s">We</a>  do not have a set date when we will be doing our ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=247.085s">However,</a>  we do anticipate the contractor to be completed the end of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=251.288s">However,</a>  as people are aware, there's generally a punch list that goes with those. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=254.93s">So</a>  once we finish off the punch list, then we will determine a date.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=259.133s">And</a>  can we expand it a little so that we have a satellite?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=262.235s">That</a>  is not school committee purview.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=265.017s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=266.478s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=268.575s">Report</a>  of superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=269.859s">Report</a>  on SBIRT program. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=275.476s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=277.58s">Mayor</a>  and members of the school committee, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services, is with us this evening for three different reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=285.384s">This</a>  particular report is particularly significant, since you may have seen some items in the newspaper today, as latest today, about opiate issues in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=295.389s">And</a>  Tony has prepared a report based on our initial screening on this pilot program, and I think it should be of strong interest to us with regard to how we're looking at screening our young people.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=307.862s">Good</a>  evening, mayor, superintendent, school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=312.171s">I</a>  think I'm one of your main attractions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=314.656s">I'm</a>  up for three reports, so I hope you find them interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=319.203s">So</a>  the SBIRT screening, we know in January of 2016, the governor enacted a law, signed a law, requiring all grade 9 and grade 7 students to be screened. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=331.211s">The</a>  law stated that in the school year 2016 to 17, that all schools screen grade 9 students and then the following school year add grade 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=342.67s">The</a>  law is called an Act Relative to Preventing Adolescent Substance Abuse by Expanding SBIRT. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=350.497s">SBIRT</a>  is a screening questionnaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=353.039s">I've</a>  given you information in the past on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=356.062s">It</a>  uses what is called the CRAFT tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=360.266s">It's</a>  a preventative model looking at identifying students early who are starting to think about <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=369.405s">use</a>  risky behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=371.767s">So</a>  this year was our maiden voyage. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=375.569s">We</a>  sent out information, a letter home to all grade nine parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=380.072s">Parents</a>  had the option to opt out of the screening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=383.795s">And</a>  out of all of our students, only five parents opted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=387.858s">So</a>  we were very encouraged by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=389.779s">We</a>  felt that was hitting on an informational need that parents had. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=395.152s">We</a>  did the screening in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=397.633s">It</a>  was a team effort between school nurses, guidance Councilors, adjustment Councilors, and school psychologists. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=403.856s">And</a>  we screened 316 grade nine students in three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=410.478s">So</a>  all the screenings were done in a confidential place. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=415.22s">We</a>  used the gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=416.441s">And</a>  we had set up four different screening stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=422.259s">It</a>  was a one-on-one session, and when every student left, he or she received an educational resource about if you're worried about yourself or another student, these are the people within the school that you can contact for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=437.983s">I</a>  did provide a table that summarized the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=445.185s">And</a>  316, as I said, were screened. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=447.486s">277</a>  grade nine students exhibited no high-risk behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=453.927s">So</a>  at that point, they received positive reinforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=457.808s">The</a>  screener would say, I'm really proud that you have made healthy lifestyle choices, and we'd like to see you continue that through your high school years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=467.812s">If</a>  you need to talk to anybody, this is who you can come talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=471.836s">Thirty-nine</a>  screened had at least one positive response. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=478.862s">Of</a>  those thirty-nine, the most common positive response was that they rode in a car with somebody who had been drinking or using drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=488.771s">Depending</a>  on, let's say if you look at the craft tool, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=492.028s">there's</a>  a number of questions on part B. So depending on their score on part B, that score dictate the next step, which for 32 of the students was a, um, a brief negotiated motivational interview where the screener explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=510.093s">Um,</a>  so tell me a little bit more about, you know, your answer on this question and they would probe, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=517.445s">looking</a>  for some information on a scale of 0 to 10, where do you feel you land, and then did some exploration about likelihood to implement some healthy behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=530.275s">Seven</a>  of the 39 students, by their score, required a referral to an in-school Councilor, and of those, seven, too, refused the referral. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=542.179s">So</a>  overall, we felt that our first screening was very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=547.161s">We</a>  thought that the data we received out of it supported all the data from the Community Care Survey, which has been showing the last few years a trend for lower <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=560.006s">use</a>  of substances by our high school population and more reporting of positive protective factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=568.934s">So</a>  I look at that and say, well, the efforts by, you know, people, the team Medford staff, the efforts by the Boys and Girls Club, the extracurricular activities within the high school are all doing their job as protective factors.</p>
