1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,782
[SPEAKER_09]: The meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,443
[SPEAKER_09]: The secretary will call the roll.

3
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:21,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Present, seven present, none absent.

4
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:22,993
[SPEAKER_09]: All please rise and salute our flag.

5
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:36,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

6
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:51,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Prior to the commencement of the meeting, under the open meeting law, the chair must announce to all attendees in the audience that this meeting is being filmed, and I just want to make you aware of that.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

8
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of minutes of March 20th, 2017.

[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

14
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:04,558

[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

21
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:14,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

22
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:15,747
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:17,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of payrolls.

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, second by Ms.

00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:23,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

27
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:24,668
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

28
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

29
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion carries.

31
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:30,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of secretary.

32
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:31,974
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not.

33
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:34,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of committees.

34
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,618
There's a gentleman who wants to speak.

35
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:39,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything.

36
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:40,420
I don't either.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Do I?

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,383
[SPEAKER_14]: But he sent me something at the email late this afternoon.

39
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:47,505
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an item for community participation, I believe.

40
00:01:58,097 --> 00:01:59,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Medford School Committee.

41
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:01,139
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Joe Villione.

42
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:04,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I reside at 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

43
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for hearing the public.

44
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, education over at Somerville TV.

45
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,706
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now taping my TV show inside my radio show.

46
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:17,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a TV program and a radio program.

47
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:25,792
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal for Medford, of course, is to expand access TV for all the residents so that we're not restricted to certain times

48
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:39,757
[SPEAKER_01]: At the high school, and I believe as Arlington has we need to have a satellite station Somewhere centrally located as Mayor McGlynn's tribunal suggested and I want to help the school.

49
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:45,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help the mayor I want to help the community in this endeavor because I started in access in 1979 and

50
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:48,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's unarguable.

51
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more experience and more memberships and access than possibly anyone in the entire city of Medford.

52
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help my community.

53
00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:00,636
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question to the city school committee is,

54
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,726
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the hard date for opening?

55
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:04,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the end of April?

56
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was talking to Mr. Belson and Ms.

57
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Van der Kloot, and they informed me that it would probably be finished by the end of April.

58
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:27,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know when we can implement this for the community, when we can bring in the educational component so that citizens can learn computers, be it Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, whatever.

59
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:29,684
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the amazing thing we've been missing.

60
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:38,658
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been missing it in Medford for the entirety of the time we've been paying for AXS TV, because at the old station, it was never properly taught.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:55,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with the station being shut down from around July of 2014, I believe, we've now had three years in limbo where our football games, our athletics, our political speech, everything has just been kind of in the dark.

62
00:03:56,378 --> 00:04:01,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help open the light, open the door, bring some transparency, so can anyone tell me

63
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,263
[SPEAKER_01]: what our next phase is.

64
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:06,945
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have a set date when we will be doing our ribbon cutting.

65
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,968
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we do anticipate the contractor to be completed the end of April.

66
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:14,530
[SPEAKER_09]: However, as people are aware, there's generally a punch list that goes with those.

67
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So once we finish off the punch list, then we will determine a date.

68
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we expand it a little so that we have a satellite?

69
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:23,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not school committee purview.

70
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:25,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

71
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:26,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

72
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:29,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of superintendent.

73
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on SBIRT program.

74
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

75
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor and members of the school committee, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services, is with us this evening for three different reports.

76
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:54,729
[SPEAKER_14]: This particular report is particularly significant, since you may have seen some items in the newspaper today, as latest today, about opiate issues in Massachusetts.

77
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:05,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tony has prepared a report based on our initial screening on this pilot program, and I think it should be of strong interest to us with regard to how we're looking at screening our young people.

78
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:10,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, mayor, superintendent, school committee members.

79
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,636
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I'm one of your main attractions tonight.

80
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:18,483
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm up for three reports, so I hope you find them interesting.

81
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:30,411
[SPEAKER_20]: So the SBIRT screening, we know in January of 2016, the governor enacted a law, signed a law, requiring all grade 9 and grade 7 students to be screened.

82
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:40,518
[SPEAKER_20]: The law stated that in the school year 2016 to 17, that all schools screen grade 9 students and then the following school year add grade 7.

83
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:50,077
[SPEAKER_20]: The law is called an Act Relative to Preventing Adolescent Substance Abuse by Expanding SBIRT.

84
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:52,258
[SPEAKER_20]: SBIRT is a screening questionnaire.

85
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,742
[SPEAKER_20]: I've given you information in the past on that.

86
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:00,246
[SPEAKER_20]: It uses what is called the CRAFT tool.

87
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:07,932
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a preventative model looking at identifying students early who are starting to think about

88
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,786
[SPEAKER_20]: use risky behaviors.

89
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:15,109
[SPEAKER_20]: So this year was our maiden voyage.

90
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,592
[SPEAKER_20]: We sent out information, a letter home to all grade nine parents.

91
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:23,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Parents had the option to opt out of the screening.

92
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:27,757
[SPEAKER_20]: And out of all of our students, only five parents opted out.

93
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,419
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were very encouraged by that.

94
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:34,122
[SPEAKER_20]: We felt that was hitting on an informational need that parents had.

95
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,553
[SPEAKER_20]: We did the screening in January.

96
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:43,435
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a team effort between school nurses, guidance Councilors, adjustment Councilors, and school psychologists.

97
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:47,677
[SPEAKER_20]: And we screened 316 grade nine students in three days.

98
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,180
[SPEAKER_20]: So all the screenings were done in a confidential place.

99
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,381
[SPEAKER_20]: We used the gymnasium.

100
00:06:56,441 --> 00:07:00,122
[SPEAKER_20]: And we had set up four different screening stations.

101
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:16,340
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a one-on-one session, and when every student left, he or she received an educational resource about if you're worried about yourself or another student, these are the people within the school that you can contact for help.

102
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:25,165
[SPEAKER_20]: I did provide a table that summarized the results.

103
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,945
[SPEAKER_20]: And 316, as I said, were screened.

104
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:32,567
[SPEAKER_20]: 277 grade nine students exhibited no high-risk behaviors.

105
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:37,408
[SPEAKER_20]: So at that point, they received positive reinforcement.

106
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:47,031
[SPEAKER_20]: The screener would say, I'm really proud that you have made healthy lifestyle choices, and we'd like to see you continue that through your high school years.

107
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:50,675
[SPEAKER_20]: If you need to talk to anybody, this is who you can come talk to.

108
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:56,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Thirty-nine screened had at least one positive response.

109
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:07,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Of those thirty-nine, the most common positive response was that they rode in a car with somebody who had been drinking or using drugs.

110
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Depending on, let's say if you look at the craft tool,

111
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:29,353
[SPEAKER_20]: there's a number of questions on part B. So depending on their score on part B, that score dictate the next step, which for 32 of the students was a, um, a brief negotiated motivational interview where the screener explored.

112
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:36,455
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so tell me a little bit more about, you know, your answer on this question and they would probe, um,

113
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:48,834
[SPEAKER_20]: looking for some information on a scale of 0 to 10, where do you feel you land, and then did some exploration about likelihood to implement some healthy behaviors.

114
00:08:50,275 --> 00:09:00,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Seven of the 39 students, by their score, required a referral to an in-school Councilor, and of those, seven, too, refused the referral.

115
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:06,381
[SPEAKER_20]: So overall, we felt that our first screening was very positive.

116
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:19,406
[SPEAKER_20]: We thought that the data we received out of it supported all the data from the Community Care Survey, which has been showing the last few years a trend for lower

117
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:28,273
[SPEAKER_20]: use of substances by our high school population and more reporting of positive protective factors.

118
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:42,825
[SPEAKER_20]: So I look at that and say, well, the efforts by, you know, people, the team Medford staff, the efforts by the Boys and Girls Club, the extracurricular activities within the high school are all doing their job as protective factors.

119
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:44,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

120
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:45,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

121
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, did you have a question on this?

122
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,029
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't.

123
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:48,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Tony.

124
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:50,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

125
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:51,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

126
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,343
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I want to say thank you to you and your staff for implementing this in such a quick way.

127
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,265
[SPEAKER_06]: 300 kids in three days is a lot to go through.

128
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:08,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that opening the communication with children in this manner is very, very positive.

129
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:14,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, if something were to come arise, you've already had that initial contact with somebody.

130
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:20,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might feel comfortable going to them, even for other issues that might come about.

131
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think that the process is good for all our children.

132
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad so many participated.

133
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of the 32, my concern was, OK,

134
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:32,434
[SPEAKER_06]: do we notify parents?

135
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,475
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we do that?

136
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:38,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's confidential, but like, especially those seven students that some red flags were drawn.

137
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It is confidential.

138
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:49,351
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um, the, at the only point where, where we would cross the threshold for notifying parents would be if the student demonstrated, um,

139
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,375
[SPEAKER_20]: potential for harm to themselves or others.

140
00:10:54,956 --> 00:11:04,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we going back as, as confidential employees or nurses or guidance Councilors to check on those students in like a few months and just say, Hey, how's everything?

141
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:08,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Those students are students that are already met.

142
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:13,410
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of them are already followed by, um, staff within the school.

143
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,615
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do have ongoing relationships that are being, um, built and being fostered and,

144
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:23,177
[SPEAKER_20]: So that connection is there.

145
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:26,980
[SPEAKER_20]: So we feel that that breeds the follow-up.

146
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

147
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:32,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially for the two students that refused the referral.

148
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,027
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't want anybody to fall through the cracks.

149
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that's not happening.

150
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:41,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you again, and I think that conversation with seventh graders is appropriate.

151
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:42,906
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be next year.

152
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:43,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

153
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also think that open that line of communications very early with children, you know, they're mature, they're seeing stuff that we don't even know that they're seeing in middle school.

154
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's good to acknowledge it and talk about it.

155
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:57,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report.

156
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to accept.

157
00:11:59,178 --> 00:11:59,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

158
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:00,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

159
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:01,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Cono.

160
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:02,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

161
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:11,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the total screenings that that came out was a total of 39, seven students came forward for you to know who they were, correct?

162
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:12,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

163
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the 32, what do we do with them?

164
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,777
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't come forward, how do we try to help them?

165
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:30,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, see, by virtue of the law, there is no mechanism to place any follow-up in a student's medical record or health record that we keep.

166
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:35,574
[SPEAKER_20]: the basis of the law was complete confidentiality.

167
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:40,997
[SPEAKER_20]: So no, I, those seven students or those 39 students, I do not know who they are.

168
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:41,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

169
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:42,898
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do we do?

170
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:45,980
[SPEAKER_20]: So, well, we keep on reinforcing what we reinforce.

171
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

172
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,863
[SPEAKER_20]: And you, you reinforce the positive, the positive protective factors.

173
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,304
[SPEAKER_20]: You make known who are your supports within the school.

174
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,986
[SPEAKER_20]: You keep building and working on relationships.

175
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:00,748
[SPEAKER_20]: That type of disclosure is, is relationship based.

176
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:01,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

177
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a very delicate line.

178
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:08,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as a parent, yes, you want to know, but we're also trying to get the trust of the students.

179
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:17,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have the seven that have come forward, what you want, what we're hoping to do is have that, the loyalty and the, uh,

180
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:33,648
[SPEAKER_08]: confidentiality so maybe those seven could hopefully give us maybe or have the other students say you know listen it's working no one is really saying anything about us we're going to counseling and we're helping you know if you want to go the door is open

181
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,810
[SPEAKER_20]: The students had very good feedback.

182
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:52,148
[SPEAKER_20]: My role during the screening was an escort, so I made sure I escorted the students from the health and fitness class to the screening area and then back to class, so we knew that they got back into class.

183
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:55,792
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of them had very positive comments to say.

184
00:13:56,922 --> 00:13:57,783
[SPEAKER_20]: That wasn't bad.

185
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,746
[SPEAKER_20]: I enjoyed talking to that person.

186
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,507
[SPEAKER_20]: I never met him before.

187
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:02,809
[SPEAKER_20]: It was really nice to meet him.

188
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,213
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I heard a lot of nice feedback.

189
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:13,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And the referrals for the counseling, is it strictly whoever is in our school or is it even outside counseling?

190
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, again, that goes on tiered intervention.

191
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:23,227
[SPEAKER_20]: The seven that we referred to an in-school Councilor, that was the level that they met by their scores.

192
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:31,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Had we had students that had an elevated score, we would have referred them to the SAFE project, which is through the Institute of Health and Recovery.

193
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,452
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have a SAFE project Councilor that is available to come to the school to do on-site counseling.

194
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:38,772
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.

195
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:39,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

196
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for all the work.

197
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:43,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as my colleagues have said, three days to put this together.

198
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:44,334
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of work.

199
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:46,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

200
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:47,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Kreatz.

201
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:48,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Ms.

202
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:49,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Pinto, thank you for the report.

203
00:14:50,854 --> 00:15:12,101
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to know, because I was at the DARE program at the elementary school last week and it just got me thinking after reading this report, I wanted to know if maybe with the cooperation, like with the team Medford, if we could do maybe a similar like presentation, maybe in the Cameron Theater,

204
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:23,247
[SPEAKER_18]: for maybe the incoming freshmen and the outgoing seniors to educate them again at the high school level on drinking and driving.

205
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:30,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there's the seminar for driving distracted, but that covers texting, being distracted.

206
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:38,934
[SPEAKER_18]: I noticed in this report that the most frequently reported risky behavior was ridden in a car with someone who was drinking or using drugs.

207
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:55,653
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know with the new, how the marijuana is now legal, I wasn't sure if maybe we needed to do like an upgraded training program to educate the students on, you know, the dangers of, you know, smoking marijuana, drinking and driving.

208
00:15:57,002 --> 00:16:01,424
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was really thinking about that and brainstorming and wanted to ask you about that.

209
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:08,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, all of those components are rolled into the Michigan model health curriculum that Rachel Perry has spoken about.

210
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:20,793
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition, actually today at our community-based justice meeting at the high school, we were talking with the district attorneys for setting up

211
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,519
[SPEAKER_20]: pre-prom education seminars.

212
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,104
[SPEAKER_20]: So they come and they provide an assembly to students prior to the junior and senior prom.

213
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:40,290
[SPEAKER_20]: That reinforces, again, healthy decision making and shares the dangers of all of those things.

214
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

215
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,850
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

216
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

217
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:42,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

218
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:44,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

219
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:44,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

220
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:45,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

221
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:57,317
[SPEAKER_21]: As I reflect on this, I think exactly what Kathy picked up was the thing that most concerns me, that 32 out of 39 kids reported that they had been in a car where they knew that someone had been drinking or using drugs.

222
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:03,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Just about two months, within the last two to three months, a young Stoneham teenager lost her life.

223
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:18,603
[SPEAKER_21]: And prior, I know many of the kids who were friends are in her class, and sadly, prior to that, and fortunately, there were other students in the car who had gotten out before she had her tragic accident.

224
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:23,843
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that that's the piece here we're talking about, ninth graders, that we really need.

225
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,764
[SPEAKER_21]: By the junior and senior prom, it's really too late.

226
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:29,925
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the piece that we really need to target.

227
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:30,745
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

228
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:36,227
[SPEAKER_20]: And well, I said that's the health and fitness classes are in grade 9 and 10.

229
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:40,709
[SPEAKER_20]: So a lot of that material they're receiving early on in high school.

230
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,471
[SPEAKER_20]: The Michigan model is going to be used district wide, K through 12.

231
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,572
[SPEAKER_20]: So they'll be building on those components

232
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:52,273
[SPEAKER_20]: developmentally as they age in their classes.

233
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:54,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Tony.

234
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:56,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Benedetto.

235
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:56,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

236
00:17:56,874 --> 00:18:09,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Coach Perry talking about how different things that they did at certain grade levels, and I know that drinking and driving was part of the health curriculum at this grade level.

237
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, and I don't know if it's still the case, but when I was on the Method High School PTO, they used to bring in speakers

238
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,481
[SPEAKER_06]: for different classes and different grade levels.

239
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:30,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them was yellow dress about dating violence and the other one was about alcohol awareness and driving and those type of things.

240
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could also check with the PTO and see if that is still happening.

241
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:43,472
[SPEAKER_20]: We do have, you know, we did receive the grant for the dating violence prevention and that has been an active,

242
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,671
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been active initiatives throughout the year that students are involved in.

243
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:52,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PTO used to do the yellow dress.

244
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:56,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Every other year they would alternate so that kids got different ones.

245
00:18:56,614 --> 00:19:11,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, through you to the superintendent, maybe we should check with some of our PTOs and see what they're funding throughout the community, like different programs that we would like to know, because I know the PTO at Medford High,

246
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:16,474
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we, they still do the prom dress shop that, that was started years ago.

247
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I think we're on the 11th year now.

248
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:30,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and some of the things, but can we check with them to see what the high school is offering with their PTO money as well as our elementary schools, just to see what they're supplementing for us.

249
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:38,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way at budget time we know, cause I did actually get a phone call this week about how PTOs are paying for a lot of buses for field trips.

250
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,652
[SPEAKER_06]: and about them being able to negotiate pricing for those buses and all of those things.

251
00:19:44,692 --> 00:20:08,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was going to actually talk to you about that too, but we should maybe invite the heads of PTO to one of our meetings and just talk about what they're doing for our school district so that we're aware of it and how, how, you know, we as a district appreciate the work that they're doing and the funds that they're raising as well as are aware of those programming and let them know how vital we think they are and thank them for their time.

252
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:15,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you could add that to the agenda for maybe either the next meeting or the next, you know, I'll give you time.

253
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the end of the school year, hopefully.

254
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

255
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:20,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

256
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:20,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Vento.

257
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:25,552
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place this paper on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

258
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:26,533
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

259
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:26,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

260
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:28,054
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

261
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:29,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

262
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:31,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

263
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:35,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone has made a motion for suspension of the rules to take a paper out of order.

264
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval on suspension of the rules.

265
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,620
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

266
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:39,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

267
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

268
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Suspension is granted.

269
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It's old business.

270
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the report on safe routes to school program.

271
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:57,616
[SPEAKER_09]: We are really, really proud to announce that the Brooks School has received a $920,000 grant for Safe Routes to School.

272
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:03,104
[SPEAKER_09]: They have been working on this project for the last, I think, four years, if I'm correct.

273
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've worked very, very hard to demonstrate the

274
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:12,311
[SPEAKER_09]: activity in the school, the need to get kids walking, the safe routes to get to school as well.

275
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:21,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So they've been really, really busy working on this, and we were so very proud to receive the letter from the Commonwealth of Mass, Department of Transportation, that we have been awarded this.

276
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:30,081
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have some parents in the audience that worked very, very hard that we would like to come up and say a few words about this, and then we can say thank you for all of your efforts.

277
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:31,502
[SPEAKER_09]: So Liz, would you like to come up?

278
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:33,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Liz and your daughter?

279
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,666
[SPEAKER_10]: We're very excited to receive this news.

280
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:44,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to thank Sara McGivern, who has been instrumental in this effort as well.

281
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,895
[SPEAKER_10]: been great supporting the Safe Routes to School program at the Brooks and I know other schools as well.

282
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:07,544
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could, Sarar is the Director of Mass in Motion for the City of Medford, so she gets involved with a lot of walking issues, healthy eating issues.

283
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:13,170
[SPEAKER_09]: She does a lot of different things in the community, so we're very, very happy for all of her efforts as well.

284
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:24,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yeah, so this is, you know, a long time coming, but we're excited about the changes that will be happening and we're hopeful that the other schools as well will be able to get involved.

285
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:28,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know some of the schools are already active with the Safe Roads to School.

286
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:33,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Soraya has an update for... Soraya, you want to step into the mic?

287
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:36,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Soraya McGivern, Mass in Motion Coordinator in the Board of Health.

288
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:46,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we presented to you about two winters ago just about the Safe Routes to School program and how we're encouraging students to walk and ride more.

289
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:08,419
[SPEAKER_12]: considers this a community level strategy that affects people's health because oftentimes it involves the entire family, not just the student.

290
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Parents and siblings are ending up walking or riding the bikes with the students.

291
00:23:14,485 --> 00:23:19,751
[SPEAKER_12]: It also helps improve our air quality and traffic around the schools as well.

292
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:29,166
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is why in my position that I'm funded by the state, I'm supposed to be working on this and helping the schools with the Safe Routes to School program.

293
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:43,493
[SPEAKER_12]: But the other important thing to mention that I know Superintendent Belson is really excited about too is that when the schools participate in the Safe Routes to School activities, they're eligible to apply for this funding, which is why Liz applied for funding in 2013.

294
00:23:44,113 --> 00:23:46,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And the improvements will be made in 2020.

295
00:23:48,756 --> 00:24:01,031
[SPEAKER_12]: But we really hope that the other schools, all the schools in Medford are going to be participating in the Safer2School activity soon so that we can apply and get these infrastructure improvements made around all the schools in our community.

296
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:08,156
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see from that paper that I passed out, some of the schools are participating.

297
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them are not as active yet, but they will be soon.

298
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:19,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I met with Principal DeLeva on Friday, and we're going to be doing some trainings, bike and pedestrian safety trainings at his school soon.

299
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any questions?

300
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:30,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So SORRA will be reaching out to all of the schools to get them on board, to get them really motivated to take on this task.

301
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,753
[SPEAKER_09]: And you did apply in 14, and we were just notified now.

302
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:38,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And when the state came out, they did a full assessment of the area of the Berks School.

303
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:44,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And literally from Placeton Road down Placeton all the way up to the Winthrop Street Rotary.

304
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:48,566
[SPEAKER_09]: So they looked at a wide expanse of where all the kids are coming from.

305
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And the report is amazing, the detailed work that they put together.

306
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:53,371
[SPEAKER_09]: But they will be expanding.

307
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:57,475
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing the Complete Streets project right at Alston and High, right at the corner of the Brooks.

308
00:24:57,935 --> 00:25:02,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to be expanding it up to Woburn Street and further down into the square.

309
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're taking on some of the things that we're not able to do right now.

310
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,066
[SPEAKER_09]: But $920,000 is a fabulous grant.

311
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much, Liz and your team.

312
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

313
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to thank Principal Andrews.

314
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,068
[SPEAKER_09]: He was fantastic when we worked on this grant.

315
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:39,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Also just supporting the walking program at the Brooks.

316
00:25:39,478 --> 00:25:41,519
[SPEAKER_10]: He was really on board with that.

317
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,601
[SPEAKER_10]: He was great in getting it started and now Principal Galussi will take it over and get it to completion.

318
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:47,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

319
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming Anna.

320
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

321
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:51,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any questions?

322
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:52,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

323
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:52,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

324
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:55,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think that it's important that we

325
00:25:55,945 --> 00:26:13,789
[SPEAKER_21]: note that the different sorts of things that the money is being spent on, including five foot wide concrete sidewalk and granite curbs, including ramps, pavement, mill and overlay, signs and striping, landscaping, drainage, utility improvements, school zone, flasher, traffic control.

326
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:20,151
[SPEAKER_21]: And these are the sorts of needed improvements that will make our city safer for walking.

327
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,731
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is really fantastic, and thank you so much.

328
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:24,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

329
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:25,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Mayor Burke.

330
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

331
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:34,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Through you to the superintendent, I was reading through this report and participation and goals and needs for each of the schools.

332
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:42,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the schools don't have someone, a parent that stepped up, but we still see needs at all of our schools for this project.

333
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:48,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to maybe work with our principals about making this a priority at every school.

334
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:53,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, it says near the Robert schools, they've been very excited about this for a few years.

335
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:55,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that their school

336
00:26:56,152 --> 00:27:05,902
[SPEAKER_06]: walking school bus, um, is, was always a favorite of, um, now Councilor Falco because he used to go with this family and talk to me about it a lot.

337
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I noticed that there is still some question about the crossing guard.

338
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:14,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any updates on that at all on the Fellsway?

339
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:17,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we don't have any, anything new.

340
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, we certainly talked to, uh,

341
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:24,960
[SPEAKER_14]: DCR, but there's no new commitment from them at this point in time.

342
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

343
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,743
[SPEAKER_09]: DCR is not expanding their traffic guards.

344
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:28,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

345
00:27:28,483 --> 00:27:30,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitive.

346
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:37,553
[SPEAKER_06]: In, um, through you to the mayor, well, to the mayor, um, is there, um,

347
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:41,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a need for more, like police officers, someone there in the morning?

348
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:47,978
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be reviewing that for the upcoming budget to see if there is room in any of the city-side budget or school-side budget.

349
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:49,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, that's all we can ask for.

350
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,062
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on the school side, that is on the city budget, yes.

351
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

352
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:57,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sarai's gonna be going out to the other schools too to try and motivate them a little bit more.

353
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:58,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

354
00:27:58,069 --> 00:27:58,489
[SPEAKER_09]: The principals.

355
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

356
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,639
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion to, oh, Ms.

357
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:02,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno.

358
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, to Sarah.

359
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,141
[SPEAKER_08]: The question was, first of all, congratulations to the Brooks School for all your hard work.

360
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:11,781
[SPEAKER_08]: That's incredible.

361
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:12,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It really is.

362
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,502
[SPEAKER_08]: You really should be proud of yourselves.

363
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a wonderful thing to achieve.

364
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:23,164
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is that you were saying that the other schools, would they be able to also apply for this type of funding?

365
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:27,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And since the Brooks did do it in 2014, you said, 2014, which took three years,

366
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:32,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know if the deadline and the waiting period is the same?

367
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:40,188
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, the Columbus also applied in the same year and they only grant the funding to one school per community per year.

368
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,749
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, they're eligible to apply again.

369
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:48,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, there is a new application process that I've inquired about from the state and I'm waiting for them to get back to me.

370
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we're hoping that we haven't missed the deadline for next year, but I mean, I think it's rolling and it's always going.

371
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So as soon as,

372
00:28:56,072 --> 00:29:00,156
[SPEAKER_12]: We find out about it, we're going to try to get the Roberts to apply for the next one.

373
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,277
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we'll go from there.

374
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:11,946
[SPEAKER_12]: By that time, after the Roberts does the next one, whenever the next one is, the Andrews will have been participating long enough that we think they'll be eligible.

375
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:15,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they'll be a really good candidate for obvious reasons.

376
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:16,849
[SPEAKER_12]: There's three schools right there, so.

377
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:17,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

378
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,891
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's great.

379
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:21,133
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, too, they have an idea.

380
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:33,923
[SPEAKER_08]: As my colleague said, there are some schools that have not participated and do not have anybody, so at least it gives them plenty of time to try to recruit and try to get some more information from you.

381
00:29:34,714 --> 00:29:36,495
[SPEAKER_08]: and to try to find out what the process is.

382
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great idea, and it's a great way of getting some more money for all of us.

383
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:43,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

384
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:44,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Kreatz.

385
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:45,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

386
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,462
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to thank you for the report, and it was very detailed and a great job, too, Liz.

387
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,043
[SPEAKER_18]: And to Sarad, thank you very much.

388
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,165
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to mention the point of information for Aaron.

389
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So the crossing light

390
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:08,035
[SPEAKER_18]: at the corner of the Fulton Street and Bellsway, the timing crossing was adjusted, and that was done a while ago.

391
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,058
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was the only update, yeah.

392
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:18,464
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's working, and I've crossed myself, and it gives you plenty of time to get all the way across.

393
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:20,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

394
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:22,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, yep.

395
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no problem, okay.

396
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:27,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

397
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:29,798
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place on file.

398
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:31,079
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

399
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:31,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

400
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,440
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

401
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

402
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:36,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

403
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:37,764
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

404
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:37,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

405
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:39,185
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

406
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:41,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We are now back in business.

407
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:45,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Item two, report on automated external defibrillators.

408
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:48,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Ms.

409
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:49,284
[SPEAKER_21]: Van der Kloot.

410
00:30:49,705 --> 00:31:02,816
[SPEAKER_21]: I was trying to think that perhaps it would have been nice to have our principals of the middle schools come forward so that we could approve their field trips rather than keeping them to the end of the meeting.

411
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,239
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules offered by Ms.

412
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:06,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

413
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:07,760
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

414
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,641
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

415
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:09,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Suspension is granted.

416
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: We are on item one.

417
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:15,201
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an addenda to the school committee.

418
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:19,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to approve middle school New York trips.

419
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:20,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Please see attached report.

420
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,203
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

421
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:24,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second by Ms.

422
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:24,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Vander Kloof?

423
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,145
[SPEAKER_09]: All those, motion?

424
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:29,205
[SPEAKER_21]: I did have a question.

425
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:29,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a question?

426
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:30,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

427
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:30,585
[SPEAKER_21]: Vander Kloof.

428
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:30,946
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

429
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:35,427
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that the Andrews told us the cost of the trip, but I didn't see it in the McGlynn report.

430
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:37,868
[SPEAKER_11]: It's costing $320 per student.

431
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and yours, the students go just overnight?

432
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:43,993
[SPEAKER_11]: One overnight this year, yes.

433
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,974
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the Andrews, it's two?

434
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Two overnights.

435
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:48,255
[SPEAKER_21]: So what time do they leave in the morning?

436
00:31:48,695 --> 00:31:50,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Very early, so about 5 a.m.

437
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:51,877
[SPEAKER_11]: on that Friday.

438
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and then they return?

439
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,538
[SPEAKER_11]: About 7 p.m.

440
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:56,479
[SPEAKER_11]: on Saturday.

441
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:57,498
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

442
00:31:57,558 --> 00:31:59,319
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just an interesting difference.

443
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:00,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

444
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:04,321
[SPEAKER_11]: We thought we really needed to make some adjustments to make it affordable for our students.

445
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:08,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were able to get a lot more students to participate in doing so.

446
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:11,283
[SPEAKER_11]: And they really are not losing anything on the itinerary.

447
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:14,565
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, they gained a Broadway show, so they're very excited about that.

448
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:19,546
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing that was cut was on Sundays, the only thing we did was go to the Bronx Zoo.

449
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,248
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was cut, and they had some other things they're doing on Saturday.

450
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:24,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

451
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:30,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, I think it'll be interesting when you compare notes after the trips to see how it worked out.

452
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:32,754
[SPEAKER_21]: And how many students do you have participating?

453
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:34,036
[SPEAKER_13]: As of right now, I have 100.

454
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:35,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

455
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,119
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have?

456
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:36,500
[SPEAKER_13]: About 49.

457
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:36,500
49.

458
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

459
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:39,985
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't make sense to combine them.

460
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,113
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously not this year.

461
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:47,114
[SPEAKER_13]: So this year, well, let me, our dates are different as well.

462
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:47,455
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

463
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:57,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Ours happened to be because the director of the musical had asked for an extra week due to doing two shows for the high school and then moving to the Andrews.

464
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:04,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, over the summer we planned it and went through everything and it seemed like that was a better way to go with the later date.

465
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:05,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

466
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:06,723
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not meaning this year at all.

467
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:10,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just, and I think that there were pros and cons, but I,

468
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:12,286
[SPEAKER_21]: The question needs to be asked.

469
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,468
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done it in the past.

470
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:17,650
[SPEAKER_13]: We have done it in the past.

471
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what happens is every year there's a different shift of interest.

472
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:32,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes the McGlynn is higher than the Andrews and we always have to figure out the logistics of everything and making sure that it all works.

473
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:38,646
[SPEAKER_13]: But we're never opposed to doing it around the same time and integrating the groups.

474
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I think though,

475
00:33:40,707 --> 00:34:03,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Again more logistically and mr. Edwards can also chime in as well There are certain things that we go to it's hard to have bigger groups What would happen was if we were at a certain area The McGlynn wasn't too far behind us or we weren't too far behind them in a different timeframe Okay.

476
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:04,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, great.

477
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:05,420
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks very much Mr. Skerry

478
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:11,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll throw you to the principals.

479
00:34:12,296 --> 00:34:15,898
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe this is the eighth or ninth year that this trip has taken place.

480
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:26,884
[SPEAKER_17]: I move that it be granted and I know you guys do a great job and I know the kids get a lot out of it and given the nature of current affairs, I believe

481
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:33,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps if you worked anything out with the travel agency for contingencies, if the trip has to be canceled.

482
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:37,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Make sure that the trip does take place.

483
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,260
[SPEAKER_13]: We both use the same company.

484
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,501
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been using them for years.

485
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Very amenable for things that occur.

486
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:50,347
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think what your point being is, compared to nine years ago, this wasn't as much of a.

487
00:34:51,387 --> 00:35:00,251
[SPEAKER_13]: issue as what we're seeing nowadays, so they've been a minimal of, you know, we don't have anything officially in writing, but through phone conversations, they've been a minimal.

488
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:06,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that the kids get a chance to do what they want to do, go on the field trip, get to see a Broadway play.

489
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:09,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

490
00:35:09,694 --> 00:35:09,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

491
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:10,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

492
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:11,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

493
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Edwards, how many students have you had in the Pasco?

494
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,530
[SPEAKER_11]: It varies every year.

495
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,971
[SPEAKER_11]: It varies.

496
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,813
[SPEAKER_11]: It certainly has tapered off over the last few years.

497
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:25,376
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really due to demographics in our school.

498
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:29,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year you had less than 49 students go?

499
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we had one full bus.

500
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,981
[SPEAKER_11]: It was probably comparable to that.

501
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what the exact number was.

502
00:35:33,843 --> 00:35:34,723
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

503
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:38,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know over the years that we've tried to say,

504
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:45,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I know over the years it's been together and I kind of thought that was working.

505
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:50,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So that way the students felt that it was like one field trip for everybody.

506
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:58,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, do we have any students that want to do like a one nighter in your school that want to go in the McGlynn school?

507
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:01,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we haven't presented it like that.

508
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:10,770
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would feel that, you know, we had a parent meetings and sort of laid out what our itinerary was and I just wouldn't feel right.

509
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,313
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of doing that shift this year, but if it's something that we've had to do.

510
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wouldn't be right for the student either.

511
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just asking if anybody's asked.

512
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:17,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

513
00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:21,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Edwards, you said you're leaving at 5 o'clock in the morning.

514
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:22,715
[SPEAKER_08]: What time do you get back?

515
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:27,136
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the evening, 7 o'clock, I think approximately.

516
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:28,736
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

517
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:33,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying that the only thing that the students will miss out on is the show?

518
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:34,777
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bronx.

519
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:35,797
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they added a show.

520
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,017
[SPEAKER_08]: You added the show?

521
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:37,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

522
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:39,818
[SPEAKER_08]: In place of the Bronx too, I guess.

523
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:40,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

524
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:43,679
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I was just curious.

525
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:56,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're still going to the 9-11 Memorial Museum of Natural Heritage, out into the water to see Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Center, Times Square.

526
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,649
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

527
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,391
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have your itinerary.

528
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:05,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could provide that for us with the time.

529
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:08,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you also have the same amount of chaperones?

530
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:11,900
[SPEAKER_11]: We have six chaperones for 49 students.

531
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:15,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And 49 students.

532
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just reading.

533
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:20,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And yourself?

534
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:22,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to.

535
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:25,538
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so it's just the six chaperones and the students.

536
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:29,479
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all eighth grade teachers that are going, which is really nice for the students.

537
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:31,039
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

538
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

539
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,380
OK.

540
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:37,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss McDougall.

541
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,682
[SPEAKER_03]: My eighth grade acquaintance is very excited to be going with the Andrews.

542
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:46,437
[SPEAKER_03]: She would not want me to chaperone, so if you need an extra chaperone with the McGlynn, I'll go with you.

543
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a great time, both of you.

544
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all the kids at both schools are so excited.

545
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:52,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

546
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

547
00:37:55,637 --> 00:38:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Do any of the children need medical services that are going on the trip, and how are we handling that?

548
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe through you to the superintendent.

549
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:04,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Ms.

550
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:05,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Vento.

551
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:06,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Ms.

552
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Vento, since she's here.

553
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:18,335
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a careful procedure that starts in October, as we start to really get to know our students and identify any students going on any field trips, especially on this field trip.

554
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:22,278
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, we do not have any medical concerns for the students going.

555
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:23,679
[SPEAKER_11]: In years past, we have.

556
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've handled that in a variety of ways.

557
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:34,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, we had the parents of a diabetic student accompany us and be readily available in case the student needed any assistance.

558
00:38:35,784 --> 00:38:37,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Thankfully, she did not, and she had a wonderful time.

559
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:51,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And to reiterate, I have the same scenario this year where I don't have the same medical needs as I've had in the past where we have had parents come as well to serve the need that's there.

560
00:38:52,866 --> 00:39:00,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Knowing that, I know this is a discussion that we've had this year greatly, but I think it's something that we're working on to improve.

561
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to make sure that everybody has a reasonable chance to go.

562
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:12,451
[SPEAKER_13]: That's our number one, you know, we would never deny anybody because of some medical reason or even some financial hardship.

563
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,711
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been able to cover that as well.

564
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:15,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

565
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:20,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just want to prepare for that in case it were to arise because it would be the school's responsibility to make sure.

566
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:27,544
[SPEAKER_06]: that we provide appropriate health services for any student that chooses to go on one of these trips.

567
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:33,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to keep that in mind when you're planning, and I applaud you for both doing that.

568
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:42,882
[SPEAKER_20]: As with every field trip, the school nurses screen the lists of students that have signed up for the field trips or that are eligible to go.

569
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:50,684
[SPEAKER_20]: So this year, as both the principals said, we didn't have any students with needs that required a nurse to accompany them.

570
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:59,166
[SPEAKER_20]: Parents were offered a chance to go, and they all willingly wanted to go.

571
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:02,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Should they had said no, we would have looked at alternative arrangements.

572
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:03,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

573
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:04,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

574
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:06,488
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am EpiPen certified.

575
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:08,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Defibrillator.

576
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:12,771
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

577
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot.

578
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:14,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

579
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Pugna?

580
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:17,854
Yes.

581
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,275
Mr. Benedetto?

582
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:19,415
Yes.

583
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:20,655
Mrs. Price?

584
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:21,116
Yes.

585
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:21,936
Mrs. Costello?

586
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:22,176
Yes.

587
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:22,917
Mr. Skerry?

588
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

589
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:23,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

590
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:23,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot?

591
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:24,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

592
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

593
00:40:24,397 --> 00:40:24,658
Zahra?

594
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:25,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

595
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:26,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

596
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:27,739
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

597
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:28,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

598
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:32,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, a motion to revert to the regular order of business.

599
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:33,367
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

600
00:40:34,107 --> 00:40:34,928
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

601
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:38,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Item two, report on automated external defibrillators.

602
00:40:39,152 --> 00:40:39,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

603
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:41,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Vento, I think you already did your intro.

604
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:43,616
[SPEAKER_14]: No, just a quick thing on this one.

605
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:45,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, this is a report you asked for.

606
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:46,899
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a follow-up report.

607
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:57,303
[SPEAKER_14]: of a report that we previously gave you on the AED, so with specific names and specific discussions of where they're located.

608
00:40:57,323 --> 00:41:02,665
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a follow-up report to a previous report, but Tony is here to give you more details.

609
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

610
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:15,925
[SPEAKER_20]: So this also follows up another mandate by Governor Baker that was just signed in January called an act requiring automatic external defibrillators in schools.

611
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:17,266
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's effective of July 2018.

612
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we're very fortunate in Medford.

613
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:28,092
[SPEAKER_20]: This has been a recommendation for many years, and we have met that recommendation for many years.

614
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:33,696
[SPEAKER_20]: All of our school buildings do have defibrillators in them.

615
00:41:33,816 --> 00:41:37,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the schools, depending on the size of the school, have multiple defibrillators.

616
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,102
[SPEAKER_20]: And the locations are itemized out in the report.

617
00:41:45,733 --> 00:42:06,967
[SPEAKER_20]: Our AED units are compatible with the equipment that's on Armstrong ambulances so that if we had to use a defibrillator, we know that we can easily turn responsibility over to the Armstrong ambulance without changing any other equipment.

618
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:08,468
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're fortunate with that.

619
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:14,685
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, every school does the staff does have, um, we, every school has staff that are certified.

620
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:29,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and we, um, I did provide lists now that those lists change with, um, you know, all of the nurses, um, the athletic trainer, the coaches, the health and phys ed teachers are required to be certified.

621
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:37,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Teachers are not, so there's fluidity in the teaching staff who maintain their certifications.

622
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:44,274
[SPEAKER_20]: But during the school day, we have somebody on site that is properly certified and trained.

623
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:54,067
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have our units serviced twice a year through a maintenance contract with life support systems in Dedham.

624
00:42:54,868 --> 00:43:00,170
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're fortunate also that our training has been provided by generous support from

625
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:02,438
[SPEAKER_20]: on the people at Armstrong Ambulance.

626
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:16,783
[SPEAKER_20]: So Superintendent Belson had asked for a demonstration of how the unit would work, and I have Shawn Mangan here from Armstrong Ambulance with a trainer, so we don't have to use it on anybody.

627
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:19,505
[SPEAKER_20]: But we will show you how.

628
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:27,848
[SPEAKER_20]: The unit is a smart unit, so they're set up to give you auditory prompts through the process.

629
00:43:29,547 --> 00:43:30,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Mr. Mangan.

630
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:32,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here tonight.

631
00:43:33,722 --> 00:43:33,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

632
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:40,165
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this is the Zoll AED Plus.

633
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:43,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the machines that are in the city are Zoll products.

634
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:46,310
[SPEAKER_00]: They're brought through life support systems.

635
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:49,413
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine is pretty simple to operate.

636
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:52,336
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same machine that's here in City Hall downstairs.

637
00:43:53,637 --> 00:43:54,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the machine up.

638
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:59,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Any AED that you use or potentially need to use, the first thing you should do is turn the machine on.

639
00:44:00,703 --> 00:44:04,967
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's basically how American Heart Association teaches you, open the machine, turn it on.

640
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:08,730
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn on this machine, it'll start to prompt you into what to do next.

641
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,553
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not sure what to do, the machine will guide you.

642
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:15,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of things that ultimately save people's lives.

643
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:19,586
[SPEAKER_00]: It's early defibrillation and high quality chest compressions or high quality CPR.

644
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:30,834
[SPEAKER_00]: If both of those things are done in a very short amount of time after we recognize somebody needs those, the outcomes are typically much better as they get CPR much sooner.

645
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:35,077
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think a long time ago back in high school when I took CPR that

646
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:41,342
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your brain starts to lose after seven or 10 minutes of not having oxygen, so we breathe, we breathe, we breathe into people.

647
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:44,405
[SPEAKER_00]: If their heart stops, we need to circulate the blood.

648
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:48,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the blood has plenty of oxygen in it for that period of time, so we need to move it around.

649
00:44:48,948 --> 00:44:59,256
[SPEAKER_00]: So those chest compressions alone will circulate, perfuse the brain, perfuse the heart, perfuse the major organs until we can get a machine there quick enough to defibrillate somebody, okay?

650
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,198
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna put the, I'll turn the machine on for you.

651
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:03,880
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trainer.

652
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,701
[SPEAKER_00]: The pads are pretty simple to use.

653
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:10,922
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures on the pads as you can see.

654
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:15,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the pads out of the machine and lay them right on the patient's chest and turn the machine on.

655
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:20,925
Unit okay.

656
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:22,866
Stay calm.

657
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:24,466
Check responsiveness.

658
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:25,827
Call for help.

659
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Attach defib pads to patient's bare chest.

660
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:36,079
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you place the defib pads on the patient's spare chest, the machine will recognize that.

661
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:39,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Attach defib pads to patients.

662
00:45:39,222 --> 00:45:40,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't touch patient.

663
00:45:40,923 --> 00:45:41,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Analyze it.

664
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:44,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the machine is going to analyze for up to about 10 to 15 seconds.

665
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:46,608
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to analyze the operating itself.

666
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:47,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch patient.

667
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:48,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Analyze it.

668
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Shock advised.

669
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:55,616
Don't touch patient.

670
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Press flashing shock button.

671
00:45:58,621 --> 00:45:59,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty simple to use.

672
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:05,667
[SPEAKER_00]: We clear the patient, make sure nobody else is touching the patient.

673
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:14,154
[SPEAKER_00]: So that machine gives you a metronome as to a beat to give when you're actually providing chest compressions throughout that.

674
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:18,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two minutes, this machine will go into a reanalyzation process automatically.

675
00:46:19,383 --> 00:46:25,006
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is tells us to change out the compressor, because the compressor or whoever's doing the CPR is going to get tired.

676
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:28,127
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we change that position of that person.

677
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:31,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And every two minutes, the machine will cycle that.

678
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:35,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's either going to deliver a shock, it's going to say the shock is advised, or it's going to say no shock advised.

679
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:41,714
[SPEAKER_00]: After either one of those, whether we deliver a shock or there's no shock advised, we want to start chest compressions again right away.

680
00:46:42,554 --> 00:46:42,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

681
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:45,856
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it says, check your patient, check for responsiveness.

682
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:47,517
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quick, are you okay?

683
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:48,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you all right?

684
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:57,031
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's not breathing normally or responding to you just from that or only gasping, that could be a sign of a cardiac arrhythmia that could potentially cause death.

685
00:46:57,531 --> 00:46:59,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to start compressions right away.

686
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:01,293
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what AHA recommends.

687
00:47:02,054 --> 00:47:07,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start compressions right away and someone says, please stop pushing on my chest, we would stop.

688
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:09,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, we would continue to go.

689
00:47:09,598 --> 00:47:13,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gives you, you don't have to worry about hurting anybody or anything like that.

690
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,022
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to stop pushing on that chest right away to get that blood.

691
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:18,682
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating and perfusing those major organs right away.

692
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:22,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you want to do your song that you taught us at City Hall?

693
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:31,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, so the song beat is... We were all trained by Armstrong on how to use this, but there's a time lapse between getting the defibrillator and actually the person that's in the room with them.

694
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:35,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so the song that AHA used to use is called Stayin' Alive.

695
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:44,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sing Stayin' Alive in your head and you keep the beat to stayin' alive and you do good high quality chest compressions and you get early defibrillation, you have great outcomes of patient survival.

696
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:50,053
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't a good demonstration.

697
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:58,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So amongst us, just speaking with Tony and speaking with Diane Caldwell, we've also, we have two CPR classes planned.

698
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:03,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been in touch with Jean Camuso from your office, so we're going to be doing some at city hall.

699
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:09,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the AEDs from the school and through the service zone plan, what's kind of spaced out throughout the city.

700
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:12,453
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost about 50 AEDs in the city.

701
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:15,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a community, it's pretty impressive.

702
00:48:15,236 --> 00:48:16,457
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a lot of locations.

703
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:21,301
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to get them in a few more locations in the parks and stuff with some weatherproof casing.

704
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:23,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Baseball fields have them as well.

705
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:25,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are out there and they are available to people.

706
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:30,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Armstrong Ambulance for also assisting us on any call that we make to them.

707
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:31,799
[SPEAKER_09]: They're there to help us out.

708
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:32,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

709
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

710
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Van der Kloot.

711
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

712
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,241
[SPEAKER_21]: I just had one question.

713
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,702
[SPEAKER_21]: We have the list of where they are in the school system.

714
00:48:37,742 --> 00:48:38,623
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just sort of curious.

715
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:40,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there one in this, um, yep.

716
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:41,444
[SPEAKER_21]: You're right in the front lobby.

717
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:42,485
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

718
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:43,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Just in case.

719
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:45,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause sometimes, you know, passions get pretty heated.

720
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:48,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the library has one.

721
00:48:48,828 --> 00:48:49,868
[SPEAKER_00]: All the schools have one.

722
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,810
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in the training center at the police Academy.

723
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the little league fields have them right now.

724
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,433
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd like to get a couple more too, so.

725
00:48:58,274 --> 00:48:58,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

726
00:48:58,634 --> 00:48:59,215
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

727
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:00,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you both.

728
00:49:00,276 --> 00:49:07,021
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a little bit more on this because, as I said, we are in good shape, but the new law does

729
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:12,035
[SPEAKER_20]: is going to require us to purchase additional units.

730
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:16,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and that will be to meet the requirements for the presence of an AED.

731
00:49:16,777 --> 00:49:20,859
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, when, during athletic events that are off campus.

732
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:25,341
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now at our athletic events, when they're on campus at the high school, we have

733
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:34,098
[SPEAKER_20]: AED is available, the trainer is on-site, and so we can get an AED to the field very quickly.

734
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:48,623
[SPEAKER_20]: The new law requires that if a school-sponsored athletic event is held at a site other than a school facility, the school officials shall ensure that an AED and an AED provider is on-site.

735
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:51,444
[SPEAKER_20]: So I spoke with Rachel Perry.

736
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:56,125
[SPEAKER_20]: and Bobby Maloney about what does that mean to us.

737
00:49:56,305 --> 00:50:01,706
[SPEAKER_20]: And for winter sports that are held at the high school, we are meeting requirements, we're fine.

738
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:07,868
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the fall and spring sports that tend to disperse out amongst the city playing fields.

739
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:15,870
[SPEAKER_20]: So Playstead, Memorial Park, let's see where else, Columbus Park, places that there is not an AED.

740
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,831
[SPEAKER_20]: We tallied the need to purchase

741
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:34,739
[SPEAKER_20]: 16 AEDs that the coaches would be able to sign out at the beginning of their season, keep with their first aid bag, and then sign it back into the athletic department at the end of the season.

742
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:41,642
[SPEAKER_20]: That way, the unit goes with them to every practice and to every game, and it is on site.

743
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:49,386
[SPEAKER_20]: With purchasing those units, we would also have to purchase the servicing program.

744
00:50:50,266 --> 00:51:01,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, that maintains the twice yearly servicing and keeps the software up to date and replaces, um, parts and, um, and pads as, as they're used.

745
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:06,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

746
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:07,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

747
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, thank you for your report and thank you very much for the demonstration.

748
00:51:10,524 --> 00:51:12,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't seen that, so I found it very interesting.

749
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and your time to come out tonight.

750
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:17,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so,

751
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:30,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to purchase these immediately if our spring sports are underway and our coaches, like say our track team is doing long distance track or something like that.

752
00:51:30,848 --> 00:51:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Those coaches should have them with them and God forbid something happened while we're putting this in the budget for next year.

753
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:46,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So through you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent, is there any way that we could find a way to get

754
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:51,915
[SPEAKER_06]: what we need for our students for this spring season to make sure that they're safe.

755
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:52,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And training.

756
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:55,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It would require training.

757
00:51:55,137 --> 00:51:56,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, all the coaches are trained.

758
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:59,140
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trained in this mission, the AED.

759
00:51:59,340 --> 00:51:59,560
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

760
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,761
[SPEAKER_20]: It's required of all the athletic coaches.

761
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:07,265
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Tony, maybe you could explain the different sites that we think

762
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:15,431
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, technically, I mean, a coach and a trainer could bring a unit with them to every field and every activity.

763
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:17,832
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have to necessarily, because you see how portable they are.

764
00:52:17,852 --> 00:52:19,453
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have to keep it in the car.

765
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:20,654
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, they would bring it in their first.

766
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:21,754
[SPEAKER_14]: They could bring it with them.

767
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:22,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

768
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:27,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we're proposing going forward is, is that we have them actually on site at these places.

769
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:30,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So in case something happens and someone is not there with it,

770
00:52:31,339 --> 00:52:37,942
[SPEAKER_14]: But since we have trainers and coaches going to every game, I'm not sure we're in a critical stage yet.

771
00:52:38,462 --> 00:52:43,825
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the future, obviously, we want to be in a situation where these things are automatically there.

772
00:52:44,345 --> 00:52:48,607
[SPEAKER_14]: The downside to that is they have to be checked fairly frequently to make sure the battery's loaded.

773
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:53,509
[SPEAKER_14]: And that means people have to go to these places early to check them in advance.

774
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:56,530
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a little logistical work that's associated with that.

775
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,531
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are working on that.

776
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:03,328
[SPEAKER_20]: as to getting that going forward.

777
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:11,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion to have all of our coaches have these defibrillators with them as of this spring season.

778
00:53:12,652 --> 00:53:17,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way they're portable and our children are always provided safe care.

779
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:19,415
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor.

780
00:53:20,516 --> 00:53:21,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

781
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:22,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you wish to speak on this?

782
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:31,203
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I just want to know, I mean, as far as the coaches having one, at what point do they have to be recharged?

783
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:36,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like, does the battery go out if you don't use it, or how does that work?

784
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,827
[SPEAKER_20]: The batteries have a long shelf life.

785
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:45,672
[SPEAKER_20]: So for instance, the nurses check their machines daily to make sure that that battery is charged.

786
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:50,814
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't remember purchasing batteries, I mean, through a school year.

787
00:53:51,215 --> 00:54:00,178
[SPEAKER_20]: And then with the maintenance service contract, they're here twice a year, and then they swap out batteries that need to be swapped out.

788
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:05,320
[SPEAKER_14]: How long is the actual battery charge good for, Tony?

789
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,581
[SPEAKER_20]: Two years.

790
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:08,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Two years.

791
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:12,883
[SPEAKER_14]: So in other words, saying it generally should be in good shape, but again, you know,

792
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:16,990
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly wouldn't want a malfunction to be the outcome of anything.

793
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:19,892
[SPEAKER_20]: And how much is the cost per unit?

794
00:54:20,032 --> 00:54:22,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Per unit, it's just a little bit shy of $1,000.

795
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:28,195
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the service contract is $285 per unit.

796
00:54:28,756 --> 00:54:38,600
[SPEAKER_20]: So we are looking at a cost, I mean, about $15,000 for the purchase cost and another $4,500 to service them every year.

797
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how many coaches do we have starting off in the spring season right now?

798
00:54:43,935 --> 00:54:45,237
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I didn't bring that.

799
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:46,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't bring that with me.

800
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:48,121
[SPEAKER_20]: But exactly.

801
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:50,644
[SPEAKER_20]: And they all go to different fields.

802
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:54,529
[SPEAKER_20]: So the different levels, freshman, JV, and varsity go to different fields.

803
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:57,272
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't have all of baseball at one field.

804
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:58,915
[SPEAKER_20]: We have them separated out.

805
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:12,068
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have at least a half a dozen that they could sign up when they're off campus.

806
00:55:28,183 --> 00:55:30,846
[SPEAKER_20]: There are a lot of spring teams that are off campus.

807
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:34,210
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that's how we added up the 16.

808
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:44,321
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor that funding take place immediately if the superintendent can find the funds seconded by Miss Mustone.

809
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:45,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

810
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:58,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

811
00:55:58,846 --> 00:55:59,687
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

812
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:01,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

813
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:01,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

814
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have another question.

815
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:14,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, you were just saying that anything that basically off campus, and I know we were discussing our athletes, but I'm curious in knowing what about like when we have our proms,

816
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:18,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have to find out where we have our proms?

817
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:21,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have to find out at those locations if there's anything going on?

818
00:56:21,867 --> 00:56:26,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we do have proms that are off-site and certain other events that are off-site.

819
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:31,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Our banquets for our students, when we have our banquets at the end of the year or after a season.

820
00:56:32,128 --> 00:56:33,509
[SPEAKER_08]: do we need to find out those?

821
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:38,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I, um, actually we spoke about that this morning, um, at the high school.

822
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:49,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and again, I think the planners of a lot of these events need, that needs to be a, now a question when they're setting up the venues is, you know, do you have an, an AED on site?

823
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:49,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Um,

824
00:56:50,248 --> 00:57:03,481
[SPEAKER_20]: We would have—I mean, I keep a couple in my office as loaners, so sometimes we have to send them on a field trip, and I can give it to the nurses or a phys ed teacher who's certified to take it on a field trip if that's the case.

825
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:10,208
[SPEAKER_20]: So it would fall under that category, making sure that the venue has them, and if not, then we would loan one out.

826
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:14,236
[SPEAKER_20]: to our staff, they would sign it out and bring it back.

827
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:23,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I would propose, actually, even if the site has it, sometimes, even though they might have it, and if you're in a large hotel, you don't exactly know where it is.

828
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:32,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would just be better safe than sorry if we do have these that we can check out, that whoever is running the event is actually bringing it with them.

829
00:57:33,985 --> 00:57:40,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the things that we, you know, obviously have to work with our partners, the people that we play sports with and so on.

830
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:43,351
[SPEAKER_14]: So another school districts is to have that conversation.

831
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:46,313
[SPEAKER_14]: If we go to their school, do they have things in place?

832
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:49,515
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're at other places, do they have things in place?

833
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:51,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like we're talking about the nurses on field trips and the like.

834
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:56,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we're going to be asking that question wherever we go.

835
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,303
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's something major going on, do you have facilities on site?

836
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:12,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if you know this, but one of our former nurses used to get paid to go to the theater shows in Boston to sit in the audience just in case a nurse was necessary.

837
00:58:12,979 --> 00:58:17,060
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, because the theaters didn't have their own medical staff.

838
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:23,722
[SPEAKER_14]: So they wanted someone there who was medically trained to intervene should a situation take place.

839
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:27,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I suspect we're going to have this conversation since the law normally affects Medford.

840
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:31,608
[SPEAKER_14]: but it affects every school district and every community across the Commonwealth.

841
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:33,729
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be one of those discussions.

842
00:58:33,789 --> 00:58:35,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have the right equipment?

843
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,450
[SPEAKER_14]: The same way with first aid kits, the same way with ambulance calls.

844
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,391
[SPEAKER_14]: We play a football game in a different field.

845
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't necessarily bring our ambulance.

846
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,892
[SPEAKER_14]: They have their ambulances.

847
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:49,094
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's, you know, we have to obviously, um, work out a lot of coordination.

848
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:49,914
[SPEAKER_20]: I went,

849
00:58:50,233 --> 00:59:02,782
[SPEAKER_20]: When I called Life Support Systems to obtain a quote, my contact there said, you're one of the first dozen cities to call about this.

850
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:03,903
[SPEAKER_20]: He said, I'm expecting

851
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:07,685
[SPEAKER_20]: many, many, many calls because now with this new law.

852
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:16,275
[SPEAKER_20]: And just in the last week, I received an email from a vendor saying, oh, this is the new law, and are you prepared?

853
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:20,520
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's out there, and we're ahead of the curve right now.

854
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,805
[SPEAKER_20]: People are starting to look at their needs as well.

855
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

856
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

857
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:40,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Through you to the superintendent, can we get a follow up report of how many were actually ordered when they became available to our staff and the cost, the total cost after you figure out exactly how much you need?

858
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:45,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you add that to the requested reports list at the back?

859
00:59:45,893 --> 00:59:55,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, when I read your report, I'm very happy to see that like three, four, five or more people at each, at each of our locations are,

860
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:59,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Trained except for the Curtis tough school that concerned me.

861
00:59:59,172 --> 01:00:04,895
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only one trained person at that and I know that we're close and I'm strong can be there in moments.

862
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:07,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we don't live miles and miles away.

863
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:13,333
[SPEAKER_06]: like some of the rural districts, but really two people minimum should be at every building.

864
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:14,854
[SPEAKER_20]: We are opening up training.

865
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:20,358
[SPEAKER_20]: So, um, that's being offered to, um, starting with the administrators and then we'll, we'll open up more.

866
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:22,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially cause there's only a nurse there three hours a week.

867
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:31,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I read another report being presented that, that, that concerns me and those students, you know, weren't the same.

868
01:00:31,788 --> 01:00:32,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

869
01:00:33,209 --> 01:00:34,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, consideration.

870
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:52,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd really like to see an upgraded list after the training through you to the superintendent of any additional people and making sure that we're starting September with the appropriate number at each building and not less than two people at each school.

871
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably more than that.

872
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:58,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And I motion to accept the report and thank you very much.

873
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:02,257
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to accept the report and place on file, seconded by Ms.

874
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:03,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot, Ms.

875
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:03,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

876
01:01:03,919 --> 01:01:04,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

877
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:23,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just thinking that since this is something that is hitting now and it is the law, is it possible maybe, I'm not sure if there's any type of discount if you buy a certain amount and if like maybe we could talk to our surrounding areas, districts to see if maybe if Somerville, Malden, Everett, or even if like Armstrong

878
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:28,597
[SPEAKER_08]: is buying some just to see if that, if you buy, you know, zero to five, it costs a thousand.

879
01:01:28,717 --> 01:01:31,760
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's five to 10, it might cost something else.

880
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:41,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, even if there's a hundred dollar difference, maybe we could buy them together as a package deal and get the cost down.

881
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,914
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we'll look into that as well as the, you know, the commissioner of elementary and

882
01:01:45,203 --> 01:01:49,047
[SPEAKER_20]: secondary education, but they're establishing the guidelines on this.

883
01:01:50,508 --> 01:01:55,874
[SPEAKER_20]: They're also looking at getting out information about other grant sources and funding opportunities.

884
01:01:56,274 --> 01:01:59,337
[SPEAKER_20]: That information has not come out yet.

885
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:06,124
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will have our eye on that, whether we can get some costs reimbursed once the grants come out.

886
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:07,406
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

887
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:10,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

888
01:02:10,315 --> 01:02:10,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

889
01:02:11,036 --> 01:02:12,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Vento on the motion.

890
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,218
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

891
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:14,559
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

892
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is granted.

893
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Pre-budget health services.

894
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:21,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Vento.

895
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:33,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so I thought I'd give you a little overview of the program and I listed out where our staffing, where our staff nurses are assigned.

896
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:39,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Our staffing is based on student enrollment as well as acuity of student health needs.

897
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:53,583
[SPEAKER_20]: So while we meet all of the guidelines set out by the state for student enrollment, I always look at the acuity within the school and whether additional nurses are necessary at different schools.

898
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,750
[SPEAKER_20]: One expected change is I have one nurse that's retiring at the end of this school year.

899
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,940
[SPEAKER_20]: So as we've talked about in many of our

900
01:03:09,134 --> 01:03:13,756
[SPEAKER_20]: pre-budget reports is the complexity of school nursing that has changed.

901
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:16,597
[SPEAKER_20]: There's many advances in pediatric care.

902
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:24,700
[SPEAKER_20]: Students with chronic illnesses live, they attend school, and they receive a lot of care in school.

903
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:27,961
[SPEAKER_20]: We have not only students with

904
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:40,916
[SPEAKER_20]: allergies, diabetes, but we have students who have had cancer, we've had students that have had organ transplants, and they all require some sort of monitoring or attention by a school nurse.

905
01:03:40,936 --> 01:03:50,758
[SPEAKER_20]: The past couple of years has also seen a growing number of international children coming into the area for care.

906
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:53,500
[SPEAKER_20]: at the Boston Medical Centers.

907
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,421
[SPEAKER_20]: These students usually seek advanced care.

908
01:03:56,621 --> 01:04:02,644
[SPEAKER_20]: They have never or had very little health care in their lives, so they're coming with many, many needs.

909
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:06,846
[SPEAKER_20]: And while they're here, they do enroll in the Medford Public Schools.

910
01:04:07,446 --> 01:04:14,509
[SPEAKER_20]: We're close to the city, and there are community groups that they are linked with.

911
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:17,170
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's why they come here to Medford.

912
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,531
[SPEAKER_20]: And those students require,

913
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:24,790
[SPEAKER_20]: for their time when they're in school to access their curriculum.

914
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:40,215
[SPEAKER_20]: And it leaves school nurse case managers and not only doing first aid and medication administration, but working closely with physicians and community organizations to make sure that the students are able to attend school safely.

915
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,081
[SPEAKER_20]: We have students who travel with portable defibrillators.

916
01:04:47,141 --> 01:04:51,323
[SPEAKER_20]: We have students who require tube feedings, certainly diabetic care.

917
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,164
[SPEAKER_20]: We have students with seizure disorders and then life-threatening allergies.

918
01:04:55,204 --> 01:05:07,489
[SPEAKER_20]: And any emergency with any of these students will require one-to-one attention by the school nurse, and it leaves the rest of the population waiting until the emergency has been resolved.

919
01:05:08,797 --> 01:05:20,145
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the other things that have increased the complexity, the demand for student screenings, such as the mental health issues have grown and expanded yearly.

920
01:05:20,285 --> 01:05:34,695
[SPEAKER_20]: And our most recent numbers are we have 660 students who have a physician diagnosed mental health condition that may require a lot of additional nursing support.

921
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:37,077
[SPEAKER_20]: We work in tandem with the counseling

922
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:54,978
[SPEAKER_20]: staff so that behavior plans can be carried forth in the nurse's office as well and that we're part of the team to help students get back to class quickly, stay in class, and access their curriculum.

923
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:04,307
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're also trained, we have access to NARCAN in case there are any

924
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:12,258
[SPEAKER_20]: opioid overdoses by either students, staff, or even visitors in the area.

925
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:15,800
[SPEAKER_20]: The nurses are trained and we have a supply of Narcan available.

926
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:29,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year we did receive funds to fund the contractually mandated professional development and the liability insurance as we grew our staff.

927
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:39,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of the accomplishments, we have maintained a return to class rate of 97% in our district.

928
01:06:40,077 --> 01:06:42,940
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's been consistent for the past three years.

929
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:49,066
[SPEAKER_20]: So students coming down to the nurse's office are receiving treatments and getting back into class.

930
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:53,699
[SPEAKER_20]: We accomplished the SBIRT screening as I mentioned earlier.

931
01:06:54,259 --> 01:06:57,780
[SPEAKER_20]: This year was accomplished at no financial cost to the district.

932
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:04,062
[SPEAKER_20]: We were able to readjust staffing and we did that without having substitute.

933
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:11,924
[SPEAKER_20]: The tuberculosis surveillance project was a high priority this fall.

934
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:17,066
[SPEAKER_20]: We had 205 individuals that participated in

935
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:20,649
[SPEAKER_20]: screening that took place in October and January.

936
01:07:21,629 --> 01:07:27,431
[SPEAKER_20]: We ran a blood screening clinic here at the high school for about 120 individuals.

937
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:37,775
[SPEAKER_20]: A number of other students had skin tests placed by the Medford Board of Health, and other students were followed by their primary care physicians.

938
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:47,438
[SPEAKER_20]: What that project entailed was a lot of collaboration and coordination by the school nurses with different departments, both at the state and city level.

939
01:07:49,562 --> 01:07:53,463
[SPEAKER_20]: And then last, another accomplishment is we're continuing our outreach to parents.

940
01:07:53,523 --> 01:08:01,806
[SPEAKER_20]: And I did put a flyer over at the podium about, we have a talk on April 12th by Dr. Ruth Poteet.

941
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:07,268
[SPEAKER_20]: She's an expert on substance abuse behaviors.

942
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:17,212
[SPEAKER_20]: And she speaks frequently about the risk factors that teens face because of their brain development during the teen years.

943
01:08:17,695 --> 01:08:25,041
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a community forum, it's open to all parents, teaching staff, it's not for students, it's for adults.

944
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:32,087
[SPEAKER_20]: We've opened it up to the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, some neighboring towns have also expressed interest.

945
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:38,052
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're very pleased to be sponsoring that with generous support from Team Medford.

946
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:47,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Pardon me, it's at the high school, the Caron Theater, at 6.30 on Wednesday, April 12th.

947
01:08:52,751 --> 01:09:04,140
[SPEAKER_20]: So the request for the budget, the first thing is to increase the service line item to maintain our existing 13 AEDs that we have in the district.

948
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:10,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year, I was able to absorb that cost through grant funding, and that grant funding is no longer available.

949
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:20,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Also the funds to purchase the additional AEDs that we spoke about at the previous report.

950
01:09:22,014 --> 01:09:24,056
[SPEAKER_20]: And then some special requests.

951
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:32,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Replacing the full-time nursing position that we will lose to retirement and increasing the nursing staff by one FTE.

952
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:43,812
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to increase the staff at the Roberts Elementary School so that there is some extra support to the school nurse there since she's a solo practitioner.

953
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:57,083
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd like to place some nursing staff at the Curtis Tufts so that we would have somebody available to attend meetings and be available for the students as they need.

954
01:09:59,124 --> 01:09:59,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

955
01:10:00,365 --> 01:10:01,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

956
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:03,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any questions for Ms.

957
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:03,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Bento?

958
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:09,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place this report on file by Ms.

959
01:10:09,869 --> 01:10:10,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno.

960
01:10:11,694 --> 01:10:13,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Scari, all those in favor?

961
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

962
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:15,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

963
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:16,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

964
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:16,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

965
01:10:18,595 --> 01:10:20,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Pre-budget foreign language.

966
01:10:26,537 --> 01:10:28,197
[SPEAKER_14]: This report will be given in Italian.

967
01:10:29,477 --> 01:10:29,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

968
01:10:29,957 --> 01:10:30,377
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

969
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:32,298
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do that.

970
01:10:32,318 --> 01:10:36,979
[SPEAKER_16]: I promise you it'll be much lighter than the previous reports.

971
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And before you speak, we do have an addenda that was added in our packet on our desk tonight.

972
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:44,903
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could add it to this one.

973
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:51,446
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to begin with giving you an overview of our department.

974
01:10:52,306 --> 01:11:03,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the foreign language program and the Medford public schools is aligned with the national act for guidelines and with the state of Massachusetts.

975
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:05,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, uh,

976
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,630
[SPEAKER_16]: curriculum frameworks.

977
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:16,713
[SPEAKER_16]: In the foreign language classroom, students develop linguistics and cultural skills that enable them to contribute in a global society.

978
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:32,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Students in the MedFed public schools are first introduced to a foreign language in second grade, Italian, and that continues to fifth grade, and it's a program that's being supported by a grant.

979
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:34,181
[SPEAKER_16]: from CACET.

980
01:11:34,982 --> 01:11:39,784
[SPEAKER_16]: In the middle school, students can choose to study Italian or Spanish.

981
01:11:42,985 --> 01:11:52,710
[SPEAKER_16]: They have instructions twice a week in sixth grade, and that's increased to three times a week in seventh grade and eighth grade.

982
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:58,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Our current program in the middle schools is

983
01:12:02,102 --> 01:12:11,570
[SPEAKER_16]: is not ideal and does not adequately prepare most of our students to move into the second year of foreign language at the high school.

984
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:18,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Ideally, students should have foreign language every day, especially at the eighth grade level.

985
01:12:19,137 --> 01:12:26,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, the scheduling and the level of staffing needed precludes this from occurring.

986
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:28,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Adding staff

987
01:12:29,486 --> 01:12:41,868
[SPEAKER_16]: A .5 teacher at each of the middle schools would help reduce class size, thus increasing a student's acquisition of the language by the end of eighth grade.

988
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:47,369
[SPEAKER_16]: At the high school, in addition to Spanish and Italian, we also offer French.

989
01:12:48,209 --> 01:13:06,116
[SPEAKER_16]: The graduation requirement is two years of the same language, but many students choose to continue through senior year, as acceptance to many colleges require three or four years of the same language.

990
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:14,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Staffing, the foreign language department has 14 teachers, two at each of the middle schools and 10 at the high school.

991
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:23,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Highlights, and I did it monthly to be a little bit more organized, so I'll start with September.

992
01:13:24,597 --> 01:13:34,121
[SPEAKER_16]: This past September, our French teachers accompanied a group of French students to the Boston Opera House to see the intriguing Opera of Carmen.

993
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:44,992
[SPEAKER_16]: In October, two AP Italian students each won $1,000 and were honored at a gala celebration in Boston.

994
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:59,260
[SPEAKER_16]: In November, six Medford Public Schools foreign language teachers, including myself, were among the 8,500 who attended the Actful Convention in Boston.

995
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:08,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Teachers felt inspired and returned to their classrooms with renewed energy and lots of new strategies to use in the classroom.

996
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:28,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Subsequently, we held a series of professional development workshops where teachers that attended the conference shared what they learned with the rest of the department and with each other because we made it a point not to attend the same sessions at the convention.

997
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:29,855
[SPEAKER_16]: In December,

998
01:14:31,235 --> 01:14:37,577
[SPEAKER_16]: 220 students of Italian enjoyed a concert by Italian singers at Everett High School.

999
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:51,041
[SPEAKER_16]: A group of Italian and Spanish students spent a Saturday at Melrose High School's Immersion Day, where they were able to use the target language outside the classroom settings.

1000
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of using the

1001
01:14:54,697 --> 01:14:56,980
[SPEAKER_16]: target language outside the classroom settings.

1002
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,862
[SPEAKER_16]: In February, students from Ms.

1003
01:14:58,922 --> 01:15:05,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Bryan's Spanish 5 class visited and participated in Spanish classes at St.

1004
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:07,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Anselm's College.

1005
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:11,916
[SPEAKER_16]: In March, the same thing was done with DAP students from Ms.

1006
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:13,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Lopore's

1007
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,463
[SPEAKER_16]: AP class, and this time it was at Tufts University.

1008
01:15:19,304 --> 01:15:25,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Also in March, the Italian Consulate of Boston arranged to bring Italian culture to Medford High School.

1009
01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:40,740
[SPEAKER_16]: They brought two cars, a Maserati and a Lamborghini, and 100 packets from Italy that contained pasta, canned tomatoes, and a recipe for students of Italian.

1010
01:15:41,568 --> 01:15:46,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Finally, that afternoon, they entertained us with a musical group from Italy.

1011
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,350
[SPEAKER_16]: A French student in Ms.

1012
01:15:49,910 --> 01:16:00,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Smith's French four honors competed in the oratory contest by Club Richelieu of Salem and finished second place and won $200.

1013
01:16:02,918 --> 01:16:08,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Still in March, about 300 students participated in the national foreign language exams.

1014
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:10,322
[SPEAKER_16]: We just completed them this week.

1015
01:16:11,322 --> 01:16:17,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And the results from these tests inform us about curriculum and how we perform on a national basis.

1016
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:28,511
[SPEAKER_16]: The two middle school teachers from the Andrews School, for the first time this year, also opted to have their students take the tests.

1017
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:31,513
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're anxious to see the results.

1018
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:41,660
[SPEAKER_16]: In April, actually this coming Friday, a group of 19 Italian students will compete with area high schools at Brandeis University.

1019
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:47,042
[SPEAKER_16]: They will be judged on creativity and language use.

1020
01:16:48,382 --> 01:17:02,048
[SPEAKER_16]: During April vacation, Medford High School will take a group to Italy on an educational trip, and actually I will be returning on an upcoming meeting to ask

1021
01:17:02,707 --> 01:17:06,630
[SPEAKER_16]: your approval for two other trips for the following year.

1022
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:16,877
[SPEAKER_16]: In April and May, the Education Office of the Boston Italian Consulate will introduce Arduino to advanced Italian students.

1023
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:23,441
[SPEAKER_16]: And Arduino is an open source platform used for building electronics projects.

1024
01:17:24,722 --> 01:17:31,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Universities in Italy and MIT are working together on numerous research collaborations using Arduino.

1025
01:17:32,487 --> 01:17:38,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of these representatives will come to give instructions in Italian to our students.

1026
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:49,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Each student will receive a Arduino kit and will be challenged to create its own electronics project.

1027
01:17:50,783 --> 01:17:54,666
[SPEAKER_16]: In May, 28 students will be taken foreign language AP exams.

1028
01:17:55,447 --> 01:17:57,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Our averages from last year

1029
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:03,749
[SPEAKER_16]: were above the national average, and we wish this year's students good luck on their exams.

1030
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:21,703
[SPEAKER_16]: After taking the AP exam, exams, I should say, because the three languages they do it, students will be teaching foreign language to the children in Kids' Corner, and this is in response to requests from Kids' Corner and parents.

1031
01:18:24,312 --> 01:18:53,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Funding for 2016-2017 was used to purchase new textbooks, Avancemos 3, to finish our Spanish series, replace lost and damaged books, purchase new sets of easy readers for French, Italian, and Spanish, purchase additional AP books since our AP Spanish enrollment was higher this year, pay for the annual online fee for the AP Spanish students,

1032
01:18:53,843 --> 01:19:05,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Purchase sets of headphones and microphones for our middle schools and high school, and then purchase off the usual office and classroom supplies.

1033
01:19:06,147 --> 01:19:10,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Requests for budget for 2017-2018, I'm asking for a level funded budget to 2015-2016.

1034
01:19:10,228 --> 01:19:13,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Numbers of current staff and anticipated staffing needs,

1035
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:26,153
[SPEAKER_16]: At the high school, we currently have 10 full-time teachers.

1036
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:30,036
[SPEAKER_16]: At the middle schools, there are four, two at each school.

1037
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:36,342
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I mentioned before, I am asking for an additional 0.5 teacher at each of the middle schools.

1038
01:19:37,243 --> 01:19:44,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Goals and objectives for 2017-2018, improving our foreign language program at the middle schools.

1039
01:19:45,487 --> 01:20:14,666
[SPEAKER_16]: provide professional development for teachers in pedagogy and curriculum, continue our journey to proficiency, and it is a journey, plan a PD series to work on proficiency-based assessments, especially final exams, and support and guide teachers to focus on two of the six core practices from ACTFL, and those are design communicative activities and teach grammar as concept

1040
01:20:15,412 --> 01:20:16,672
[SPEAKER_16]: and use in context.

1041
01:20:17,732 --> 01:20:22,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Non-salary needs for educational materials and supplies.

1042
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:28,695
[SPEAKER_16]: I supplied a table for you, and as I said, I'll be asking for level funded budget to 2015-2016.

1043
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:32,095
[SPEAKER_16]: If you have any questions.

1044
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1045
01:20:34,036 --> 01:20:34,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1046
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:36,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your report.

1047
01:20:36,636 --> 01:20:37,657
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very nice to see you.

1048
01:20:37,677 --> 01:20:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1049
01:20:39,677 --> 01:20:43,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a question about the middle school teachers.

1050
01:20:43,258 --> 01:20:44,298
[SPEAKER_06]: You said the point

1051
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:52,979
[SPEAKER_06]: The 2.5 people, one for each middle school, would not increase the amount of classes the students take.

1052
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:55,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It would decrease the class size.

1053
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the average class size now?

1054
01:20:58,443 --> 01:20:59,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Around 25, I think.

1055
01:20:59,083 --> 01:20:59,544
[SPEAKER_05]: 24 to 25.

1056
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:01,185
[SPEAKER_05]: In how many classes a day?

1057
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,920
[SPEAKER_05]: How many classes a day?

1058
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:14,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Do each teacher currently teach?

1059
01:21:15,341 --> 01:21:20,683
[SPEAKER_13]: The middle school schedule is unique in a sense that we go a five-day cycle.

1060
01:21:21,363 --> 01:21:24,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also have every exploratory as well.

1061
01:21:24,143 --> 01:21:27,084
[SPEAKER_13]: So at the Andrews, we rotate quarterly.

1062
01:21:27,144 --> 01:21:32,905
[SPEAKER_13]: So art, music, tech lab, computer, include a full year of foreign language.

1063
01:21:33,146 --> 01:21:37,907
[SPEAKER_13]: But in order to make everything work contractually and everybody have what they need,

1064
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:43,569
[SPEAKER_13]: You pay for Peter to rob the Paul in this sort of kind of way.

1065
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:47,132
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, everybody wants something.

1066
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:52,076
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there were times where people wanted us all to make sure that everyone's getting help with Michigan model oil.

1067
01:21:52,536 --> 01:21:53,837
[SPEAKER_13]: You only have 10 periods a day.

1068
01:21:54,437 --> 01:21:58,480
[SPEAKER_13]: So in order to figure out how to do that, it becomes a real balancing act.

1069
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to increase foreign language.

1070
01:22:02,654 --> 01:22:10,368
[SPEAKER_13]: becomes a balancing act and making sure, remembering too, that if there is a 0.5, there's travel that's involved between the two middle schools.

1071
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:13,715
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm saying 0.5 in each.

1072
01:22:15,492 --> 01:22:18,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So how would a 0.5 person lower the class size?

1073
01:22:19,095 --> 01:22:24,418
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can make a section that would help that out and divvy things up.

1074
01:22:24,558 --> 01:22:31,203
[SPEAKER_13]: What happens when fifth graders come to select a school, they also select a foreign language.

1075
01:22:31,263 --> 01:22:36,126
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do the best we can to honor that, but we can't honor that all the time due to the numbers of kids.

1076
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:40,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So there just happens to be an increased number of students that want to take Spanish.

1077
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,411
[SPEAKER_13]: when they come to the Andrews.

1078
01:22:43,611 --> 01:22:48,173
[SPEAKER_13]: So that, with one teacher, there's only so many sections I can give that one teacher.

1079
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:52,474
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I have to move it over to Italian, let's say.

1080
01:22:52,975 --> 01:22:58,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So presently, what do we have for staffing at the Andrews for foreign language?

1081
01:22:58,597 --> 01:23:01,998
[SPEAKER_13]: A full-time Italian teacher and a full-time Spanish teacher.

1082
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the class size for the Italian classes?

1083
01:23:07,224 --> 01:23:11,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so how many of those requested a time?

1084
01:23:13,575 --> 01:23:15,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say it's usually a 6040.

1085
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,248
[SPEAKER_13]: 60% Spanish, 40% Italian.

1086
01:23:20,268 --> 01:23:21,950
[SPEAKER_13]: But that changes.

1087
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, and that varies.

1088
01:23:25,453 --> 01:23:26,253
[SPEAKER_13]: We've talked about this.

1089
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,795
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had middle school ILDs.

1090
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,498
[SPEAKER_13]: We've talked about what's the change.

1091
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:41,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it's the experience that they feel like they've had a little bit of experience in Italian in elementary and they want to make just a change into Spanish and learn something different.

1092
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:45,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious just to help how it works.

1093
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:50,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we used to have foreign language every day in the middle schools years ago.

1094
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:59,511
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, things, you know, needed things like everybody needs to take health and we want to make sure that they get the Michigan model.

1095
01:23:59,571 --> 01:24:02,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a lot of things that, you know, the needs are there.

1096
01:24:02,613 --> 01:24:05,355
[SPEAKER_13]: We just have to make sure everything's balanced.

1097
01:24:06,921 --> 01:24:13,264
[SPEAKER_06]: So adding the 0.5 person, would that enable more children to have choice?

1098
01:24:15,965 --> 01:24:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: As in get their first choice of which language they want?

1099
01:24:19,246 --> 01:24:19,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1100
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:22,768
[SPEAKER_13]: They get their first choice.

1101
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1102
01:24:22,968 --> 01:24:24,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if they choose in the sixth grade?

1103
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:24,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1104
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:26,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we could make the sections again.

1105
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:34,193
[SPEAKER_13]: The way that we're looking at this, if I'm assuming, and correct me if I'm wrong, we're talking about one teacher that's going to be shared

1106
01:24:35,622 --> 01:24:36,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Two schools?

1107
01:24:36,603 --> 01:24:40,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, we try to get two teachers to save on.

1108
01:24:40,226 --> 01:24:40,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Beautiful.

1109
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,387
[SPEAKER_16]: 2.5 teachers.

1110
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:43,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's even better.

1111
01:24:43,168 --> 01:24:45,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Two part-time teachers would be better this way.

1112
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:48,392
[SPEAKER_16]: They won't waste time traveling.

1113
01:24:48,432 --> 01:24:52,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they just teach one language or do some teachers teach both?

1114
01:24:52,315 --> 01:24:53,696
[SPEAKER_16]: We would teach both.

1115
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:54,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1116
01:24:54,116 --> 01:24:55,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it'd be great if we can get two.

1117
01:24:55,778 --> 01:25:01,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Ideally, we would like to have someone that's a foreign language teacher.

1118
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:02,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, that would have both.

1119
01:25:02,982 --> 01:25:04,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that common?

1120
01:25:04,323 --> 01:25:05,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are very rare.

1121
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:07,883
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very rare.

1122
01:25:07,923 --> 01:25:19,006
[SPEAKER_13]: But just because of what we're seeing with data, it would make things easier with scheduling if you could have someone that could teach a Spanish class and an Italian class as well.

1123
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:21,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would help balance off numbers as well.

1124
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:30,648
[SPEAKER_06]: So the new hires that you're going to advertise, Bob, will they be for Spanish or for Italian?

1125
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:36,447
[SPEAKER_16]: We will probably go for Spanish, because we have more students selecting Spanish.

1126
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:42,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So my last question is, do we need two full-time Spanish teachers and a part-time Italian teacher?

1127
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Or has that been looked at?

1128
01:25:45,092 --> 01:25:48,134
[SPEAKER_13]: I think based on the numbers, I don't think.

1129
01:25:48,954 --> 01:25:52,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, and I don't know what the incoming numbers are at this point in time.

1130
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:53,837
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going through that now.

1131
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,718
[SPEAKER_13]: We're currently going through that.

1132
01:25:57,637 --> 01:26:02,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Since my tenure in principle, the increase has gotten a little bit greater through the years.

1133
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:08,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking so like we allocate and we plan for future choice.

1134
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:13,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other sense of things too, and I think Mia can attest to it too, I hope.

1135
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:18,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though I don't, I'm not always able to honor the sixth grade, I do my best.

1136
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,162
[SPEAKER_13]: If there needs to be some switch, a lot of kids say, oh, no, I'm very happy where I was.

1137
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:26,443
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's still a few families that would like to make that switch.

1138
01:26:26,503 --> 01:26:29,885
[SPEAKER_13]: I do everything I can in the summer to adjust for that if I can.

1139
01:26:32,066 --> 01:26:32,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1140
01:26:32,806 --> 01:26:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1141
01:26:33,707 --> 01:26:33,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1142
01:26:33,907 --> 01:26:34,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone.

1143
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I can attest to that.

1144
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:39,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I can attest to that.

1145
01:26:39,549 --> 01:26:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an Italian eighth grader and a Spanish sixth grader.

1146
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:45,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So they both got their first choice, so they were happy.

1147
01:26:45,312 --> 01:26:45,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1148
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:48,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Skerry.

1149
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:50,626
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll throw you to Mr. Cowell.

1150
01:26:50,946 --> 01:27:00,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Cowell, do you get requests from students to, uh, that they may want to learn another language besides what we're offering, such as German or study Latin or Chinese or Russian?

1151
01:27:01,353 --> 01:27:05,616
[SPEAKER_16]: We have had that discussion at the beginning of the year with Dr. Perella and Ms.

1152
01:27:05,656 --> 01:27:09,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Riccardelli, and we actually conducted a survey.

1153
01:27:09,863 --> 01:27:13,024
[SPEAKER_16]: The students gave them a choice of 10 languages.

1154
01:27:13,164 --> 01:27:21,948
[SPEAKER_16]: If they were to choose any language, which one would be their first choice, put them in the order of choice.

1155
01:27:22,108 --> 01:27:27,951
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there was no surprise that number one was Spanish, number two was Italian, number three

1156
01:27:28,631 --> 01:27:34,455
[SPEAKER_16]: was French and actually number four is Portuguese that they want.

1157
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:41,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Chinese wasn't there, but I can send you, if you want, I can send you the data of the survey.

1158
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:47,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any possibility of offering introductory Portuguese in the fall or was that some time off?

1159
01:27:47,923 --> 01:27:56,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Once we went over the survey with Dr. Ricardelli and Dr. Perella, we decided to leave things as they are for this year and then reconsider.

1160
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:58,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1161
01:27:58,812 --> 01:27:58,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1162
01:27:58,992 --> 01:27:59,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1163
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Keller, for the report.

1164
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:07,737
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the lost and damaged books, are those numbers rising over the years?

1165
01:28:10,759 --> 01:28:18,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, now that we have newer books, so that if a book is lost, it costs a lot more to replace.

1166
01:28:19,884 --> 01:28:21,965
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some Italian books that are almost $170 a book.

1167
01:28:26,297 --> 01:28:28,157
[SPEAKER_16]: That includes the online component.

1168
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:47,642
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems that more books are lost at the middle schools, but they have old books and teachers are using the book less and less because in fact, we were looking into buying new books for middle schools, but I'd rather have the extra teachers.

1169
01:28:48,802 --> 01:28:55,724
[SPEAKER_16]: And they are making their own units and there's so much now,

1170
01:28:56,442 --> 01:29:01,344
[SPEAKER_16]: available online.

1171
01:29:01,384 --> 01:29:07,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you have replaced lost or damaged books because the cost of replacing newer books is very high.

1172
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:10,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So how about the new books that were bought at the high school?

1173
01:29:11,049 --> 01:29:11,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1174
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:12,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the ones I'm talking about.

1175
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:15,351
[SPEAKER_16]: If they lose those books, right, we have to replace them.

1176
01:29:15,371 --> 01:29:17,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So has the number of losing books increased?

1177
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:19,092
[SPEAKER_16]: At the high school, I don't think so.

1178
01:29:19,232 --> 01:29:19,973
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty much

1179
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:24,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1180
01:29:24,222 --> 01:29:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Van de Kloop.

1181
01:29:25,283 --> 01:29:33,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to mention that I really love that after the AP exams, the students are going to go down to Kid's Corner and teach them some words and whatever.

1182
01:29:33,926 --> 01:29:34,666
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought that was a lot of fun.

1183
01:29:34,686 --> 01:29:37,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Some little songs, some words, some colors maybe.

1184
01:29:37,768 --> 01:29:38,428
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's great.

1185
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:41,769
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would be great for both the students and the little children.

1186
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:42,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1187
01:29:43,699 --> 01:29:45,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much to Carlos there.

1188
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Carlo, is there a motion on the floor to receive place on file?

1189
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:51,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by miss.

1190
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:51,943
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

1191
01:29:52,743 --> 01:29:53,544
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

1192
01:29:54,024 --> 01:29:54,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is granted.

1193
01:29:55,084 --> 01:29:55,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1194
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:56,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1195
01:29:58,246 --> 01:29:59,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Pre-budget mathematics.

1196
01:29:59,947 --> 01:30:00,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss joy.

1197
01:30:05,552 --> 01:30:06,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

1198
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:07,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everyone.

1199
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:10,815
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go through the overview with you.

1200
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:18,720
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the full text of the narrative of the mathematics proposed budget for next year.

1201
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:31,448
[SPEAKER_15]: The mathematics program at the K through 12 is based on the Massachusetts State Framework for Mathematics, and that is built upon the Common Core state standards.

1202
01:30:32,397 --> 01:30:43,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is currently undergoing a revision of those standards which we will be attending to during the summer and the following school year.

1203
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,242
[SPEAKER_15]: The instructional practices and materials are aligned with the program.

1204
01:30:52,356 --> 01:30:58,140
[SPEAKER_15]: recently bought new programs for the elementary and at the high school levels.

1205
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:10,428
[SPEAKER_15]: And our practices, again, go on with that program and to offer course pathways for students to make them college and career ready.

1206
01:31:11,028 --> 01:31:18,393
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'll see at the high school, we have a lot of offerings beyond Algebra II for our students.

1207
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:25,643
[SPEAKER_15]: because they do take various routes post-graduation from Medford High School.

1208
01:31:27,444 --> 01:31:36,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently, at the middle school, we have 13 teachers, and at the high school, 15 and two-tenths.

1209
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:44,478
[SPEAKER_15]: That little piece is one of the CTE teachers is teaching a section of Algebra I for us again this year.

1210
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:48,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And the highlights of this year

1211
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:52,434
[SPEAKER_15]: is to support those changes in curriculum and testing.

1212
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:59,538
[SPEAKER_15]: We put in place some professional development for teachers in grades three through eight.

1213
01:32:00,478 --> 01:32:12,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Three through five was given predominantly during their professional development days, visits to the elementary schools and workshops that I had at the high school, which they attended.

1214
01:32:13,385 --> 01:32:17,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was to get them all ready for the next round of testing, which will be

1215
01:32:18,435 --> 01:32:21,596
[SPEAKER_15]: We are entering in that area now.

1216
01:32:22,476 --> 01:32:38,959
[SPEAKER_15]: All the teachers on the PD day took the online assessment to see what it was like and experience that firsthand so they'd have better knowledges of the challenges that might face the children with the use of the technology.

1217
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:47,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the middle school, a lot of the professional development was done within our department meeting time.

1218
01:32:48,102 --> 01:32:53,511
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, they were taking the test, giving practice tests to students.

1219
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:56,156
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a new program.

1220
01:32:56,236 --> 01:33:02,066
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a first year at the high school for Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and I'd like to thank.

1221
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:04,887
[SPEAKER_15]: members of the committee for voting that through.

1222
01:33:05,507 --> 01:33:24,720
[SPEAKER_15]: It is making a significant difference to have teachers all on the same pace, and that is in all the schools, and at the special education classrooms are using the same materials, as well as the English language learner classrooms.

1223
01:33:25,503 --> 01:33:27,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that is going well.

1224
01:33:27,343 --> 01:33:34,425
[SPEAKER_15]: We kicked off the year with some professional development in how to use the technology associated with the program.

1225
01:33:35,345 --> 01:33:43,206
[SPEAKER_15]: And also in the elementary, again, we're working on greater use of the technology.

1226
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:51,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So we know that at home, they have access to online textbooks and tutors through those programs.

1227
01:33:52,468 --> 01:33:54,288
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's going quite well.

1228
01:33:54,765 --> 01:33:57,126
[SPEAKER_15]: But like anything, it's so deep.

1229
01:33:57,206 --> 01:34:07,672
[SPEAKER_15]: There are many layers of the technology for the faculty to learn and to be able to share with the students.

1230
01:34:08,192 --> 01:34:10,594
[SPEAKER_15]: The program is integrated.

1231
01:34:10,634 --> 01:34:11,774
[SPEAKER_15]: We have co-teaching.

1232
01:34:12,335 --> 01:34:20,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Also at the high school now, we extended it to geometry classes in the hopes of expanding it to algebra too.

1233
01:34:20,899 --> 01:34:23,661
[SPEAKER_15]: It's working well in mathematics, and we just did it.

1234
01:34:24,177 --> 01:34:30,963
[SPEAKER_15]: an assessment on it, so if it can all be scheduled, we'd like to continue in that realm.

1235
01:34:32,385 --> 01:34:40,272
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's a co-teach model that we're using, and again, it will depend on staffing.

1236
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:52,425
[SPEAKER_15]: And the collaboration and outreach has been with our community members and also higher education.

1237
01:34:53,165 --> 01:34:56,226
[SPEAKER_15]: We had an opportunity right now.

1238
01:34:56,906 --> 01:35:02,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of our students are in the midst of taking courses through MIT's OpenCourseWare.

1239
01:35:03,387 --> 01:35:06,707
[SPEAKER_15]: They invited us into their BeaverWorks program.

1240
01:35:07,187 --> 01:35:10,108
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have, let's see, six students

1241
01:35:10,605 --> 01:35:15,848
[SPEAKER_15]: who have been granted entrance into the program.

1242
01:35:16,228 --> 01:35:22,832
[SPEAKER_15]: They're taking online programming courses and have now applied for a summer program.

1243
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:26,474
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're hoping to get some of the students in this summer program.

1244
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:36,942
[SPEAKER_15]: which will be a combination of programming and robotics, and it'll be free of charge to our students, so we're very hopeful all their applications are in.

1245
01:35:37,563 --> 01:35:48,371
[SPEAKER_15]: We had speakers come from Wentworth Institute in Applied Mathematics to talk to the students about, you know, how are you going to use this mathematics?

1246
01:35:49,152 --> 01:35:52,575
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they brought an entire team out,

1247
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:56,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Tufts University has always been a great partner with us.

1248
01:35:58,237 --> 01:36:00,879
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a few programs going with them.

1249
01:36:01,379 --> 01:36:10,044
[SPEAKER_15]: One is the STEM Ambassador's Program, where we sit down, the Director of Science and myself

1250
01:36:10,528 --> 01:36:14,369
[SPEAKER_15]: with the team from that program through Tisch College.

1251
01:36:14,909 --> 01:36:17,270
[SPEAKER_15]: We evaluate the program each year.

1252
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:23,672
[SPEAKER_15]: And last year, we found a need to kind of strengthen our pathway in computer science.

1253
01:36:24,212 --> 01:36:32,795
[SPEAKER_15]: And it turned out this year that almost 50% of the ambassadors coming from Tufts had that as a background.

1254
01:36:33,175 --> 01:36:38,476
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were able to bring some of the units into the physics class.

1255
01:36:38,516 --> 01:36:40,217
[SPEAKER_15]: We're using physics as their

1256
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:46,102
[SPEAKER_15]: vehicle of reaching students, and so they did some programming with them.

1257
01:36:46,862 --> 01:37:08,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And also through that program, I was able to meet a new faculty member in the Computer Science Department, who is starting a chapter of Girl Set Code, and invited Medford students, and we had quite a few, and I believe they've even connected with the Girl Scouts in Medford, to offer Saturday classes.

1258
01:37:08,716 --> 01:37:12,339
[SPEAKER_15]: And in turn, one of our teachers, Ms.

1259
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:25,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Faiza Khan, she went on the TEF Saturday program and spoke about her career pathway because she has an engineering background and programming background and teaches programming at the high school.

1260
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:32,856
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the other side, we had that professor, Dr. Laney Strange,

1261
01:37:33,317 --> 01:37:38,239
[SPEAKER_15]: come to Medford High School and speak about her career pathway.

1262
01:37:38,339 --> 01:37:41,059
[SPEAKER_15]: So it did work out well.

1263
01:37:41,179 --> 01:37:42,480
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a give and take.

1264
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:57,104
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be entering into a partnership with Harvard University on strategies for teaching Algebra I. So right now, we're just working out the details of the memorandum of agreement.

1265
01:37:57,844 --> 01:38:02,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And that will begin this summer with teacher education.

1266
01:38:04,258 --> 01:38:09,802
[SPEAKER_15]: the parent and guardian participation and communications.

1267
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:21,069
[SPEAKER_15]: We held several nights during the school year at the high school and we have an event coming up for parents of sixth graders.

1268
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:27,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Thursday if you can make it at seven o'clock at the high school talking about the pathways in our mathematics program.

1269
01:38:28,494 --> 01:38:30,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the elementary level we had

1270
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:40,245
[SPEAKER_15]: teachers open up their classroom and actually model Envision Math lessons so the parents could see just what it looked like in the classroom.

1271
01:38:41,186 --> 01:38:57,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So the funding for this present school year, again, the entire textbook budget went to the new high school adoption for Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2.

1272
01:38:59,723 --> 01:39:05,585
[SPEAKER_15]: instructional materials to support the program K through 12.

1273
01:39:07,145 --> 01:39:15,747
[SPEAKER_15]: So those were like mathematics specific materials that they needed in the classroom, and that included a lot of technology.

1274
01:39:16,588 --> 01:39:24,970
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting up to speed in trying to get document cameras in the classroom, and calculators are always a big expense.

1275
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And along with that comes a big expense for batteries every year.

1276
01:39:29,193 --> 01:39:31,634
[SPEAKER_15]: So that takes a good chunk of it.

1277
01:39:32,195 --> 01:39:37,418
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the office supplies just for operations for the department.

1278
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:52,409
[SPEAKER_15]: And so my request for next year's funding is pretty much level to what we had last year with a little bump up on the textbook item.

1279
01:39:53,025 --> 01:40:13,955
[SPEAKER_15]: and that is so that we can pay our last payment for the textbook program, and then a little bit of extra money for those senior programs should we see a shift in enrollment and need to buy some books, or when you're at a classroom, the teacher materials are quite expensive, but I'm not

1280
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:21,814
[SPEAKER_15]: projecting anything very great, but we do know that our enrollment has been fluctuating.

1281
01:40:21,854 --> 01:40:33,076
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been bringing in students, which is a good thing, but we need to kind of look ahead to see if any more monies need to be put in that direction.

1282
01:40:34,216 --> 01:40:35,957
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you have any questions.

1283
01:40:36,177 --> 01:40:36,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1284
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:37,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

1285
01:40:37,257 --> 01:40:37,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Vandekloot.

1286
01:40:38,457 --> 01:40:41,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Could I just ask, what was the date of the pathways?

1287
01:40:43,363 --> 01:40:45,305
[SPEAKER_15]: That's this Thursday evening.

1288
01:40:45,845 --> 01:40:46,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1289
01:40:46,045 --> 01:40:47,006
[SPEAKER_15]: And where is it being held?

1290
01:40:47,186 --> 01:40:51,870
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be at the science lecture hall at the high school at seven o'clock to eight o'clock.

1291
01:40:53,425 --> 01:40:54,706
[SPEAKER_21]: There's so many things that night.

1292
01:40:55,086 --> 01:40:55,607
[SPEAKER_15]: There is.

1293
01:40:55,987 --> 01:40:57,368
[SPEAKER_21]: And that one didn't get on our list.

1294
01:40:57,408 --> 01:40:58,369
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you very much.

1295
01:40:58,629 --> 01:40:59,249
[SPEAKER_21]: You're welcome.

1296
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:01,431
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess one other comment.

1297
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:14,440
[SPEAKER_21]: I really like that there's been so much interaction between our students and Tufts and many of the other MIT and whatever, so that our students are seeing real world

1298
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:18,362
[SPEAKER_21]: potential jobs in mathematics and what people do with it.

1299
01:41:18,382 --> 01:41:22,765
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that clearly your report listed so many of them, and I think that's terrific.

1300
01:41:22,805 --> 01:41:23,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1301
01:41:24,285 --> 01:41:24,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1302
01:41:25,286 --> 01:41:30,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor for a motion to receive in place on file by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

1303
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:31,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Cuno?

1304
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:32,130
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1305
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:33,411
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1306
01:41:33,451 --> 01:41:33,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1307
01:41:33,971 --> 01:41:34,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1308
01:41:34,732 --> 01:41:34,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Joy.

1309
01:41:39,037 --> 01:41:44,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up, report on personnel hiring September 1st, 2016 to March 29th, 2017.

1310
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:46,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

1311
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a report that you requested, and it's listing.

1312
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,202
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty obvious as to what's there.

1313
01:41:51,882 --> 01:41:55,763
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll give you updates as they require.

1314
01:41:56,824 --> 01:41:58,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Mr. Superintendent.

1315
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:03,206
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor to accept by Mr. Benedetto.

1316
01:42:03,226 --> 01:42:04,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a seconded by Ms.

1317
01:42:05,007 --> 01:42:05,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Van der Kloot?

1318
01:42:05,547 --> 01:42:06,247
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1319
01:42:06,267 --> 01:42:06,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1320
01:42:07,027 --> 01:42:07,728
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1321
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:08,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1322
01:42:11,085 --> 01:42:15,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, if I could just make an announcement from the floor.

1323
01:42:15,607 --> 01:42:17,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not related to schools.

1324
01:42:17,408 --> 01:42:19,309
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the big sweep is starting on Monday.

1325
01:42:20,109 --> 01:42:21,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody check your website.

1326
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:25,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign up for the website to get alerts.

1327
01:42:25,231 --> 01:42:26,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Please sign up through the website.

1328
01:42:27,332 --> 01:42:31,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And just watch for your area when it's going to be covered, because there is ticketing and towing involved.

1329
01:42:31,934 --> 01:42:34,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know that's very expensive, but it's the only way we can get it done.

1330
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:35,996
[SPEAKER_09]: So a shout out.

1331
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It's starting next Wednesday.

1332
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:38,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1333
01:42:40,509 --> 01:42:40,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1334
01:42:40,849 --> 01:42:46,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to throw a couple of quick information pieces out there tomorrow night?

1335
01:42:46,752 --> 01:42:55,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm at the city council again seeking matching funds for the culinary arts hospitality project.

1336
01:42:56,956 --> 01:42:58,056
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got a breakout here.

1337
01:42:58,636 --> 01:43:03,979
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can see, we're putting in quite a bit of our own money and outside money as well as a state grant.

1338
01:43:04,839 --> 01:43:04,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

1339
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:13,216
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's 500,000 from the state, there's 813,000 in kind, and we're asking the council for free cash for 250,000.

1340
01:43:13,256 --> 01:43:14,879
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll be there tomorrow night.

1341
01:43:14,959 --> 01:43:17,583
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also,

1342
01:43:19,305 --> 01:43:21,025
[SPEAKER_14]: because next Monday is Passover.

1343
01:43:21,105 --> 01:43:23,546
[SPEAKER_14]: We inadvertently scheduled it for Monday night.

1344
01:43:23,566 --> 01:43:24,806
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd like to move it to the 24th.

1345
01:43:25,026 --> 01:43:31,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I scheduled, you know, just tentatively the 26th, but that may have some conflicts with the mayor and other things.

1346
01:43:31,928 --> 01:43:35,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll get back to you for a meeting on, on the community schools.

1347
01:43:35,089 --> 01:43:37,149
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get a date that works for all of you.

1348
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:40,010
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll looking to schedule a date.

1349
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:47,852
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll check with the mayor's office and elsewhere, uh, for a community school, not a community schools, a, uh, school council report night.

1350
01:43:48,864 --> 01:43:54,609
[SPEAKER_14]: So just some of the dates that we're trying to juggle to make sure everybody can be in attendance.

1351
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:56,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're good.

1352
01:44:03,272 --> 01:44:03,912
[SPEAKER_21]: 10th is canceled?

1353
01:44:04,272 --> 01:44:04,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1354
01:44:04,752 --> 01:44:07,613
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's rescheduled to April 24th.

1355
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:08,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1356
01:44:08,534 --> 01:44:08,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1357
01:44:09,334 --> 01:44:09,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1358
01:44:10,454 --> 01:44:17,976
[SPEAKER_21]: I did wonder, uh, when we were given the school council reports, my colleague earlier asked about, uh, the PTO representation.

1359
01:44:18,016 --> 01:44:25,078
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wondered if we might, um, combine those two because often the school council reports reflect.

1360
01:44:25,098 --> 01:44:25,698
[SPEAKER_14]: We can.

1361
01:44:25,738 --> 01:44:29,319
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I suggest is, is that those meetings tend to be very long.

1362
01:44:29,619 --> 01:44:30,140
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

1363
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:30,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um,

1364
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,823
[SPEAKER_14]: You might want a different meeting for that, just simply because those meetings are long as it is.

1365
01:44:36,143 --> 01:44:36,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1366
01:44:36,543 --> 01:44:38,684
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes we hear about them.

1367
01:44:38,704 --> 01:44:42,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes the same people, but that can go for a few hours.

1368
01:44:42,186 --> 01:44:42,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1369
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:56,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to follow up on that, I would like it to be here at the chambers so that way we acknowledge the people that are really doing so much time and service to our community for our students.

1370
01:44:56,235 --> 01:44:59,857
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd rather really have them present to us here.

1371
01:45:00,747 --> 01:45:02,910
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than a committee at a regular meeting.

1372
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1373
01:45:04,732 --> 01:45:05,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1374
01:45:05,072 --> 01:45:05,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1375
01:45:05,593 --> 01:45:08,536
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd have to schedule as a regular meeting, but it's our special meeting.

1376
01:45:08,576 --> 01:45:11,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put that way or add it to our agenda.

1377
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:12,601
Okay.

1378
01:45:13,082 --> 01:45:13,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1379
01:45:13,262 --> 01:45:13,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Cunha.

1380
01:45:13,823 --> 01:45:19,550
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing about having everybody here for the, uh, psych council meeting is I know that, um,

1381
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people like to sit at the round table like when we have an open meeting like that and they feel that they could come and be more casual in that.

1382
01:45:29,408 --> 01:45:30,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could still have it.

1383
01:45:33,092 --> 01:45:33,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the PTO.

1384
01:45:33,713 --> 01:45:34,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1385
01:45:34,374 --> 01:45:35,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we were talking about side council.

1386
01:45:37,288 --> 01:45:39,550
[SPEAKER_14]: You're talking about the PTO meeting being in the council chambers?

1387
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:39,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1388
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:40,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1389
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:40,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1390
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:43,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1391
01:45:44,633 --> 01:45:46,474
[SPEAKER_09]: New business, school committee resolution.

1392
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:51,198

1393
01:45:51,698 --> 01:45:55,801

1394
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:58,623
[SPEAKER_09]: He was a strong supporter of the Medford public schools.

1395
01:46:01,453 --> 01:46:06,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Stephen DeVoe.

1396
01:46:06,099 --> 01:46:08,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. DeVoe was the brother of former superintendent Phillip DeVoe.

1397
01:46:08,883 --> 01:46:10,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. DeVoe was a 1964 graduate of Medford High School.

1398

[SPEAKER_09]: Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Frank Loschuto.

01:46:19,845 --> 01:46:20,305

1400
01:46:20,325 --> 01:46:20,906

[SPEAKER_09]: Senator Donnelly lost his courageous battle with brain cancer this past Sunday.

1404
01:46:34,879 --> 01:46:38,623
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could all please rise and take a moment of silence on the past of these individuals.

1405
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:51,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's one other item.

1406
01:46:51,917 --> 01:47:01,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its congratulations to Director of Pupil Services, Kathy Medaglio, on the birth of her first grandchild, Reese James McMahon.

1407
01:47:02,026 --> 01:47:04,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Reese is the son of social studies teacher, Dana McMahon.

1408
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:06,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations, Ms.

01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Medaglio.

1410
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:13,636
[SPEAKER_09]: We all got to see beautiful pictures earlier, so congratulations.

1411
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:14,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy every minute of that.

1412
01:47:16,486 --> 01:47:18,733
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that is the final item on our agenda.

1413
01:47:18,753 --> 01:47:20,839
[SPEAKER_09]: There are no negotiations in legal matters.

1414
