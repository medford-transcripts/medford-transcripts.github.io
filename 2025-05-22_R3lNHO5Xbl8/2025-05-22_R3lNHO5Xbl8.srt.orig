[SPEAKER_12]: Microphone check one, two.

2
00:13:06,856 --> 00:13:07,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Mic check.

3
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Check mic one, two.

4
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:38,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford City Council Committee of the whole May 21 2025 is called to order Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

11
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:16,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Our action discussion items today are 25039 for the budget process, preliminary budget meeting, and 25085 submitted by the mayor in appropriation of free cash.

12
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:23,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a discussion and it'll be, it could be referred to a regular meeting for

13
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:24,923
[SPEAKER_02]: final action.

14
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get it out of the way, we're going to take 25085 first.

15
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an appropriation of free cash for parking kiosk replacement and soil remediation at 448 High Street.

16
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear President Behrs and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following free cash appropriation in the total amount of $150,859.89 for the following, or 98 cents for the following, 92,859.98 for replacement of the remaining Flowbird parking kiosks, IPS parking kiosks, and 58,000 for the continuation of solar remediation services at 448 High Street.

17
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:09,149
[SPEAKER_02]: The balance of free cash before this vote is $22,311,303.11.

18
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Parking Director Sarah McDermott and City Engineer Owen Wartella will be available to answer any questions on the respective requests.

19
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your kind attention to these matters.

20
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Brianne Aligo-Kern, Mayor.

21
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:24,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing Owen, I do see Sarah.

22
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:34,398
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys wanna come up and present a little bit more about these requests, and maybe we can start with the parking kiosks as we await the City Engineer.

23
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:39,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can feel free to move that down, if helpful.

24
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:51,005
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do want to note that Councilor Collins has arrived and Councilor Lemming is absent due to military service so we'll go to parking director right now.

25
00:20:53,029 --> 00:21:07,761
[SPEAKER_19]: So as of today, the city of Medford has 12 remaining Flowbird parking kiosks that were originally part of Park Medford's inventory of kiosks that the city of Medford took over seven years into the contract.

26
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:08,982
[SPEAKER_19]: We had full ownership of them.

27
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:10,703
[SPEAKER_19]: 12 of them remain.

28
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:21,152
[SPEAKER_19]: There are three on Clippership Drive and nine on Boston Ave from Harvard Street over up Boston Ave down College to Cousins Gym at Tufts.

29
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:33,386
[SPEAKER_19]: These meters are unreliable and are not able to be repaired according to my meter 4 person, Mike Viola.

30
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:52,057
[SPEAKER_19]: The positive thing is we have removed four IPS meters from a different part of Boston Avenue for a large project at Tufts, which we can use to replace some of these meters in the meantime to provide kiosks that actually work for our customers.

31
00:21:52,797 --> 00:22:01,301
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, so that's, I mean, I don't know what questions you all might have, but I'm happy to try and answer any.

32
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, Councilor Lazaro.

33
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:10,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, as the parking department I know is revenue generating department.

34
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:17,805
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems clear to me that we it's in our interest to make sure things are working appropriately.

35
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, the

36
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:22,956
[SPEAKER_18]: The parking kiosks.

37
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this different than a meter?

38
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,700
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this at a parking lot?

39
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:27,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

40
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:32,146
[SPEAKER_19]: So I refer to them as kiosks because the city does have single space meters.

41
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:39,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So the individual space by space meters I will generally refer to as meters and then these pay by space kiosks.

42
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:45,500
[SPEAKER_19]: and they cover multiple spaces.

43
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,324
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm referring to 12 kiosks, not single space meters.

44
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:58,208
[SPEAKER_19]: So these kiosks would cover, I don't know, nine kiosks.

45
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:06,233
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the inventory of how many spaces it would cover, but it's a significant portion of Boston Avenue between Harvard and Cousin's Gym on College Ave.

46
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:10,936
[SPEAKER_19]: And the reason that it is important that those meters start to work functionally

47
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:20,759
[SPEAKER_19]: soon is that we've lost about 40 plus spaces at the 400 block of Boston Avenue due to the Tufts Dormitory Project.

48
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:27,380
[SPEAKER_19]: So those spaces are utilized most every day by people commuting on the Green Line.

49
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:41,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if we have reliable kiosks on a different part of Boston Avenue, we can easily transition all of the folks who are used to parking in one part of Boston Avenue to a similar distance away on a different part of Boston Avenue and not encounter

50
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:43,746
[SPEAKER_19]: functionality issues.

51
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:50,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Something I failed to mention is that these kiosks from Flowbird are still under a different vendor.

52
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:56,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So Flowbird charges us per meter per kiosk per month.

53
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:56,927
[SPEAKER_19]: It's

54
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,929
[SPEAKER_19]: $66 per kiosk per month for 12 months.

55
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,230
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been paid for the year 2025.

56
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:15,434
[SPEAKER_19]: So another benefit is if we replace any Flowbird kiosks and take them out of commission, I can likely get refunded the unused portion of 2025.

57
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:25,821
[SPEAKER_19]: In total, we've paid them $9,504 for the use of their kiosks for the year 2025, calendar year 2025.

58
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:36,369
[SPEAKER_19]: And if any that are taking it up commission, I can recoup that money as soon as they're deactivated, they'll stop the service and we should be able to request a refund.

59
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:49,238
[SPEAKER_18]: So do you have an estimate for how long it would take to likely recoup the cost of the kiosks?

60
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,360
[SPEAKER_19]: That's hard for me to say.

61
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Simply, I could look up the amount that the flow bird meters have produced, but it wouldn't really truly reflect

62
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:16,420
[SPEAKER_19]: what the IPS kiosks could produce because they'd be more functional and with just the shift in the customer base for those kiosks, I could estimate, but I couldn't give you an accurate number of what I could expect to recoup and when.

63
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,160
[SPEAKER_19]: But

64
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:20,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'll leave it at that.

65
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:38,838
[SPEAKER_18]: In general, I just would want to say that I think that when we have functioning parking equipment, it's much better for that department and for all of the all of the parking in the city to be super functional and available for people on a

66
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,440
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a good practice.

67
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,283
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a good baseline because then people are used to regularly paying for parking.

68
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:49,366
[SPEAKER_18]: They're doing it by habit, and it's, um, more consistent.

69
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:50,907
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a good practice.

70
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:51,848
[SPEAKER_18]: So thanks.

71
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,690
[SPEAKER_18]: I would be in favor of Thank you.

72
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other questions from members of the council?

73
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I

74
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:13,360
[SPEAKER_19]: I think hadn't considered putting in single space meters.

75
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:15,822
[SPEAKER_19]: I could absolutely get an estimate for that.

76
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:23,606
[SPEAKER_19]: But in that area, they have been kiosks for since 2014 when they were originally installed.

77
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:35,352
[SPEAKER_19]: So I believe to kind of harken on what Councillor Lazaro said, it would stay consistent with what the folks in that area are already used to using, if for no other reason than that.

78
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:36,013
[SPEAKER_19]: But I could

79
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:47,798
[SPEAKER_19]: I could get an estimate as to what it would cost to acquire and install single space meters for the spaces along that drive if that's what the council would like to compare.

80
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:51,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Back of the napkin, would you guess would be more expensive?

81
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:59,935
[SPEAKER_19]: If I had to guess, I don't know that it would be any less expensive because it is a substantial amount of spaces.

82
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:06,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And that would be, it would be at least 30 or 40 single space parking meters.

83
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:16,100
[SPEAKER_19]: But like I said, I don't know off the top of my head what those are per meter, especially now I don't, I could look at what we paid for them in the past and it might be different.

84
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,582
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd have to request a quote from IPS to get a better determination.

85
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:23,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And would those require like electrical wiring to install and

86
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,908
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they're all charged by solar power.

87
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:31,793
[SPEAKER_19]: There's batteries inside that get charged continuously in the sunlight, but it would require, so there's three components.

88
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:46,547
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the pole, the post, and then of course, installation of each of those posts per space, the housing that holds the mechanism, and then inside the mechanism itself, which is probably the most expensive part where all the electronics and the magic happens.

89
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:47,928
[SPEAKER_19]: So that,

90
00:27:48,889 --> 00:28:00,353
[SPEAKER_19]: it might be less equipment-wise, but it's a lot more installation, whereas the infrastructure to install these kiosks is already in the ground and actually will be.

91
00:28:01,253 --> 00:28:12,657
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a section of that part of Boston Ave just, I guess, north of Harvard Street that we don't have kiosks in right now because they've been doing construction, but they're about to be reinstalled in the coming weeks.

92
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's between the college intersection and Harvard Street?

93
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,639
[SPEAKER_19]: It's on Boston Ave between Harbor Street and College Avenue.

94
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,339
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, yes.

95
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,581
[SPEAKER_02]: What's our compliance like in the area, especially around the T station.

96
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:34,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So are a lot of people using the kiosk like how often are we seeing people parking all day to take the T and how often are we ticketing them and.

97
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:40,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, yeah, it's just kind of a unique area of public parking and that's why I'm wondering what the best treatment might be.

98
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:51,641
[SPEAKER_19]: So compliance has gone up recently simply because that a lot of the T workers park there, which is a complaint I've heard, but also they're paying customers just like any other citizen.

99
00:28:51,721 --> 00:29:02,725
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we did recently, I believe it was in March, we expanded the prepaid time so that people who come to park there to go to work early

100
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:07,327
[SPEAKER_19]: can prepay for their session starting at 4.30 AM.

101
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:17,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Previously, the prepay wasn't allowed until 7.30 AM, which is well after some of the employees and students park there to get a space.

102
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,094
[SPEAKER_19]: And so compliance has gone up since then.

103
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:24,875
[SPEAKER_19]: We do still have, I would say right now it's about average.

104
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:28,257
[SPEAKER_19]: We take 20 spaces that are occupying.

105
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's any more or less

106
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:38,901
[SPEAKER_19]: abused than any other area, especially now that we've expanded the start time to 4.30 a.m.

107
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:45,142
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't charge between 4.30 and 8.30, but they can pay for their session to start at 8.30 a.m.

108
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:47,282
[SPEAKER_19]: as early as 4.30 a.m.

109
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:50,003
[SPEAKER_19]: And then they can pay for the whole day until 6 p.m.

110
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,124
[SPEAKER_19]: when the meters are no longer active.

111
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:52,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's unlimited.

112
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,344
[SPEAKER_02]: They can stay the whole day.

113
00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:57,585
[SPEAKER_19]: In that particular zone, they can, yes.

114
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:07,539
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the zones are limited to three hours but that zone and I think a couple others are a place that road is another one that you can park all day it's designed for commuters.

115
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

116
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:12,427
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and enforcement is going up there on a daily basis.

117
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:24,722
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very frequent up there simply because it is a popular area and it's also near another municipal lot and it's en route to a lot of residential areas as well.

118
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:25,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

119
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:29,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So my last question is kind of on a two year time horizon with the dorm project.

120
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:33,329
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of the use in that area is going to change.

121
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:36,691
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a lot more people, probably a lot more activity.

122
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:41,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Tufts is talking about significant improvements to the street.

123
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,197
[SPEAKER_02]: How has the kiosk project been incorporated into that?

124
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:55,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hate to see us buy these and then take them out, you know, in two years because of the significant design changes on the street.

125
00:30:56,223 --> 00:31:07,967
[SPEAKER_19]: It's my understanding that once the project is complete, we have already spoken to the contractor who requested that we remove the four kiosks from either side of Boston Avenue there.

126
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:12,549
[SPEAKER_19]: And part of our discussion was the reinstallation after the fact.

127
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:21,732
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have communication with them, letting them know we'll need to be there when the concrete's poured so we can put our bolts in to reinstall them and also signage.

128
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:25,193
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's my understanding that the kiosks that we're taking out

129
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,335
[SPEAKER_19]: will only be temporarily removed and will be put back.

130
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:34,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Should there be changes in the planned use of the curb between now and then, that might change.

131
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,343
[SPEAKER_19]: But as of right now, the plan is to reinstall these four kiosks after the project's complete.

132
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

133
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this other side of the street as well?

134
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:43,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

135
00:31:43,426 --> 00:31:43,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

136
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:48,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if there are changes on the other side of the street, I know that they've talked about in the sidewalk over there as well.

137
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,490
[SPEAKER_02]: strange to say the least.

138
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:50,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

139
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,471
[SPEAKER_02]: With that weird kind of lip.

140
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:54,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's going to be changed.

141
00:31:54,731 --> 00:32:00,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So would we install these now and then maybe have to uninstall them and then they redesign and then we reinstall them?

142
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:00,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of?

143
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:09,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I also have a request from a constituent which has been approved by the mayor to install or reinstall because it's been removed before my time here.

144
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:13,535
[SPEAKER_19]: A second kiosk in the West Medford municipal lot behind

145
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:17,837
[SPEAKER_19]: located closer to the rear of Pompeo Insurance.

146
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:24,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Because right now there's one kiosk in that lot, and I've heard several people request an additional one be put back where it used to be.

147
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:25,822
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's another one.

148
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:33,207
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have one spare, and we're planning on reinstalling that there as soon as we can get the concrete poured.

149
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,449
[SPEAKER_19]: But we do like to have at least one spare aside anyway.

150
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:41,432
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, I don't know.

151
00:32:44,037 --> 00:32:55,570
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if they decide to change the entire curb at the tough storm that would leave for kiosks that were no longer necessary based on the use that we have now.

152
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:58,954
[SPEAKER_19]: One could be the spare that we.

153
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:00,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Um.

154
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:05,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Replace the spare from West Medford, and then the most would be left with is three.

155
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:09,704
[SPEAKER_19]: And to be honest, we could stand to have another one in the Lambert Street lot.

156
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:12,847
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's that would be a recommended uses for that.

157
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:14,408
[SPEAKER_19]: And then perhaps, um.

158
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Somewhere in the I don't I'm hesitant to say the clipper should drive a lot because I know

159
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:28,203
[SPEAKER_19]: We might end up with spares should the uses change on Boston.

160
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:28,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

161
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:42,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess my only thought would be, let's make sure that if there's significant changes that the reinstallation removal and reinstallation if necessary is something that tops and their contractor is responsible for.

162
00:33:46,444 --> 00:34:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Installing them and then having to pay whatever the installation fees are in a few years if they make significant changes to locations or or the lot of the street i'm thinking actually on the track side of Boston Avenue across from the dorm that's kind of where my concerns are.

163
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:07,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and we have two from that side and two from the top side.

164
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are off on that side too.

165
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

166
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,321
[SPEAKER_19]: There's two from one side, two from the other side that have currently been removed for that project.

167
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:22,243
[SPEAKER_19]: So if they change the railroad side of the street, then that would only impact two of the kiosks that we currently have out there.

168
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:23,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

169
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:23,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

170
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:24,303
[SPEAKER_19]: You're welcome.

171
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions?

172
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:34,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, we'll go to Engineer Wartella to talk about the Soil Remediation Services.

173
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:37,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

174
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:42,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Owen, we can hear you.

175
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,326
[SPEAKER_05]: What's happening at 448 High Street?

176
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, thank you so much for taking this on.

177
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to extend the contract for the remediation for another two years.

178
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:58,714
[SPEAKER_05]: This contract is for having our consultant do that work.

179
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:08,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need some funding to continue the work so that we can continue to report it and monitor it.

180
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Which lot is this again?

181
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,405
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the lot behind, it's on the corner of Canal and High Street.

182
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:15,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

183
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:18,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So behind the shops over there.

184
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's like a hair salon, a liquor store, a restaurant, a few restaurants.

185
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:27,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

186
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions, Councilor Callahan?

187
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,039
[SPEAKER_11]: just super basic, why are we doing soil remediation there?

188
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:45,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that was started back with the previous administration and it's over like a decade old.

189
00:35:45,948 --> 00:35:54,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to, we own the lot, there is contaminated soils, the remediation has been occurring for

190
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:56,415
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years plus.

191
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just continuing it.

192
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:01,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be the last little bit of it, we hope.

193
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:01,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Fingers crossed.

194
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:04,378
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all there really is.

195
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:06,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just operation, maintenance, and testing, and reporting.

196
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:08,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

197
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:09,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

198
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we know the source of the contamination?

199
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the old, from what has been told to me, I wasn't around here either at that time.

200
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:20,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an old laundromat that was there.

201
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:22,043
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

202
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:23,283
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

203
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:24,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

204
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any further questions for the City Engineer?

205
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:34,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, is there a motion and it would be to refer out?

206
00:36:36,817 --> 00:36:42,162
[SPEAKER_02]: A motion to refer to the regular meeting by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Sang.

207
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:43,343
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

208
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:45,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposed?

209
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:45,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

210
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Owen.

211
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:47,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

212
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

213
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:49,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Already gotten back to work.

214
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:51,860
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

215
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we're going to take 25039 Annual Budget Process Preliminary Budget Meeting.

216
00:36:57,122 --> 00:37:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we're talking Assessor, Building, Clerk, Legislative, Electrical, Fire, Insurance, Pensions, Bonds, and Interests, and Recreation slash Farmhouse Stadium.

217
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take Recreation first.

218
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:14,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go to our Rec Director, Kevin Bailey, and we will hear about what's happening in the Recreation

219
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,230
[SPEAKER_02]: department.

220
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:27,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So first I'm just going to read off the budget, and then we'll do Hormel next but here we have department recreation fiscal 25 budget 607,787 fiscal 26 proposed 641,373 for an increase of $33,586.

221
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:42,170
[SPEAKER_02]: As our net increase, we have some fixed cost growth.

222
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:53,276
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some step increase, stipend increase, or a stipend that's eligible for, and additional training for part-time employees.

223
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have a new expense under part-time employees for an office manager position for the department.

224
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that,

225
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:05,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a general kind of three items that I asked everyone.

226
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:11,433
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, just share, you know, any other things you'd like to talk about with the change in the budget.

227
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let us know kind of what your accomplishments were this year.

228
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:17,299
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some goals for the upcoming year.

229
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, what are items that aren't funded in this budget that you'd like to see funded in the future.

230
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

231
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:39,703
[SPEAKER_00]: just to go from order my binder if it's okay we'll start with settings and goals from this year and future that have a flight 26 great so we actually had four goals this year that we were working on.

232
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:50,139
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first one I think we talked about it briefly last night is last, the end of last spring we received a bus.

233
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,608
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 passenger bus with opera funding so one of our goals this year was to really utilize that bus.

234
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:02,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was supposed to be shared between the Council of Aging and the Recreation Department.

235
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:11,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So our original plan wasn't to use it too often, but to do field trips and possibly snow tubing and different activities with that.

236
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: The Council of Aging did find that without handrails and the way the seating is, it's a little tight.

237
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:22,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So recreation does have a little bit more availability to utilize that.

238
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:28,338
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we did offer a couple of field trips.

239
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:32,882
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to go to the Ecopterium over the summertime.

240
00:39:33,322 --> 00:39:34,843
[SPEAKER_00]: We did indoor rock climbing.

241
00:39:34,923 --> 00:39:39,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to boat aboard, I believe, and Sky Zone.

242
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:44,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did start some of the things that we kind of had on the list that we really wanted to start with field trips.

243
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:46,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to do that.

244
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:49,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the summertime, our program manager,

245
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:57,923
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted to do a program called adventure week where that whole entire week each day we were doing different field trips for the entire day.

246
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:10,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandably, getting the van late spring, by the time we got it out and we got the vendors and the program put together, it was already July.

247
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,162
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have the ability to really get enough numbers to execute that program.

248
00:40:15,902 --> 00:40:22,685
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would love to continue something like that as well towards the end of the season and something more for the older teens.

249
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:33,981
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we're doing with the van this week, and it kind of ties into another goal, was to use the bus during our summer park program.

250
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:44,290
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a strong advantage of having our own van where we can do field trips and not increase the cost of our summer park program.

251
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:49,615
[SPEAKER_00]: So we changed the way we're doing our summer park program, but we increased it.

252
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:56,746
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did groups of 10 so that every day, that bus is going to be used where a group of 10 is going to go on a field trip.

253
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:00,468
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different things planned out.

254
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:05,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to Nahon Beach, we're going to Beaverbrook reservations, we're doing hikes around Wrights Tower.

255
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:15,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, to try to keep costs down, we're trying to visit, you can tell a lot of our state parks and just different unique experiences around the area that we want to make sure that all the kids get to.

256
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,649
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing other things like fishing up at Wrights Pond.

257
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:33,637
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other nice things we just recently this is only two weeks ago we received a grant from the Tufts Community Fund for the summer park program so some of it is being allocated for financial aid by any remaining

258
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:38,510
[SPEAKER_00]: funds left over is going to be used for the summer park program.

259
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:46,355
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking at trying to use that money to do either kayaking or some other kind of paid field trips.

260
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:53,439
[SPEAKER_00]: The second goal that we're trying to do is intramural program for our middle school students.

261
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:57,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Very truthfully, it was a struggle to try to get this up and going.

262
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:01,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that we continue to try to get going.

263
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:09,265
[SPEAKER_00]: But our program manager has been out for a very extended period of time.

264
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:13,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was one that was kind of a struggle, but we were able to get it going.

265
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:18,489
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the fall programming, we already have one intramural started.

266
00:42:19,729 --> 00:42:25,012
[SPEAKER_00]: John Curley, who is our facilities coordinator is also the high school football coach.

267
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:27,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked him to kind of help get that started.

268
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:32,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one we're gonna do is flag football for middle school students this fall.

269
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:45,327
[SPEAKER_00]: And another goal that we had was to enhance our summer park program and our saga program saga is basically our school vacation week programs and when there is a professional development days.

270
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:50,030
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we are using that van, which I think is gonna be great to enhance it.

271
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:55,653
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we were able to partner with is with City Year.

272
00:42:56,354 --> 00:43:01,417
[SPEAKER_00]: City Year is actually a group of volunteers that help us staff the saga program.

273
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:04,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we've been able to increase our enrollment.

274
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:15,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we only take 20 to 30 people into our saga program, particularly February vacation and sometimes April vacation, we don't have the college students back.

275
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:22,507
[SPEAKER_00]: But having this partnership does give us more people we've been able to increase it past 50 people.

276
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:31,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had actually no waitlist this year for our school vacation week so that was a really nice to see and be able to do that and grow that program.

277
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:37,490
[SPEAKER_00]: We also in the summer park program this year, one of our goals was to figure out

278
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:47,945
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor space and location, we actually decided this year, we're gonna do a little bit of work over at Lacanee Rain, cleaning out the hockey bed, and we're gonna have that as a rain location.

279
00:43:48,045 --> 00:44:06,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So the summer park program, if we're as a plan that most of the day is gonna be rain, we're gonna actually relocate a camp over at Lacanee and we'll have basketball, we'll have pickleball nets, we'll have corn hole, we'll have a bunch of activities out there so that we can really use that like a gym space.

280
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:21,459
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to share is the year previously, if you remember, one of those goals was the Friends of Method Recreation to get established and then get running.

281
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:30,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has done wonders to our department as well with the fundraising efforts and trying to apply financial aid.

282
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,887
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the nice things with this.

283
00:44:34,728 --> 00:44:50,135
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been able to apply a lot of financial aid to our typical programs we have children, jumping into wrestling into archery and all different programs but when you do look at specifically the saga and the summer park program.

284
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:56,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Already we've given out over $2,410 on financial assistance.

285
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:05,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just kind of shows that effect of the previous year goal, how that is helping us out and helping make sure that our programs are accessible to everyone.

286
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:15,592
[SPEAKER_00]: The very last one we talked about, and this is one of my own personal goals, and anyone who knows me knows that I have a real passion for aquatics.

287
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:20,899
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to try to get to offering free swim lessons over at Tufts Pool.

288
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,921
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to work on this.

289
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:27,842
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some grants that we found that is available.

290
00:45:28,383 --> 00:45:34,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think as I said before, we need to make sure that we're running a nationally recognized program.

291
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:39,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, we've actually did our own in-house swim program.

292
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:55,970
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep it affordable to keep the cost down, but it does seem if we do go with a national program like the American Red Cross, while there is some upfront expenses of having our staff train as water safety instructors and to bring in an instructor.

293
00:45:56,721 --> 00:46:02,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I let my instructor elapse, but we'll have to bring in an outside person to teach it for right now.

294
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:14,839
[SPEAKER_00]: There is going to be a little bit upfront, but it does make us eligible for these grants, and one particularly is going to be a DCR grant, Department of Conservation and Recreation.

295
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:16,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have that identified.

296
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:20,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already spoken to a water safety instructor trainer.

297
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:33,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary judge if anyone knows she is a method resident and the high school swim coach, but she is an instructor trainer so she is already scheduled to run a WSI class at house pool.

298
00:46:34,449 --> 00:46:40,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon as we get it filled so the week of June 9 we will get started and get our staff WSI certified.

299
00:46:42,651 --> 00:46:44,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the goals for this year.

300
00:46:44,132 --> 00:46:46,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that we've been able to accomplish.

301
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:54,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're still working on some of these goals, but a lot of it we have certainly helped enhance and continue to work on them.

302
00:46:55,881 --> 00:47:06,387
[SPEAKER_00]: For FYI 26 is a three goals that we want to be working on the first one we talked about as a group is to enhance our team programs may you know we have team nights.

303
00:47:06,947 --> 00:47:15,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've heard before is that it's just open gym it's a place for kids to go, and we do have a group of kids that typically

304
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:17,913
[SPEAKER_00]: come visit and play basketball, which is great.

305
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:20,335
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of want to take that to the next level.

306
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:25,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly now, we have a little bit more classroom space at the YMCA.

307
00:47:25,618 --> 00:47:36,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about we have like a TV in my office that we will allow when the kids are watching a movie, we can certainly get a video game controller in there, have a section where kids can play video games.

308
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:43,028
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also talked about looking at purchasing other things if we can do ping pong tables and

309
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:51,702
[SPEAKER_00]: and other things that we can store, that collapse, that can fold, we can have more activities down there just to kind of enhance that teen program as well.

310
00:47:54,344 --> 00:48:02,230
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that our staff I think had a great idea is to try to offer a paint night during the teen night drop-in.

311
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:11,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working with a couple of people that have done paint nights with us to see if they can try to bring that into the teen night program.

312
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:16,481
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is to expand our therapeutic recreation programs.

313
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:26,488
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we did work with a collaboration between Method, Malden and Somerville Recreation to try to grow that therapeutic recreation offering.

314
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:34,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the goal by having the three is more children will enroll and participate in that program to make sure we have the numbers to run it.

315
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:37,356
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have one at Somerville.

316
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:40,639
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our teen drop-in program, which is great,

317
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,420
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now going into the summer session.

318
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,423
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running our adaptive swim lesson.

319
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,765
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that we've been running for several years.

320
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:50,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been popular.

321
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:57,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Even right now, this program doesn't begin until after July 4th, and it's already at full enrollment.

322
00:48:57,752 --> 00:49:02,816
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with some of them in Malden to get some more instructors, and I am as well.

323
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:04,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to increase that.

324
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:10,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plan is to just continue to grow that program.

325
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:12,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we have more people in that adaptive.

326
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:20,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a sensory friendly open swim at Tufts pool, Saturday mornings from nine to 10 before we open up to the public.

327
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:33,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives a little bit of a quieter time that people with families with special needs or have sensory has the ability to visit the pool at a dedicated time that might be a little bit easier for them.

328
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:39,667
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Who's Without Limits that we are planning for the fall session as well.

329
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:50,331
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a preschool program, well, I shouldn't say preschool, it's more for youth program, and then we have another one for tweens that is already on the schedule for the fall.

330
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:56,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plan is to continue with that collaboration, continue offering that programs.

331
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:58,178
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we have right now for the summer.

332
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:06,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the fall, again, we do have that who's without limit, but we're also looking towards Malden to try to also run a program as well.

333
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's several offerings that people can choose from.

334
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:19,277
[SPEAKER_00]: The last and final goal for FY26 is to help with the hockey rink to get more rentals during outside peak season.

335
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:29,401
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go on the hockey rink schedule, you can see that a lot of times we have the public skating, which is by contract with DCR, but then there's usually this closure time.

336
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:37,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually get a couple of hours, sometimes three o'clock or sometimes five o'clock, depending on the hockey season that we get things up and running.

337
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:38,744
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just look at that,

338
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:48,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of these different recreation facilities that take a lot of energy, no matter what, there's a lot of fixed costs to run those compresses to keep ice.

339
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:53,827
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get people on that ice all the time so that there is revenue coming through.

340
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our goal as well.

341
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,592
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working at different companies such as Catch Corner.

342
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:04,919
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an online app to try to market and to get more rentals in there.

343
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:17,023
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also gonna be reaching out to Method Rock Hockey and with figure skating to just try to add more programs and close that gap so that we're continuously having programs in there from morning to night.

344
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions on the goals or should I go on to the finances?

345
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:25,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

346
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,828
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the finance section,

347
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:42,062
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I do have to mention is when we were creating the budget, the expectation is we did have a program manager on family medical leave.

348
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:53,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, she did come back last week and decided that is best to resign for her family and for her growing family.

349
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:59,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does kind of change a little bit when you are looking at the program manager moving to a step five

350
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:03,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different things that obviously are going to change.

351
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:07,612
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be posting that position as soon as possible.

352
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:19,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to say that's going to be out by next week, but we want to get someone in very quickly so that we do have our program manager started before the summertime.

353
00:52:21,919 --> 00:52:26,841
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that you're going to see is a increase in our part-time employee budget.

354
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:28,302
[SPEAKER_00]: That is to add the 0.5

355
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:31,123
[SPEAKER_00]: office manager position.

356
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:42,671
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a position I've been asking for a few years and one that we have, I know as a city council, I've talked about for a while, but our hope is by having a office manager.

357
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:56,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Truthfully, I was hoping for a full-time office manager, but to have someone in the office to help answer the phone, respond to our general emails, help pay invoices and help with some of the media of

358
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,366
[SPEAKER_00]: adding programs into the calendar, making sure that our schedule is correct and we have the staff.

359
00:53:03,006 --> 00:53:11,575
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all different things that right now as a director I'm doing, as the assistant director is doing, but most importantly our program manager.

360
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:18,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talked about wanting to have originally a certified therapeutic rec specialist, the idea is

361
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:26,203
[SPEAKER_00]: The program manager that unfortunately just recently designed was a therapeutic recreation specialist.

362
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:28,385
[SPEAKER_00]: She had her master's degree in therapeutic rec.

363
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:43,701
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to have an office manager to take some of that work off of her plate and off of our plate so that we can focus on the bigger picture things to allow her more time to be able to run more therapeutic programming.

364
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,661
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still stays the same.

365
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:55,865
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go out to a job opening, we are gonna look for someone that does have their CTRS or have that experience to work on the therapeutic program.

366
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:57,205
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that job description.

367
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:14,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are really hoping that office manager is going to help take some of that work off of our plate so that it allows the program manager to focus truly on executing the programs, not the remedial, answering the phone, responding to general emails and questions.

368
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:19,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.

369
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:25,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing to just point out with the longevity pay, I know it shows that we haven't spent it.

370
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did get paid out that longevity pay.

371
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:32,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was accidentally put to the permanent employees.

372
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:36,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just looking to transfer that money, but that was paid out.

373
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:39,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's everything covered.

374
00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:42,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

375
00:54:42,443 --> 00:54:43,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Kevin.

376
00:54:43,204 --> 00:54:45,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go to councilor Scarpelli then council Lazzaro.

377
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:46,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

378
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:47,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

379
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:54,326
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I'll start off by humbly letting you know a little story today.

380
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:58,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, we reviewed our survey that we sent out to our community.

381
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:07,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And number two on the list was, why don't we have as many programs as Medford?

382
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really mad at you, Kev.

383
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:13,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

384
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:14,579
[SPEAKER_10]: You made me look.

385
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:25,427
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a lot to know we do, but I just wanted to let where we are and where you are as a, you know, a team of three is very different.

386
00:55:25,808 --> 00:55:31,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that I see you working first firsthand you and I work collaboratively.

387
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:39,006
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been very helpful when we have concerns, not just me, but other recreation departments across the state that need help with aquatics.

388
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:47,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your expertise is make sure that all of our programs are safe and under following all the guidelines.

389
00:55:47,649 --> 00:55:48,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that.

390
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,611
[SPEAKER_10]: As of your goals, I appreciate what you're doing.

391
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:59,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the discussions we had both in subcommittee and we've been talking with on a regular basis with parents,

392
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:23,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Increasing the, the programs for children with disabilities I think that's, we're seeing something that's going to be really celebrated I think in a year where we're looking at what you're doing with aquatics and taking over what we're doing for teen center and now you're taking your turn and some of all doing the adaptive recreation program in the summer.

393
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:30,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Maldon doing basketball, then us again, we're taking on the bicycle, I like the bike program.

394
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:35,716
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're seeing, we're taking an initiative as a partnership.

395
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:38,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that that's a lot because of your leadership.

396
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:39,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that.

397
00:56:40,118 --> 00:56:43,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that there are some limitations.

398
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that what we wanted is really another full-time recreation employee.

399
00:56:49,582 --> 00:56:49,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And

400
00:56:51,383 --> 00:57:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We also, we like, I settle on the fact that understanding that we have a part-time office manager, which I think will help with at least filling the gap with increasing your involvement and your team's involvement away from the duties behind a desk and in the field.

401
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that.

402
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:22,263
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that, as you see, the question that I had was really, I know we have 243.

403
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:26,126
[SPEAKER_10]: We've increased it to 280,000.

404
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:29,548
[SPEAKER_10]: And then for part-time, 273.

405
00:57:30,809 --> 00:57:38,294
[SPEAKER_10]: For FY 26, I know a lot that you do is we need the part-time assistance.

406
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:41,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that still enough money in that account to maintain that?

407
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:54,221
[SPEAKER_10]: The program as we're growing with part time staffing Kevin that that's my biggest concern right now is making sure that I know that we're not top heavy but we're not very bottom heavy so.

408
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:57,664
[SPEAKER_00]: No it's a great question and, yes.

409
00:58:00,037 --> 00:58:01,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see that higher.

410
00:58:02,118 --> 00:58:10,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously there are financial constraints and I will say that the mayor did increase putting that officer manager in there.

411
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:14,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So she certainly listened and put that in to help us out.

412
00:58:14,045 --> 00:58:21,129
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we can do with the part-time budget is we do have our recreation revolving account.

413
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:28,734
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if this is not exactly what I'm looking for, there is a revolving account that we can take some of the money from.

414
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:40,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Really what I'm trying to do with the part time employee budget is look at the pond and pool that's where most, I would say almost all of it, besides the.

415
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:47,959
[SPEAKER_00]: The office manager really subsidized so that our pond and pool passes are at a affordable rate.

416
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:58,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately by doing that, it's the lifeguards, it's the park rangers, it's the bathhouse attendants that are in that part-time employee budget.

417
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:05,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this year I'm gonna have to use a little bit of our recreation revolving account for some training with our lifeguards.

418
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:13,019
[SPEAKER_00]: originally hoping for was a little bit more money in that training budget so that we can add another training during mid-season.

419
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we do 16 hours before the season opens up.

420
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:24,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Father's Day weekend, I know, your daughter's one of them, right?

421
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:28,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Father's Day weekend, we do go to the pond and the pool.

422
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:29,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We practice, we train.

423
00:59:30,672 --> 00:59:33,374
[SPEAKER_00]: At times, we've had the fire department here as well, which is great.

424
00:59:35,057 --> 00:59:44,643
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we want to try to do is we do all this training, we talk about the rules, we talk about how the summer is going to go, how it's going to be laid out, we practice the drills.

425
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:57,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding is we really need something in two or three weeks after the season opens up so we can reiterate because we see flaws, we see things that we need to go over again as a reminder.

426
00:59:58,472 --> 01:00:14,860
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're noticing to the guard, you got to get off the chair you got to go talk to people you don't just have to blow the whistle and yell at them right like there's certain things that we see as observation but it's really hard to get that meeting and follow up what our observations are for the first couple of weeks so.

427
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,662
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our original hope a little bit more money to be able to do that, but we'll be okay.

428
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,442
[SPEAKER_10]: But you'll be okay.

429
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:34,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll just say before I go, Mr. President, if I can, I didn't disclose that my daughter did work part time with, with the recreation department, but we don't know if she's coming back.

430
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to make that known.

431
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:37,908
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I will

432
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:48,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I will look, I will share that we, is there a way working with HR to bring in a, use a volunteer-based program?

433
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:58,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know we have a lot of people that, former teachers, former educators, former coaches that are retired that might be a good way to even talk with the assessor.

434
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:02,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there's some sort of an abatement program, a work abatement program for recreation.

435
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:03,979
[SPEAKER_10]: No pressure.

436
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:04,319
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

437
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:09,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry, I'm losing my voice.

438
01:01:09,654 --> 01:01:15,219
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have had a senior abatement program that has been very helpful.

439
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry, you might see, he's actually now a park ranger for us.

440
01:01:19,303 --> 01:01:25,089
[SPEAKER_00]: He's helped us out with even just cleaning the recreation facility, doing a nice deep clean a couple of days a week.

441
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have had that before and it's been helpful.

442
01:01:29,092 --> 01:01:30,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll leave you off with this.

443
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I've asked this both

444
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:34,204
[SPEAKER_10]: many moons ago.

445
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_10]: And you brought it up because it is important because probably the most expensive line that falls with the Parks and Recreation Department will be your electric bill from the rink.

446
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:48,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

447
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:58,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I would recommend through the chair that we make a motion that we ask our environmental director to look into

448
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:15,348
[SPEAKER_10]: looking into making Dillboy, excuse me, Hormel parking lot to a solar parking lot to fund the needs of the electric cost for the rink, which will then eliminate a big number toward our cost to the city.

449
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:17,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's something that's prudent.

450
01:02:17,509 --> 01:02:23,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, you're seeing it across the Commonwealth now that you're seeing a lot of, it doesn't affect parking spots.

451
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:28,215
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks appealing and it,

452
01:02:29,342 --> 01:02:36,824
[SPEAKER_10]: could be a very, very cost effective way to run the compressors.

453
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:55,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can, that'd be something that I know I asked, but that was years ago and we haven't heard anything back, but I think it's time where it's so maybe 15 years ago, it wasn't 10 years ago, it wasn't so prevalent, but now you're looking at a lot of municipalities using solar parking lots as a way to fund

454
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:57,227
[SPEAKER_10]: some huge initiatives.

455
01:02:57,287 --> 01:03:01,250
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will end by thanking you, Kevin, you do a great job.

456
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:05,513
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know I'll be talking to you probably tomorrow.

457
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:06,334
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

458
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:06,814
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

459
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion from Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Singh.

460
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:16,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick follow up on that.

461
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:19,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin, where do we pay the electric right now?

462
01:03:19,704 --> 01:03:21,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is that in the building?

463
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the facilities budget or?

464
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:25,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a it's a revolving account.

465
01:03:26,674 --> 01:03:29,176
[SPEAKER_00]: So rental fees, I'll pay for it.

466
01:03:29,236 --> 01:03:44,367
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Scott probably is right that one of our largest expenses is any hockey rink, the largest expenses, the electricity and the compressor, especially when you look at like the month of October, I think sometimes we're getting somewhere around $20,000 just for that one month.

467
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,308
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a big expense.

468
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,009
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

469
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:47,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

470
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:48,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Hockey is expensive.

471
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:49,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

472
01:03:50,591 --> 01:03:51,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Council is our

473
01:03:52,363 --> 01:03:52,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

474
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:57,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to reiterate something that I think I said last year.

475
01:03:57,948 --> 01:04:00,490
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate your dedication to aquatics.

476
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:08,777
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really important that our residents are learning to swim as young as possible.

477
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:12,200
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a public health issue.

478
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,462
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a lot of waterways in the city.

479
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:17,545
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really appreciate your dedication to that.

480
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:20,947
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wanted to ask this.

481
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:36,035
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not, you know, I happen to just have a conversation about this today, but it's not really the responsibility of the recreation department to provide child care to the city, but it's also kind of the responsibility of maybe a few different departments to do that.

482
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:42,318
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to check about the summer park program.

483
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:45,745
[SPEAKER_18]: in the vacation week programs.

484
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:49,567
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the hours of those programs?

485
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:54,010
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you can sort of elaborate on also the length of time for the summer program.

486
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that there's maybe, and it might not be this one, there's also summer fun.

487
01:04:57,972 --> 01:04:59,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that different from the summer park?

488
01:04:59,873 --> 01:05:02,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I find it is with the school department.

489
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:03,477
[SPEAKER_18]: The school department.

490
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:12,126
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are a few different city run summer programs that are available to Medford residents that are really pretty affordable.

491
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:19,534
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think there's usually like a gap week or maybe two weeks at the end of the school year before they start up.

492
01:05:19,594 --> 01:05:20,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that true?

493
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,515
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true.

494
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:24,096
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we did do this year that's a little bit different.

495
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:28,778
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the summer fun program they are starting the first week of July 4.

496
01:05:29,778 --> 01:05:31,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell my head what date that is.

497
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I want to say or the first.

498
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:37,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're going to start that week a little bit earlier.

499
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:39,562
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both six weeks programs.

500
01:05:39,662 --> 01:05:39,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

501
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:44,124
[SPEAKER_00]: But ours is going to start the week after July 4.

502
01:05:44,164 --> 01:05:45,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So ours is July 7.

503
01:05:45,184 --> 01:05:46,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be started.

504
01:05:46,245 --> 01:05:47,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an extra week in there.

505
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,227
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is a little bit helpful.

506
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:50,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And

507
01:05:51,062 --> 01:06:00,815
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can get away with it a little bit more we are at the Curtis tough school which has made a tremendous difference for us, having an indoor location, kids having a break and have an AC.

508
01:06:01,736 --> 01:06:05,921
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a little bit of advantage of also being able to be outdoors in the park.

509
01:06:06,201 --> 01:06:07,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you're right next to tough start.

510
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:12,628
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing with that is we did also partner with SNL.

511
01:06:14,569 --> 01:06:18,513
[SPEAKER_00]: SNL is also an outside company that also works with the after school programming.

512
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:23,617
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to run a summer camp right up to the start of school.

513
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:24,398
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very last week

514
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:31,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't have a calendar on me so I do apologize for that very last week of August, and the two days before school starts.

515
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,071
[SPEAKER_00]: We are planning on running a camp with them.

516
01:06:35,632 --> 01:06:38,536
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be at Tufts Park so it will be an outdoor camp.

517
01:06:39,016 --> 01:06:42,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to have the school buildings.

518
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:51,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can offer a program out in the park and use the Tufts pool bathhouse as the restroom.

519
01:06:51,285 --> 01:06:51,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, nice.

520
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:53,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Try anything outside the box and kind of keep it going.

521
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:54,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Totally.

522
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:56,668
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of the time you have to do that kind of thing.

523
01:06:56,848 --> 01:06:58,169
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the daytime hours?

524
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,470
[SPEAKER_18]: When do the camps start and when do they finish?

525
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:02,211
[SPEAKER_00]: 830 to 430.

526
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:13,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this year, again, partnership with SNL, we did an extended day option, I believe it was an extra 100 or $150 for that week.

527
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:15,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes all the way till six if you wanted to do that.

528
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:19,886
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get too much enrollment, which I was really surprised as a parent.

529
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:26,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I know myself when I saw we can go all the way to six, this is great if nine to five, eight to four, you have that time.

530
01:07:26,552 --> 01:07:28,093
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get too many people.

531
01:07:28,761 --> 01:07:32,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to hold a little bit longer, see if we get a few more enrollments.

532
01:07:32,902 --> 01:07:43,346
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've already talked with SNL that if their minimum number doesn't reach, we're just going to uncover that, and we're going to have our own staff run that extended day program.

533
01:07:43,366 --> 01:07:45,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So that option is also out there.

534
01:07:46,387 --> 01:07:47,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's great to know.

535
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:54,829
[SPEAKER_18]: It does tend to be, I mean, from my experience, an absolute nightmarish scramble trying to plan for the summer.

536
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,150
[SPEAKER_18]: And sometimes you have to do it.

537
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:12,788
[SPEAKER_18]: depending on when you're trying to get coverage, like you have, sometimes you have to plan in January or like right after Christmas, or there are some camps that are full in December and you are like, well, I don't know what I'm doing in August yet, but now I have to figure it out.

538
01:08:12,908 --> 01:08:14,770
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's very panic inducing.

539
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:18,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad to hear that the vacation week camps are going well.

540
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:19,575
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds awesome.

541
01:08:21,757 --> 01:08:43,176
[SPEAKER_18]: But yes, I think there are a lot of different departments that have to kind of work together to try to help us cobble together childcare options for our families, especially the families that are, you know, on like the more vulnerable end of the spectrum that are in need of childcare sort of for longer spans of time that are more affordable.

542
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:47,259
[SPEAKER_18]: that have meals and all that kind of stuff.

543
01:08:47,299 --> 01:09:00,369
[SPEAKER_18]: So great to hear that there are inside options too for when, you don't have to like close the camp if it's raining and have the kids stay home because that's also like work doesn't cancel when it's raining.

544
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:02,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you for that.

545
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:03,271
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate.

546
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:12,594
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm hearing about that and that the office manager will be starting and maybe in future years, we can get the coverage for a whole full time employee.

547
01:09:13,355 --> 01:09:13,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

548
01:09:13,696 --> 01:09:14,336
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

549
01:09:14,837 --> 01:09:15,137
Thank you.

550
01:09:15,978 --> 01:09:16,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

551
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple quick questions for myself, Kevin.

552
01:09:21,384 --> 01:09:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, and you always do this, but could you just talk a little bit about how your department is funded in general?

553
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:35,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you get personnel money from the city but everything else comes from your program fees and outside funding can you just talk a little bit about that more.

554
01:09:35,455 --> 01:09:35,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

555
01:09:38,135 --> 01:09:43,239
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do look at our budget, the full-time employees, the part-time, well, let me start with the full-time employees.

556
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,542
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the four positions.

557
01:09:47,742 --> 01:09:53,666
[SPEAKER_00]: It's myself as the director, the assistant director, program manager, and facilities coordinator.

558
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:57,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the four full-time management and the general fund.

559
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:08,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Part time employees, what you see there is, as I mentioned, more for the operations of rights pawn and test pool so it gets subsidized.

560
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:09,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did like a little.

561
01:10:11,075 --> 01:10:17,958
[SPEAKER_00]: a little exercise just to see if we wanted to be in a revolving account, what we would have to charge the public.

562
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:22,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first came up with those numbers, I was like, this is ridiculous.

563
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:29,162
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not, they can't afford this much to go to Tufts Pool or to buy a Rice Pond Pass.

564
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:34,364
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say I've had other recreation departments and conversations at conferences

565
01:10:35,204 --> 01:10:39,788
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep asking how Rights Pond and our pool fees are so much cheaper.

566
01:10:39,908 --> 01:10:40,809
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get away with it?

567
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:44,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is because our part-time employees are in there.

568
01:10:44,392 --> 01:10:45,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a subsidization of that.

569
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:51,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, everything else works off a revolving account.

570
01:10:51,637 --> 01:10:55,180
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a part-time instructor to go teach, let's say, our

571
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:58,528
[SPEAKER_00]: sport sampler program on Saturday.

572
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,309
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to pay that instructor.

573
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:06,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the user fees is, that comes in and that is how we're able to fund those part-time employees.

574
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:12,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we have a part-time employee help teach a program or work the front desk, that's where it all comes from.

575
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:19,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really rolls back to even some of the minor things when you look at like our website or our operating system.

576
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:23,153
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's now costing us almost $10,000 when you look at

577
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:25,694
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the facilities.

578
01:11:25,734 --> 01:11:32,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all comes in from the user fees, a certain percentage to help pay for that type of stuff.

579
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:40,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so basically all works out of Revolving Account, whether it's equipment, supplies, part-time employees that teaches our programs.

580
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The Summer Park program is a perfect example.

581
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:51,190
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our counselors, our CIT, those are all paid out of the Revolving Account, but it's the fees that are coming into the Summer Park program that helps support it.

582
01:11:52,370 --> 01:12:00,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And how is the you said the friends has brought in some money, what about that element of it the non fee like the outside funding, what is that, how much is coming in and.

583
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:08,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this year is really the first year we've really been able to actively go out now that we have the 501c status.

584
01:12:08,877 --> 01:12:12,437
[SPEAKER_00]: It is over $5,000 that we've already raised.

585
01:12:12,577 --> 01:12:15,618
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say year to date is closer to $10,000.

586
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,299
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we haven't been established for too long.

587
01:12:21,339 --> 01:12:23,039
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been able to get some grants.

588
01:12:23,059 --> 01:12:24,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the other Tufts University grant.

589
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,405
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the Community Fund Grant with Encore.

590
01:12:30,206 --> 01:12:32,548
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had several in-kind donations.

591
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:36,954
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Dave McGillivray Foundation also gave us a donation.

592
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:43,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a couple of good donations and several in-kind donations for it to help.

593
01:12:44,377 --> 01:12:55,727
[SPEAKER_00]: And really right now, the friends have their main goal and focus is to just raise money so that we can apply that financial aid and really not turn anyone away from our programs.

594
01:12:56,888 --> 01:12:57,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

595
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:03,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other questions for Kevin Bailey and our recreation department?

596
01:13:04,095 --> 01:13:09,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, do we have any questions or comments from members of the public about the recreation department budget?

597
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:13,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none in person or on Zoom, thank you.

598
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:15,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin, can we quickly talk about Hormel?

599
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:18,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing Hormel Stadium or Hormel Commission, 5400 Fiscal 25, 5400 Fiscal 26.

600
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:21,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So no change, but is there anything else you'd like to say about that?

601
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:36,382
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the only thing I would say is the projected right now for this year, we had started the year with only two commissioners.

602
01:13:36,442 --> 01:13:45,126
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we are gonna be under budget this year, even, but again, for the proposed, we do now have a full three panel commission.

603
01:13:45,186 --> 01:13:53,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, even though we might be under budget this year, we need to put in the actual hire now that we have a full staff.

604
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

605
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:56,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions about Hormel Commission

606
01:13:59,943 --> 01:14:01,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, thank you, Kevin.

607
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:02,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

608
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:06,107
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're gonna go to the assessing department.

609
01:14:07,649 --> 01:14:12,792
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we have here assessing... No, good at the end.

610
01:14:12,852 --> 01:14:16,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the assessing department.

611
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:17,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal year 25 budget, $589,783.

612
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:18,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 26 budget, $644,812.

613
01:14:28,349 --> 01:14:38,993
[SPEAKER_02]: fixed cost growth, keeping a part time employee on through the revaluation process some inflationary increases to supplies and services and software.

614
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:44,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a new expensive 57,000 for the state required citywide revaluation.

615
01:14:45,036 --> 01:14:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that we'll go to our chief assessor.

616
01:14:48,538 --> 01:15:02,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And same questions, just give us some commentary on the budget any of the changes that I mentioned your accomplishments in fiscal 25 goals for fiscal 26 and anything that's not in this budget that you think needs to be funded in the future.

617
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:03,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

618
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:09,816
[SPEAKER_14]: So, first for 25 we're just trying to continue on with what we were doing, which was.

619
01:15:10,837 --> 01:15:16,439
[SPEAKER_14]: bring up all the properties, both residential and commercial, to their full and fair cash value as of the lien date.

620
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:26,342
[SPEAKER_14]: As you mentioned, we're in a reval year, so the state is going to certify us at the end of the year, working with our state rep to get that done.

621
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:31,484
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an intensive, time-consuming process, but working through that.

622
01:15:33,365 --> 01:15:40,147
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you said, most of that budget increase, that $57,000, is for that state reval we utilize.

623
01:15:41,032 --> 01:15:52,281
[SPEAKER_14]: vision as our software, and that was a $114,000 reval, which is pretty much in line with what the cities and towns paid on a five-year reval process.

624
01:15:53,342 --> 01:15:59,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And then going forward for those next three or four years between the five-year time frame, it's significantly less.

625
01:15:59,647 --> 01:16:02,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of a one-time hit every five years.

626
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:04,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Beyond that,

627
01:16:06,517 --> 01:16:09,100
[SPEAKER_14]: All the other minor increases were pretty much inflationary.

628
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:13,545
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, yes, we wanted to keep that part-time field inspector on.

629
01:16:13,665 --> 01:16:19,611
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very important that we have someone out in the field rather than rely on vision.

630
01:16:19,952 --> 01:16:26,519
[SPEAKER_14]: One, it's cheaper to actually have our own field inspector versus pay them to go out

631
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:39,689
[SPEAKER_14]: and have their guys do the field inspections bring it back and then they send us back the information we get it in house, we can talk to the people so we feel it's just it's much cleaner data that comes back when we fund our own field inspectors versus farm it out.

632
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:48,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I mentioned, run the numbers and it's not much cheaper but it's it's cheaper and we get better data so it's a win win as far as I see it too.

633
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:56,421
[SPEAKER_14]: continue to maintain having a field inspector out in the fields to keep looking at our properties, mainly for the cyclicals.

634
01:16:56,701 --> 01:17:02,303
[SPEAKER_14]: So what happened in 25 and what was our main one of our main goals that we achieved was to catch up.

635
01:17:02,403 --> 01:17:07,945
[SPEAKER_14]: So every five years, every 10 years, a property has to be looked at.

636
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:10,666
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have roughly 11,000 properties in the city.

637
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:14,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So to stay on track, we have to do about 1100 a year.

638
01:17:16,885 --> 01:17:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: and then sales reviews and building permits get bundled into that.

639
01:17:20,107 --> 01:17:29,513
[SPEAKER_14]: So fell behind in the last two years, we had to do approximately, I think it was right around 5,000 and we have hundreds left.

640
01:17:29,593 --> 01:17:32,195
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll get there and we'll be on track with that.

641
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:44,003
[SPEAKER_14]: So going into 26, again, I'd like to keep going with that field inspector, which we have in the budget and he'd be doing again, the SICA bills, helping with the building permit reviews.

642
01:17:45,102 --> 01:17:48,003
[SPEAKER_14]: and looking at some of the sales that take place.

643
01:17:51,804 --> 01:18:02,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other increase was just the reval mailing.

644
01:18:02,407 --> 01:18:06,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So as part of the reval process, at the end of the year, once we get the value set,

645
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:28,212
[SPEAKER_14]: we have to send out what's called, they call it, I think it's an impact notice if there's a certain percentage that the valuations are going to change, but basically we have to put out all the new values, either on the website or via mailings, or both, whatever the state tells us to do.

646
01:18:28,993 --> 01:18:35,175
[SPEAKER_14]: And that usually happens in October, so that's going to be a budget increase there for the mailings.

647
01:18:36,885 --> 01:18:42,168
[SPEAKER_14]: And beyond that, there really isn't much change from last budget to this budget.

648
01:18:42,528 --> 01:18:44,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything else is pretty in line.

649
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:46,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions on that?

650
01:18:48,131 --> 01:18:50,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, do we have questions for the assessing department?

651
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, I do.

652
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:03,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed there's a reduction in the field assessor roles.

653
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,041
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the impact of that gonna be?

654
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:09,463
[SPEAKER_14]: a reduction in the field assessor?

655
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:11,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like it's going down from... Yes.

656
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had two last year.

657
01:19:14,748 --> 01:19:18,532
[SPEAKER_14]: One was funded through ARPA, just to catch up with that cyclical that we were well behind on.

658
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:21,475
[SPEAKER_14]: So that fell off this year.

659
01:19:23,036 --> 01:19:24,157
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be nice to have two.

660
01:19:24,438 --> 01:19:25,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can get away with one.

661
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:26,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

662
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

663
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's going to be... We won't be able to catch up as much without them.

664
01:19:31,582 --> 01:19:34,103
[SPEAKER_14]: It's always better to have more eyes, but it costs money.

665
01:19:35,324 --> 01:19:40,646
[SPEAKER_14]: So to keep up with the cyclicals, we should be OK.

666
01:19:40,946 --> 01:19:48,069
[SPEAKER_14]: If we stick with that $1,100, that's well within one person's budget and one person's ability on a part-time basis.

667
01:19:49,989 --> 01:19:55,571
[SPEAKER_14]: The new growth stuff as we start to get more stuff built getting built into the city, we might need more eyes may want to revisit that later.

668
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

669
01:19:56,692 --> 01:20:00,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's essential to maximizing our new growth is essential.

670
01:20:00,674 --> 01:20:03,215
[SPEAKER_14]: That's, that's what I spend the majority of my time on.

671
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:04,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

672
01:20:05,035 --> 01:20:05,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

673
01:20:05,556 --> 01:20:08,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain a little bit of a difference between the annual

674
01:20:09,124 --> 01:20:13,287
[SPEAKER_02]: re-evaluations and reassessments of properties and what the statewide re-evaluation is?

675
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:14,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they different?

676
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:16,609
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the state mandate that's different from what we do every year?

677
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:21,792
[SPEAKER_14]: So every year, the goal is the same.

678
01:20:22,152 --> 01:20:26,015
[SPEAKER_14]: It's to bring properties to their full and fair cash value as of the lien date.

679
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:29,137
[SPEAKER_14]: So for this year, it would be January 1 of 2021.

680
01:20:32,637 --> 01:20:35,960
[SPEAKER_14]: 25.

681
01:20:32,677 --> 01:20:35,960
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking at calendar year 24 sales for fiscal year 26.

682
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,941
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it's the same going forward.

683
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:40,924
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be calendar year 25 sales for fiscal year 27.

684
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:46,448
[SPEAKER_14]: So all the state does is they come in and they look at, they take a, it's called a data quality review.

685
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:50,272
[SPEAKER_14]: And they said, are you being, are you assessing fairly across neighborhoods?

686
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:52,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you looking at the sales or the sales in line?

687
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:53,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you over sales?

688
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:59,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So they just basically do a scrub of our data and say, do you have clean data or is your data dirty?

689
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:00,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And does it need to be cleaned up?

690
01:21:01,498 --> 01:21:03,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I'm working with our state rep on right now.

691
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:05,240
[SPEAKER_14]: So far, so good.

692
01:21:05,841 --> 01:21:06,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

693
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:08,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what the state revaluation is.

694
01:21:08,102 --> 01:21:12,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the same, you're doing the same thing every year, but sometimes the state comes in to double check.

695
01:21:13,065 --> 01:21:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Same process this year, right?

696
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:18,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Every five years, there's someone looking over your shoulder, so to speak, to make sure that it's being done right.

697
01:21:18,889 --> 01:21:19,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

698
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,992
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super helpful, because I think might look like

699
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: there's extra reevaluation or, you know, but it's the same thing and it's a double check and make sure you're following the rules and regulations that we have to follow every year and they observe you.

700
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:34,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

701
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:36,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Just additional reporting that year to the state.

702
01:21:36,609 --> 01:21:36,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

703
01:21:38,089 --> 01:21:38,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Last question.

704
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:42,430
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talked about it pretty extensively as a council.

705
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:48,892
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of our key requests in the budget process was that we really want to consider residential exemption.

706
01:21:51,414 --> 01:21:57,876
[SPEAKER_02]: with this budget, with the staffing, if we came in December and we said we're voting a residential exemption, would you be able to handle that?

707
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:01,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Without an increase in the budget, no.

708
01:22:01,176 --> 01:22:05,898
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd need a full-time person that was well-versed in that to start.

709
01:22:07,158 --> 01:22:14,720
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd expect, I think based on the modeling last year and on the paperwork in front of me, we'd expect about 7,000 applications, I think was the modeling.

710
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:24,073
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, to have to be reviewed before July 1, so it would be a big ask of someone, and it would be a full-time job.

711
01:22:24,614 --> 01:22:24,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

712
01:22:25,394 --> 01:22:25,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

713
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:26,354
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

714
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:34,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we definitely want to be able to consider that, so I think it's something we're going to need to talk about more as we move through the budget.

715
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: People have questions now, so I'm going to go to Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli, then Vice President Collins.

716
01:22:40,339 --> 01:22:41,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

717
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:43,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

718
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:49,928
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, I'm quite sure you're correct, but just, you know, running the numbers in my head, 1,100 a year is more than three a day.

719
01:22:50,769 --> 01:22:53,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a part-time person that can assess more than three buildings a day.

720
01:22:54,052 --> 01:23:00,177
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like, maybe I'm not, I'm just curious, like, with the part-time.

721
01:23:00,658 --> 01:23:03,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so he'll do roughly 80, he can do about 80 a week.

722
01:23:06,663 --> 01:23:07,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Eight a week, you said?

723
01:23:07,303 --> 01:23:08,144
[SPEAKER_14]: 80 a week, right?

724
01:23:08,164 --> 01:23:08,404
[SPEAKER_14]: 80 a week.

725
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:11,708
[SPEAKER_11]: That's amazing, okay.

726
01:23:12,148 --> 01:23:16,330
[SPEAKER_14]: We bundle them, so it's not like I send him from one neighborhood all the way to the next.

727
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:17,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try to keep him on the same street.

728
01:23:18,231 --> 01:23:19,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

729
01:23:19,671 --> 01:23:28,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And then thank you, President Perez, for mentioning the, what am I sitting on now?

730
01:23:28,515 --> 01:23:30,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, the residential exemption.

731
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:33,318
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding is that

732
01:23:34,118 --> 01:23:43,163
[SPEAKER_11]: applications wouldn't begin until July, like we would open an application process in July and that you would need people starting some extra help starting in July, right?

733
01:23:43,203 --> 01:23:48,706
[SPEAKER_11]: But the way you phrased it, it sounded like it would be submitted by July.

734
01:23:48,726 --> 01:23:51,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Or can you just talk a little bit more about that process?

735
01:23:51,247 --> 01:23:57,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the residential exemption, my understanding of it is that you need to own the property and occupy the property as of January 1st.

736
01:23:58,696 --> 01:24:02,480
[SPEAKER_14]: to have the exemption apply for the upcoming fiscal year.

737
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:06,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's to start on the July billing.

738
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:13,533
[SPEAKER_14]: So my understanding, I believe, is that the applications need to be reviewed prior to July 1 for that fiscal year.

739
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,325
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if we vote in December, can we vote in December to have it apply to the next?

740
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:20,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to understand.

741
01:24:20,826 --> 01:24:27,528
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems almost like it's become impossible for us to ever do it because we have to have already hired the people before.

742
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:31,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that our deadline for making some sort of decision was really going to be around July.

743
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Jared's saying for the following July.

744
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,112
[SPEAKER_11]: For the following July.

745
01:24:36,452 --> 01:24:43,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we voted in December to implement a residential exemption, that would apply for the tax rate for the fiscal year starting

746
01:24:44,683 --> 01:24:45,664
[SPEAKER_02]: the next July.

747
01:24:45,804 --> 01:24:45,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

748
01:24:45,984 --> 01:24:47,885
[SPEAKER_14]: So say for this December, it would be fiscal 27.

749
01:24:48,185 --> 01:24:48,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

750
01:24:48,845 --> 01:24:49,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

751
01:24:49,225 --> 01:24:50,926
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be July of calendar year 26.

752
01:24:51,946 --> 01:24:56,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why you would need to have that extra on the budget, because those people would have to be hired.

753
01:24:56,769 --> 01:24:58,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're not talking about this July.

754
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:06,013
[SPEAKER_02]: They would need to work from, well, probably even starting a little earlier than that, I'm guessing, to do the prep, but certainly from December through June.

755
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:06,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

756
01:25:07,154 --> 01:25:07,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

757
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:07,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

758
01:25:08,014 --> 01:25:08,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

759
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

760
01:25:09,415 --> 01:25:10,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

761
01:25:11,516 --> 01:25:11,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

762
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:13,797
[SPEAKER_10]: First, Jared, I want to commend you.

763
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:17,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know you came in at a very difficult time as the acting.

764
01:25:18,217 --> 01:25:26,522
[SPEAKER_10]: when I know the city threw an override at you and assessments and reassessments and it must have been chaos.

765
01:25:26,602 --> 01:25:30,244
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know I came by the office a few times and I've witnessed it myself.

766
01:25:30,264 --> 01:25:44,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanna thank you for a lot of the senior citizens that were in dire need of support for the fact that their taxes skyrocketed to the fact that they needed, they were making decisions, whether it was healthcare or

767
01:25:45,712 --> 01:25:47,432
[SPEAKER_10]: they were going to have to pay their taxes.

768
01:25:47,472 --> 01:25:51,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that your team, the one-man team that you have, did an amazing job.

769
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:54,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to make sure that I'm public.

770
01:25:54,554 --> 01:26:02,516
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that your department, as I talked to the previous assessor, was not involved in the override process or the prep of the override process.

771
01:26:02,536 --> 01:26:05,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So that had nothing to do with you.

772
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:09,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tell people that every day that are having issues because I'm still getting phone calls

773
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,999
[SPEAKER_10]: from people that are really struggling with their taxes.

774
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:37,888
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that my questioning is that I know that we're looking at the homeowner exemption, and I think that as I talked to the state assessor, who's been a good friend of mine, an ally in understanding these processes as we go, and he said a lot of cities and towns are seeing the homeowner exemption

775
01:26:39,103 --> 01:26:45,351
[SPEAKER_10]: being enacted he said but what he did say is making sure the infrastructure of the team is in place to make that happen.

776
01:26:46,052 --> 01:26:56,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other piece that he mentioned was that also understanding that when you hear homeowner exemption anybody that thinks they own a home, whether it's worth 500,000 or hundred 1.2 million.

777
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,621
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, oh, great, my taxes are gonna go down.

778
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:02,141
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not true.

779
01:27:02,221 --> 01:27:05,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just, I know that that has to be vetted.

780
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:16,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that people really have to understand that there is a consequence, because I have residents that are saying, George, my tax will go down, we'll finally get home more exemption.

781
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:22,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, well, your home is praised probably around 1.1 to two family.

782
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:25,330
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, yeah, it doesn't equate that way.

783
01:27:25,897 --> 01:27:46,489
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that if you could share a little bit about that just so we know and the other piece is the ramifications to our renters because when you look at big buildings like the building across from Wegmans, you're talking 600 renters and that assessment that homeowner

784
01:27:47,298 --> 01:27:53,421
[SPEAKER_10]: that would affect their rates, which would then increase renters, correct?

785
01:27:53,461 --> 01:27:55,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, help me understand that if I can.

786
01:27:55,222 --> 01:28:05,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that a lot of people are hoping that we are going to ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars to have in place so we can expect this and hire new people, but I know there are some limitations, so.

787
01:28:06,568 --> 01:28:09,230
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a very good summary and pretty accurate.

788
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:13,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So with the residential exemption is what's called a break-even point.

789
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And everyone wants to know what that is.

790
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:21,410
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost impossible to say what the breakeven point is without knowing how many applications we get.

791
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:25,531
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a function of applications because the levy never changes.

792
01:28:25,871 --> 01:28:31,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's last year's levy times 1.025, 2.5%, and that's plus the new growth.

793
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: And that just gets distributed.

794
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,855
[SPEAKER_14]: How it gets distributed is what the residential exemption does.

795
01:28:36,765 --> 01:28:46,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So that breakeven point is what, say the breakeven point, I think last year we modeled it was right around 900, assuming the certain, I think 70% exemption, I believe.

796
01:28:47,228 --> 01:28:49,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't hold me to that, but pretty sure it was right around there.

797
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:53,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone over 900,000, their taxes would increase.

798
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:59,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And then to your point specifically, the bigger, those apartment buildings are considered residential class.

799
01:28:59,771 --> 01:29:03,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have a $70 million apartment building like 61 Locust,

800
01:29:04,841 --> 01:29:07,003
[SPEAKER_14]: their taxes are going to significantly increase.

801
01:29:08,524 --> 01:29:12,987
[SPEAKER_14]: And what that would do to how they pass that along to the renters in their buildings.

802
01:29:15,148 --> 01:29:23,594
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to be cognizant with that so I appreciate the understanding I think that I think even if there's a way to put it on our site, where it's.

803
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:34,358
[SPEAKER_10]: put forth so the average person can understand what the ramifications are, because all they hear is exemption, homeowner, and that's it.

804
01:29:34,879 --> 01:29:37,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that understanding the whole calculation

805
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,852
[SPEAKER_10]: might be helpful if there's a way to do that.

806
01:29:39,912 --> 01:29:42,914
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's a way to do that, that's also important.

807
01:29:42,954 --> 01:29:49,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that one of the biggest things I've said, especially over the override concerns is the lack of new growth.

808
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:56,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I know my fellow councilors have stated that we were top of the state and obviously they don't understand what I was saying.

809
01:29:56,907 --> 01:30:04,534
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I go through the assessor's line and I've talked to the building department, some members of the building department, we're seeing that they're really,

810
01:30:05,315 --> 01:30:08,439
[SPEAKER_10]: other than two jobs that are in process right now.

811
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:14,665
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the biggest factors, we haven't had shovel in the ground and big jobs in many, many years.

812
01:30:15,106 --> 01:30:25,678
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's hurting our base for an increase in what we're seeing for accruing fees for permitting,

813
01:30:26,118 --> 01:30:36,187
[SPEAKER_10]: which is a lot of money that could help our tax base also increasing more of a tax base from housing.

814
01:30:36,287 --> 01:30:42,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't see anything here, but what did we do last year?

815
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:52,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we have many jobs or many, you know, the assessor's office see much of an increase or anything to support the community for

816
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,191
[SPEAKER_10]: big jobs with shovels in the ground that would help with that.

817
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:05,044
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we haven't had a significant, you know, new growth is new construction art, and it can be exempt to taxable.

818
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:11,327
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a different topic that we could get into if you'd like, but it'd be small additions to homes would be small new growth.

819
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:24,154
[SPEAKER_14]: A big new apartment building like the ones that are across from Wegmans, that would be considered big new with the projects that are coming online, the apartment buildings that are to be built, that's going to be significant.

820
01:31:25,215 --> 01:31:41,864
[SPEAKER_14]: The other piece of that that also helps the residential side is when you get new growth in the commercial sector, or even in the residential with the big, it will drop the overall tax rate because of the denominator being bigger and how it divides into the levy.

821
01:31:42,884 --> 01:31:49,588
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be helpful for everyone who owns a home when new growth occurs.

822
01:31:49,988 --> 01:31:51,309
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know you don't have a crystal ball,

823
01:31:52,455 --> 01:31:57,378
[SPEAKER_10]: with Fells Way and Mystic Valley Parkway, two big sites.

824
01:31:58,478 --> 01:32:05,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Next year, hopefully we'll be talking and seeing something different that could assist us with that tax base.

825
01:32:06,423 --> 01:32:10,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, big projects are instrumental to having strong growth.

826
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:12,246
[SPEAKER_14]: We really need them.

827
01:32:12,766 --> 01:32:14,587
[SPEAKER_10]: We love election season, don't we?

828
01:32:14,967 --> 01:32:16,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate it, Jared.

829
01:32:16,548 --> 01:32:16,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

830
01:32:17,028 --> 01:32:19,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we've taken enough of your time, so thank you.

831
01:32:21,433 --> 01:32:27,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, I just wanted to talk a little bit more about two of the topics so can start with the new growth.

832
01:32:30,299 --> 01:32:40,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, regardless of the type of new growth, you know, new growth has been significantly higher the past couple years than it was in the past, you know, could you go over the new growth numbers over the last few years.

833
01:32:41,925 --> 01:32:53,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so the new growth numbers for the last two years, myself and the previous chief assessor, we did a very deep dive and scrub on old building permits.

834
01:32:53,793 --> 01:32:56,715
[SPEAKER_14]: We caught a lot of things that just, they were done already.

835
01:32:57,115 --> 01:33:00,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say we're pretty current with what we have.

836
01:33:00,697 --> 01:33:03,299
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not much else to grab that hadn't been already grabbed.

837
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:09,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was kind of a lag effect where maybe that new growth should have happened in the prior years and it didn't.

838
01:33:11,072 --> 01:33:25,751
[SPEAKER_14]: So this year we're struggling because there is no new shovels in the grounds to catch and going over past building permits was a project we took on in calendar year 24 and calendar year 23.

839
01:33:28,637 --> 01:33:33,218
[SPEAKER_14]: We scrubbed through that and there's nothing else really in there significant to find.

840
01:33:33,919 --> 01:33:39,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So those 2.2, 2.3 million a year numbers were mostly from your catch-up project?

841
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:42,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I would say that was a pull forward from previous years.

842
01:33:42,261 --> 01:33:44,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any expectations on this year?

843
01:33:45,869 --> 01:33:50,851
[SPEAKER_14]: For this year, there is not gonna be a significant project that we can grab.

844
01:33:50,891 --> 01:34:03,574
[SPEAKER_14]: The Herb Chambers, I believe, is the biggest one, that old office building, or not old, but the office building that's being converted into a showroom, and then they're building a substantial auto bay next to it.

845
01:34:03,694 --> 01:34:07,596
[SPEAKER_14]: That's our biggest project cranes in the sky right now.

846
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:13,717
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll capture a piece of that through June 30th, which is the date we have to value new growth by.

847
01:34:14,698 --> 01:34:15,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Beyond that,

848
01:34:16,034 --> 01:34:21,736
[SPEAKER_14]: that is, there is no other big project that I'm aware of that will have shovels in the ground as of June 30th.

849
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:29,538
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you expect from like all this aggregation of the smaller things, the nine unit building on in West Bedford Square, stuff like that?

850
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:32,479
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of new growth for this year?

851
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:32,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

852
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tough to say.

853
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,701
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends on how far they were along as of June 30th.

854
01:34:39,121 --> 01:34:41,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, get this here.

855
01:34:42,595 --> 01:34:49,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So estimate-wise, condo conversions, we typically have a strong number from that.

856
01:34:49,361 --> 01:34:52,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, a lot of those come from two families that get renovated.

857
01:34:53,864 --> 01:35:02,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we switched to June 30, capturing new growth, the previous chief assessor, Chapter 653, put that in play.

858
01:35:02,892 --> 01:35:04,073
[SPEAKER_14]: So it now pulls forward the

859
01:35:04,733 --> 01:35:10,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, the condo conversions where we are now capturing the two family renovations prior to the conversions.

860
01:35:11,396 --> 01:35:12,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just get a piece of that.

861
01:35:12,817 --> 01:35:16,378
[SPEAKER_14]: So the condos are now starting to come in lower than they would have been.

862
01:35:16,398 --> 01:35:18,779
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting about a half year versus a full year and getting more.

863
01:35:18,799 --> 01:35:19,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come in the next year.

864
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

865
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:26,983
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, with that 653, it just was a pull forward that you typically get because of the one-one date prior to that.

866
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:30,705
[SPEAKER_14]: But all that said, in short, we're looking at about

867
01:35:32,803 --> 01:35:34,884
[SPEAKER_14]: 2.1, 2.2 roughly is my estimate.

868
01:35:36,325 --> 01:35:42,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's assuming that we get another roughly 150,000 between now and the end of June.

869
01:35:42,568 --> 01:35:53,875
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go out in June and do a last final review of the, I think we have about 200 properties that are under construction from small additions to the back of the house all the way to the Herb Chambers with their $20 million permit.

870
01:35:54,155 --> 01:35:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna be in that 2 million range still or so is the estimate?

871
01:35:58,173 --> 01:36:00,934
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my best estimate, between two and 2.2.

872
01:36:01,814 --> 01:36:06,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we see that dropping in the next few years because of what you're talking about?

873
01:36:06,734 --> 01:36:10,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I see it increasing with the big properties coming online.

874
01:36:13,016 --> 01:36:16,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And that two million number is historically very high for Medford over the last 10 years.

875
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:26,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the last 10 years, I look back, it seems to be since I've been here and with the previous chief, we've done a pretty good job at getting that number up.

876
01:36:28,398 --> 01:36:32,540
[SPEAKER_02]: On the, obviously, Mourning Growth is great, and I hope we get more.

877
01:36:34,621 --> 01:36:42,324
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Davis Company's project on the Fells Way, I mean, that obviously they have, they've done demolition, there's construction going on.

878
01:36:42,364 --> 01:36:44,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Mystic Valley hasn't started yet.

879
01:36:44,164 --> 01:36:46,585
[SPEAKER_14]: The 4000 Mystic Valley?

880
01:36:46,605 --> 01:36:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

881
01:36:47,005 --> 01:36:47,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, the old Gold's Gym.

882
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:52,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you expect, like, when would we get the full realization?

883
01:36:52,147 --> 01:36:53,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a year or two out?

884
01:36:54,776 --> 01:37:02,739
[SPEAKER_14]: The, it will come in chunks so unless they do the full build out in a year which is unlikely, say, one you say it's a two year project.

885
01:37:03,379 --> 01:37:06,700
[SPEAKER_14]: June 30 of next year, maybe we get 50% of the full value.

886
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:12,882
[SPEAKER_02]: The next June 30 would get the other 50%, and that's even if it's occupied or not it's just the construction.

887
01:37:13,832 --> 01:37:15,673
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the construction, that's the cost model.

888
01:37:15,693 --> 01:37:19,915
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we talk with the owners, there's the income model too.

889
01:37:19,975 --> 01:37:25,977
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a function of what they have in place and might give a one year discount for lease up, something like that.

890
01:37:26,037 --> 01:37:28,518
[SPEAKER_14]: But yes, most of it's based on the cost model.

891
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:29,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

892
01:37:29,539 --> 01:37:40,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the residential exemption, basically my understanding of the way it works is you assume 7,000 homes are gonna apply for the exemption, let's say it's a 30% exemption.

893
01:37:40,724 --> 01:37:43,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the city has to do is say, okay,

894
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna lose that much, you know, if we, which we won't, right?

895
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:52,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the levy doesn't come down, but that would reduce the levy by this much.

896
01:37:53,692 --> 01:37:55,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to have the rate be higher.

897
01:37:56,393 --> 01:38:06,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And because there's a higher rate and because the exemption amount is fixed, it applies kind of a progressive curve to what is currently a flat residential rate.

898
01:38:06,956 --> 01:38:08,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that essentially correct?

899
01:38:08,596 --> 01:38:10,016
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

900
01:38:10,737 --> 01:38:12,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're under the breakeven,

901
01:38:13,438 --> 01:38:21,881
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're very low, if you're in a $300,000 home, I don't know that there's many left with that valuation here in Medford, you would be receiving the most benefit.

902
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:36,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're in a very, very high value residential property, even if you're one of many tenants of multi-hundred million dollar valued property, that's where the higher rate is gonna impact the most in a dollar amount.

903
01:38:38,422 --> 01:38:41,485
[SPEAKER_14]: want to say the owners of those big apartment buildings, they'll get hit the most.

904
01:38:41,585 --> 01:38:47,669
[SPEAKER_14]: And then your $1.5 to $2 million single families, and the condos, the smaller condos.

905
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:54,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd say I don't know if we have any at 350, 400 anymore, but they'd get the biggest break.

906
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,077
[SPEAKER_14]: So like you said, you're accurate with that curve.

907
01:38:57,477 --> 01:39:01,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really benefits the small, small single families condos.

908
01:39:02,662 --> 01:39:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you have a three family that's of low value and you divided it across three units, something like that, but yeah, I don't, it's possible that three family would be under the break even, but be unlikely, very unlikely.

909
01:39:14,792 --> 01:39:15,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

910
01:39:15,813 --> 01:39:16,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

911
01:39:17,835 --> 01:39:18,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

912
01:39:18,195 --> 01:39:18,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my questions.

913
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:19,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice president Collins.

914
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:23,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

915
01:39:23,398 --> 01:39:24,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the presentation.

916
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:25,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for being here.

917
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:30,884
[SPEAKER_20]: And for helming the assessing department, while you're around, we're very glad to have you on board.

918
01:39:30,904 --> 01:39:33,666
[SPEAKER_20]: Your presentation was very thorough.

919
01:39:33,686 --> 01:39:36,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you as well for the added context around new growth.

920
01:39:36,508 --> 01:39:44,314
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have any specific questions on your presentation just while we have you, I wanted to add my voice.

921
01:39:44,954 --> 01:39:53,344
[SPEAKER_20]: to the conversation around, um, taking this opportunity in this budget, um, to future proof for future assessing needs.

922
01:39:53,364 --> 01:40:03,876
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had a lot of conversations, not just this term, but in previous terms before you were before you were here about wanting to gear up to at least have that conversation about a residential and exemption and, um,

923
01:40:05,297 --> 01:40:08,760
[SPEAKER_20]: I remain of two minds on it for the reasons that were just discussed.

924
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:15,425
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that this is one of those municipal tools that sounds simple, but isn't.

925
01:40:15,485 --> 01:40:21,429
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you just described very well, some residents will see an immediate benefit.

926
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:23,311
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of others will not.

927
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:32,678
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we have to have really, really good comprehension about that in the community before we try to make a determination about if this is something that the people of Medford want or not.

928
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,761
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there's a lot of really great reasons to consider it.

929
01:40:36,801 --> 01:40:43,307
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that we also do have to pay attention to those homeowners who will not benefit and renters whose costs may go up.

930
01:40:43,367 --> 01:40:46,930
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a lot of conflicting data about that out there.

931
01:40:48,652 --> 01:40:51,955
[SPEAKER_20]: But this isn't a conversation tonight about should we do a residential exemption or not.

932
01:40:51,995 --> 01:40:57,680
[SPEAKER_20]: It's about when should we bring on the capacity to be able to do one if we decide that we want to do one.

933
01:40:58,541 --> 01:41:04,586
[SPEAKER_20]: and the resources to investigate what that would look like in our community so I really do think that, you know, I am.

934
01:41:05,507 --> 01:41:16,817
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not a criticism but just looking at the spreadsheets I'm concerned to see even a small reduction in force in the assessing department, because I know the great work that we're able to do with more staff in the assessing department over the past couple of years.

935
01:41:17,858 --> 01:41:21,403
[SPEAKER_20]: getting things up to speed, reviewing old records, cleaning up the data, as you said.

936
01:41:21,423 --> 01:41:34,100
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's a benefit to everybody and we also know that it's just easier for residents to get quick answers to their questions and to get help with exemptions when your department has, you know, the staffing that it really deserves.

937
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:42,124
[SPEAKER_20]: So I hope that that's something we can contend hope that's something that the administration is willing to take a second look at as we proceed through this budget process.

938
01:41:43,725 --> 01:41:53,649
[SPEAKER_20]: Not just because I think it's a benefit to the community to have more people on hand in the assessing department in the short term but if our conversations over the rest of this year, lead us to wanting to.

939
01:41:55,150 --> 01:42:01,072
[SPEAKER_20]: pursue a residential exemption we're going to need more people on that for starting in this fiscal year.

940
01:42:02,632 --> 01:42:16,377
[SPEAKER_20]: And as other counselors mentioned earlier, it's not to say we definitely want to do this I'm definitely gonna vote in favor but it would be foolish, I think, to not even have the option of pursuing it because we don't have the people to implement it in the assessing department so I just want to put that out there at this point.

941
01:42:20,752 --> 01:42:22,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do think it's also relevant.

942
01:42:22,752 --> 01:42:24,293
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to hear the numbers about the new growth.

943
01:42:24,353 --> 01:42:42,936
[SPEAKER_20]: It is actually gratifying to me to hear that our projected new growth number for this year is kind of in the ballpark of previous years, given that previous years weren't so much of a snapshot of new growth that happened exclusively within that calendar year, it sounds like, but cleaning up undocumented new growth from prior years.

944
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,817
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you're aware, we're in the midst of

945
01:42:48,058 --> 01:42:51,281
[SPEAKER_20]: a very large scale rezoning effort.

946
01:42:51,301 --> 01:43:00,029
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that in the coming few years, coming many years, we can expect to see a more consistent application of larger new growth eligible projects.

947
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:12,541
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know that you've been doing a lot with a small and scrappy team, but I think that as time goes forward, we really need to be thinking about how to right size this department so that we're capturing everything we need to be in real time.

948
01:43:13,321 --> 01:43:16,923
[SPEAKER_20]: and not creating backlog just because you could use more people in the office.

949
01:43:17,683 --> 01:43:21,404
[SPEAKER_20]: So all that to say, thank you for your presentation and for your work.

950
01:43:21,565 --> 01:43:32,729
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks great, but I do hope that the administration is able to consider avoiding a reduction in the assessor's department this year.

951
01:43:32,809 --> 01:43:35,590
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that current level of staffing is something that we should be maintaining.

952
01:43:35,991 --> 01:43:36,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

953
01:43:38,952 --> 01:43:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

954
01:43:39,372 --> 01:43:41,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any more questions for assessing?

955
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:44,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to add, Jerry?

956
01:43:46,315 --> 01:43:46,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else.

957
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:47,316
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

958
01:43:47,336 --> 01:43:47,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

959
01:43:48,077 --> 01:43:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

960
01:43:48,617 --> 01:43:49,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

961
01:43:49,218 --> 01:43:49,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

962
01:43:52,261 --> 01:43:53,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the building department.

963
01:43:53,643 --> 01:43:56,165
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the building commissioner with us, Scott Vandewall.

964
01:43:57,378 --> 01:44:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Building Department Fiscal 25 Budget $1,031,543.

965
01:44:03,002 --> 01:44:08,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 26 Proposed $1,057,806 for an increase of $26,263.

966
01:44:10,528 --> 01:44:21,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of this in the fixed cost growth, phone contracts, postage spending, clerical contracting, COLA increases, and the copier lease, and two new citizen-served licenses under new expenses.

967
01:44:22,457 --> 01:44:28,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And my three questions for you are the same as everyone else just if there's anything else you'd like to add around the change to your budget.

968
01:44:29,144 --> 01:44:37,452
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your accomplishments this year goals for next year, and what is something that you'd like to see funded in the future that wasn't funded in this budget.

969
01:44:38,693 --> 01:44:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

970
01:44:39,073 --> 01:44:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

971
01:44:39,634 --> 01:44:45,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, we've added to citizen service licenses one for the clerk's office and one for the engineer's office.

972
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to go online with permits for the clerk's office himself.

973
01:44:52,839 --> 01:44:54,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Most everything else is, yeah, fixed costs.

974
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We're primarily a labor department.

975
01:44:56,321 --> 01:44:58,923
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do much in capital improvement, things like that.

976
01:44:59,804 --> 01:45:07,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, the postage machine is in there and postage costs are going up and the use of the postage machine has increased over the years.

977
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are probably the two biggest changes.

978
01:45:10,893 --> 01:45:11,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a busy year.

979
01:45:11,713 --> 01:45:15,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here now just slightly over a year, a year and three months.

980
01:45:16,357 --> 01:45:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've gone through a lot of

981
01:45:18,277 --> 01:45:19,699
[SPEAKER_04]: changes down there.

982
01:45:21,681 --> 01:45:40,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Primarily in some of our permitting stuff developing our citizens are programmed to include more departments on it, health permits are now going online for permits are online, outdoor dining licenses and some of the processes around that, as well as an ongoing effort to sort of streamline the system.

983
01:45:41,069 --> 01:45:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: get data out of it that we need to use both for customers and for ourselves.

984
01:45:45,358 --> 01:45:48,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a great increase in public records requests.

985
01:45:49,408 --> 01:45:56,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when I started at the beginning of the year, we'd have one every couple of weeks request to please close out on the old building permits, because I'm going to sell my house.

986
01:45:57,373 --> 01:45:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're getting one to two a day.

987
01:45:58,834 --> 01:46:11,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had to develop a process for going through that, including reports that we typically email back to them, saying what they wanted to say is closed, even though we never made, we don't have a strong record.

988
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:14,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these permits are going back to 1999, they're in the systems.

989
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:18,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's here that remembers what was done so we try to close that out for people.

990
01:46:19,529 --> 01:46:34,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we get appraisers we get attorneys we get homeowners both after and before and sometimes they're calling from the closing gone I need this record because some attorneys asked for it so that's pushed some of the growth and process on us to deal with.

991
01:46:36,985 --> 01:46:48,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We also continue, and it's been an ongoing thing, developing some of our overtime protocols with the fire department, and that is a series of conversations and documentation.

992
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:50,792
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of an ongoing process.

993
01:46:50,812 --> 01:46:58,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to work to get a handle on to sort of control some of our overtime costs, and I think that's increasingly being successful.

994
01:47:00,536 --> 01:47:03,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some new energy code changes coming up this year.

995
01:47:05,298 --> 01:47:08,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them focused around the ADUs that are now out there.

996
01:47:09,579 --> 01:47:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a new building code coming online fully in July 1st.

997
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:20,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sort of split between the old and the new, but as of July 1st, it'll be a brand new building code.

998
01:47:20,383 --> 01:47:23,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been the first time since I think 2017.

999
01:47:24,484 --> 01:47:25,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 2021 code.

1000
01:47:25,724 --> 01:47:28,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get a sense of how fast the state really moves on these things.

1001
01:47:33,273 --> 01:47:41,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been using to help us get through all this, some senior work offs that have really been successful for us.

1002
01:47:41,259 --> 01:47:42,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the first time we've used them.

1003
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They do more than answer the phones.

1004
01:47:45,602 --> 01:47:48,044
[SPEAKER_04]: They get deeply into a lot of the processing.

1005
01:47:48,124 --> 01:47:52,727
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them has been very helpful in going through all those public records requests we have.

1006
01:47:52,747 --> 01:47:55,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And I value her services very much in addition to,

1007
01:47:57,015 --> 01:48:04,298
[SPEAKER_04]: The administrative staff we have, one of them was out for probably six months on sick leave due to some issues.

1008
01:48:04,338 --> 01:48:09,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been bouncing around a little bit with the staff and trying to stay on top of that issue.

1009
01:48:12,521 --> 01:48:23,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to let you know, we're probably going to be on target for somewhere between 4,000 and 4,500 permits through our system this year, which is about the same level we've been the last few years.

1010
01:48:23,184 --> 01:48:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of holding right in there.

1011
01:48:26,195 --> 01:48:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the biggest change is we got several very large projects coming on.

1012
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:38,401
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 970 Felsway, which is a six-story 40B project full of apartments.

1013
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:40,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you've seen the building coming down over there.

1014
01:48:40,842 --> 01:48:46,865
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, the last wall came down, but they had to shut power off on the street because it was so close to the power lines.

1015
01:48:46,885 --> 01:48:50,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to take it down until they coordinated with National Grid.

1016
01:48:50,828 --> 01:48:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1017
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect we've had early conversations about the permitting process.

1018
01:48:56,912 --> 01:49:00,535
[SPEAKER_04]: They've projected sometime in June to be applying for the permits.

1019
01:49:01,015 --> 01:49:03,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We certainly have Tufts dorm coming online.

1020
01:49:03,397 --> 01:49:10,382
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been exchanging some paperwork during the time in the closing of the financing part of the process and doing some initial work.

1021
01:49:10,842 --> 01:49:16,526
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't expect them to start doing much more than moving dirt and fences around for at least another couple of weeks.

1022
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:22,852
[SPEAKER_04]: A waffling court is supposed to undergo a major development, tear it down and reconstruct.

1023
01:49:24,614 --> 01:49:32,521
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the homes at 541 Winthrop, which is known as Mary Kenny Way now.

1024
01:49:32,801 --> 01:49:35,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The first of those has started to get occupancy permits.

1025
01:49:35,203 --> 01:49:38,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're starting to get, come on live.

1026
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:42,350
[SPEAKER_04]: We started to do site clearing for the bridal path.

1027
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: project up at the top of the Hill of Franklin the old horse farm.

1028
01:49:47,015 --> 01:50:01,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a several things there, certainly her chambers is busy so from our perspective there's a lot going on all these large projects taken unusually large amount of inspections because the size of we do them in small chunks rather than one large size.

1029
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:05,493
[SPEAKER_04]: So we expect to be very busy this year, doing a lot of inspections.

1030
01:50:07,902 --> 01:50:13,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also continued to work with the planning department on zoning changes.

1031
01:50:13,366 --> 01:50:22,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the lead on it but I pay attention I'm probably less more focused on language changes and definition changes and some of the things that

1032
01:50:23,213 --> 01:50:26,114
[SPEAKER_04]: know, the down in the weeds stuff that we deal with on a daily basis.

1033
01:50:26,174 --> 01:50:29,375
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working through that and making recommendations.

1034
01:50:29,455 --> 01:50:36,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of leave the big colored maps to the planning department and I focus more on what we deal with at that desk every day.

1035
01:50:38,097 --> 01:50:44,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly one of the things that's been popping across our desk is ADUs with the new state law and protected ADUs.

1036
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,360
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have a couple

1037
01:50:47,468 --> 01:50:55,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a couple applied for, but I would say hundreds of people probably asked about it, they all want to understand what is, I think, the most important thing to understand is that.

1038
01:50:57,377 --> 01:51:00,638
[SPEAKER_04]: The new ADU law is zoning protection.

1039
01:51:00,698 --> 01:51:03,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the building code still applies to the fullest extent.

1040
01:51:03,659 --> 01:51:07,960
[SPEAKER_04]: We treat it as a single family home, essentially, that you're adding to your property.

1041
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,821
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't necessarily recognize ADU as a term in the code.

1042
01:51:10,881 --> 01:51:15,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So that creates some challenges to work around, fire code, energy code, things like that.

1043
01:51:15,882 --> 01:51:25,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working through all of that, working towards continuing to try to use technology and then do our inspections, you know, pushing the use of tablets in the field.

1044
01:51:27,221 --> 01:51:28,282
[SPEAKER_04]: big plans for us.

1045
01:51:31,323 --> 01:51:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a busy year, we're doing an awful lot of work.

1046
01:51:35,205 --> 01:51:47,111
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have one goal down the road, it would be to find a way to digitize the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of files we have in the basement, because we go down that basement, almost every day pulling an old dusty file out and

1047
01:51:47,512 --> 01:51:54,537
[SPEAKER_04]: provide in a record for somebody and ultimately my dream would be to have those digitized and available on some sort of digital base.

1048
01:51:55,398 --> 01:52:06,206
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always encouraging people who are looking for information to log on to the system, which is, you've seen some of the icons on the website, they can do public record searches on their own.

1049
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:10,068
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're sort of limited to what we've had in the last five years.

1050
01:52:10,168 --> 01:52:16,569
[SPEAKER_04]: All the old little cards and files down there that gather dust or stuff, we go digging for the old fashioned way.

1051
01:52:16,649 --> 01:52:23,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully down the road, we'll be able to get those online, join more of the digital age as we come.

1052
01:52:24,931 --> 01:52:27,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much my report at this point.

1053
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:28,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any questions?

1054
01:52:29,872 --> 01:52:32,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, do we have any questions for our building commissioner?

1055
01:52:36,443 --> 01:52:37,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Board is not lighting up.

1056
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of questions for you.

1057
01:52:42,828 --> 01:52:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working on this new, well, we have a request out to departments around the new fee schedule.

1058
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:53,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been able to take a look at your fees and fines and make recommendations?

1059
01:52:53,996 --> 01:52:56,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did some time ago.

1060
01:52:56,278 --> 01:52:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably in the mid range of most of them.

1061
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few communities substantially higher.

1062
01:53:02,062 --> 01:53:06,704
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not down in the bottom range either, although we probably tend to trend towards that.

1063
01:53:06,744 --> 01:53:16,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We're certainly overdue to consider looking at that, but I did make a series of recommendations a time ago, and we look forward to seeing what comes out with that.

1064
01:53:16,586 --> 01:53:16,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1065
01:53:16,986 --> 01:53:17,186
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1066
01:53:17,226 --> 01:53:18,867
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take those recommendations.

1067
01:53:19,067 --> 01:53:27,529
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ask them, ask the chief of staff for them, and we'll see if we can work on updating some of those fee amounts to get us more into a reasonable range.

1068
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:29,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Collins, do you have a follow up on that?

1069
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:34,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I'll just go to you and then I'll come back to my questions.

1070
01:53:40,187 --> 01:53:42,969
[SPEAKER_20]: well, take a break from the specific questions, which I don't have.

1071
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:51,136
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say thank you for the presentation, and we have a lot of undersung hard workers in City Hall.

1072
01:53:51,156 --> 01:53:52,497
[SPEAKER_20]: You're certainly among them.

1073
01:53:52,517 --> 01:54:03,465
[SPEAKER_20]: I know especially with, I've been working in concert on the zoning updates, and I see just a fraction of the many, many questions that you've been getting about just the protected ADUs updates alone.

1074
01:54:05,086 --> 01:54:05,647
[SPEAKER_20]: Your department is

1075
01:54:07,338 --> 01:54:09,619
[SPEAKER_20]: quite resourceful in handling a lot of incoming all the time, so.

1076
01:54:09,879 --> 01:54:10,619
[SPEAKER_20]: Try to stay busy.

1077
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:15,661
[SPEAKER_20]: And we know that you do, so thank you for your service and for the presentation.

1078
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of busy, permit and inspection times.

1079
01:54:22,523 --> 01:54:23,883
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do on that?

1080
01:54:24,003 --> 01:54:33,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we, you know, how long does it take on average to get an inspector out to a site after they've, you know, how does our time put compared to other communities?

1081
01:54:33,746 --> 01:54:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we longer, shorter?

1082
01:54:36,535 --> 01:54:37,496
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think we do fine.

1083
01:54:37,757 --> 01:54:42,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, generally, if you call the day before, you can get an inspection.

1084
01:54:42,884 --> 01:54:46,008
[SPEAKER_04]: In rare occasions, we've addressed emergencies during the day.

1085
01:54:46,068 --> 01:54:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We're maintaining, you know, we're keeping up with the flow generally pretty well.

1086
01:54:50,875 --> 01:54:53,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know our plumbing electrical inspectors are

1087
01:54:54,047 --> 01:54:54,767
[SPEAKER_04]: very busy.

1088
01:54:55,007 --> 01:54:57,148
[SPEAKER_04]: They certainly have quite a big load.

1089
01:54:57,628 --> 01:55:07,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The building inspectors kind of have a different process and do a lot more drawing review and permit review on the side and are still able to maintain a pretty good consistent schedule.

1090
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:14,413
[SPEAKER_02]: How long on average would you say from a filing of a permit to a determination you know how long does that take?

1091
01:55:15,133 --> 01:55:16,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Well the magic answer is

1092
01:55:17,571 --> 01:55:19,432
[SPEAKER_04]: one to two weeks, depending.

1093
01:55:19,873 --> 01:55:24,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand that we've split the permits up into minor permits and major permits.

1094
01:55:24,696 --> 01:55:26,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Minor are sort of one-shot deals.

1095
01:55:26,517 --> 01:55:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: They're roofing, they're doors, they're windows.

1096
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:30,620
[SPEAKER_04]: They go through sort of a simple review schedule.

1097
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: The major permits additions and new buildings and stuff like that go through a more extensive review where they're forwarded to all departments.

1098
01:55:39,526 --> 01:55:41,407
[SPEAKER_04]: In any department that may have an issue,

1099
01:55:42,932 --> 01:55:47,674
[SPEAKER_04]: might pop their head up and say, hey, I need to put a hold on this and that can drag it out.

1100
01:55:49,055 --> 01:55:52,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We check for taxes and we check for open stuff from other departments.

1101
01:55:52,856 --> 01:55:55,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So generally not too bad a week or two if it's simple.

1102
01:55:56,498 --> 01:56:01,940
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's complex and you haven't done your homework ahead of time and gotten everything straightened around, it can drag on a little bit.

1103
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst case scenario, we find you have to go to the zoning board and that easily can add two to three months to the project to go there and come back.

1104
01:56:10,712 --> 01:56:13,793
[SPEAKER_04]: but generally it's a good, decent time turnaround, reasonable time.

1105
01:56:13,813 --> 01:56:16,554
[SPEAKER_04]: We're required by building code to respond within 30 days.

1106
01:56:16,614 --> 01:56:21,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can generally meet that unless there's a concern floating out there that we uncover.

1107
01:56:22,557 --> 01:56:26,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that done electronically or on paper at this point?

1108
01:56:26,959 --> 01:56:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's pretty much electronically.

1109
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:32,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We take everything by electronic, we submit it and pass it around.

1110
01:56:32,581 --> 01:56:34,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really trying to avoid paper.

1111
01:56:36,042 --> 01:56:37,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say most of, you know,

1112
01:56:38,558 --> 01:56:44,983
[SPEAKER_04]: not to pick on generations, the younger generations prefer that way, the older will come in and we'll help them how to do it online.

1113
01:56:45,524 --> 01:56:55,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say we haven't got plenty of the older generation who, you know, they learn how to shop on Amazon pretty quickly and they can pick it up pretty quickly, but it's pretty much 100% online at this point in time.

1114
01:57:00,031 --> 01:57:00,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1115
01:57:00,711 --> 01:57:14,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, in talking to you know some contractors in the city they're very, they do actually note that if their paperwork is in line, Medford's actually quite a good city to do business in.

1116
01:57:15,523 --> 01:57:19,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to your department, to your staff, to you for that.

1117
01:57:19,746 --> 01:57:23,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that leads, that connects really well to what you just said.

1118
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:33,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a question for you about, you noted that there's some applications where maybe they haven't really done their homework, they have to go to the ZBA first.

1119
01:57:35,137 --> 01:57:36,818
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, protracts the process.

1120
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:43,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you notice any patterns in terms of what kinds of things, like mistakes are being made?

1121
01:57:43,162 --> 01:57:47,385
[SPEAKER_03]: What kinds of variances that people are seeking?

1122
01:57:47,445 --> 01:57:50,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is there anything in that, you know,

1123
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:53,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we go through a couple of different stages in it.

1124
01:57:53,178 --> 01:57:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely there's the initial administrator, we're looking at, did you pay your fee?

1125
01:57:57,159 --> 01:58:01,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We did change last year from paying the fee at the end of paying up front and it's gone fairly well.

1126
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:09,122
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to look at insurance as the state DIA requires any permit to have workers comp insurance evidence submitted.

1127
01:58:09,422 --> 01:58:11,582
[SPEAKER_04]: That one gets mucked up quite handily.

1128
01:58:11,602 --> 01:58:15,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people just used to handling paper and don't really understand what they're doing.

1129
01:58:16,003 --> 01:58:21,551
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been training the staff to understand to look at some key points to make sure it's consistent there to protect the homeowner.

1130
01:58:22,052 --> 01:58:29,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That is very difficult for most folks to get quite right the first time licenses are.

1131
01:58:30,702 --> 01:58:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Less and less, the state doesn't give anybody little paper or plastic cards anymore.

1132
01:58:35,404 --> 01:58:36,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That is all online too.

1133
01:58:36,964 --> 01:58:41,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So we struggle to get guys to learn how to download that and upload it and some of that stuff.

1134
01:58:42,026 --> 01:58:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some of the challenges.

1135
01:58:43,827 --> 01:58:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, it will be generally referred to a building inspector.

1136
01:58:47,228 --> 01:58:52,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, with the energy code, we looked at hers reports, which not everybody fully understands what it is.

1137
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:57,831
[SPEAKER_04]: We increasingly need site plans because of a lot of zoning type issues and stuff like that.

1138
01:58:59,816 --> 01:59:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a lot of homeowners who want to do a very simple thing and don't realize there are some more complex things that need to be thrown in that didn't used to exist.

1139
01:59:07,038 --> 01:59:08,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So they get a lot of education on that.

1140
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:17,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, most professional contractors have sort of done this enough times and we're not that different from anybody else that they can get through the process.

1141
01:59:18,421 --> 01:59:26,423
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have plenty of contractors though that are still learning the ropes and they have some challenges and we do have to go back and forth quite a bit.

1142
01:59:26,963 --> 01:59:29,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We document it and verify it all along the way.

1143
01:59:30,026 --> 01:59:45,454
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of moving things on to the zoning board, we've tried to get away from the process of taking in a building permit and then sort of rejecting it and then sending them on to the zoning board and sort of encouraging them to go ahead.

1144
01:59:45,994 --> 01:59:53,958
[SPEAKER_04]: If they know what they're doing or come talk to us, it shortens the process down because it takes time to do a rejection and set them up for that.

1145
01:59:54,038 --> 01:59:56,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And just spending time for us, we don't need to duplicate.

1146
01:59:59,247 --> 02:00:10,237
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing a lot of stuff, people wanting to do like third floors where it's a two and a half floor limit they want to bump up the attic and put in addition living space that's been very popular lately.

1147
02:00:12,851 --> 02:00:27,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you would think with the cost of things today and the interest rates, people are still putting additions on and still put nice ones on so that is still very much, you know, bread and butter of what we see a lot of in terms of the big projects.

1148
02:00:27,687 --> 02:00:33,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't see a lot of new homes, that's just the nature of Medford but people still want to improve them.

1149
02:00:34,073 --> 02:00:38,778
[SPEAKER_04]: in any way they can and contractors are all still staying busy and they're hard to find a good contractor.

1150
02:00:39,418 --> 02:00:42,561
[SPEAKER_04]: They may say, how many times people come in and go, can you give me a name?

1151
02:00:42,961 --> 02:00:43,662
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do that.

1152
02:00:44,262 --> 02:00:48,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unethical on us, but they're having trouble finding contractors.

1153
02:00:48,286 --> 02:00:49,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that's changed at all.

1154
02:00:50,468 --> 02:00:52,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for such a comprehensive answer.

1155
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:54,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it helps us, um, understand, um,

1156
02:00:56,375 --> 02:01:04,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a priority for me, at least, and I think for a lot of counselors here is to make doing this stuff in Medford easier within reasonable limits, right?

1157
02:01:04,499 --> 02:01:16,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But to make sure that we're revisiting how we do things and make sure that the kind of steps that we're putting in make sense and that we can make things easier for people to come in and try to do business here in Medford.

1158
02:01:16,964 --> 02:01:20,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gives us a lot of fodder to work with.

1159
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:20,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1160
02:01:21,825 --> 02:01:28,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the consistent clear and equitable experience that you know, any applicant receives is essential.

1161
02:01:29,651 --> 02:01:32,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and speedy as best as we can do it.

1162
02:01:34,035 --> 02:01:36,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Last question, leaf blower ordinance.

1163
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's new.

1164
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:42,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're working on it.

1165
02:01:43,683 --> 02:01:44,884
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinance does require

1166
02:01:47,012 --> 02:01:52,194
[SPEAKER_02]: large commercial operators to submit management plans and municipal operators as well.

1167
02:01:52,394 --> 02:01:52,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1168
02:01:53,195 --> 02:01:54,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody submitted a plan last year.

1169
02:01:55,056 --> 02:01:55,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1170
02:01:55,436 --> 02:01:56,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Voluntarily.

1171
02:01:56,676 --> 02:01:56,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1172
02:01:57,377 --> 02:02:00,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we get enforcement on that?

1173
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:11,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what, what reason, you know, what does your office doing to, to get those plans submitted and to, and what does enforcement look like if someone calls and says that someone's violated?

1174
02:02:11,543 --> 02:02:14,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not had any requests for enforcement to date.

1175
02:02:14,584 --> 02:02:14,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1176
02:02:16,895 --> 02:02:29,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be a challenge, primarily because these guys do come in and they get out by time we get out there to see it we don't, we're not sure what we're going to run into so we really haven't, but nobody's really made a natural complaint.

1177
02:02:31,924 --> 02:02:36,165
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working on ways to get the word out.

1178
02:02:36,846 --> 02:02:40,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the biggest challenge is we just not fully sure who we get the word out to.

1179
02:02:41,487 --> 02:02:44,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We have certainly a bunch of names that we used to see.

1180
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost have to drive around and write names down off of trucks.

1181
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:57,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have submitted some names, but we will certainly stumble across guys on a regular basis that nobody knew existed or was doing work.

1182
02:02:57,833 --> 02:02:59,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a challenge.

1183
02:02:59,673 --> 02:03:01,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something the next,

1184
02:03:02,872 --> 02:03:04,353
[SPEAKER_04]: required to be submitted by September 1.

1185
02:03:04,953 --> 02:03:05,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1186
02:03:05,553 --> 02:03:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not in that quite in that timeframe yet.

1187
02:03:10,135 --> 02:03:20,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I am creating a module within CitizenServe to sort of dump the information into and create it and give us a database to go back out next to remind people.

1188
02:03:21,241 --> 02:03:27,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely going to be a bit of a challenge to to work through and, and catch and find the things we need to find.

1189
02:03:27,864 --> 02:03:28,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1190
02:03:28,144 --> 02:03:28,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1191
02:03:28,304 --> 02:03:30,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just one, you know, I'm sure you're doing it.

1192
02:03:30,465 --> 02:03:30,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1193
02:03:32,416 --> 02:03:39,204
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could work with the communications team to get something up on the city website that just kind of explains what you're talking about.

1194
02:03:40,754 --> 02:03:42,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the citizen serve module just going to be internal?

1195
02:03:43,056 --> 02:03:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you going to ask people to submit their plans through that module, we're going to treat it much like we do with the outdoor dining licenses.

1196
02:03:50,323 --> 02:03:52,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, here's what we're looking for.

1197
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:58,711
[SPEAKER_04]: The owner says we need this, you need to give us some information and you need to submit it through that and becomes an annual license.

1198
02:03:58,811 --> 02:04:01,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of what we do with these licenses and permits and requesting.

1199
02:04:01,754 --> 02:04:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also capturing some key information.

1200
02:04:05,637 --> 02:04:25,952
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've added all the property owners emails and phone numbers and stuff that help to supplement other departments needs to reach out in an occasion or an incident or emergency so we're sort of using it to do a couple of different things but we'll treat it just like we do an outdoor dining license you apply on an annual basis you'll submit the documents we need and at least we know

1201
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:30,362
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're going forth with and then we have somebody to reach out to if we need to.

1202
02:04:30,782 --> 02:04:31,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1203
02:04:31,163 --> 02:04:31,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1204
02:04:31,323 --> 02:04:38,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think something on the website that just is, you know, here's if you're an operator who needs to submit a plan, here's the link, here's some of that.

1205
02:04:38,447 --> 02:04:56,137
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a resident who feels that the ordinance is being violated, this is the process noting maybe some of the limitations of the enforcement, you know, just so that there's kind of a clear landing page for people who have questions and concerns about this, both if they're an operator or a resident who wants a

1206
02:04:57,002 --> 02:05:01,304
[SPEAKER_02]: little peace and quiet during the time the ordinance says they should have some Awesome.

1207
02:05:01,324 --> 02:05:02,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you on that.

1208
02:05:02,225 --> 02:05:03,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the answer.

1209
02:05:03,185 --> 02:05:05,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Council is our Thanks.

1210
02:05:06,027 --> 02:05:06,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Just this morning.

1211
02:05:06,907 --> 02:05:10,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I called the police, not emergency line about a leaf blower.

1212
02:05:10,869 --> 02:05:18,473
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can tell you they're still around, and I know that they're in my neighborhood around Hastings Park in West Medford almost every single day.

1213
02:05:19,233 --> 02:05:20,334
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really incredible.

1214
02:05:21,074 --> 02:05:24,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it's, uh, I would

1215
02:05:25,312 --> 02:05:31,355
[SPEAKER_18]: I would love if there was a link, but I can also write down just the names of the landscaping companies.

1216
02:05:31,795 --> 02:05:35,797
[SPEAKER_18]: There's one big one, but I think we know who that is.

1217
02:05:36,097 --> 02:05:52,106
[SPEAKER_18]: But yes, and I think that there's also just like, if there's any kind of standard way of recording, I think that would be great, or like some really straightforward way to just record would be helpful.

1218
02:05:53,286 --> 02:05:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, see click fix.

1219
02:05:55,338 --> 02:05:58,620
[SPEAKER_04]: is certainly an available way to utilize.

1220
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:03,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does come to us and to one of our code enforcement officers to follow through.

1221
02:06:03,542 --> 02:06:09,184
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest challenge for me is just by the time we receive a complaint can get back out there.

1222
02:06:09,204 --> 02:06:10,485
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually moved on.

1223
02:06:10,565 --> 02:06:16,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't have the magic answer to how we're going to be in as timely as we'd like to be, but we just have to work on it.

1224
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:19,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1225
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1226
02:06:19,469 --> 02:06:22,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, even just pointing people in that direction, making sure there's a,

1227
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:26,171
[SPEAKER_02]: category and see click fix for the specific issue.

1228
02:06:26,231 --> 02:06:37,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kinds of kind of small nudge guidance for folks will help because I'm sure a lot of people are complaining generally, but maybe not.

1229
02:06:38,094 --> 02:06:39,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not hearing about it.

1230
02:06:39,374 --> 02:06:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just complaining in their kitchen or something.

1231
02:06:43,035 --> 02:06:44,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

1232
02:06:45,135 --> 02:06:47,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further questions for the building department?

1233
02:06:49,496 --> 02:06:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none.

1234
02:06:50,037 --> 02:06:50,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1235
02:06:50,557 --> 02:06:51,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Commissioner.

1236
02:06:53,534 --> 02:06:56,395
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll go now to clerk and legislative.

1237
02:06:56,615 --> 02:06:58,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have our assistant city clerk with us.

1238
02:06:59,576 --> 02:07:08,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We may go back and forth with our city clerk who's sitting beside me, but we will start with the city clerk's office and then we can do legislative.

1239
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:12,121
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fiscal 25 budgeted 40, 406,364, fiscal 26 budgeted 408,686 and increase of 2,322.

1240
02:07:21,645 --> 02:07:23,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We have in here that this is all fixed cost growth.

1241
02:07:23,786 --> 02:07:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We have contract increases for the staff.

1242
02:07:27,888 --> 02:07:47,075
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a printer and copier contract increase, increase for book binding, inflationary costs in office supplies, increase for clerk conferences and training, and an increase for some of our subscriptions that we use for licenses and records.

1243
02:07:48,437 --> 02:07:54,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, turn it over to our Assistant City Clerk and same three questions as for everybody else.

1244
02:07:54,959 --> 02:07:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to go into the budget more.

1245
02:07:56,579 --> 02:07:57,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I start and hand it over?

1246
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:00,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it over to our City Clerk and then our Assistant City Clerk.

1247
02:08:01,701 --> 02:08:15,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But just talking generally, any additional comments you want to make on the change to the budget, then accomplishments this year, goals for next year, and what's an item that's not funded that you'd like to see funded in the future.

1248
02:08:15,505 --> 02:08:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start with the City Clerk.

1249
02:08:17,065 --> 02:08:19,327
[SPEAKER_02]: who will then go back to being the clerk of the council.

1250
02:08:20,708 --> 02:08:21,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1251
02:08:21,249 --> 02:08:32,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to do a sort of a brief overview and get folks more acclimated to Rich as well.

1252
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I know he's been here since October.

1253
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,901
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been absolutely fantastic.

1254
02:08:36,302 --> 02:08:42,888
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last year we had, last June we had two retirements of longtime employees, including the assistant city clerk.

1255
02:08:44,488 --> 02:09:02,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And we promoted one employee internally and we hired two new employees in the office, we still have a vacancy, which was one of the new hires in the office, Cassandra Polito is one of the new hires in the office and Lisa young is the person we promoted the former assistant city clerk Sylvia de Placido, thankfully is also still working with us part time.

1256
02:09:03,638 --> 02:09:05,900
[SPEAKER_07]: She has a lot of the institutional memory the clerk's office.

1257
02:09:07,001 --> 02:09:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: She does a lot of tasks, actually related to your work whenever we do Council papers, whenever I do Council papers she can she converts the records into the Council papers and delivers them to the mayor.

1258
02:09:19,371 --> 02:09:24,976
[SPEAKER_07]: We have really this year been been been doing more with it, you know, with a little, little bit of a staffing shortage.

1259
02:09:27,779 --> 02:09:40,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have also been, and this is this is mostly thanks thanks to Richard I'm going to hand it off to him in a second, but we have been working with the building department as the building commissioner said to get some of our processes online so that so that customers don't have to come to City Hall.

1260
02:09:43,101 --> 02:09:46,602
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working on the class two and class four auto licenses right now.

1261
02:09:46,622 --> 02:09:47,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe they're up on CitizenServe.

1262
02:09:48,762 --> 02:09:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Common Vic licenses will actually be up there later this year at some point.

1263
02:09:53,903 --> 02:09:56,124
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not up for renewal until the end of December.

1264
02:09:56,224 --> 02:10:04,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a little bit of time there, but we're working on getting these processes online so that, you know, we love it when our customers come and visit, but if they can do this from their couch, it's even better.

1265
02:10:05,806 --> 02:10:08,287
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are really looking at those processes

1266
02:10:10,628 --> 02:10:12,890
[SPEAKER_07]: as both a short term and a long term goal.

1267
02:10:13,651 --> 02:10:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to turn it over to Rich now.

1268
02:10:15,893 --> 02:10:20,718
[SPEAKER_07]: But the budget stays, our budget is staying roughly, roughly level.

1269
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:23,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone.

1270
02:10:24,442 --> 02:10:30,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like Adam said, I mean, my goal when I came in, was to try and streamline the office to make it

1271
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:36,614
[SPEAKER_09]: efficient and functioning into the 20th century, so to speak.

1272
02:10:40,337 --> 02:10:41,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll settle for the 19th at this point.

1273
02:10:41,598 --> 02:10:41,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1274
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:44,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everything was done in paper.

1275
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:46,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Still, when I got here, it was done in paper.

1276
02:10:46,842 --> 02:10:48,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had this huge influx of paper.

1277
02:10:49,644 --> 02:10:54,027
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been working with Scott over in building to get the applications online.

1278
02:10:54,047 --> 02:10:58,251
[SPEAKER_09]: We have three applications right now online, which is our auto licenses, Auto 1, Auto 2, and Auto 4.

1279
02:11:00,432 --> 02:11:01,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Those three are online.

1280
02:11:02,073 --> 02:11:05,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Auto 4 is in the process right now of being renewed by businesses.

1281
02:11:06,474 --> 02:11:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: The goal is to have every application online hopefully by the end of the fiscal, by the end of June of next year.

1282
02:11:14,857 --> 02:11:24,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get the common VIX and a couple others online through the summer so we can have that influx come September, October, November, and December.

1283
02:11:26,197 --> 02:11:43,251
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as that goes, it's just been streamlining the office, cleaning it up, organizing it, updating it, which is what I've been going through, looking into fees, scheduling, and stuff like that to see how our fees are, and just been taking it one step at a time.

1284
02:11:43,712 --> 02:11:48,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam slowly has been putting responsibilities my way with other departments and stuff like that.

1285
02:11:48,536 --> 02:11:54,280
[SPEAKER_09]: So the department has to understand that there is an assistant in the office, and they can come to me for things that they need.

1286
02:11:55,675 --> 02:12:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, other than that, everything Adam said is what we've accomplished so far this year, and hopefully to continue that through the summer, where it's our little lull of a period, and we're not as, you know, hopped up on licenses and stuff like that, so.

1287
02:12:13,322 --> 02:12:14,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions on the budgets?

1288
02:12:14,822 --> 02:12:19,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any questions for the clerk or the assistant city clerk?

1289
02:12:24,318 --> 02:12:27,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't have any myself on the clerk's budget.

1290
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:30,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty self-explanatory.

1291
02:12:30,242 --> 02:12:33,944
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one thing that I would like to add just to make you guys aware.

1292
02:12:35,445 --> 02:12:41,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I have been talking with Scott about subscriptions, especially for CitizenServe.

1293
02:12:41,649 --> 02:12:45,371
[SPEAKER_09]: He did recently get us one subscription, which is going to be under me.

1294
02:12:47,909 --> 02:12:58,042
[SPEAKER_09]: He did say that these subscriptions are costly and I would like to get the employees in our office their own subscription so we can track their workload as they get it.

1295
02:12:58,903 --> 02:13:02,988
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, they'll have to use my login and my name will be on every

1296
02:13:04,082 --> 02:13:07,885
[SPEAKER_09]: application, every process, every step of the application process.

1297
02:13:08,506 --> 02:13:11,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So we really can't see who is actually doing the workload.

1298
02:13:12,549 --> 02:13:18,534
[SPEAKER_09]: My goal is to separate the workload between the employees to make it easier for the office to function.

1299
02:13:19,035 --> 02:13:25,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody will know what everybody is doing and how to do the job, but I want every individual to have their specific responsibilities.

1300
02:13:26,121 --> 02:13:28,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So there might be something coming up next year

1301
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:37,045
[SPEAKER_09]: that I may have to, when we come to you guys for the budget, that you may see a little increase in subscriptions for the CitizenServe licenses.

1302
02:13:38,426 --> 02:13:46,852
[SPEAKER_09]: How much those are, Scott will have a better idea of what they are, each one, but I don't think it's a large amount, but it'll be a significant increase.

1303
02:13:49,865 --> 02:13:50,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes sense.

1304
02:13:50,646 --> 02:13:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as you gear up and get everything on there this year, then you'll be running those.

1305
02:13:56,514 --> 02:14:03,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense when everyone's using them that, and the reporting seemed to be a great benefit in general.

1306
02:14:03,103 --> 02:14:03,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1307
02:14:06,017 --> 02:14:08,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for adding that and we'll be on the lookout for that in the next budget.

1308
02:14:09,781 --> 02:14:17,029
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, legislative, we have a legislative fiscal 25 312 689 fiscal 26 307 359 for a reduction of 5,330 taking a taking a budget cut y'all.

1309
02:14:26,727 --> 02:14:40,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like the main change is the reduction from $51,000 to $35,000 for our professional technical services, which is what we've been using for our zoning consultants.

1310
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:45,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are keeping a chunk of that because we will be continuing that into fiscal 26 at this point.

1311
02:14:47,617 --> 02:14:50,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did work with the clerk who worked with the administration on this.

1312
02:14:50,839 --> 02:14:55,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I do actually have a question for might be for Bob.

1313
02:14:55,441 --> 02:14:57,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bob.

1314
02:14:59,402 --> 02:15:01,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we might be booking.

1315
02:15:02,704 --> 02:15:04,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the services that we use for

1316
02:15:06,925 --> 02:15:16,073
[SPEAKER_02]: our meeting management and agenda in the wrong line item, just because I'm seeing no to date actuals in the legislative repair and maintenance line item.

1317
02:15:17,294 --> 02:15:20,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing that we're over on professional technical services.

1318
02:15:20,316 --> 02:15:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you might be able to take a look at that, or obviously Adam or Rich, if you have any thoughts on that.

1319
02:15:27,102 --> 02:15:32,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, it's all coming out of the same ordinary expense pool, so it's not a big deal, but

1320
02:15:34,938 --> 02:15:39,861
[SPEAKER_02]: for our budget, but I just think we might be putting some stuff in the wrong line from how I'm reading it right now.

1321
02:15:42,844 --> 02:15:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen anything come through the office.

1322
02:15:45,685 --> 02:15:47,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Sylvia has been handling the billing end of it.

1323
02:15:47,787 --> 02:15:48,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1324
02:15:48,968 --> 02:15:52,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I can definitely talk with her to see if maybe we're coding it wrong.

1325
02:15:53,191 --> 02:15:54,432
[SPEAKER_09]: It's being put on the wrong code.

1326
02:15:54,852 --> 02:15:55,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1327
02:15:55,512 --> 02:15:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the Civic Plus stuff.

1328
02:15:58,474 --> 02:15:58,694
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1329
02:15:58,855 --> 02:16:02,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like it might be getting entered into 5310, and it should be getting entered into 5240.

1330
02:16:02,057 --> 02:16:02,097
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1331
02:16:04,233 --> 02:16:05,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, that's something we can look into in the office.

1332
02:16:06,494 --> 02:16:06,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1333
02:16:07,434 --> 02:16:08,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not a big deal.

1334
02:16:08,274 --> 02:16:09,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't worry about it now.

1335
02:16:09,294 --> 02:16:10,335
[SPEAKER_02]: But Bob's here.

1336
02:16:10,375 --> 02:16:10,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here.

1337
02:16:10,935 --> 02:16:11,755
[SPEAKER_02]: You're both aware of it.

1338
02:16:15,536 --> 02:16:15,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1339
02:16:15,816 --> 02:16:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Bob.

1340
02:16:16,296 --> 02:16:25,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any questions about the legislative budget for the clerks or I guess for me?

1341
02:16:34,352 --> 02:16:39,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're hoping that we'll be able to find someone to help us out with that soon, so.

1342
02:16:40,596 --> 02:16:41,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

1343
02:16:42,877 --> 02:16:45,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Next we have our, and thank you both.

1344
02:16:45,338 --> 02:16:45,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Rich.

1345
02:16:45,859 --> 02:16:46,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Adam.

1346
02:16:47,299 --> 02:16:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our electrical budget.

1347
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:51,682
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Superintendent of Wires Randazzo with us.

1348
02:16:52,843 --> 02:16:53,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 25 budget, 678,805.

1349
02:16:53,463 --> 02:16:54,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiscal 26 proposed, 752,094.

1350
02:17:01,082 --> 02:17:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We have COLA increases, an adjustment to reflect overtime and historical actuals, a couple of contract increases, some inflationary cost increases for meter charges and office supplies.

1351
02:17:11,692 --> 02:17:13,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all under fixed cost growth.

1352
02:17:13,174 --> 02:17:19,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a big increase adjusting for our streetlights and the lighting costs there.

1353
02:17:21,322 --> 02:17:23,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And off street for recreational as well, lights.

1354
02:17:24,965 --> 02:17:26,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the summary here.

1355
02:17:27,167 --> 02:17:31,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go to Superintendent Weyers, same as everybody else.

1356
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:36,132
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you know, any comment anymore on those changes that I just mentioned?

1357
02:17:37,073 --> 02:17:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Accomplishments last year, goals next year?

1358
02:17:39,154 --> 02:17:47,560
[SPEAKER_17]: My only accomplishments that I'm looking forward to next year is to pretty much keep everything maintained properly.

1359
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:52,123
[SPEAKER_17]: It's kind of my department is to maintain the signal equipment and

1360
02:17:52,857 --> 02:17:53,537
[SPEAKER_17]: the streetlights.

1361
02:17:54,898 --> 02:18:00,161
[SPEAKER_17]: So as long as I can just keep everything maintained status quo, then I think I'll be in good shape.

1362
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:02,642
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully there's nothing catastrophic that happens.

1363
02:18:02,982 --> 02:18:05,163
[SPEAKER_02]: No light poles falling down or anything like that.

1364
02:18:05,183 --> 02:18:10,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully we have had some issues with the light poles out here, which the bid just went out.

1365
02:18:10,886 --> 02:18:12,447
[SPEAKER_17]: So that'll be getting started soon.

1366
02:18:12,527 --> 02:18:14,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll have some new lighting in the parking lot as well.

1367
02:18:15,389 --> 02:18:15,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1368
02:18:15,629 --> 02:18:19,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions for Mr. Randazzo on the electrical budget?

1369
02:18:22,717 --> 02:18:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have one.

1370
02:18:24,298 --> 02:18:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just talk a little bit more about that increase for this, the, the 55,000 for the lights and what, what that's going towards.

1371
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:33,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So basically the meter charges have gone up.

1372
02:18:34,842 --> 02:18:36,223
[SPEAKER_17]: They've gone up across the board.

1373
02:18:36,243 --> 02:18:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: It was originally my streetlight account had more money in it.

1374
02:18:41,645 --> 02:18:44,726
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we had a couple of quiet years where we dropped it down.

1375
02:18:45,666 --> 02:18:50,548
[SPEAKER_17]: But now we're bringing it back up to where it should be to be compatible to up years prior.

1376
02:18:51,609 --> 02:18:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1377
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:56,572
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you for keeping the lights on for us all.

1378
02:18:56,592 --> 02:18:57,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

1379
02:18:58,794 --> 02:19:00,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing no further questions on electrical.

1380
02:19:01,396 --> 02:19:02,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for sitting through this.

1381
02:19:02,697 --> 02:19:03,497
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take you to fire.

1382
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:08,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll take Steve first next time.

1383
02:19:13,504 --> 02:19:14,685
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Medford Fire Department.

1384
02:19:14,725 --> 02:19:17,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our chief Todd Evans with us.

1385
02:19:18,717 --> 02:19:20,898
[SPEAKER_02]: We have fiscal 25 budget $15,126,017 fiscal 26 proposed $15,802,494 that's an increase of $676,477.

1386
02:19:20,938 --> 02:19:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at.

1387
02:19:37,944 --> 02:19:44,625
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority of that fixed cost, it's all mostly in fixed cost growth, although quite a bit of some new expenses.

1388
02:19:46,066 --> 02:19:50,967
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing $526,000 in the increase for permanent employees.

1389
02:19:51,287 --> 02:19:57,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That's eight firefighters last year budgeted for half year and this is bringing those up to full year.

1390
02:19:57,388 --> 02:20:00,609
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have contract increases and step increases.

1391
02:20:02,502 --> 02:20:11,593
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some increase in part-time clerical staff to help with transitioning to a new office manager.

1392
02:20:11,613 --> 02:20:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some contract increases for the firefighters.

1393
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:31,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Postage is going up a bit, janitorial going up a bit, clothing is up because there's 13 new hires being added, replacing radio batteries, and then we have some new expenses.

1394
02:20:32,138 --> 02:20:45,684
[SPEAKER_02]: We have legal costs going up under professional services, additional training within the fire department and individual classes, restoring a couple of the motor service repair items back to fiscal 24 levels.

1395
02:20:48,545 --> 02:21:01,935
[SPEAKER_02]: some new tracking software, prices are increasing for some of our firefighting and rescue supplies, and then conference dues going up, and then $8,200 for public education.

1396
02:21:03,757 --> 02:21:05,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's everything.

1397
02:21:05,118 --> 02:21:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a long list of line items there on that second page.

1398
02:21:10,082 --> 02:21:14,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that, we'll turn it over to the Chief, and same as everyone else, if you could

1399
02:21:15,621 --> 02:21:21,922
[SPEAKER_02]: tell us, you know, anything more you'd like to say about those changes beyond, you know, I'm sure you have more context than what I have, just what's written here.

1400
02:21:23,123 --> 02:21:30,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about some of your accomplishments this year, goals for next year, and something that's maybe not funded here that you'd like to see funded in future years.

1401
02:21:31,385 --> 02:21:32,025
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

1402
02:21:32,945 --> 02:21:33,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

1403
02:21:35,666 --> 02:21:40,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Were you able to get that PowerPoint that I sent over for you?

1404
02:21:40,567 --> 02:21:41,407
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to try to

1405
02:21:42,127 --> 02:21:42,867
[SPEAKER_21]: share on zoom.

1406
02:21:43,027 --> 02:21:43,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

1407
02:22:26,295 --> 02:22:37,182
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, you touched on all those other things already there There's all those things that you ran down right there so

1408
02:22:40,508 --> 02:22:49,752
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking back over the past year here, we're looking at, we had several promotions here over the past year.

1409
02:22:52,233 --> 02:22:57,255
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had some new hires that we had that went to the Fire Academy back in October of 24.

1410
02:22:57,615 --> 02:23:00,696
[SPEAKER_21]: They're now assigned and they're out on the trucks now.

1411
02:23:01,957 --> 02:23:06,599
[SPEAKER_21]: But we also started the process of back in August,

1412
02:23:10,235 --> 02:23:16,717
[SPEAKER_21]: August, September of 24, starting the recruitment process of 12 more people to send off to the academy.

1413
02:23:17,257 --> 02:23:23,459
[SPEAKER_21]: So that took up until now to finally get them scheduled into an academy.

1414
02:23:23,539 --> 02:23:26,519
[SPEAKER_21]: For four, we were able to get into the Bridgewater Academy.

1415
02:23:27,079 --> 02:23:29,780
[SPEAKER_21]: And eight, we were able to schedule to the Stowe Academy.

1416
02:23:29,820 --> 02:23:32,901
[SPEAKER_21]: So four will go in July, and eight will go in August.

1417
02:23:33,731 --> 02:23:49,102
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a long process to get them through and scheduled into an academy once we begin the hiring process of them and doing all the background checks and everything else and putting them through physicals and psychological testing and everything like that.

1418
02:23:50,463 --> 02:23:59,429
[SPEAKER_21]: So they'll be getting out around end of October and then we can start getting them out on the trucks finally.

1419
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:02,011
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're looking forward to that.

1420
02:24:03,898 --> 02:24:16,225
[SPEAKER_21]: That'll right now we're at about 105 total basically an all time low number for manpower the department here.

1421
02:24:16,825 --> 02:24:21,588
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can see the overtime costs that have been going on here.

1422
02:24:22,408 --> 02:24:29,352
[SPEAKER_21]: It's it's been pretty significant along with basically the

1423
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:37,144
[SPEAKER_21]: There's four working groups and there's a 23 person minimum manning for a group.

1424
02:24:38,245 --> 02:24:47,433
[SPEAKER_21]: And basically right now, each of those four groups, we only have enough manpower for basically 24 per group.

1425
02:24:47,493 --> 02:24:57,280
[SPEAKER_21]: So obviously anytime somebody's on vacation or out sick or death in family or something like that, it's costing all the time.

1426
02:24:58,061 --> 02:25:00,103
[SPEAKER_21]: So getting us up to

1427
02:25:03,173 --> 02:25:04,354
[SPEAKER_21]: 117.

1428
02:25:03,573 --> 02:25:04,354
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll help a little bit.

1429
02:25:04,694 --> 02:25:05,595
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to help a little bit.

1430
02:25:06,555 --> 02:25:07,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And finally, it'll help.

1431
02:25:10,538 --> 02:25:23,346
[SPEAKER_21]: Firefighters are definitely working a lot of hours and also trying to do what you heard the commissioner talking about all the development and all the buildings and everything else going on that usually entails details and things like that.

1432
02:25:23,427 --> 02:25:25,948
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's been a lot of details going on also.

1433
02:25:26,389 --> 02:25:31,392
[SPEAKER_21]: So the firefighters are trying to keep up with doing details and the overtime work and

1434
02:25:34,271 --> 02:25:34,951
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a strain on them.

1435
02:25:35,271 --> 02:25:39,512
[SPEAKER_21]: So increasing the manning is definitely going to be helpful.

1436
02:25:40,272 --> 02:25:50,456
[SPEAKER_21]: And obviously, every year, I'm going to say that we obviously need more manning because these trucks are busy.

1437
02:25:50,836 --> 02:25:51,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford's busy.

1438
02:25:53,456 --> 02:25:59,738
[SPEAKER_21]: You've probably seen recent articles talking about Medford up and coming, growing, expanding.

1439
02:26:03,605 --> 02:26:10,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Engine one out of headquarters here, they're doing a lot of runs, as you'll see in the coming slides here.

1440
02:26:11,507 --> 02:26:15,308
[SPEAKER_21]: Engine four, Riverside Ave station, they're doing a ton of runs too.

1441
02:26:16,048 --> 02:26:26,892
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's not much wiggle room there that we can try to, you know, utilize other outside stations to come into the area of coverage to help lighten that load on.

1442
02:26:26,912 --> 02:26:28,392
[SPEAKER_21]: And obviously,

1443
02:26:29,238 --> 02:26:31,218
[SPEAKER_21]: talking about developing Medford Square more.

1444
02:26:31,398 --> 02:26:33,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we're talking about developing Salem Street more.

1445
02:26:36,359 --> 02:26:48,181
[SPEAKER_21]: It's gonna add more runs, and we're trying our best to think of ways to try to help these trucks reduce the numbers of runs, beating up the trucks.

1446
02:26:48,261 --> 02:26:55,883
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the costs are adding up on the trucks, and we've been trying to maintain the fleet, and it's difficult.

1447
02:26:55,943 --> 02:26:57,523
[SPEAKER_21]: The costs are going up on all the,

1448
02:26:58,230 --> 02:27:08,016
[SPEAKER_21]: all the parts on trucks delays and getting the parts and, and obviously the mechanics are very strapped in the city here, like cities down to like two mechanics now.

1449
02:27:08,737 --> 02:27:11,318
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's, it's, it's difficult.

1450
02:27:11,338 --> 02:27:19,804
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we're going to have to send truck trucks out for repairs outside because the mechanics, we don't have enough mechanics here to work on it internally.

1451
02:27:19,824 --> 02:27:23,006
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to have to send them out and it's additional cost there.

1452
02:27:23,726 --> 02:27:27,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's tough.

1453
02:27:28,686 --> 02:27:45,237
[SPEAKER_21]: With the we had had an aging fleet we're waiting on to pumps that are supposed to arrive at the end of this year, sometime maybe December, January, maybe we're supposed to get to pumps that were ordered back in 23. that's part of the slide also coming up.

1454
02:27:46,718 --> 02:27:48,379
[SPEAKER_21]: How this a national.

1455
02:27:50,114 --> 02:27:55,739
[SPEAKER_21]: crisis really of backlogs of fire trucks and the cost going up skyrocketing.

1456
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:10,313
[SPEAKER_21]: Senator Warren's looking into it, probing into these companies that are basically buying up the companies that made the fire trucks and it's creating a, you know,

1457
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:14,031
[SPEAKER_21]: huge backlog and price spikes and everything else.

1458
02:28:14,071 --> 02:28:16,872
[SPEAKER_21]: So, uh, I included it, some articles in there for you.

1459
02:28:16,892 --> 02:28:22,813
[SPEAKER_21]: There's even a news newsreel about it that tells you all about it, what's going on there and how they're looking into it right now.

1460
02:28:23,713 --> 02:28:33,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, back in 2023, when we ordered those trucks, those, those fire engines were about, I believe 980,000 each maybe.

1461
02:28:34,256 --> 02:28:40,798
[SPEAKER_21]: And, uh, now, and I think they were talking about like maybe 800 days wait time from the signing of a,

1462
02:28:41,276 --> 02:28:41,996
[SPEAKER_21]: of a contract.

1463
02:28:42,536 --> 02:28:52,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're talking about the trucks are over $1.2 million and you're looking at 1200 days wait time from the signing of the truck after you go and spec it out and everything else.

1464
02:28:53,179 --> 02:28:57,860
[SPEAKER_21]: It's tough to keep up with this stuff.

1465
02:28:58,060 --> 02:29:05,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you, some private equity firms are buying up these fire manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers and gouging us basically?

1466
02:29:06,163 --> 02:29:07,263
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, great.

1467
02:29:10,594 --> 02:29:13,876
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, that's one of the challenges that we're facing.

1468
02:29:13,956 --> 02:29:25,584
[SPEAKER_21]: So anticipating, going forward, trying to anticipate trucks being built four years, you know, it's harder to look at the capital improvement plan and try to space that out.

1469
02:29:25,964 --> 02:29:27,705
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're not even talking about ladder trucks yet.

1470
02:29:28,345 --> 02:29:30,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Ladder trucks are over $2 million now.

1471
02:29:31,868 --> 02:29:36,631
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's tough going forward along with the parts.

1472
02:29:37,872 --> 02:29:47,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Even ordering hose or something like that, you got to start thinking a year in advance to start getting hose, things like that.

1473
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:58,748
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty tough to figure this out, the way that these prices are going and the backlog of supply chain stuff and everything else here.

1474
02:29:59,208 --> 02:30:01,130
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's not just us, it's across the country.

1475
02:30:03,892 --> 02:30:06,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously, we had several retirements here.

1476
02:30:06,894 --> 02:30:08,816
[SPEAKER_21]: We had four people retire here.

1477
02:30:08,876 --> 02:30:11,297
[SPEAKER_21]: We had some, again, I mentioned the promotions.

1478
02:30:12,638 --> 02:30:18,623
[SPEAKER_21]: One of our firefighters actually just recently got promoted to Lieutenant Robert Brennan.

1479
02:30:20,364 --> 02:30:28,329
[SPEAKER_21]: His uncle, who retired after 42 years, was on the state hazmat team for a long time.

1480
02:30:28,410 --> 02:30:31,812
[SPEAKER_21]: He was one of the longest serving members on the state hazmat team.

1481
02:30:32,493 --> 02:30:45,562
[SPEAKER_21]: And Robbie Brennan went through all the hazmat training and applied and went through the process and interviews and everything else against other people that were trying to apply.

1482
02:30:45,622 --> 02:30:54,848
[SPEAKER_21]: And he ended up landing a spot on the state hazmat team and happened to replace the spot that his uncle was in, coincidentally.

1483
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:02,886
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a pretty big thing there to have a continue having somebody on Metro Fire Department on the state hazmat team.

1484
02:31:03,346 --> 02:31:05,728
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's a good thing to have here.

1485
02:31:05,768 --> 02:31:09,191
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's great for him.

1486
02:31:18,058 --> 02:31:22,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year, I had mentioned that we were going to try to look into that Cummings grant.

1487
02:31:26,165 --> 02:31:27,486
[SPEAKER_21]: for community engagement.

1488
02:31:27,566 --> 02:31:32,190
[SPEAKER_21]: We had nine people that are now a community engagement team here.

1489
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:43,118
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year, we did not get the Cummings grant applied for due to some other circumstances behind the scenes here that were going on here.

1490
02:31:43,458 --> 02:31:46,620
[SPEAKER_21]: But this year, we're going to keep our eye out for the Cummings grant again.

1491
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:52,565
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've established some dedicated

1492
02:31:53,363 --> 02:32:00,286
[SPEAKER_21]: folks that are part of the day personnel to start focusing on grants and looking for more grants to acquire things.

1493
02:32:00,786 --> 02:32:02,867
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's been working out well.

1494
02:32:02,967 --> 02:32:06,088
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been tracking down some good things here to apply for.

1495
02:32:06,568 --> 02:32:09,769
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think we have some things on the horizon to look forward to here.

1496
02:32:10,510 --> 02:32:15,611
[SPEAKER_21]: We have acquired, here you go, the grant section here.

1497
02:32:16,672 --> 02:32:21,834
[SPEAKER_21]: We were able to get some great training on electric vehicles

1498
02:32:23,661 --> 02:32:49,107
[SPEAKER_21]: and we were able to acquire several fire blankets that you can actually put over an electric vehicle if it's on if it was on fire and and try to help maintain keeping that once you get once you get it out trying to keep it from reigniting and transporting the vehicle to like a tow yard or something and getting that safely stored away there.

1499
02:32:49,627 --> 02:32:51,628
[SPEAKER_21]: We also got

1500
02:32:52,959 --> 02:33:01,202
[SPEAKER_21]: plugs that you can put into the electric vehicles to disable the power to the electric vehicles.

1501
02:33:01,262 --> 02:33:08,945
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have a supply of those electric plugs through that gaming commission money that we were able to get there.

1502
02:33:10,978 --> 02:33:25,410
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there was two department of fire service grants that we've got that we were able to those new recruits that we have going to the academy we were able to nine out of the 12 sets of gear we were able to acquire grant money for.

1503
02:33:26,251 --> 02:33:28,873
[SPEAKER_21]: So, that was, that was helpful right there.

1504
02:33:28,893 --> 02:33:29,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And also,

1505
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:41,388
[SPEAKER_21]: another Department of Fire Services grant was we were able to acquire to buy more structural firefighting helmets and face pieces.

1506
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:54,018
[SPEAKER_21]: So right now it's working out pretty well there so far with the focusing on the grants and having somebody dedicated to looking into that for us.

1507
02:33:54,939 --> 02:33:57,161
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, the

1508
02:33:58,954 --> 02:34:13,928
[SPEAKER_21]: procurement guys that are looking into the grants and also helping out with acquiring supplies for us and items that they've attended some conferences, which we haven't been able to do before.

1509
02:34:14,548 --> 02:34:21,394
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's pretty important, looking at outside other state, other fire departments and things like that.

1510
02:34:22,716 --> 02:34:24,197
[SPEAKER_21]: That's more like the norm around it.

1511
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:35,158
[SPEAKER_21]: going out and learning about other things there and interacting with vendors and things like that isn't something that has been done in the past here.

1512
02:34:35,178 --> 02:34:45,808
[SPEAKER_21]: So Medford's catching up with the times here, kind of expanding their viewpoints and learning other new things out there.

1513
02:34:45,848 --> 02:34:48,430
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a good thing here.

1514
02:34:51,365 --> 02:35:01,835
[SPEAKER_21]: The engine three, the ladder two station there on Salem Street, that was a year-long project, probably more than a year long, doing that floor over there.

1515
02:35:02,796 --> 02:35:04,938
[SPEAKER_21]: They were finally able to move back into that station.

1516
02:35:05,238 --> 02:35:13,846
[SPEAKER_21]: Engine four on Riverside Ave, there was an issue with one of their bathrooms there that Paul was able to fix.

1517
02:35:15,171 --> 02:35:22,774
[SPEAKER_21]: fix some issues in there with the hole in the floor and leakage, water leaking down to the lower level.

1518
02:35:22,854 --> 02:35:28,776
[SPEAKER_21]: And he was able to do a tiling renovation in that bathroom and repair that.

1519
02:35:29,297 --> 02:35:36,259
[SPEAKER_21]: And all the stations, obviously not headquarters, but the other stations had window projects done.

1520
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:39,001
[SPEAKER_21]: So windows were replaced in those exterior stations.

1521
02:35:43,418 --> 02:35:44,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, Rich Lane from IT.

1522
02:35:44,678 --> 02:35:50,079
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been working on a fiber network project going on throughout the city.

1523
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Also updating several computers at the department.

1524
02:35:55,861 --> 02:35:59,061
[SPEAKER_21]: And a new telephone system was installed.

1525
02:35:59,081 --> 02:36:02,762
[SPEAKER_21]: The headquarters working on the other station soon.

1526
02:36:03,722 --> 02:36:09,504
[SPEAKER_21]: And we were able to acquire a new fire engine actually through ABBA funding.

1527
02:36:13,454 --> 02:36:17,536
[SPEAKER_21]: just before the beginning of just before the beginning of the year there.

1528
02:36:18,696 --> 02:36:20,777
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just about to go into service finally.

1529
02:36:21,177 --> 02:36:32,882
[SPEAKER_21]: So that came about because of another city's department happened to they ordered a couple fire engines that actually didn't end up fitting in their stations.

1530
02:36:33,723 --> 02:36:38,264
[SPEAKER_21]: So we happen to hear about that, that those were became available.

1531
02:36:38,304 --> 02:36:39,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Lawrence grabbed one quickly.

1532
02:36:40,085 --> 02:36:41,826
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we heard about it and we quickly

1533
02:36:42,766 --> 02:36:49,189
[SPEAKER_21]: learned about that we could get get some upper funds and quickly grab a new truck, so that we wouldn't have to wait for years.

1534
02:36:49,909 --> 02:36:51,330
[SPEAKER_21]: So we quickly jumped on that one.

1535
02:36:51,630 --> 02:36:54,612
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and we're sure we're sure that's going to fit in our station.

1536
02:36:54,952 --> 02:36:56,793
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in.

1537
02:36:56,853 --> 02:37:00,815
[SPEAKER_21]: We went out and measured all the stations and made sure that it was going to get in it.

1538
02:37:01,902 --> 02:37:02,422
[SPEAKER_21]: It's working.

1539
02:37:02,482 --> 02:37:09,024
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're just doing driver training on that right now and just getting acclimated to the truck now.

1540
02:37:09,084 --> 02:37:12,285
[SPEAKER_21]: And it should be driving around very shortly.

1541
02:37:13,465 --> 02:37:14,025
[SPEAKER_21]: We're right there.

1542
02:37:14,546 --> 02:37:18,547
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, we had to plan ahead and try to get all the equipment for that truck.

1543
02:37:19,087 --> 02:37:23,888
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we're waiting on some of that stuff, supplies, to come in to get that into service.

1544
02:37:28,229 --> 02:37:29,710
[SPEAKER_21]: One of those facility improvements.

1545
02:37:32,079 --> 02:37:49,094
[SPEAKER_21]: This is here, we're talking about, we had to get a boat dock installed at the Riverside Yacht Club, where we keep our marine unit one, our fire boat in the water.

1546
02:37:49,635 --> 02:37:56,081
[SPEAKER_21]: Last season, when we pulled it out of the water, we found that there was significant damage to the bottom of the boat.

1547
02:37:56,581 --> 02:37:57,322
[SPEAKER_21]: We found out that,

1548
02:37:59,403 --> 02:38:05,105
[SPEAKER_21]: There had been barnacles attaching to the boat and eating holes in the hull of the boat.

1549
02:38:05,225 --> 02:38:12,608
[SPEAKER_21]: So we had to get that repaired and then get this dock installed so that we're able to lift it out of water.

1550
02:38:14,008 --> 02:38:18,190
[SPEAKER_21]: There's actually a video here that if you want to take a quick look at that just to see what that looks like.

1551
02:38:18,210 --> 02:38:24,972
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure if you can hear that.

1552
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:02,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Rich Lane didn't bring a video.

1553
02:39:12,205 --> 02:39:14,687
[SPEAKER_21]: So here it is landing back up on the dock.

1554
02:39:23,351 --> 02:39:23,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1555
02:39:40,006 --> 02:39:41,947
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so there's that.

1556
02:39:41,967 --> 02:39:45,128
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1557
02:39:47,209 --> 02:39:51,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically we had to do that to try to save the boat.

1558
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:52,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's great.

1559
02:39:52,371 --> 02:39:52,691
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1560
02:39:53,331 --> 02:39:54,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Less holes, that's always good.

1561
02:39:54,952 --> 02:39:57,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1562
02:39:57,253 --> 02:40:00,774
[SPEAKER_21]: So here, this is what I was talking about here, about how busy.

1563
02:40:00,794 --> 02:40:01,534
[SPEAKER_02]: The run figures?

1564
02:40:01,614 --> 02:40:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1565
02:40:02,134 --> 02:40:08,177
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is looking at the run numbers by station.

1566
02:40:08,197 --> 02:40:08,857
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see.

1567
02:40:13,377 --> 02:40:14,057
[SPEAKER_21]: engine four.

1568
02:40:21,721 --> 02:40:22,601
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're working hard.

1569
02:40:24,302 --> 02:40:42,631
[SPEAKER_21]: At this point, like the engine one numbers and engine four numbers, they're quite significant where at this point that the levels that these are getting to like NFPA standards would say that these are probably like a

1570
02:40:44,431 --> 02:40:49,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't say dangerous level, but it's pretty significant.

1571
02:40:50,733 --> 02:40:56,114
[SPEAKER_21]: And this was just talking about employee compliments.

1572
02:40:56,254 --> 02:41:02,356
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you want to review this stuff, this is just like numbers over the years of where we were at as far as employees go.

1573
02:41:04,857 --> 02:41:12,679
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was what I was talking about with the four groups, with having 24 or 23 people working in A, B, C, or D group.

1574
02:41:13,921 --> 02:41:23,326
[SPEAKER_21]: That's where I was talking about where basically anybody on vacation or out sick or something like that, it's generating overtime costs.

1575
02:41:23,346 --> 02:41:29,110
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was just to explain the overtime amounts in the budget there.

1576
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:31,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Last year, that was cut by $100,000 last year.

1577
02:41:31,911 --> 02:41:35,473
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's where we're at on that.

1578
02:41:36,274 --> 02:41:41,036
[SPEAKER_21]: And this was the thing that I was telling you about the nationwide fire department struggles with the trucks.

1579
02:41:44,347 --> 02:41:48,911
[SPEAKER_21]: This is where they're telling you that now they're costing over $2 million for ladder trucks.

1580
02:41:49,652 --> 02:41:54,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And Senator Warren is looking into that.

1581
02:41:57,719 --> 02:41:59,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Telling you that there's a nationwide fire truck shortage.

1582
02:42:02,555 --> 02:42:04,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Quincy fight apartment, this article about Quincy.

1583
02:42:05,096 --> 02:42:07,878
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, this is pretty similar.

1584
02:42:08,458 --> 02:42:11,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Reading the article, it's like very similar to Medford situations.

1585
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:14,761
[SPEAKER_21]: So I encourage you to read that article.

1586
02:42:15,142 --> 02:42:18,083
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very interesting on how close it is compared to us.

1587
02:42:20,745 --> 02:42:25,287
[SPEAKER_21]: Spikes in labor shortages and everything else is adding to that.

1588
02:42:25,387 --> 02:42:31,050
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's that rev group that we were talking about that's buying up these companies.

1589
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:40,842
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a two-minute video, a news story about it.

1590
02:42:41,302 --> 02:42:44,303
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're interested in seeing that, it's up to you.

1591
02:42:46,544 --> 02:42:48,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can circle back to it.

1592
02:42:48,645 --> 02:42:49,285
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available here.

1593
02:42:49,305 --> 02:42:50,946
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it available to the public.

1594
02:42:53,247 --> 02:42:58,989
[SPEAKER_21]: There's the article about looking and probing into the firetruck manufacturing issues.

1595
02:42:59,049 --> 02:43:02,090
[SPEAKER_21]: We can skip along.

1596
02:43:07,255 --> 02:43:11,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, well, the goals going forward, we were talking about discussing some of the goals.

1597
02:43:11,817 --> 02:43:17,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously we wanna look towards officer development and the mentorship program with new recruits coming on board.

1598
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:35,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Also looking at increasing training and looking at more targeted training focused on low frequency and high risk incidents and really training up on that stuff.

1599
02:43:36,603 --> 02:43:46,886
[SPEAKER_21]: also getting more people certified in things such as safety officer and fire instructor and things like that that are important towards promotional exams.

1600
02:43:47,326 --> 02:44:04,610
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, with the officer development, peer support, firefighter wellness program, members of the department have already charged ahead with this and started doing this training with, they've been training in

1601
02:44:06,063 --> 02:44:10,465
[SPEAKER_21]: here support mental health, mental wellness training.

1602
02:44:10,545 --> 02:44:21,130
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and they've actually conducted classes now for for members of the department with it, telling them how to contact them and get in touch with them regarding

1603
02:44:22,548 --> 02:44:32,272
[SPEAKER_21]: if they've gone through a difficult call in some way and how to address like critical incident stress situations and things like that.

1604
02:44:32,372 --> 02:44:40,016
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's already, members have already taken the reins of that and run with it and they're doing a good job with that.

1605
02:44:40,076 --> 02:44:43,017
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually they're ahead of that already.

1606
02:44:45,198 --> 02:44:51,801
[SPEAKER_21]: And obviously we're looking forward to trying to update old SOPs that are

1607
02:44:52,813 --> 02:44:53,434
[SPEAKER_21]: that are dated.

1608
02:44:55,115 --> 02:45:15,153
[SPEAKER_21]: And another big thing is we really need to start catching up with the times of the software that we can actually track training and inventory tracking for all of our equipment that is obviously expensive stuff.

1609
02:45:15,193 --> 02:45:19,897
[SPEAKER_21]: We want to keep an eye on it and keep track of it and know where it's at and everything else.

1610
02:45:20,698 --> 02:45:27,540
[SPEAKER_21]: And these companies are all going to a subscription based model.

1611
02:45:27,701 --> 02:45:31,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Like you can't just buy software and own it anymore.

1612
02:45:31,682 --> 02:45:34,823
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, this is becoming a cost now.

1613
02:45:35,143 --> 02:45:46,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Some companies are charging outrageous money, but we've been looking hard at the different things out there and we've been trying to find something that can

1614
02:45:47,032 --> 02:45:49,173
[SPEAKER_21]: be suitable for us and do exactly what we need.

1615
02:45:49,774 --> 02:45:55,977
[SPEAKER_21]: And we believe that we found some good ones for training and inventory tracking.

1616
02:45:56,037 --> 02:46:09,444
[SPEAKER_21]: And we would like to start working with those and utilizing those to get the department up to date so that we can actually be ready for like insurance.

1617
02:46:12,082 --> 02:46:13,322
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an ISO rating.

1618
02:46:13,342 --> 02:46:17,284
[SPEAKER_21]: The last time that we got an ISO rating done here was in 2018.

1619
02:46:17,744 --> 02:46:26,927
[SPEAKER_21]: And at the time we were rated at a class two and departments all strive to get to the class one.

1620
02:46:27,507 --> 02:46:39,991
[SPEAKER_21]: And basically we were just missing out on some points where they look at like water systems and dispatch and your training records and training grounds and

1621
02:46:41,022 --> 02:46:45,025
[SPEAKER_21]: staffing and equipment and trucks and things like that.

1622
02:46:45,065 --> 02:46:52,850
[SPEAKER_21]: So we were probably within like about eight or nine points of getting to a class one at the time.

1623
02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:54,471
[SPEAKER_21]: So we were really close.

1624
02:46:54,551 --> 02:46:59,254
[SPEAKER_21]: We're trying to strive to get all the stuff in line for the next time that we get

1625
02:47:01,357 --> 02:47:04,478
[SPEAKER_21]: inspected by them to try to get to that class one.

1626
02:47:04,498 --> 02:47:06,979
[SPEAKER_21]: It'd be nice to get to that class one level.

1627
02:47:06,999 --> 02:47:07,579
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be great.

1628
02:47:08,119 --> 02:47:15,581
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can work with the, you know, water department and make sure we can probably get some points on that end.

1629
02:47:16,241 --> 02:47:22,103
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm talking about basically checking water flows from hydrants and things like that.

1630
02:47:22,183 --> 02:47:26,985
[SPEAKER_21]: Checking on the water system that way could help us pick up some points and things like that.

1631
02:47:27,105 --> 02:47:28,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Other things with the training,

1632
02:47:29,048 --> 02:47:35,389
[SPEAKER_21]: and tracking the training, that's where the software would come into play, inventory tracking and all that stuff that plays into it.

1633
02:47:35,409 --> 02:47:39,690
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something that we're striving to do with that software.

1634
02:47:49,172 --> 02:47:57,834
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've spoken before about obviously something that we hope to do one of these days is develop a dive rescue team.

1635
02:47:58,768 --> 02:48:00,849
[SPEAKER_21]: and a drone response team.

1636
02:48:01,529 --> 02:48:04,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Both of these would be huge to have here in the city.

1637
02:48:05,470 --> 02:48:11,372
[SPEAKER_21]: We've looked into it that we would probably need about three people per group of the four groups.

1638
02:48:11,532 --> 02:48:17,574
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we could get 12 people completely trained up, we could have a successful dive team here.

1639
02:48:19,829 --> 02:48:27,913
[SPEAKER_21]: That way we would have three people potentially working in each group to be able to respond immediately to some kind of water situation here.

1640
02:48:28,453 --> 02:48:39,879
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is about 10 people or so went out and started getting the training on their own years ago after they responded to a drowning incident at the Medford Boat Club.

1641
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:47,082
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's tough for them when they go to a call like that and somebody is underwater, you can't find them.

1642
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:49,540
[SPEAKER_21]: we don't have the equipment to get down there.

1643
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:54,481
[SPEAKER_21]: You got to call another community that has a dive team and wait for them to get there.

1644
02:48:55,942 --> 02:49:01,343
[SPEAKER_21]: And so you get, you have firefighters standing like on the shoreline, they can't dive.

1645
02:49:02,023 --> 02:49:06,224
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nothing, there's nothing you can do except wait for a response.

1646
02:49:06,264 --> 02:49:14,126
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's something, that's, that's something tough to do if you don't have the stuff that, you know, that's, that's not in their nature to wait for something, you know?

1647
02:49:14,346 --> 02:49:16,206
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um,

1648
02:49:17,197 --> 02:49:21,964
[SPEAKER_21]: So a dive team would be great if we could actually get that eventually.

1649
02:49:21,984 --> 02:49:31,056
[SPEAKER_21]: And the same thing with a drone team as far as search and rescue capabilities, that would be

1650
02:49:32,178 --> 02:49:49,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Great to have the drone with the thermal imaging the night vision and be able to actually there's been several times that we've had to look for people in the in the woods, we have a lot of woods around method, we have a lot of waterways trying to find somebody in the water reported in the water it's hard to find them at night.

1651
02:49:50,891 --> 02:50:02,079
[SPEAKER_21]: I can think of several times where if we had a drone with that capability, we could have flown that along the shoreline, we could have found these people quick before the incident turned worse.

1652
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:19,230
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, at like a fire scene, it can be huge to actually be able to pinpoint where fire is in like a roof or something like that, because I've seen it in action at some fire scenes where

1653
02:50:21,322 --> 02:50:27,924
[SPEAKER_21]: We have, they have a ladder truck flowing water onto the fire and there's smoke everywhere.

1654
02:50:27,964 --> 02:50:34,465
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can't really see through the smoke or where you gotta aim this stream of water and hit the right spot in a roof or something like that.

1655
02:50:34,905 --> 02:50:48,228
[SPEAKER_21]: And, but with the drone, they can actually see the thermal hotspots and like look on a tablet or something while they're directing the hose streams, the water streams and pinpoint.

1656
02:50:48,926 --> 02:50:54,089
[SPEAKER_21]: the exact location through the smoke and everything else and start hitting those targets exactly.

1657
02:50:54,129 --> 02:50:58,131
[SPEAKER_21]: And that would be something huge to have here.

1658
02:50:58,331 --> 02:51:00,192
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be great if we could acquire that.

1659
02:51:00,733 --> 02:51:07,717
[SPEAKER_21]: It wouldn't be that one, that particular drone that I have listed there, because I looked at that one last year and it was about 13 grand.

1660
02:51:08,377 --> 02:51:11,079
[SPEAKER_21]: But now with the tariffs and everything else, that one went up to like 30,000.

1661
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:16,822
[SPEAKER_21]: So that one's out, but there's another one that I found that's back around

1662
02:51:18,277 --> 02:51:19,558
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 spots.

1663
02:51:19,598 --> 02:51:24,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two chief, are we looking at, these are one-time costs or how much of this is ongoing?

1664
02:51:24,963 --> 02:51:25,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1665
02:51:25,463 --> 02:51:33,710
[SPEAKER_21]: The drone, the drone that I, the alternative drone that I found, that thing has the same thing, thermal imaging, night vision, that one's about 9,000, $10,000.

1666
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:41,296
[SPEAKER_21]: And the only other costs associated with that, anybody that wants to be on the team, it's like a,

1667
02:51:42,052 --> 02:51:48,738
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like $175 to get your POT 107 certification, basically drone pilot license that you have to get.

1668
02:51:49,218 --> 02:51:51,180
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like 175 bucks to take that test.

1669
02:51:51,380 --> 02:51:53,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And then that's it, that's it.

1670
02:51:53,582 --> 02:51:57,525
[SPEAKER_21]: So you could get a handful of people that are pilot trained to operate that drone.

1671
02:51:57,545 --> 02:52:04,711
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you got a great search and rescue tool and great tool at a fire scene and hazard assessments.

1672
02:52:06,230 --> 02:52:10,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the dive team, are those one-time costs as well, mostly, or how much of that is ongoing?

1673
02:52:10,472 --> 02:52:32,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, well, for the most part, yeah, to acquire all the equipment and the dry suits and the tanks and the communications, that's going to be the big initial cost there in getting those certifications to get up to the full-scale dive rescue ability, rescue diver level certification training.

1674
02:52:34,617 --> 02:52:37,999
[SPEAKER_21]: just to get those 12 individuals done, that would be the initial cost.

1675
02:52:38,039 --> 02:52:38,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1676
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:59,234
[SPEAKER_21]: So, and after that, it's going to, it's just going to be like, you know, uh, training throughout the year or whatever, any costs that might be associated with that, but that, that could just be some little over time involved in that just to keep on, keep up with your training once it's established.

1677
02:52:59,254 --> 02:53:03,437
[SPEAKER_21]: But for the most part, you're going to have those three people per shift working on

1678
02:53:04,290 --> 02:53:31,459
[SPEAKER_21]: on duty at the time so you're not you're not like calling somebody in you're gonna have those people they're available ready to go and and you could call like another community it's like a backup team to come in and help you out so and instead of calling a another community in to be your your one and only rescue situation here um yeah that's all we get for that um and then uh the only other thing that

1679
02:53:32,333 --> 02:53:39,056
[SPEAKER_21]: on the horizon right now is we have an issue with the truck radios that we have right now.

1680
02:53:39,196 --> 02:53:54,983
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now the truck radios that we have are basically end of life right now and we don't even have any interoperability with the police because the police switched over to a digital frequency and our truck radios are not capable of even

1681
02:53:56,083 --> 02:53:59,204
[SPEAKER_21]: getting the police frequency in the truck.

1682
02:53:59,224 --> 02:54:02,104
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can't communicate with them in the trucks or hear them.

1683
02:54:03,125 --> 02:54:10,827
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have to look into replacing those radios as fast as we can.

1684
02:54:11,527 --> 02:54:14,247
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, there's a cost to that.

1685
02:54:14,267 --> 02:54:18,048
[SPEAKER_21]: So we were looking at a quote of roughly $109,000 for that.

1686
02:54:18,088 --> 02:54:18,548
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's it.

1687
02:54:18,588 --> 02:54:19,369
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I got.

1688
02:54:19,509 --> 02:54:22,309
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1689
02:54:26,787 --> 02:54:27,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, chief.

1690
02:54:27,307 --> 02:54:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to questions.

1691
02:54:28,347 --> 02:54:29,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I have counselor scarpelli.

1692
02:54:30,748 --> 02:54:50,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, I can I don't want to be rude but I know I have to get to work after I speak I try to hold on as long as I can, but chief I appreciate your thorough breakdown, and, but I do have some, some questions, and as we look at the budget breakdown.

1693
02:54:51,447 --> 02:55:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing's alarming to me, you mentioned that the staffing is a concern, but we see two positions that will not be filled this year.

1694
02:55:02,414 --> 02:55:03,595
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that gonna affect us?

1695
02:55:05,996 --> 02:55:14,362
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, as I mentioned before, the past year, we've been operating at an all time low, really.

1696
02:55:15,453 --> 02:55:16,574
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't been up to that.

1697
02:55:17,434 --> 02:55:27,019
[SPEAKER_21]: That's gonna reduce us to the, basically to the potential of only hiring up to 118 people.

1698
02:55:27,359 --> 02:55:32,322
[SPEAKER_21]: Once we have these people out of the academy, that's gonna get us right to about 117 right there.

1699
02:55:32,422 --> 02:55:38,245
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can potentially add one more person and that's about it.

1700
02:55:38,325 --> 02:55:44,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously it would be great if we could increase Manning after that and that would help

1701
02:55:45,331 --> 02:55:48,254
[SPEAKER_21]: increase the people working in those four different groups.

1702
02:55:48,855 --> 02:55:50,436
[SPEAKER_21]: And that would help.

1703
02:55:52,559 --> 02:55:56,963
[SPEAKER_21]: That would help obviously defray any overtime costs and things like that.

1704
02:55:57,143 --> 02:56:02,569
[SPEAKER_21]: And also, we could we could start looking for a potential, you know,

1705
02:56:04,036 --> 02:56:27,590
[SPEAKER_21]: If we could start looking at like a squad or something like that, that would probably be one of the best ways to start alleviating some of the issues with the engine one and engine for the amount of runs that they're doing to have like a, a squad would be like a smaller vehicle that you could send out to respond to like a medical call or something like that and try to take off the burden of engine one and engine four.

1706
02:56:28,370 --> 02:56:31,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, that would probably be the only way to help them out.

1707
02:56:31,988 --> 02:56:36,511
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's obviously something that we have to look forward to in the future.

1708
02:56:36,531 --> 02:56:37,311
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1709
02:56:37,331 --> 02:56:38,612
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that I appreciate that.

1710
02:56:38,672 --> 02:56:44,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at the report that was sent up with the gentleman that the city hired the GIS report.

1711
02:56:45,096 --> 02:56:54,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now we're not meeting safe staff staffing numbers on our companies and trucks at the national regulations, right?

1712
02:56:55,957 --> 02:56:57,678
[SPEAKER_21]: You mean like NFPA standards?

1713
02:56:57,759 --> 02:57:02,682
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously, ideally, we would want you would want to have like four people on a truck, right?

1714
02:57:02,703 --> 02:57:05,084
[SPEAKER_21]: We have three and we run three people to a truck.

1715
02:57:05,124 --> 02:57:05,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sure.

1716
02:57:06,005 --> 02:57:11,910
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, obviously, at a fire scene and stuff like that, that's gonna help out tremendously with the situation.

1717
02:57:12,450 --> 02:57:24,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you mentioned you talked about grants, but I know that we we lucked out in the FEMA grant because of numbers and then because they won't, they won't fund the department that

1718
02:57:24,979 --> 02:57:26,981
[SPEAKER_10]: are not willing to invest in itself, right?

1719
02:57:27,001 --> 02:57:27,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1720
02:57:27,301 --> 02:57:35,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's what I know that the union president was here and I know Danielle did a great job applying for all these grants, but we had a great opportunity to

1721
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:46,483
[SPEAKER_10]: save our community a lot of money with FEMA, I believe, taking the lead in paying for 10 firefighters for three years, I believe it was.

1722
02:57:47,024 --> 02:57:56,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And then as long as you get the commitment of staffing, and then we would take over the responsibility that we should

1723
02:57:56,947 --> 02:57:59,629
[SPEAKER_10]: and staffing a minimal by department, right?

1724
02:57:59,709 --> 02:58:00,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's safe.

1725
02:58:00,790 --> 02:58:02,651
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a safer called the safer grant.

1726
02:58:02,851 --> 02:58:08,095
[SPEAKER_21]: So that thing actually just reopened again, that just went live just a couple days ago.

1727
02:58:08,775 --> 02:58:14,039
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about to go live, but they just put out the information about it about to go live, I believe, like me.

1728
02:58:15,440 --> 02:58:15,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1729
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:22,485
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I bring this up because we're gonna put down to not even level so that we won't even be able to apply for the FEMA.

1730
02:58:22,505 --> 02:58:23,225
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't even do it.

1731
02:58:23,305 --> 02:58:24,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of a waste.

1732
02:58:24,806 --> 02:58:25,587
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see

1733
02:58:27,262 --> 02:58:33,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the cutting of the budget and staffing and severely hurts method chances, right, for winning these grants.

1734
02:58:33,485 --> 02:58:38,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's definitely, it's important that we see this as a community and our leadership team here in Medford.

1735
02:58:39,588 --> 02:58:51,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I revert to, because I know that an article went out, an article went out from Tufts and they asked the mayor some questions.

1736
02:58:51,915 --> 02:58:53,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And the mayor's question was that,

1737
02:58:54,472 --> 02:58:57,614
[SPEAKER_10]: that the fire is resisting change and accountability.

1738
02:58:58,855 --> 02:58:59,736
[SPEAKER_10]: How is the morale?

1739
02:59:00,276 --> 02:59:16,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know that there's a lot going on there with accusations of fraudulent sick time and possible investigators following your firefighters.

1740
02:59:16,127 --> 02:59:18,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how is the staff?

1741
02:59:19,069 --> 02:59:20,350
[SPEAKER_10]: How is the morale of your staff?

1742
02:59:23,581 --> 02:59:29,903
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as the morale of the staff, I've heard conflicting things.

1743
02:59:30,183 --> 02:59:34,165
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there are people that are trying to make the best of everything.

1744
02:59:34,265 --> 02:59:39,827
[SPEAKER_21]: And sure, there's been some grievance issues going on and things like that, sure.

1745
02:59:42,567 --> 02:59:52,811
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, with the low manpower, obviously it gets tough eventually trying to keep up with the amount of runs that Medford has here.

1746
02:59:53,692 --> 02:59:57,033
[SPEAKER_21]: how busy it is, people get tired, people get worn down.

1747
02:59:57,834 --> 03:00:02,936
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, it's going to happen in that and that's going to reflect on morale in some way, of course.

1748
03:00:03,156 --> 03:00:07,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, you make a good point, because I think that was a topic of discussion.

1749
03:00:07,657 --> 03:00:13,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually asked to have you, the leadership team for your union, and the administration,

1750
03:00:15,242 --> 03:00:23,948
[SPEAKER_10]: come to a meeting and then go to executive session so we can actually ask some issues that we've heard so we can, this could be some corrective actions.

1751
03:00:24,488 --> 03:00:32,974
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I'm seeing is that, you know, you said it yourself, understaffing, people are tired, people are run down.

1752
03:00:32,994 --> 03:00:36,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the same people that are taking days off.

1753
03:00:37,067 --> 03:00:38,407
[SPEAKER_10]: and then being accused of.

1754
03:00:39,008 --> 03:00:39,988
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is what this is.

1755
03:00:40,788 --> 03:00:52,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm more concerned with our budget with the lack of staffing and how it's trickling down effect and then being categorized as resisting.

1756
03:00:53,233 --> 03:00:59,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you keep, I just want to stay on the topic that, you know,

1757
03:01:02,008 --> 03:01:13,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I've said it a few times in different departments, and I look at the legal costs that we're seeing at DPW, we're seeing with fire, we're seeing with different unions that we're seeing,

1758
03:01:17,158 --> 03:01:27,223
[SPEAKER_10]: paying representative legal representation for for grievances, then arbitrations, then losing arbitrations, then appealing arbitrations, and then losing again.

1759
03:01:27,243 --> 03:01:30,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're seeing in the biggest thing we're talking about is money.

1760
03:01:31,185 --> 03:01:41,290
[SPEAKER_10]: But these are the reasons, part of the reasons why it's I would love to see our administration try to find a way not to look at it as resistance, but try to work as a partnership

1761
03:01:41,850 --> 03:01:51,038
[SPEAKER_10]: to fix these issues so we can then save these these funds that are going out, you know, useless, just useless use of funding.

1762
03:01:51,098 --> 03:02:01,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So a piece that I'm nervous about, because I have family and, and elderly friends that where I grew up, and engine three, we can't even call it engine three, because we don't have an engine three.

1763
03:02:02,407 --> 03:02:05,349
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means we have no water, correct in the Salem Street area.

1764
03:02:05,870 --> 03:02:06,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1765
03:02:07,132 --> 03:02:11,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So you also brought up that engine four and engine one's taking all this heat.

1766
03:02:11,115 --> 03:02:16,940
[SPEAKER_10]: They're taking it because we don't have staffing for engine three.

1767
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:18,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, engine three would lighten the load.

1768
03:02:19,442 --> 03:02:23,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I gather, that was a necessity.

1769
03:02:23,064 --> 03:02:34,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that you don't want that, but I know it's a necessity for the fact that to take some of the pressure away from overtime, because it's a lot of money, that we have to shut down an engine

1770
03:02:35,043 --> 03:02:38,326
[SPEAKER_10]: and use that team to fill in gaps for overtime.

1771
03:02:39,167 --> 03:02:41,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that, that's what I've been told, is that?

1772
03:02:41,610 --> 03:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_21]: It's because the 23 minimum manning, but we only have like 23 or 24 people in the group.

1773
03:02:48,358 --> 03:02:49,259
[SPEAKER_21]: just because of the manning.

1774
03:02:49,279 --> 03:02:54,181
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the, you would have to have at least 26 in the group to put engine three in service.

1775
03:02:54,441 --> 03:02:54,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1776
03:02:55,002 --> 03:03:06,628
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's, but of course, like if there's vacation or sick again, sick time or anything like that, you, you, you rarely ever going to have right with these levels, you cannot get to the 26 people to put that truck in service.

1777
03:03:07,189 --> 03:03:09,530
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, so why aren't we, why aren't we,

1778
03:03:10,418 --> 03:03:12,379
[SPEAKER_10]: You're our leader, right?

1779
03:03:12,499 --> 03:03:18,282
[SPEAKER_10]: You came up and gave us a breakdown, but why aren't you telling us this is what we need, City Council?

1780
03:03:18,742 --> 03:03:26,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we can't give it to you, but I think the public has to understand that sure, there are faults in the school departments.

1781
03:03:26,946 --> 03:03:30,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, there are some problems with DPW.

1782
03:03:30,388 --> 03:03:32,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, this is public safety.

1783
03:03:32,569 --> 03:03:37,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And from what I'm hearing is that it's gonna get to a point where I'm nervous because

1784
03:03:39,030 --> 03:03:44,993
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done an amazing job with some pretty big fires and your team has done an amazing job.

1785
03:03:45,493 --> 03:03:52,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just, I don't want to get to a point to say, geez, we knew this, but we didn't do what needed to be done as a city.

1786
03:03:53,036 --> 03:03:56,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's important.

1787
03:03:57,078 --> 03:04:01,360
[SPEAKER_21]: The problem is the department has always done incredibly well with very limited things.

1788
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:01,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1789
03:04:02,757 --> 03:04:07,778
[SPEAKER_21]: gauging fleets and gauging equipment and they make the best of it and they do a great job with it.

1790
03:04:08,158 --> 03:04:10,259
[SPEAKER_21]: So they all do a great job at any fire scene.

1791
03:04:10,739 --> 03:04:14,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are the resistant union members.

1792
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:21,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, then we, this, the community listened to your firefighters, the rank and file.

1793
03:04:22,201 --> 03:04:24,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe they listened to Chief Friedman when he came out and spoke.

1794
03:04:24,762 --> 03:04:31,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think when I talked to a lot of people, when it came to the debt exclusion for the fire station, I think the non-involvement

1795
03:04:32,602 --> 03:04:40,205
[SPEAKER_10]: and the final stage and the limitations of that new station really spoke volumes that the community voted it down.

1796
03:04:40,925 --> 03:04:42,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And I haven't heard anything.

1797
03:04:43,246 --> 03:04:47,908
[SPEAKER_10]: We're both with a new fire station and a training tower.

1798
03:04:48,208 --> 03:04:49,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any updates or anything with that?

1799
03:04:50,409 --> 03:04:55,871
[SPEAKER_21]: No, there's still water coming in through my windows in my office, leaking all over the floor and the fire prevention and everything else.

1800
03:04:55,911 --> 03:04:58,592
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in a building that's basically it's

1801
03:05:00,803 --> 03:05:02,903
[SPEAKER_21]: decrepit building, the roof is leaking.

1802
03:05:02,963 --> 03:05:14,605
[SPEAKER_21]: And they did a quick little patch on that to try to keep a room from leaking water in there with right now some important computer equipment and things like that is trying to make this building survive.

1803
03:05:14,665 --> 03:05:18,206
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the heating system was probably going to go on the fritz eventually soon.

1804
03:05:18,666 --> 03:05:20,546
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to be in a world of trouble there.

1805
03:05:20,606 --> 03:05:25,387
[SPEAKER_21]: But when there's no new headquarters on the right now, I know you're the chief and it's a hot seat.

1806
03:05:25,647 --> 03:05:29,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just you have to take the brunt of it.

1807
03:05:29,188 --> 03:05:29,308
[SPEAKER_10]: But

1808
03:05:29,991 --> 03:05:39,097
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, in your presentation, you didn't, you didn't say anything about the headquarters chief, but you had to wait for, I had to say something so we could talk about what's a huge issue.

1809
03:05:39,198 --> 03:05:40,438
[SPEAKER_21]: We know what happened with the vote.

1810
03:05:40,619 --> 03:05:41,619
[SPEAKER_21]: What am I going to say about it?

1811
03:05:41,679 --> 03:05:43,200
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have a new headquarters.

1812
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:43,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1813
03:05:43,521 --> 03:05:49,765
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the leadership team doing to move our city forward to make sure that we're going to a next step?

1814
03:05:50,365 --> 03:05:55,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's looking at a debt exclusion in the future for what's truly needed, right?

1815
03:05:55,749 --> 03:05:56,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Obviously that's,

1816
03:05:57,557 --> 03:06:01,499
[SPEAKER_21]: The only way you're going to see something happen, but there's nothing on the horizon right now.

1817
03:06:02,099 --> 03:06:03,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that got shot down.

1818
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:04,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well.

1819
03:06:05,961 --> 03:06:12,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Deservedly so, but I look at and, you know, I know that you mentioned the peer support team because I've talked to some young firefighters.

1820
03:06:13,205 --> 03:06:16,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, that's spearheaded by a union, correct?

1821
03:06:16,206 --> 03:06:24,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know the union takes their brothers and sisters, the new brothers and sisters say, hey, listen, they might not be here, this, that and the other thing, but we're going to take that peer

1822
03:06:24,976 --> 03:06:30,757
[SPEAKER_10]: peer leadership and we're going to take control of it to make sure that we're teaching our fellow brothers and sisters firefighters.

1823
03:06:30,957 --> 03:06:32,378
[SPEAKER_21]: This is what I've been asking people.

1824
03:06:32,538 --> 03:06:34,718
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been trying to encourage people to get engaged with it.

1825
03:06:34,738 --> 03:06:42,720
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've been telling them, we got to, you got to reduce that stigma out there across fire departments and other places that people are afraid to seek help.

1826
03:06:42,980 --> 03:06:43,840
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't be like that.

1827
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:48,942
[SPEAKER_21]: People need to, if they have a tough call, they see some terrible things, awful things that stick with you forever.

1828
03:06:49,422 --> 03:06:54,123
[SPEAKER_21]: And they need to seek out help and it has to be welcome and encouraged to do so.

1829
03:06:55,243 --> 03:06:59,946
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what we want, and that's what we're working towards now, and it's going forward.

1830
03:07:01,588 --> 03:07:07,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I, for one, City Councilor, I think this is one of the biggest pieces that I find very disturbing.

1831
03:07:07,852 --> 03:07:15,237
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a secret that I haven't been supporting what's been happening with the firefighters, the union, and the fire headquarters, the tower.

1832
03:07:16,538 --> 03:07:21,161
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we're just glossing over things, but there are some serious, serious concerns here.

1833
03:07:21,801 --> 03:07:23,923
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something that

1834
03:07:24,750 --> 03:07:32,075
[SPEAKER_10]: as we meet with the mayor as we move forward, that there has to be something that has to be earmarked to our fire stations.

1835
03:07:32,135 --> 03:07:42,542
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can find a piece of land in the city or something like that, where we can try to look for a grant or something to get some kind of like, they have conics boxes type of things that you can build a training facility.

1836
03:07:43,282 --> 03:07:44,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Auburn has an incredible one.

1837
03:07:44,803 --> 03:07:46,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that trickle down effect.

1838
03:07:46,644 --> 03:07:52,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I talked to members of the state board, fire board, and I get some numbers from them.

1839
03:07:52,827 --> 03:08:02,710
[SPEAKER_10]: and to get these wishes, if you're not showing that we're maintaining minimal safe levels of force, then we're not gonna get these grants.

1840
03:08:03,511 --> 03:08:11,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, common sense says if your own city isn't gonna commit to it, why should an outside agency give you money to do it?

1841
03:08:11,613 --> 03:08:14,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And at least that's what my homework has shown me.

1842
03:08:15,234 --> 03:08:22,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm frustrated because since the debt exclusion failure,

1843
03:08:24,043 --> 03:08:24,744
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't heard much.

1844
03:08:26,225 --> 03:08:26,965
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't heard much.

1845
03:08:27,125 --> 03:08:49,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And then today you have retirees contacting me that saw this Facebook post about the mayor's article in the Tufts Daily and, you know, making a point that say that the firefighters with this whole process, that again, that they're resistant.

1846
03:08:50,621 --> 03:08:51,902
[SPEAKER_10]: to change in accountability.

1847
03:08:52,302 --> 03:08:53,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen that article.

1848
03:08:53,443 --> 03:08:55,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just I'll let you know, I'll forward it to you.

1849
03:08:55,684 --> 03:08:58,545
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's so that's what the question was about the unions.

1850
03:08:59,026 --> 03:09:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said, well, the union, the fire and teams is just don't want change in accountability.

1851
03:09:03,708 --> 03:09:07,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how do you want change in accountability when you're struggling as hard as they are?

1852
03:09:07,930 --> 03:09:15,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, I don't even think residents know because my my neighbors didn't know that we don't have water on on Salem Street.

1853
03:09:16,114 --> 03:09:17,795
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we call it engine three, we have no engine.

1854
03:09:18,488 --> 03:09:29,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I mean, these are things that if people hear what it is cheap as a leader, and they see these things, people are going to stand up and say, Okay, well, maybe we do need a debt exclusion.

1855
03:09:29,832 --> 03:09:31,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we do show us.

1856
03:09:32,035 --> 03:09:35,376
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that since it failed, everybody's moving on.

1857
03:09:35,436 --> 03:09:42,159
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not talking about something we definitely need down the line, which is looking at a new high school, refurbished high school.

1858
03:09:42,179 --> 03:09:44,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I can never say you're looking at a new one.

1859
03:09:44,340 --> 03:10:01,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's gonna happen, but at least try to stop moving things forward when we talk about our fire department, because I don't wanna be the one, God forbid, that says, I told you so, when one of our firefighters or one of our residents lost their lives because we didn't have enough staffing.

1860
03:10:02,596 --> 03:10:05,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I appreciate you listening.

1861
03:10:05,598 --> 03:10:12,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very passionate about this because I've gone, I've stood up for our firefighters for a long time now.

1862
03:10:12,803 --> 03:10:15,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I hate to be rude.

1863
03:10:15,225 --> 03:10:25,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I was supposed to be gone 45 minutes ago, but I just, if you have any response or anything that you want me to ask, I'll stick around for that.

1864
03:10:25,493 --> 03:10:28,955
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know Zach doesn't want to hear me anymore, so thank you.

1865
03:10:30,403 --> 03:10:39,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember my first words, eight minutes after we knew that question six had failed, we're coming back for a fire station.

1866
03:10:39,586 --> 03:10:43,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm one who will vote the debt exclusion Tuesday night if it's proposed.

1867
03:10:48,272 --> 03:10:52,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I also actually need to step out, so I'm being rude as well.

1868
03:10:52,393 --> 03:10:55,254
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to thank you for the presentation.

1869
03:10:55,274 --> 03:10:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple of minor questions, but I might just send them over email.

1870
03:10:58,555 --> 03:11:00,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate the work that you're doing.

1871
03:11:01,055 --> 03:11:09,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot that our department needs from a staffing, a capital, and other perspectives.

1872
03:11:09,278 --> 03:11:14,359
[SPEAKER_02]: So just really appreciate the challenge that you're facing and the work that you need to do.

1873
03:11:15,199 --> 03:11:28,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for being open and transparent and I really appreciate the presentation that you're focusing on, you know, really showing here a bunch of key goals here are some things that are not being funded and this is what they would cost.

1874
03:11:30,250 --> 03:11:44,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those bigger questions that involve us and the mayor and everyone else, you know, maybe those are not able to be addressed, but I'm hoping that some of those one-time things around dive team and the drone team that really could improve your operational ability.

1875
03:11:45,200 --> 03:11:49,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems mostly based on one-time costs that those are some things we might be able to move forward with much more quickly.

1876
03:11:50,243 --> 03:11:50,703
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1877
03:11:51,304 --> 03:11:57,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to turn it over to Vice President Collins to take the chair, if that's all right with you.

1878
03:11:57,628 --> 03:11:57,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1879
03:11:57,988 --> 03:11:59,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And my apologies, Chief.

1880
03:12:03,713 --> 03:12:05,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to my colleagues.

1881
03:12:20,815 --> 03:12:27,258
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing no additional hands raised from other councillors, I'll just briefly state, thank you for your presentation.

1882
03:12:27,778 --> 03:12:33,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Very thorough as befits the incredibly complicated charge of your leadership and your department.

1883
03:12:34,060 --> 03:12:35,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much for the thorough overview.

1884
03:12:36,642 --> 03:12:37,802
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, no problem.

1885
03:12:41,283 --> 03:12:44,525
[SPEAKER_20]: I think to the conversation that we were just having, I really appreciate your candor.

1886
03:12:44,565 --> 03:12:49,767
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that your presentation and your communication throughout the year do a really good job of

1887
03:12:51,107 --> 03:13:03,493
[SPEAKER_20]: illuminating the work that your department is doing all the time and outlining those future needs in those areas where it's not that, not areas where you want to improve, but where areas where the community needs our fire department to improve.

1888
03:13:03,573 --> 03:13:15,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And for myself as one counselor, I don't think it's necessarily fair to say to the leader of a department, you know, you must identify the path forward and also how to fund it.

1889
03:13:15,799 --> 03:13:16,400
[SPEAKER_20]: That is our job.

1890
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:18,481
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's,

1891
03:13:22,223 --> 03:13:28,191
[SPEAKER_20]: community and other branches of government need to collaborate on how to meet the needs that our department heads identify.

1892
03:13:28,211 --> 03:13:29,533
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you've done a very good job of that.

1893
03:13:32,577 --> 03:13:35,821
[SPEAKER_20]: And I appreciate your continuing clarity in telling us

1894
03:13:36,881 --> 03:13:39,462
[SPEAKER_20]: what are the capital and operating needs that we really do need to fund.

1895
03:13:39,522 --> 03:13:40,742
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, it's not discretionary.

1896
03:13:40,782 --> 03:13:41,502
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not, we want this.

1897
03:13:41,602 --> 03:13:49,665
[SPEAKER_20]: It's things that we know that we need from the reports of fire department employees and things that we know we need to keep up with best practices for keeping people safe in Medford.

1898
03:13:50,565 --> 03:13:54,586
[SPEAKER_20]: So just for myself as one counselor, this is not a, this is an operational budget hearing.

1899
03:13:55,046 --> 03:13:56,107
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not talking about overrides.

1900
03:13:56,127 --> 03:14:01,068
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not talking about debt exclusions, but we know that there are certain things that we continue to need that could have been funded.

1901
03:14:01,848 --> 03:14:11,191
[SPEAKER_20]: with mechanisms outside of the standard operating budget, and I continue to feel that we should do those to give your staff and the people of Medford the quality public service that they deserve.

1902
03:14:11,251 --> 03:14:18,154
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for continuing to tell us what those things are, and I hope that we are able to fund them very soon.

1903
03:14:18,334 --> 03:14:19,414
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what the community deserves.

1904
03:14:20,734 --> 03:14:22,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lazaro, go ahead.

1905
03:14:24,376 --> 03:14:25,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I said I wasn't going to talk.

1906
03:14:25,416 --> 03:14:25,876
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

1907
03:14:25,916 --> 03:14:26,856
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already nine o'clock.

1908
03:14:27,097 --> 03:14:29,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize to my colleagues.

1909
03:14:29,137 --> 03:14:29,938
[SPEAKER_18]: I have

1910
03:14:32,171 --> 03:14:46,857
[SPEAKER_18]: really appreciated getting to know Chief Evans a little bit and talking to you about the ways that we can improve the fire department short of the debt exclusion which failed.

1911
03:14:46,877 --> 03:14:50,478
[SPEAKER_18]: The debt exclusion would have paid for a new

1912
03:14:51,388 --> 03:14:52,128
[SPEAKER_18]: our headquarters.

1913
03:14:54,210 --> 03:14:59,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Short of that, because it went to the voters and it failed, we talked about a dive team.

1914
03:14:59,813 --> 03:15:09,339
[SPEAKER_18]: It was not included in this budget, however, because many of those costs are potentially one-time costs that would eventually need to be updated over time.

1915
03:15:09,479 --> 03:15:18,905
[SPEAKER_18]: I do think that there is potential, and I've spoken to the mayor about it, that there is potential once this budget is passed for it to be paid for through other

1916
03:15:20,466 --> 03:15:23,927
[SPEAKER_18]: strategies, other mechanisms that the city has.

1917
03:15:24,488 --> 03:15:26,708
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't think that that's totally off the table.

1918
03:15:26,828 --> 03:15:28,289
[SPEAKER_18]: I also didn't know about the drone thing.

1919
03:15:28,309 --> 03:15:29,189
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds amazing.

1920
03:15:29,209 --> 03:15:41,573
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's even less expensive and seems like a really wonderful opportunity to take advantage of technology that we should be taking advantage of anyway.

1921
03:15:42,353 --> 03:15:43,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Public safety is

1922
03:15:45,091 --> 03:16:06,681
[SPEAKER_18]: especially important right now I think for people in localities to take advantage of we are partners in government, and we shouldn't be seeing each other in any way as adversaries we're all working together to take care of each other and protect each other and use each other as the people that

1923
03:16:09,738 --> 03:16:15,603
[SPEAKER_18]: work as a team to maintain the kind of community that we want to live in.

1924
03:16:15,744 --> 03:16:18,466
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think you've been such a great partner in that.

1925
03:16:18,746 --> 03:16:28,916
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just really appreciate all that you do and the thoroughness with which you approach this presentation and all of the things that you're willing to look into.

1926
03:16:29,476 --> 03:16:33,180
[SPEAKER_18]: And the way that you really appreciate your fire department, your

1927
03:16:36,022 --> 03:16:44,424
[SPEAKER_18]: team's willingness to see somebody that, it's just like what I was talking about with Kevin Bailey.

1928
03:16:44,884 --> 03:16:46,904
[SPEAKER_18]: He really cares about water safety.

1929
03:16:46,944 --> 03:16:53,886
[SPEAKER_18]: He really cares about making sure that kids are learning how to swim, that people in our community are learning how to swim, and you're coming at it from the other direction.

1930
03:16:53,946 --> 03:17:02,628
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, protect people before something bad happens, and you're here to protect people if something bad does happen, and not having to wait for the bad thing to happen.

1931
03:17:03,528 --> 03:17:07,531
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's the same thing that we do when we look at our streets.

1932
03:17:07,691 --> 03:17:16,398
[SPEAKER_18]: We're keeping the streets safe, and we're also trying to make sure that enforcement is happening, and the roads are paved so that the cars are not bouncing around.

1933
03:17:16,538 --> 03:17:20,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything has to happen all at once, and we're all working in partnership with each other.

1934
03:17:21,281 --> 03:17:31,989
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's frustrating when we don't have an endless supply of money to do this with, but when we're all paying attention and in good faith, trying to do these things in partnership, that's how

1935
03:17:33,011 --> 03:17:41,648
[SPEAKER_18]: community is built successfully, and I do think that there are ways to do this as long as we stay focused and collaborative.

1936
03:17:43,584 --> 03:17:44,144
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.

1937
03:17:44,164 --> 03:17:57,393
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that everything that, and this applies to all of these, I don't think that everything that we didn't get that we were hoping for, hoping to see in these line items means that they're not happening.

1938
03:17:57,654 --> 03:18:02,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe some of the things are one-time items that doesn't make sense to be in the budget right now.

1939
03:18:02,577 --> 03:18:04,678
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes sense to come after June.

1940
03:18:06,019 --> 03:18:07,841
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, you know, we can see it again.

1941
03:18:08,681 --> 03:18:11,123
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's training, it gets folded in in a different way.

1942
03:18:13,837 --> 03:18:16,078
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate all of the things that you said.

1943
03:18:16,378 --> 03:18:17,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for your presentation.

1944
03:18:17,679 --> 03:18:22,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I look forward to everything we'll talk about in June and July.

1945
03:18:23,122 --> 03:18:23,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1946
03:18:23,722 --> 03:18:24,063
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1947
03:18:28,445 --> 03:18:30,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional comments from Councillors?

1948
03:18:31,507 --> 03:18:31,767
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1949
03:18:32,868 --> 03:18:37,791
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional, actually, I'm sorry, as I took over the chair, I need to open the Zoom to see if there are comments on Zoom.

1950
03:18:57,982 --> 03:18:58,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me into the zoom place.

1951
03:18:59,047 --> 03:18:59,288
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

1952
03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:13,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for bearing with me.

1953
03:19:14,521 --> 03:19:18,962
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we'll go next to public participation on this item.

1954
03:19:19,442 --> 03:19:23,644
[SPEAKER_20]: All participants will have three minutes to speak.

1955
03:19:23,664 --> 03:19:25,184
[SPEAKER_20]: You can speak on Zoom or at the podium.

1956
03:19:25,604 --> 03:19:27,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Going first to Zoom.

1957
03:19:29,606 --> 03:19:31,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

1958
03:19:31,887 --> 03:19:33,867
[SPEAKER_20]: And you will have three minutes.

1959
03:19:33,907 --> 03:19:34,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Danielle.

1960
03:19:34,488 --> 03:19:34,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

1961
03:19:34,728 --> 03:19:38,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, can you hear me?

1962
03:19:39,069 --> 03:19:39,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, please go ahead.

1963
03:19:39,890 --> 03:19:40,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1964
03:19:40,650 --> 03:19:44,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Daniel Marcelino, Levin Spencer wrote on the fire union president.

1965
03:19:45,254 --> 03:19:53,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to comment on the fact that the staffing level is being cut, that they're dropping our staffing level down by two firefighters.

1966
03:19:55,062 --> 03:20:01,007
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of incredibly disappointing to hear that it was just it was actually not even mentioned in the chief's presentation.

1967
03:20:01,027 --> 03:20:05,871
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's just kind of grazed over in the in like all the comments afterwards.

1968
03:20:06,912 --> 03:20:19,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Anytime staffing level is dropped that the in trying to get that back is almost impossible in the future If you go and look at the table that the chief had put on his presentation that shows the staffing levels going back to like 2012

1969
03:20:22,215 --> 03:20:43,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year when we were setting up for the grant for the personnel we had noticed I looked at the overtime spendage like the overtime shifts when compared to the actual numbers of Firefighters on the floor when our numbers were up in the 125 range our overtime was incredibly low when compared to what we have right now so

1970
03:20:44,145 --> 03:20:55,474
[SPEAKER_15]: to see that we're going to be cutting personnel and never have the opportunity to get to that point, to me, makes no sense if overtime is such a big issue with the mayor and in the department budget.

1971
03:20:56,315 --> 03:21:06,663
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, and, you know, to say that the morale is low because of the call, the number of calls that were going on, that our morale is low because our staffing is low.

1972
03:21:06,983 --> 03:21:12,707
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more work with less hands and then we're constantly at battle with

1973
03:21:13,488 --> 03:21:16,654
[SPEAKER_15]: the city and the administration and everything else like that.

1974
03:21:16,795 --> 03:21:24,008
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, our morale is not the result of the runs and the calls that were going on with our community.

1975
03:21:26,135 --> 03:21:42,283
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would like to, I mean, if there was ever anything that I would ever ask anybody else to do or the counselors to push for, I would say if we could push to keep maintain those two numbers, because otherwise, if we keep slipping year after year, we're never going to be able to staff the department in general.

1976
03:21:42,363 --> 03:21:46,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we're not going to be able to hit that minimum minimum manning of 23 on the floor sooner or later.

1977
03:21:46,826 --> 03:21:51,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, as far as working towards headquarters, I'd love to hear about a new headquarters.

1978
03:21:52,009 --> 03:21:53,669
[SPEAKER_15]: We would love to collaborate on that.

1979
03:21:55,090 --> 03:22:04,534
[SPEAKER_15]: The former plan that we talked about in the fall was just severely lacking in so many different places.

1980
03:22:04,554 --> 03:22:11,237
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, not just what we needed, but actual things that are like by law required.

1981
03:22:11,838 --> 03:22:15,759
[SPEAKER_15]: So, if going forward, I'd love to talk about it.

1982
03:22:15,879 --> 03:22:16,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we had

1983
03:22:17,120 --> 03:22:21,781
[SPEAKER_15]: It had been, you know, mentioned in meetings that I had with the mayor that she was still upset about it.

1984
03:22:21,961 --> 03:22:23,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I get that she's upset about it.

1985
03:22:24,022 --> 03:22:25,022
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're upset about it.

1986
03:22:25,062 --> 03:22:27,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's upset about it, but we need to move forward.

1987
03:22:27,783 --> 03:22:39,847
[SPEAKER_15]: And if talking about headquarters is ever on the horizon, then we'd love to sit down and try to, you know, bring our committee together and put planning, you know, on paper and actually make come to fruition.

1988
03:22:42,868 --> 03:22:43,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1989
03:22:43,328 --> 03:22:44,268
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, Danielle.

1990
03:22:49,879 --> 03:22:52,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any other members of the public who'd wish to speak on this item?

1991
03:22:54,342 --> 03:22:54,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

1992
03:22:54,762 --> 03:22:55,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

1993
03:22:55,923 --> 03:22:56,483
[SPEAKER_20]: You have three minutes.

1994
03:22:57,864 --> 03:22:58,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Robert Jones, 5 St.

1995
03:22:58,705 --> 03:23:00,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Mary Street, Treasurer of the Union.

1996
03:23:00,246 --> 03:23:02,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Just real quick on the dive team that we talked about.

1997
03:23:02,847 --> 03:23:07,030
[SPEAKER_16]: The dive team would be a very good asset to the department.

1998
03:23:07,310 --> 03:23:15,516
[SPEAKER_16]: The drowning that Chief Evans spoke about earlier took place about 20 feet off the Tufts boat dock up at the Mystic Lakes.

1999
03:23:15,956 --> 03:23:19,038
[SPEAKER_16]: When the dive team did show up, they were able to recover them.

2000
03:23:20,061 --> 03:23:25,383
[SPEAKER_16]: the swimmer in minutes, we would have had the equipment and probably the outcome probably would have been drastically different.

2001
03:23:26,383 --> 03:23:28,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Tufts does have two boathouses in City of Medford.

2002
03:23:29,864 --> 03:23:35,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a perfectly reasonable request to have the funding for the dive team come from Tufts.

2003
03:23:36,327 --> 03:23:37,367
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they can afford it.

2004
03:23:37,607 --> 03:23:39,648
[SPEAKER_16]: They have multi-million dollar projects here.

2005
03:23:40,768 --> 03:23:46,290
[SPEAKER_16]: For that matter, we should probably bring someone also to cover those costs.

2006
03:23:46,350 --> 03:23:48,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have an updated number on the dive team?

2007
03:23:51,622 --> 03:23:52,682
[SPEAKER_16]: So they do have that.

2008
03:23:52,862 --> 03:23:53,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it, what is it?

2009
03:23:55,004 --> 03:23:53,523
120,000.

2010
03:23:55,024 --> 03:23:58,006
[SPEAKER_16]: 120,000.

2011
03:23:55,104 --> 03:23:58,006
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about what it was last time we looked into it.

2012
03:23:58,026 --> 03:24:01,729
[SPEAKER_16]: It's mainly the one-time cost, the certifications and the equipment.

2013
03:24:02,750 --> 03:24:04,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Like Chief said, some training.

2014
03:24:05,371 --> 03:24:07,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Upkeep would be on the overtime side.

2015
03:24:08,394 --> 03:24:12,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's a reasonable and grantable request from Tufts University.

2016
03:24:12,877 --> 03:24:16,179
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd be happy to facilitate that in any way possible.

2017
03:24:17,200 --> 03:24:20,042
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the overtime and staffing is considered,

2018
03:24:20,727 --> 03:24:30,751
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to have X amount of firefighters on shift at all times, whether they're new firefighters, which we need desperately, or guys hired back on overtime.

2019
03:24:31,732 --> 03:24:34,513
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be about the same on costs.

2020
03:24:34,813 --> 03:24:36,854
[SPEAKER_16]: We need more firefighters and we need better equipment.

2021
03:24:37,855 --> 03:24:41,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like to see a budget, obviously, at least be level funded.

2022
03:24:42,617 --> 03:24:44,597
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the lowest we've had in years.

2023
03:24:44,677 --> 03:24:47,959
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we currently have 104 firefighters on staff, chief.

2024
03:24:50,373 --> 03:24:52,035
[SPEAKER_16]: 104 105.

2025
03:24:50,593 --> 03:24:52,035
[SPEAKER_16]: That's very low.

2026
03:24:52,055 --> 03:24:53,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been on the job 24 years.

2027
03:24:54,056 --> 03:24:58,360
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it hasn't been this low at any point in my career.

2028
03:24:59,201 --> 03:25:11,591
[SPEAKER_16]: So we do need those firefighters and please consider that and consider the grants that we applied for to try to get the federal government to pay for these positions and invest in the city.

2029
03:25:11,991 --> 03:25:12,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2030
03:25:15,714 --> 03:25:16,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

2031
03:25:19,344 --> 03:25:24,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Chief, I think that you spoke to this in brief earlier, but could you just quickly go over the context?

2032
03:25:24,648 --> 03:25:40,581
[SPEAKER_20]: I see the, on the topic of the reduction from 80 budgeted firefighters to 78, was that a strategic decision or is that due to making the numbers work because of the amount allocated from the administration?

2033
03:25:40,601 --> 03:25:43,603
[SPEAKER_21]: That was just what was given to me.

2034
03:25:43,923 --> 03:25:45,104
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, right.

2035
03:25:45,224 --> 03:25:46,706
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I think that this is,

2036
03:25:48,805 --> 03:25:55,832
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that in these discussions and these preliminary budget hearings, especially, we have to remain really clear on where the power lies.

2037
03:25:55,852 --> 03:26:04,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure that if your budget was up to you, we would have the plans for a new fire headquarters and more than two additional firefighters in this budget.

2038
03:26:04,441 --> 03:26:07,484
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be at 135 people and I have four people on the trucks.

2039
03:26:07,544 --> 03:26:08,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, sure.

2040
03:26:08,265 --> 03:26:08,625
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

2041
03:26:08,945 --> 03:26:09,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2042
03:26:13,952 --> 03:26:30,046
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's always the context for how we go forward from the preliminary budget hearings to the negotiations to what the number that we finally arrive at and I just think that's something that's good to remind all participants and the public as we go through this process is the, the allocation is fundamentally decided by the mayor's office.

2043
03:26:31,047 --> 03:26:37,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, our department heads throughout the city, I think, are incredibly good at being resourceful, and I think we hear that over and over in these budget hearings.

2044
03:26:38,213 --> 03:26:44,938
[SPEAKER_20]: But a lot of the decisions come down to making the numbers work, because we are legally not required to be in a deficit as a city.

2045
03:26:46,860 --> 03:26:58,209
[SPEAKER_20]: On the topic of the dive team, because it seems that that is, I'm certain that there is consensus among all parties, councillors, members of the fire department, the fire union, this is something that everybody would very, very much like to see funded.

2046
03:26:59,830 --> 03:27:07,614
[SPEAKER_20]: I as one counselor, I'm always most in favor of things that we value and want to fund coming from our own operating budget.

2047
03:27:07,634 --> 03:27:19,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that is safest, but I do think that this is an area that would be especially appropriate as a form of pilot payment from Tufts University to the city.

2048
03:27:20,220 --> 03:27:28,404
[SPEAKER_20]: This would be outside of our operating budget process, of course, but I would welcome a motion from a counselor, now that I'm chairing, to urge the city administration to include

2049
03:27:29,764 --> 03:27:35,433
[SPEAKER_20]: seed funding for an FEDFIRED Appointment Dive Team as part of our pilot negotiations with Tufts University.

2050
03:27:37,396 --> 03:27:37,576
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

2051
03:27:37,596 --> 03:27:39,179
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was a motion by Councilor Sang.

2052
03:27:39,199 --> 03:27:39,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a second?

2053
03:27:40,200 --> 03:27:41,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Seconded by Councilor Calderon.

2054
03:27:41,242 --> 03:27:41,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2055
03:27:41,542 --> 03:27:43,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2056
03:28:01,607 --> 03:28:16,295
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2057
03:28:17,116 --> 03:28:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: We're taking the motions of the under Yeah, there's only two motions.

2058
03:28:21,138 --> 03:28:21,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, there's a

2059
03:28:29,981 --> 03:28:31,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you want to say something else, Chief?

2060
03:28:31,723 --> 03:28:33,284
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2061
03:28:34,905 --> 03:28:41,090
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other comments from council or city staff or members of the public on the Medford Fire Department budget?

2062
03:28:43,813 --> 03:28:44,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2063
03:28:49,850 --> 03:28:54,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to highlight a number of very important things that are happening here in this budget with the fire department.

2064
03:28:54,674 --> 03:28:57,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make it clear.

2065
03:28:57,316 --> 03:29:11,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there was a very thorough presentation by Chief Evans, but I feel like there's some watering down of what was the great work that's being done and the significant work that's

2066
03:29:13,347 --> 03:29:18,938
[SPEAKER_01]: been put forward for the last year plus at this point to move the department forward.

2067
03:29:22,125 --> 03:29:26,428
[SPEAKER_01]: The chief, the mayor, the human resources director have all collaborated.

2068
03:29:26,508 --> 03:29:28,670
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing on 12 new firefighters.

2069
03:29:29,370 --> 03:29:31,732
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably one of the largest cohorts we've had.

2070
03:29:31,752 --> 03:29:33,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know in how long.

2071
03:29:35,675 --> 03:29:43,521
[SPEAKER_01]: OT, overtime is better since Chief Evans joined the team and became the provisional chief.

2072
03:29:44,061 --> 03:29:45,482
[SPEAKER_01]: and now the permanent chief.

2073
03:29:47,363 --> 03:29:53,207
[SPEAKER_01]: In FY25, overtime actuals totaled just under $2.5 million.

2074
03:29:54,368 --> 03:30:11,118
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a significant change to the way in which things are being managed and the way in which the work is being done to move some of the needles that need to be moved around to accommodate and make room for an improved fire department.

2075
03:30:12,079 --> 03:30:13,180
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that

2076
03:30:14,488 --> 03:30:17,071
[SPEAKER_01]: The men and women of the fire department are not doing a fantastic job.

2077
03:30:17,491 --> 03:30:21,516
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really good work that's being done by our entire fire department.

2078
03:30:22,136 --> 03:30:29,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want there to be any ambiguity as to the significant progress that's been made over the course of the last year plus.

2079
03:30:31,302 --> 03:30:44,989
[SPEAKER_01]: We, as this council knows, as the public knows, who's had the opportunity to follow along these budget meetings, we had major financial constraints this fiscal year.

2080
03:30:45,729 --> 03:30:51,232
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the context of the discussion that's taken place today regarding the fire department, I think it's worth mentioning.

2081
03:30:51,712 --> 03:30:57,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We had approximately a million dollars in additional costs for the waste management contract.

2082
03:30:58,375 --> 03:30:58,816
[SPEAKER_01]: We had,

2083
03:30:59,996 --> 03:31:03,037
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately 2.5 million if my memory serves me correctly.

2084
03:31:03,057 --> 03:31:10,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was a 10% increase, but I might be mistaken on the numbers in terms of the health insurance increases.

2085
03:31:11,320 --> 03:31:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had significant increases, and I'm sure there are ones that I'm not immediately remembering.

2086
03:31:17,982 --> 03:31:22,904
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also say that, you know, we are, we have been

2087
03:31:23,364 --> 03:31:39,879
[SPEAKER_01]: working very diligently and hard to ensure that we give support and priority to all 25 departments of the city, but that means some resources go here some resources go there and we can only allocate so many resources, because there's a finite budget, and there's a finite pie, so to speak.

2088
03:31:41,420 --> 03:31:45,903
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire department's budget is going up over 4%.

2089
03:31:46,704 --> 03:31:50,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want that to be lost in the discussion that's taking place tonight.

2090
03:31:51,067 --> 03:31:55,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have any further comments, but I'm happy to answer any questions if the Council has any for me.

2091
03:31:58,893 --> 03:31:59,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Chief of Staff.

2092
03:32:00,294 --> 03:32:01,835
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional questions from Councillors?

2093
03:32:04,577 --> 03:32:05,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none, it's been a long night.

2094
03:32:05,638 --> 03:32:06,739
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we should let the Chief get out of here.

2095
03:32:10,041 --> 03:32:10,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Any final comments?

2096
03:32:13,287 --> 03:32:13,867
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll say thank you.

2097
03:32:14,728 --> 03:32:15,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much for your presentation.

2098
03:32:15,969 --> 03:32:17,590
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for hanging with us till 9 24.

2099
03:32:18,970 --> 03:32:19,391
[SPEAKER_20]: Anytime.

2100
03:32:19,431 --> 03:32:20,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

2101
03:32:21,132 --> 03:32:21,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

2102
03:32:21,692 --> 03:32:23,773
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2103
03:32:23,813 --> 03:32:27,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we're on to our last topic for this hearing.

2104
03:32:28,496 --> 03:32:29,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you again, Chief.

2105
03:32:30,317 --> 03:32:35,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, that would be insurance, pensions and bonds and interest.

2106
03:32:39,622 --> 03:32:40,063
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome up.

2107
03:32:40,503 --> 03:32:40,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome up.

2108
03:32:40,963 --> 03:32:42,444
[SPEAKER_20]: Finance director extraordinaire.

2109
03:33:04,741 --> 03:33:05,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

2110
03:33:06,942 --> 03:33:09,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the most boring part of the night.

2111
03:33:10,143 --> 03:33:15,885
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to ask you just at the beginning to boost that microphone because we want to hear every single word that you have to say.

2112
03:33:16,706 --> 03:33:17,146
[SPEAKER_20]: All righty.

2113
03:33:21,787 --> 03:33:23,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do we want to go first?

2114
03:33:25,109 --> 03:33:25,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Dealer's choice.

2115
03:33:26,509 --> 03:33:28,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, bonds and interest, we have to pay that.

2116
03:33:29,782 --> 03:33:30,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

2117
03:33:30,863 --> 03:33:34,385
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing new on either score, really.

2118
03:33:35,006 --> 03:33:38,848
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what that is.

2119
03:33:39,429 --> 03:33:42,130
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you able to give us just a top line overview of the numbers that we're looking at?

2120
03:33:43,471 --> 03:33:47,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you able to walk us through just a top line overview of the numbers that we're looking at for bonds and interest?

2121
03:33:51,076 --> 03:33:51,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2122
03:34:00,970 --> 03:34:02,151
[SPEAKER_08]: the easiest one here.

2123
03:34:09,373 --> 03:34:25,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, actually, currently, the city has $74 million in outstanding that as of June 30th 2024.

2124
03:34:31,074 --> 03:34:37,578
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know how much detail you want on this.

2125
03:34:39,059 --> 03:34:39,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

2126
03:34:39,800 --> 03:34:46,004
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's just helpful for councillors maybe any members of the public who don't have the sheets in front of them just to have like a general bird's eye view.

2127
03:34:46,484 --> 03:34:46,944
[SPEAKER_20]: I see.

2128
03:34:49,083 --> 03:35:02,165
[SPEAKER_20]: a very moderate reduction in proposed budget for fiscal year 26 compared to our costs for budgeted costs for fiscal year 25 for both the general fund debt service and water and sewer fund debt service.

2129
03:35:03,646 --> 03:35:08,727
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think this is fairly static interest rates on a lot of longstanding debts.

2130
03:35:08,787 --> 03:35:09,707
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that roughly correct?

2131
03:35:10,007 --> 03:35:13,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, the interest rate on longstanding that does not change.

2132
03:35:13,748 --> 03:35:15,308
[SPEAKER_08]: This year we retired some debt.

2133
03:35:17,858 --> 03:35:23,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Water, sewer, you know, water, sewer debt, actually, there isn't a lot of interest.

2134
03:35:23,863 --> 03:35:27,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 71,000 in interest and 1665 in principal.

2135
03:35:29,328 --> 03:35:32,991
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of funding for the general fund debt out of the revolving funds.

2136
03:35:33,011 --> 03:35:35,894
[SPEAKER_08]: 2026 interest for the general fund is 1.8 million.

2137
03:35:39,087 --> 03:35:40,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And principal is 3.24.

2138
03:35:42,990 --> 03:35:46,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be retiring some more debt next year.

2139
03:35:46,352 --> 03:35:51,616
[SPEAKER_08]: But nothing big is coming off, I don't think, until 2028 or so.

2140
03:35:52,737 --> 03:36:00,663
[SPEAKER_08]: But at that point in time, obviously, we'll be looking at the debt for the HVAC project at schools.

2141
03:36:00,683 --> 03:36:02,584
[SPEAKER_08]: 2028 is when that comes online?

2142
03:36:02,604 --> 03:36:03,425
[SPEAKER_20]: 2028 is when that comes online?

2143
03:36:07,227 --> 03:36:22,834
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll be looking at short-term interest costs in fiscal 2027, roughly a million dollars, and then in fiscal 2028, we'll be looking at about 1.56, depending on how the interest rates run.

2144
03:36:23,914 --> 03:36:33,799
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll just put in the long-term forecast, and that's what we have to pay.

2145
03:36:35,079 --> 03:36:35,339
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2146
03:36:35,379 --> 03:36:36,500
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

2147
03:36:38,428 --> 03:36:39,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

2148
03:36:40,169 --> 03:36:46,911
[SPEAKER_11]: How many different pieces of debt do we have that end at different times?

2149
03:36:50,072 --> 03:36:58,034
[SPEAKER_08]: That depends on how you, we have, I mean, I can send it all to you if you'd like.

2150
03:36:58,074 --> 03:36:59,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Three years at 100.

2151
03:37:01,195 --> 03:37:06,097
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, right now we have debt from fiscal,

2152
03:37:07,096 --> 03:37:17,224
[SPEAKER_08]: They're cut up in, for instance, the fiscal 2020 debt is public library construction, middle school roof for Andrews, Harris Park, and sidewalk.

2153
03:37:17,884 --> 03:37:23,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's, I don't know, there's probably about 60 or 70 lines worth of different debt.

2154
03:37:25,030 --> 03:37:34,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And in any given bond issuance, there can be different times depending on how

2155
03:37:35,559 --> 03:37:39,345
[SPEAKER_08]: longer legally allowed to borrow for for things.

2156
03:37:40,526 --> 03:37:47,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So it may be, you know, in a single issuance, you may have stuff that's 10 year debt, you may have stuff that's 30 year debt.

2157
03:37:51,283 --> 03:37:59,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see if it's 60 things, and I don't know if you could, you know.

2158
03:37:59,446 --> 03:38:11,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mean like asking me right now, but if we could just have it emailed, that would be really interesting and useful to understand sort of when it's gonna get retired, when different pieces of it are gonna get retired.

2159
03:38:11,910 --> 03:38:12,410
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be useful.

2160
03:38:13,830 --> 03:38:14,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

2161
03:38:16,791 --> 03:38:17,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Councilor Kellyanne.

2162
03:38:20,252 --> 03:38:27,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other questions from councillors on the debt service overview?

2163
03:38:33,535 --> 03:38:38,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none, essentially what we're looking at is a forecast for fiscal year 26 that looks

2164
03:38:41,028 --> 03:38:44,189
[SPEAKER_20]: much the same as our budgeted totals for fiscal year 25.

2165
03:38:44,869 --> 03:38:45,610
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the overview.

2166
03:38:46,650 --> 03:38:53,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Going next, unless I see no public participation on this budget, so I'll go next to the insurance budget.

2167
03:38:54,733 --> 03:39:02,976
[SPEAKER_20]: And just a question for you, Bob, does the insurance budget also cover budget for pensions, or is that separate?

2168
03:39:02,996 --> 03:39:04,336
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't see a sheet for pension.

2169
03:39:04,996 --> 03:39:06,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Pensions is a separate budget.

2170
03:39:07,795 --> 03:39:15,937
[SPEAKER_08]: This is insurance costs for, this is mostly driven by the GIC healthcare costs.

2171
03:39:16,518 --> 03:39:27,881
[SPEAKER_08]: It also includes the dental and the life insurance, the contributions by the city for that, money for unemployment and Medicare and city Medicare school.

2172
03:39:29,501 --> 03:39:33,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Also insurance payments, it's pretty much spelled out on the,

2173
03:39:36,615 --> 03:39:39,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you can see that on the on the attachment.

2174
03:39:39,759 --> 03:39:39,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2175
03:39:39,999 --> 03:39:45,424
[SPEAKER_08]: But the big the big one here, obviously, is the G I C is projected to go up.

2176
03:39:46,666 --> 03:39:51,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is group Insurance Commission, which is what pays for the health care.

2177
03:39:51,911 --> 03:39:52,251
[SPEAKER_08]: For the

2178
03:40:00,333 --> 03:40:04,396
[SPEAKER_08]: For statewide, that's actually not bad for the GIC.

2179
03:40:04,436 --> 03:40:12,422
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen, I've heard from other communities where it's going up as much as 18% in the smaller communities, actually.

2180
03:40:14,003 --> 03:40:22,569
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of communities that are actually now going for actual two and a half overrides just to pay for health insurance.

2181
03:40:26,328 --> 03:40:30,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just, you know, that's what they're charging us.

2182
03:40:31,790 --> 03:40:32,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a bit of a jump.

2183
03:40:33,230 --> 03:40:36,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been looking at this for the last few years.

2184
03:40:37,091 --> 03:40:40,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone up 5%, 6% in the last two years.

2185
03:40:41,032 --> 03:40:42,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Before that, it was much less than that.

2186
03:40:44,452 --> 03:40:48,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're just going to have to see what happens with the GIC.

2187
03:40:48,073 --> 03:40:50,974
[SPEAKER_20]: It's quite a frustrating situation.

2188
03:40:56,224 --> 03:41:02,005
[SPEAKER_20]: could say a lot about what a frustrating situation it is for communities just to have to follow the ever-changing rates.

2189
03:41:03,226 --> 03:41:16,529
[SPEAKER_20]: But so that GIC increase is the 10% fiscal 25 to fiscal 26% change on the health, dental, and lifeline item, which is a dollar change of $2.7 million.

2190
03:41:16,569 --> 03:41:16,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2191
03:41:16,709 --> 03:41:16,929
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's

2192
03:41:22,215 --> 03:41:26,437
[SPEAKER_20]: probably one of the single largest line item increases that we see in the entire operating budget this year.

2193
03:41:26,777 --> 03:41:27,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it is.

2194
03:41:27,957 --> 03:41:35,660
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is just for continuation of existing service for municipal and that's just for to continue insurance services for city employees.

2195
03:41:36,720 --> 03:41:41,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, we, there's actually a detailed breakdown of

2196
03:41:42,943 --> 03:41:48,025
[SPEAKER_08]: what every employee right now, which insurance they're on, whether they're individual and family.

2197
03:41:48,105 --> 03:41:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also provisions made for new hires, open positions that we expect to fill.

2198
03:41:53,487 --> 03:42:01,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets very weedy because the GIC, there's, I think, six different health plans.

2199
03:42:01,651 --> 03:42:04,512
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also the health plans for the retirees.

2200
03:42:06,153 --> 03:42:10,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So we look at all that data, and that's the closest we can come up with with the new rates.

2201
03:42:12,225 --> 03:42:14,385
[SPEAKER_20]: So an estimate of all those factors together.

2202
03:42:14,425 --> 03:42:16,306
[SPEAKER_20]: And the best estimate is that it's about a 10%.

2203
03:42:16,406 --> 03:42:17,746
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

2204
03:42:17,886 --> 03:42:19,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having real trouble hearing you.

2205
03:42:19,266 --> 03:42:20,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just my ears.

2206
03:42:20,086 --> 03:42:20,486
[SPEAKER_08]: That's OK.

2207
03:42:20,526 --> 03:42:21,007
[SPEAKER_20]: It's mutual.

2208
03:42:24,387 --> 03:42:29,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Going through all those weedsy factors, the best estimate is that we can expect to see about a 10% increase.

2209
03:42:29,268 --> 03:42:29,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2210
03:42:29,488 --> 03:42:29,728
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

2211
03:42:30,028 --> 03:42:30,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2212
03:42:32,829 --> 03:42:33,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Tough.

2213
03:42:33,469 --> 03:42:35,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Zach is louder than you are, so.

2214
03:42:35,669 --> 03:42:36,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, believe me.

2215
03:42:36,669 --> 03:42:37,309
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

2216
03:42:39,530 --> 03:42:40,250
[SPEAKER_20]: I get told that a lot.

2217
03:42:41,925 --> 03:42:46,868
[SPEAKER_20]: I see other notable percentage increases.

2218
03:42:48,929 --> 03:42:56,593
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a large percentage increase, rather small dollar increase in relative terms, the increase to the unemployment light item.

2219
03:42:56,633 --> 03:43:01,455
[SPEAKER_20]: Could you just give us a quick explanation of the nature of that change?

2220
03:43:04,103 --> 03:43:09,987
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just looking at the past amounts that we've spent.

2221
03:43:11,048 --> 03:43:14,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just try to make sure that that is actually covered for the year.

2222
03:43:15,651 --> 03:43:15,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

2223
03:43:15,911 --> 03:43:19,354
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's just trying to right size for the unemployment line item.

2224
03:43:19,614 --> 03:43:21,816
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it's another $10,000.

2225
03:43:21,856 --> 03:43:28,840
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a big percentage increase, but cost-wise, it's not that much.

2226
03:43:29,661 --> 03:43:30,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Just right sizing the budget.

2227
03:43:31,602 --> 03:43:31,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Gotcha.

2228
03:43:32,283 --> 03:43:32,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2229
03:43:34,453 --> 03:43:37,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions from my fellow councilors on the insurance budget?

2230
03:43:41,495 --> 03:43:41,915
[SPEAKER_20]: Seeing none.

2231
03:43:43,715 --> 03:43:46,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Any questions from the public on the insurance budget?

2232
03:43:51,057 --> 03:43:51,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Just one question.

2233
03:43:51,837 --> 03:43:58,999
[SPEAKER_20]: I noticed that on our cover sheet for this meeting, it indicated that we would be reviewing the pensions budget.

2234
03:43:59,039 --> 03:43:59,939
[SPEAKER_20]: You said that was separate.

2235
03:43:59,959 --> 03:44:04,080
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we expect to see an overview of the pensions budget in a future budget hearing?

2236
03:44:08,440 --> 03:44:11,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that ordinarily we actually present that.

2237
03:44:11,362 --> 03:44:33,957
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a number that's come up by the, that's, the actuary for the retirement, the actuary for the retirement board gives projections of how much the city has to contribute to the pension fund to be fully funded.

2238
03:44:34,941 --> 03:44:40,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, legislation is in place that has to be fully funded by 2040.

2239
03:44:40,105 --> 03:44:44,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get this absolutely straight.

2240
03:44:45,230 --> 03:44:54,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is currently scheduled, the PARAC, which runs the pension systems, would like everything to be funded by 2035.

2241
03:44:57,080 --> 03:45:00,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is on schedule to fund everything by 2033.

2242
03:45:03,658 --> 03:45:08,903
[SPEAKER_08]: at which point the pension number is going to drop drastically.

2243
03:45:12,207 --> 03:45:17,853
[SPEAKER_08]: We have new projections because, obviously, the markets come down.

2244
03:45:17,933 --> 03:45:26,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means that the contribution has to go up to fully fund our retirement obligations.

2245
03:45:28,492 --> 03:45:33,335
[SPEAKER_08]: But that will be discussed at the next retirement board meeting, and that won't affect fiscal 2026.

2246
03:45:33,555 --> 03:45:36,096
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll affect fiscal 2027.

2247
03:45:37,337 --> 03:45:43,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working with the mayor and the chief of staff to come up with a recommendation for the retirement board.

2248
03:45:44,460 --> 03:45:51,164
[SPEAKER_08]: In any case, we are not talking about pushing out the timeline at all.

2249
03:45:51,844 --> 03:45:53,465
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty much off the table.

2250
03:45:54,806 --> 03:45:56,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have that fully funded by 2033.

2251
03:45:58,535 --> 03:46:05,419
[SPEAKER_08]: At which point we will probably start, if I'm still in this position, it's a few years off.

2252
03:46:06,279 --> 03:46:19,626
[SPEAKER_08]: But at that point, usually what cities and towns have been doing is using the extra funding to start funding other post-employee OPEB, other post-employee benefits.

2253
03:46:20,867 --> 03:46:25,970
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the plan, basically, with that for looking

2254
03:46:27,752 --> 03:46:28,913
[SPEAKER_08]: eight years into the future.

2255
03:46:30,394 --> 03:46:31,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

2256
03:46:31,274 --> 03:46:31,714
[SPEAKER_20]: That's helpful.

2257
03:46:32,555 --> 03:46:40,840
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, if it's not normative for us to review a separate pensions budget in the budget hearing process, which it sounds like it isn't, then we're not missing anything.

2258
03:46:40,860 --> 03:46:41,700
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to make sure.

2259
03:46:43,841 --> 03:46:44,062

2260
03:46:44,862 --> 03:46:51,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Any additional questions from councillors on the insurance budget or any other departmental budget that we heard about tonight?

03:46:52,587 --> 03:46:52,767
[SPEAKER_20]: No?

03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:54,748

03:46:55,828 --> 03:46:56,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Nina, any last thoughts?

2264
03:46:57,315 --> 03:47:00,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, sorry, didn't mean to say it like that.

2265
03:47:02,478 --> 03:47:04,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there a motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn?

2266
03:47:07,822 --> 03:47:09,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry, we need to, yes.

2267
03:47:16,407 --> 03:47:25,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to send the motions to regular meeting so we can vote with the full committee, because there's only four of us.

2279
03:48:11,187 --> 03:48:12,607
[SPEAKER_20]: I would withdraw that and I would.

[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2281
03:48:13,128 --> 03:48:14,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's take a vote on those two motions.
