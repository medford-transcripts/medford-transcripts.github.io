1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,032
Some people say that I'm a little too honest to be a politician.

2
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:07,795
But I've never understood why you wouldn't want to be clear about what you think and what you feel.

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,376
And it's one of the things that I love the most about the culture here.

4
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:15,778
People are really open about what they think and what they stand for.

5
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:18,200
My name's Anna Callahan.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,000
I live in Somerville.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,721
I've been here since 2003.

8
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:26,804
I live with my husband and my son and several absolutely wonderful housemates.

9
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:28,965
Because really, who could afford the rent here?

10
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:39,737
I was a software engineer until four years ago, when I realized that I just could not sit by any longer, and I became devoted to political activism.

11
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:52,961
I started an organization called The Incorruptibles, and through that I have spent the last few years training people in cities across the country to really build progressive electoral power from the ground up.

12
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,802
The Massachusetts Statehouse is not a very progressive body.

13
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:05,179
And the more you learn about it, the more it is obvious that it is a dysfunctional and deeply broken institution.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,042
It is very difficult to find out what is happening at the Statehouse.

15
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:11,624
And it's designed to keep voters in the dark.

16
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:14,407
I want to mobilize the people of Medford and Somerville.

17
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:20,371
I want to lift the veil off of the statehouse so that my neighbors can hold me and my fellow state reps accountable.

18
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:26,256
Our state rep has voted again and again to make sure that that doesn't happen, and it is wasting our time.

19
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:31,020
We are in a moment in history when big changes are going to happen.

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,183
We need a statehouse that is ready to make bold, progressive change.

21
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:37,204
This election is about good government.

22
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,207
This election is about whether our state rep's votes are secret.

23
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:47,549
This election is about whether we as constituents have enough time to organize around legislation before it's already been voted on.

24
00:01:48,269 --> 00:02:01,472
And fundamentally, this election is about the concentration of power in the hands of the speaker that prevents us from passing the no-brainer progressive policies that the people of Massachusetts want, need, and deserve.

25
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,152
We all have progressive values here.

26
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:06,413
We need progressive action.
