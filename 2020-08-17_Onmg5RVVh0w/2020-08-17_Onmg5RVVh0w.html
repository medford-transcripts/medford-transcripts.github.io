    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=0.291s">Some</a>  people say that I'm a little too honest to be a politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=3.293s">But</a>  I've never understood why you wouldn't want to be clear about what you think and what you feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=8.415s">And</a>  it's one of the things that I love the most about the culture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=11.657s">People</a>  are really open about what they think and what they stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=17.259s">My</a>  name's Anna Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=19.04s">I</a>  live in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=20.02s">I've</a>  been here since 2003. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=20.841s">I</a>  live with my husband and my son and several absolutely wonderful housemates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=27.544s">Because</a>  really, who could afford the rent here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=30.314s">I</a>  was a software engineer until four years ago, when I realized that I just could not sit by any longer, and I became devoted to political activism. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=40.417s">I</a>  started an organization called The Incorruptibles, and through that I have spent the last few years training people in cities across the country to really build progressive electoral power from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=54.261s">The</a>  Massachusetts Statehouse is not a very progressive body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=57.513s">And</a>  the more you learn about it, the more it is obvious that it is a dysfunctional and deeply broken institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=65.88s">It</a>  is very difficult to find out what is happening at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=69.843s">And</a>  it's designed to keep voters in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=72.225s">I</a>  want to mobilize the people of Medford and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=74.947s">I</a>  want to lift the veil off of the statehouse so that my neighbors can hold me and my fellow state reps accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=80.772s">Our</a>  state rep has voted again and again to make sure that that doesn't happen, and it is wasting our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=86.596s">We</a>  are in a moment in history when big changes are going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=91.52s">We</a>  need a statehouse that is ready to make bold, progressive change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=95.783s">This</a>  election is about good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=97.685s">This</a>  election is about whether our state rep's votes are secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=100.827s">This</a>  election is about whether we as constituents have enough time to organize around legislation before it's already been voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=108.269s">And</a>  fundamentally, this election is about the concentration of power in the hands of the speaker that prevents us from passing the no-brainer progressive policies that the people of Massachusetts want, need, and deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=122.332s">We</a>  all have progressive values here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Onmg5RVVh0w&t=124.853s">We</a>  need progressive action.</p>
