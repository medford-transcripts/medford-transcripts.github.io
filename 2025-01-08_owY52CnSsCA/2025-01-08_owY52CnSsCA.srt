1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:05,015
[SPEAKER_00]: This dish is sweet and sour with a real nice punch of flavour to it.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is that Ma?

3
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: That got to be crispy shredded chilli chicken.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know what that is, it's basically crispy shredded chilli beef except with chicken instead of beef.

5
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:21,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who have our second cookbook, the base recipe for this can be found on page 77.

6
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:27,916
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got an ordinary chicken breast here and we're just going to slice this up into strips.

7
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So mum is literally just going to cut it in half lengthways as if you were going to butterfly it.

8
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:36,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she's just going to

9
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:48,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially try and go across the grain, but it's not that much of an issue When you do it making like crispy stuff with the chicken because the chicken itself is actually quite tender.

10
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:54,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, carry on and You can see your mum's cutting them quite thick you can quite them as thin or as thick as you want and

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:22,245
[SPEAKER_00]: quite them you can cut them as thick and as thin as you want again don't worry too much about the grain when you're cutting stuff for chicken and in fact some places do in fact cut along the grain specifically with the grain sorry for chicken and crispy beef because it makes it chewy and as you can see here it's all just been cut into slices yep now we're making quite thick ones but you can you can then come across and make them thin I like to feel the chicken

12
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:24,819
[SPEAKER_01]: You should taste the chicken.

13
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not weird.

14
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Not feel the chicken.

15
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you eat it, you can actually taste it in your chicken.

16
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:31,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

17
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:32,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste it in your mouth.

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:33,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

19
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:34,569
[SPEAKER_01]: A bite of it.

20
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's normally what happens when you eat.

21
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,192
[SPEAKER_00]: You can normally taste it.

22
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when it's too thin, you can't taste it.

23
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,176
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough for the chicken.

24
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:41,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

25
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:43,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to batter this.

26
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:43,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

27
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:51,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're going to place about 8 tablespoons worth of potato starch into a baking tray.

28
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:55,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back in the day places would actually use potato starch along with custard powder.

29
00:01:56,005 --> 00:02:03,449
[SPEAKER_00]: The custard powder is just there for the colouring, a slight sweetness without using sugar so it doesn't burn when you deep fry it and for a slight eggy flavour.

30
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,931
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays most places are either just using potato starch, all potato starch and flour.

31
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we do

32
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:17,215
[SPEAKER_00]: all recipes differently with different variations whenever we make a video because not one takeaway does it the same.

33
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:29,281
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are like three major different types of dry sweet and sour batter for example and also we have never at any point said chicken balls or anything that are in a wet batter should have custard powder in.

34
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,882
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it just has the main flour mix.

35
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:35,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places will add a starch but it's not going to be a custard powder.

36
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,124
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll either be corn flour or potato starch.

37
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:39,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Not custard powder!

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add some salt.

39
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag MSG Massive!

40
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:44,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, always.

41
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forget.

42
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wearing the t-shirt today but I normally am.

43
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a touch of black pepper.

44
00:02:50,481 --> 00:03:00,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements are below if you want them, but if you want to support the channel a bit more, by all means head over to our recipe vault and you'll get the method as well as videos in advance and extra content.

45
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:01,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your support.

46
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,026
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to mix this up.

47
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:03,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if I said that.

48
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:04,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I say that?

49
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:05,767
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're mixing it up.

50
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:06,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're mixing it up.

51
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:10,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's obvious from me mixing it that I am mixing it, but you never know.

52
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we've got our chicken here.

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to place this into the starch mix.

54
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,156
[SPEAKER_01]: just spread it around for easy coating.

55
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:19,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

56
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:27,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we do this on a commercial scale, we just literally throw it all in one place and then move it around.

57
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:32,419
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys at home can take the time and effort to be a bit more, what's the word?

58
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Meticulous, so you don't have to worry about it too much.

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just want a light coating on here and what this does, the first coating I should say, is helps the final coating stick to the outside.

60
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:45,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your chicken has a nice coating on it, you're just going to shake it off a little bit.

61
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,983
[SPEAKER_00]: You can of course use a colander or a sieve here but that's just more washing up.

62
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not necessarily though.

63
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate washing up.

64
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:54,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

65
00:03:54,623 --> 00:04:01,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's more than one way to do these recipes and it's why we do multiple videos on the same recipe essentially.

66
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,445
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think you've seen a version before, chances are you haven't.

67
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

68
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,190
[SPEAKER_00]: That's alright.

69
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you hit me for?

70
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:07,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

71
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Mum just had to sneeze there, just telling me to stop talking.

72
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:15,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the mixture of those spices.

73
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pepper.

74
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:17,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pepper.

75
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:21,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So then... You're going to put an egg white in?

76
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just one egg white.

77
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:22,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

78
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:28,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you need to comment if you want to see how to use the egg yolk up.

79
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:33,479
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally, in a takeaway, we'd throw that into the big pot of eggs that we use for fried rice.

80
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:37,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the egg white is a slight alkaline, it will actually velvet the meat.

81
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,042
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will say, don't you velvet the meat for this?

82
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,223
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because that's what the job of the egg white is doing.

83
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:47,366
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, we are velveting it because velveting is a process of using a chemical to make meat tender.

84
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically we have velveted it by using the egg white.

85
00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:05,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people will use the egg yolk as well but the egg yolk is actually slightly acidic which cancels out the effect of the alkaline in the egg white.

86
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,617
[SPEAKER_00]: It still works but nowhere near as well.

87
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:30,160
[SPEAKER_00]: just a second coat now yeah so we're just going to place this back into the starch mix also using the egg white makes it difficult for the um the batter to go crisp really crispy because of the fat content of the egg yolk where's the egg white using the egg yolk yeah with it yeah whereas just using the egg white is pure protein so that just goes really crispy those of you who have washed washed us

88
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,459
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a weird thing to say.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who have watched us a lot will know that one of the really good techniques here is to make sure your hands are bone dry.

90
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:40,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine aren't right now.

91
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so make sure your hands are bone dry.

92
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:52,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit of the starch onto your fingers and then come under, under the chicken or the meat you're battering.

93
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,736
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sort of flip it over and what that does it just keeps your hands from becoming like batter clubs.

94
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:00,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your hands dry.

95
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:05,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah because if you don't do that your fingers will literally just keep the batter on.

96
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:05,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Gluey.

97
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:06,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

98
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Not say gluey, sticky.

99
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:11,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and sometimes it won't stick to the chicken because it will want to stick to your fingers.

100
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:16,410
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know what we're talking about, you can try it yourself.

101
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:26,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each and every piece you just give a small gentle squeeze when it's fully battered and that just helps keep the batter on the chicken and helps the texture when it's fried.

102
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,375
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture of the batter that is.

103
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:37,679

[SPEAKER_00]: And share if you can.

106
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:42,465
[SPEAKER_00]: always comment.

107
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:43,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

108
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:44,967
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to that is.

109
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all nicely coated.

110
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,109
[SPEAKER_00]: On to the cooking.

111
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our veg oil here and it's hot.

112
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,652
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to place our strips of chicken into it.

113
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it gently, okay?

114
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:56,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

115
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, I can't remember what I was going to say.

116
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Gently lay the chicken in the hot oil.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

118
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:09,542
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I was going to say.

119
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:17,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh we're not going to be double frying this today because we're essentially going to be trying to dehydrate this as much as possible in the fat.

120
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

121
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:23,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is crispy so we want less moisture or shredded I should say.

122
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,407
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shredded crispy.

123
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:49,744
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if we were doing this for let's say Hong Kong style sweet and sour batter we would most definitely double fry because you want to make sure the outside is crispy and the inside is moist whereas this we want the inside to be slightly crispy as well or crispier than usual I should say just shifting it around stop it stop the chicken touching the base and stops it sticking together yeah that one there looks like a mackerel

124
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:54,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like white bait.

125
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:55,936
[SPEAKER_00]: White bait, that's it.

126
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,476
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to constantly move this around, by the way.

127
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:03,758
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of like 10, 15 seconds at a time, and then let it sit for one or two minutes.

128
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:04,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ma?

129
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

130
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Daydreaming must be the coldness.

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,600
[SPEAKER_00]: What making you daydream?

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

133
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:16,182
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I was just looking at how the pieces of chicken strip cooking.

134
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,063
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?

135
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Mesmerise it.

136
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just watching the bubbles?

137
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:20,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

138
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a song for bubbles?

139
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,790
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Not today.

141
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:26,191
[SPEAKER_00]: No?

142
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see bubbles I always think of Willy Wonka.

143
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the Chocolate Factory?

144
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:32,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

145
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:32,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

146
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll see.

147
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that song?

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,061
[SPEAKER_01]: World of pure imagination.

149
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,341
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever seen Willy Wonka?

150
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it before, I can't really remember the story of it.

151
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:45,984
[SPEAKER_01]: It was they went into that factory, wasn't it?

152
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:46,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

153
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:47,684
[SPEAKER_01]: By accident or what?

154
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,085
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they won prizes to go.

155
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,627
[SPEAKER_00]: But each kid was in an accident because they kept doing stuff they shouldn't be doing.

156
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so it turned out to be a nightmare then?

157
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, essentially, yeah.

158
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,464
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jean Wilder got really angry at everyone.

159
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:13,114
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice here that the chicken is not browning, and it won't when you just use starch, which is another reason why they put flour in it, because it does brown it off a little bit, and also the custard powder.

160
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:13,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

161
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:14,735
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not needed.

162
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:20,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I know someone's going to ask why we haven't chosen to use the flour, and that's essentially because of what, Ma?

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,761
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get burned too quickly.

164
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Get brown, not burn, not burn.

165
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:25,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it will burn.

166
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:36,072
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use the wheat in this mix, wheat flour in the mix, it will essentially go bitter on the outside before the chicken is cooked completely.

167
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:44,159
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue when, like I say, you're doing Hong Kong style with a two frying thing, but when you're having it for long periods of time in really hot fat,

168
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:57,488
[SPEAKER_00]: it will burn and we just haven't used the custard powder today because most places aren't using that anymore and in the cookbook where we do this recipe we haven't used it in that so we thought we'd stay true to the recipe in the cookbook.

169
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:24,884
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and also give it okay so this is nice and crispy now we're just going to set this aside on some kitchen roll and then we're going to make the sauce so we're going to add some veg oil to a pan here this is just one way we like to brown off the veg before we make the sauce whereas other takeaways we'll make the sauce and then almost poach the veg if you go to your takeaway and you're used to your veg almost having a raw taste chances are literally dumping it the veg in at the end and just heating it through you do what you like

170
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:25,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

171
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one is better than the other, just different versions.

172
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:33,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so when the oil is hot, we're going to throw in really finely sliced onions and rehydrated garlic granules.

173
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:39,215
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we did was pour some hot water on these, let them sit for 20 minutes and then drain them.

174
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,457
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add, what's that?

175
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:42,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt.

176
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:43,218
[SPEAKER_01]: MSG.

177
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:43,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

178
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,261
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to brown off the MSG.

179
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:49,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.

180
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:51,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

181
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to add some ketchup.

182
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,627
[SPEAKER_01]: White vinegar.

183
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can use rice wine vinegar if you have it.

184
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:00,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange squash.

185
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:08,254
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of takeaways aren't actually using the orange squash anymore but I think it gives it a nice citrus hit in the background so we're going to use it today.

186
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:08,914
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need much.

187
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,715
[SPEAKER_00]: A fair amount of sugar.

188
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:16,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Chinese takeaway food is fast food designed to taste delicious and be made fast.

189
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while is fine because I know someone's going to go look at all that sugar.

190
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine once in a while, you're not eating this every day.

191
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaspoon of hoisin.

192
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:34,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Good quality hoisin that comes from tins, not jars, because jars, even though it's the same brand, actually taste different and the ingredients are different on the back, you can just see.

193
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of drops of what, Ma?

194
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,653
[SPEAKER_01]: A dash of dark soy.

195
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,814
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not too much.

196
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give it a bit of colour.

197
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, literally.

198
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the book we do add carrots, but we're not doing that today.

199
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:46,318
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add pretty much whatever veg you want, if I'm honest.

200
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilli flakes.

201
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:47,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

202
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some just chillies here.

203
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, to make this bright red, you're going to need to use food colouring.

204
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,863
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to use it, obviously.

205
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,486
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it bright red, then use red food colouring.

206
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,617
[SPEAKER_00]: see the difference it makes.

207
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:06,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Bright red.

208
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:07,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

209
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:11,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to bring this to the boil, reduce it down by a third and then thicken it up with potato starch slurry.

210
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:16,081
[SPEAKER_00]: When you thicken it with potato starch slurry, little at a time and stir as you pour in.

211
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,723
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't stir as you pour in, you'll make clumps and if you put too much, you'll just make glue.

212
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:26,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So we add small amounts at a time rather than loads at once because you can add, you can't take away.

213
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:29,607
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's at a nice thickness, going to bring your chicken back in.

214
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:29,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

215
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to coat this.

216
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:36,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially done.

217
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:42,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to be serving this on a bed of steamed rice because it really opens up the flavour for us.

218
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,989
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can use whatever you want.

219
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So fried rice, noodles, whatever.

220
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:46,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

221
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.

222
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:52,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously, you don't need to put this much chilli into it if you don't want to.

223
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,153
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely up to you.

224
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:57,935
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need chilli in this if you can't even handle any spice.

225
00:12:58,635 --> 00:12:59,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on it, Ma.

226
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we like it.

227
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:03,454
[SPEAKER_01]: A small one.

228
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:14,961
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavour is coming through and the batter on the chicken is... Spot on, isn't it?

229
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:15,201
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

230
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:26,569
[SPEAKER_00]: We did garnish this with some chilli flakes and some fresh chillies, but again, that's just personal preference and the fresh ones were essentially just for the camera, for the thumbnail.

231
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,991
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones you cook in the sauce are really nice and like candied.

232
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:30,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

233
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:33,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken is really good.

234
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the whole thing is lovely.

235
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:38,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give it a go.

236
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:45,226
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never tried it before, it's like a deeper, more aromatic Hong Kong style with chili in.

237
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:47,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Hong Kong style sweet and sour sauce, sorry with chili in.

238
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:50,790
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoisin sauce really does give it another level of flavour.

239
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

240
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:52,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it?

241
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:55,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost an earthiness, which works really well.

242
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:56,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you'd like to add to that?

243
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the sauce with the rice.

244
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a small bit.

245
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,630
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I can say is yummy.

246
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the garnish of the fresh chili as well.

247
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it gives it a nice sort of freshness.

248
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

249
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cooked one as well.

250
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different flavor.

251
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

252
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:19,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture as well.

253
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I think this goes best with steamed rice.

254
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

255
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,401
[SPEAKER_00]: The second you have it with the steamed rice, the flavors open up even more.

256
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,303
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have egg fried rice, it can dull the flavor a little bit.

257
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:37,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you will argue about this, but a lot of you have actually listened to us and tried it.

258
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:42,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And we often get people going, yeah, you're right, steamed rice is actually better to open up the flavours.

259
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go for steamed rice.

260
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:44,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

261
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,736
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my preference.

262
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was unaware of that one.

263
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:52,403
[SPEAKER_00]: But most Chinese people are going to be eating steamed rice, not fried rice, for their main dish.

264
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's amazing this is.

265
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to share and thank you for sharing.

281
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:42,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye!
