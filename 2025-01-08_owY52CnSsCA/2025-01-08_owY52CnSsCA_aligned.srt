1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:05,015
This dish is sweet and sour with a real nice punch of flavour to it.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,376
And what is that Ma?

3
00:00:06,556 --> 00:00:10,959
That got to be crispy shredded chilli chicken.

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,163
And if you don't know what that is, it's basically crispy shredded chilli beef except with chicken instead of beef.

5
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:21,126
And for those of you who have our second cookbook, the base recipe for this can be found on page 77.

6
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:27,916
So we've got an ordinary chicken breast here and we're just going to slice this up into strips.

7
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,644
So mum is literally just going to cut it in half lengthways as if you were going to butterfly it.

8
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:36,930
And then she's just going to

9
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:48,197
Essentially try and go across the grain, but it's not that much of an issue When you do it making like crispy stuff with the chicken because the chicken itself is actually quite tender.

10
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:54,980
Yeah, carry on and You can see your mum's cutting them quite thick you can quite them as thin or as thick as you want and

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:22,245
quite them you can cut them as thick and as thin as you want again don't worry too much about the grain when you're cutting stuff for chicken and in fact some places do in fact cut along the grain specifically with the grain sorry for chicken and crispy beef because it makes it chewy and as you can see here it's all just been cut into slices yep now we're making quite thick ones but you can you can then come across and make them thin I like to feel the chicken

12
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:24,819
You should taste the chicken.

13
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,500
Yeah, that's not weird.

14
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,582
Not feel the chicken.

15
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,206
I mean, when you eat it, you can actually taste it in your chicken.

16
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:31,526
Yeah.

17
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:32,828
Taste it in your mouth.

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:33,248
Yeah.

19
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:34,569
A bite of it.

20
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,131
I mean, that's normally what happens when you eat.

21
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,192
You can normally taste it.

22
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:40,055
Yeah, when it's too thin, you can't taste it.

23
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,176
There's not enough for the chicken.

24
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:41,897
Yeah, I know what you mean.

25
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:43,338
So now we're going to batter this.

26
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:43,839
Yeah.

27
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:51,002
So then we're going to place about 8 tablespoons worth of potato starch into a baking tray.

28
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:55,865
Now back in the day places would actually use potato starch along with custard powder.

29
00:01:56,005 --> 00:02:03,449
The custard powder is just there for the colouring, a slight sweetness without using sugar so it doesn't burn when you deep fry it and for a slight eggy flavour.

30
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,931
But nowadays most places are either just using potato starch, all potato starch and flour.

31
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,632
Remember we do

32
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:17,215
all recipes differently with different variations whenever we make a video because not one takeaway does it the same.

33
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:29,281
So there are like three major different types of dry sweet and sour batter for example and also we have never at any point said chicken balls or anything that are in a wet batter should have custard powder in.

34
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,882
It doesn't, it just has the main flour mix.

35
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:35,543
Some places will add a starch but it's not going to be a custard powder.

36
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,124
It'll either be corn flour or potato starch.

37
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:39,724
Not custard powder!

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,585
I'm going to add some salt.

39
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,105
Hashtag MSG Massive!

40
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:44,986
Yeah, always.

41
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,126
Never forget.

42
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,986
I'm not wearing the t-shirt today but I normally am.

43
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,567
And just a touch of black pepper.

44
00:02:50,481 --> 00:03:00,825
Measurements are below if you want them, but if you want to support the channel a bit more, by all means head over to our recipe vault and you'll get the method as well as videos in advance and extra content.

45
00:03:00,985 --> 00:03:01,986
Thank you for your support.

46
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,026
We're just going to mix this up.

47
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:03,846
I can't remember if I said that.

48
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:04,307
Did I say that?

49
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:05,767
No, you're mixing it up.

50
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:06,487
So we're mixing it up.

51
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:10,489
I think it's obvious from me mixing it that I am mixing it, but you never know.

52
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,590
Okay, so we've got our chicken here.

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,171
We're just going to place this into the starch mix.

54
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,156
just spread it around for easy coating.

55
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:19,676
Yeah.

56
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:27,518
I mean, when we do this on a commercial scale, we just literally throw it all in one place and then move it around.

57
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:32,419
But you guys at home can take the time and effort to be a bit more, what's the word?

58
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,360
Meticulous, so you don't have to worry about it too much.

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,381
So you just want a light coating on here and what this does, the first coating I should say, is helps the final coating stick to the outside.

60
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:45,242
So when your chicken has a nice coating on it, you're just going to shake it off a little bit.

61
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,983
You can of course use a colander or a sieve here but that's just more washing up.

62
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:52,283
Yeah, not necessarily though.

63
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,383
And I hate washing up.

64
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:54,383
Me too.

65
00:03:54,623 --> 00:04:01,064
Like I said, there's more than one way to do these recipes and it's why we do multiple videos on the same recipe essentially.

66
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:03,445
So if you think you've seen a version before, chances are you haven't.

67
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,570
Sorry.

68
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,190
That's alright.

69
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,911
Is that what you hit me for?

70
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:07,271
Yeah.

71
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:09,872
Mum just had to sneeze there, just telling me to stop talking.

72
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:15,134
I think it's the mixture of those spices.

73
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,294
Yeah, pepper.

74
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:17,175
Yeah, pepper.

75
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:21,156
So then... You're going to put an egg white in?

76
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,397
Yeah, just one egg white.

77
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:22,777
Yeah.

78
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:28,396
Again, you need to comment if you want to see how to use the egg yolk up.

79
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:33,479
But normally, in a takeaway, we'd throw that into the big pot of eggs that we use for fried rice.

80
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:37,281
And because the egg white is a slight alkaline, it will actually velvet the meat.

81
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,042
So people will say, don't you velvet the meat for this?

82
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,223
No, because that's what the job of the egg white is doing.

83
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:47,366
But yes, we are velveting it because velveting is a process of using a chemical to make meat tender.

84
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,849
So technically we have velveted it by using the egg white.

85
00:04:53,569 --> 00:05:05,276
Lots of people will use the egg yolk as well but the egg yolk is actually slightly acidic which cancels out the effect of the alkaline in the egg white.

86
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,617
It still works but nowhere near as well.

87
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:30,160
just a second coat now yeah so we're just going to place this back into the starch mix also using the egg white makes it difficult for the um the batter to go crisp really crispy because of the fat content of the egg yolk where's the egg white using the egg yolk yeah with it yeah whereas just using the egg white is pure protein so that just goes really crispy those of you who have washed washed us

88
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,459
That's a weird thing to say.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,043
Those of you who have watched us a lot will know that one of the really good techniques here is to make sure your hands are bone dry.

90
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:40,924
Mine aren't right now.

91
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,585
Okay, so make sure your hands are bone dry.

92
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:52,649
Put a little bit of the starch onto your fingers and then come under, under the chicken or the meat you're battering.

93
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,736
and then sort of flip it over and what that does it just keeps your hands from becoming like batter clubs.

94
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:00,476
Keep your hands dry.

95
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:05,362
Yeah because if you don't do that your fingers will literally just keep the batter on.

96
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:05,982
Gluey.

97
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:06,603
Yeah.

98
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,844
Not say gluey, sticky.

99
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:11,188
Yeah and sometimes it won't stick to the chicken because it will want to stick to your fingers.

100
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:16,410
If you want to know what we're talking about, you can try it yourself.

101
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:26,814
And then each and every piece you just give a small gentle squeeze when it's fully battered and that just helps keep the batter on the chicken and helps the texture when it's fried.

102
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,375
The texture of the batter that is.

106
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:42,465
always comment.

107
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:43,706
Thank you.

108
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:44,967
If you want to that is.

109
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:46,888
So that's all nicely coated.

110
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,109
On to the cooking.

111
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,590
So we've got our veg oil here and it's hot.

112
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,652
We're just going to place our strips of chicken into it.

113
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,153
Do it gently, okay?

114
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:56,453
Yeah.

115
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,817
Now, um, I can't remember what I was going to say.

116
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,840
Gently lay the chicken in the hot oil.

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah.

118
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:09,542
That's not what I was going to say.

119
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:17,305
Oh we're not going to be double frying this today because we're essentially going to be trying to dehydrate this as much as possible in the fat.

120
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,065
Yeah.

121
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:23,106
Because it is crispy so we want less moisture or shredded I should say.

122
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,407
It's shredded crispy.

123
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:49,744
whereas if we were doing this for let's say Hong Kong style sweet and sour batter we would most definitely double fry because you want to make sure the outside is crispy and the inside is moist whereas this we want the inside to be slightly crispy as well or crispier than usual I should say just shifting it around stop it stop the chicken touching the base and stops it sticking together yeah that one there looks like a mackerel

124
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:54,915
It looks like white bait.

125
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:55,936
White bait, that's it.

126
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,476
You don't have to constantly move this around, by the way.

127
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:03,758
It's just sort of like 10, 15 seconds at a time, and then let it sit for one or two minutes.

128
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:04,458
Yeah, Ma?

129
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:06,819
Yeah.

130
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,520
Daydreaming must be the coldness.

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,600
What making you daydream?

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,060
Yeah.

133
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:16,182
At first, I was just looking at how the pieces of chicken strip cooking.

134
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:18,063
What do you mean?

135
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:18,824
Mesmerise it.

136
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,065
Oh, just watching the bubbles?

137
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:20,766
Yes.

138
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,027
Do you have a song for bubbles?

139
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,790
No, no.

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,690
Not today.

141
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:26,191
No?

142
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,314
When I see bubbles I always think of Willy Wonka.

143
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,976
Oh yeah, the Chocolate Factory?

144
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:32,297
Yeah.

145
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:32,817
Wow.

146
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:34,659
Then you'll see.

147
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,680
Do you know that song?

148
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,061
World of pure imagination.

149
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,341
You ever seen Willy Wonka?

150
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,283
I've seen it before, I can't really remember the story of it.

151
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:45,984
It was they went into that factory, wasn't it?

152
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:46,304
Yeah.

153
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:47,684
By accident or what?

154
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,085
No, they won prizes to go.

155
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,627
But each kid was in an accident because they kept doing stuff they shouldn't be doing.

156
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:56,540
Oh, so it turned out to be a nightmare then?

157
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,182
Yeah, essentially, yeah.

158
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,464
And Jean Wilder got really angry at everyone.

159
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:13,114
You'll notice here that the chicken is not browning, and it won't when you just use starch, which is another reason why they put flour in it, because it does brown it off a little bit, and also the custard powder.

160
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:13,915
Yeah.

161
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:14,735
But it's not needed.

162
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:20,060
I know someone's going to ask why we haven't chosen to use the flour, and that's essentially because of what, Ma?

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,761
It doesn't get burned too quickly.

164
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,263
Get brown, not burn, not burn.

165
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:25,504
Well, it will burn.

166
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:36,072
So if you use the wheat in this mix, wheat flour in the mix, it will essentially go bitter on the outside before the chicken is cooked completely.

167
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:44,159
It's not an issue when, like I say, you're doing Hong Kong style with a two frying thing, but when you're having it for long periods of time in really hot fat,

168
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:57,488
it will burn and we just haven't used the custard powder today because most places aren't using that anymore and in the cookbook where we do this recipe we haven't used it in that so we thought we'd stay true to the recipe in the cookbook.

169
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:24,884
yeah and also give it okay so this is nice and crispy now we're just going to set this aside on some kitchen roll and then we're going to make the sauce so we're going to add some veg oil to a pan here this is just one way we like to brown off the veg before we make the sauce whereas other takeaways we'll make the sauce and then almost poach the veg if you go to your takeaway and you're used to your veg almost having a raw taste chances are literally dumping it the veg in at the end and just heating it through you do what you like

170
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:25,745
Yeah, exactly.

171
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,026
Not one is better than the other, just different versions.

172
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:33,871
Right, so when the oil is hot, we're going to throw in really finely sliced onions and rehydrated garlic granules.

173
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:39,215
So all we did was pour some hot water on these, let them sit for 20 minutes and then drain them.

174
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,457
We're going to add, what's that?

175
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:42,297
Salt.

176
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:43,218
MSG.

177
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:43,699
Yeah.

178
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,261
We're going to brown off the MSG.

179
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:49,603
Water.

180
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:51,945
Not much.

181
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,287
Then we're going to add some ketchup.

182
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,627
White vinegar.

183
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,229
Yeah, you can use rice wine vinegar if you have it.

184
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:00,850
Orange squash.

185
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:08,254
A lot of takeaways aren't actually using the orange squash anymore but I think it gives it a nice citrus hit in the background so we're going to use it today.

186
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:08,914
You don't need much.

187
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:10,715
A fair amount of sugar.

188
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:16,358
Remember Chinese takeaway food is fast food designed to taste delicious and be made fast.

189
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:19,900
Once in a while is fine because I know someone's going to go look at all that sugar.

190
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,121
It's fine once in a while, you're not eating this every day.

191
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,626
Teaspoon of hoisin.

192
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:34,651
Good quality hoisin that comes from tins, not jars, because jars, even though it's the same brand, actually taste different and the ingredients are different on the back, you can just see.

193
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,492
Just a couple of drops of what, Ma?

194
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,653
A dash of dark soy.

195
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:38,814
Yeah, not too much.

196
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,595
Just to give it a bit of colour.

197
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:41,335
Yeah, literally.

198
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,836
Now in the book we do add carrots, but we're not doing that today.

199
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:46,318
You can add pretty much whatever veg you want, if I'm honest.

200
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,158
Chilli flakes.

201
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:47,739
Yep.

202
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,860
And we've got some just chillies here.

203
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,880
Right, to make this bright red, you're going to need to use food colouring.

204
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,863
But you don't have to use it, obviously.

205
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:01,486
If you want it bright red, then use red food colouring.

206
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,617
see the difference it makes.

207
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:06,497
Bright red.

208
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:07,017
Yep.

209
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:11,879
And we're just going to bring this to the boil, reduce it down by a third and then thicken it up with potato starch slurry.

210
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:16,081
When you thicken it with potato starch slurry, little at a time and stir as you pour in.

211
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,723
If you don't stir as you pour in, you'll make clumps and if you put too much, you'll just make glue.

212
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:26,686
So we add small amounts at a time rather than loads at once because you can add, you can't take away.

213
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:29,607
When it's at a nice thickness, going to bring your chicken back in.

214
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:29,887
Yep.

215
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,004
I'm just going to coat this.

216
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:36,886
So that's essentially done.

217
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:42,328
So we're just going to be serving this on a bed of steamed rice because it really opens up the flavour for us.

218
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,989
But you can use whatever you want.

219
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,430
So fried rice, noodles, whatever.

220
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:46,830
Yeah.

221
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,631
So here we go.

222
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:52,552
Now, obviously, you don't need to put this much chilli into it if you don't want to.

223
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,153
It's completely up to you.

224
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:57,935
You don't even need chilli in this if you can't even handle any spice.

225
00:12:58,635 --> 00:12:59,315
Let's get on it, Ma.

226
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,516
Yeah, we like it.

227
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:03,454
A small one.

228
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:14,961
The flavour is coming through and the batter on the chicken is... Spot on, isn't it?

229
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:15,201
Yes.

230
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:26,569
We did garnish this with some chilli flakes and some fresh chillies, but again, that's just personal preference and the fresh ones were essentially just for the camera, for the thumbnail.

231
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,991
But the ones you cook in the sauce are really nice and like candied.

232
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:30,451
Yeah.

233
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:33,919
Chicken is really good.

234
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,141
Yes, the whole thing is lovely.

235
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:38,642
Please give it a go.

236
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:45,226
If you've never tried it before, it's like a deeper, more aromatic Hong Kong style with chili in.

237
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:47,608
Hong Kong style sweet and sour sauce, sorry with chili in.

238
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:50,790
The hoisin sauce really does give it another level of flavour.

239
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,331
Yes.

240
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:52,171
Doesn't it?

241
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:55,634
Almost an earthiness, which works really well.

242
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:56,995
Anything else you'd like to add to that?

243
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,836
Actually the sauce with the rice.

244
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,317
Get a small bit.

245
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,630
It's all I can say is yummy.

246
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,354
I do like the garnish of the fresh chili as well.

247
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,315
Yeah, it gives it a nice sort of freshness.

248
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,155
Yeah, that's right.

249
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,336
And the cooked one as well.

250
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,637
It's just a different flavor.

251
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,977
Yeah.

252
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:19,998
Texture as well.

253
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,119
Personally, I think this goes best with steamed rice.

254
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,320
Yeah.

255
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,401
The second you have it with the steamed rice, the flavors open up even more.

256
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,303
If you have egg fried rice, it can dull the flavor a little bit.

257
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:37,345
I know a lot of you will argue about this, but a lot of you have actually listened to us and tried it.

258
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:42,130
And we often get people going, yeah, you're right, steamed rice is actually better to open up the flavours.

259
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,193
I always go for steamed rice.

260
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:44,453
Yeah.

261
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,736
That's my preference.

262
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,338
Oh, I was unaware of that one.

263
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:52,403
But most Chinese people are going to be eating steamed rice, not fried rice, for their main dish.

264
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,377
Yeah, that's amazing this is.

265
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,858
